Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nAppeal\u2014Dismissed by Judge in chambers\u2014Motion to rescind order\u2014Special circumstances.\nA party seeking an appeal obtained an extension of time for filing his case but failed to take advantage of the indulgence so granted, whereupon, on the application of the respondent, the appeal was dismissed by the judge in chambers. On motion to rescind the order dismissing the appeal:\nHeld, Strong and Gwynne JJ, dissenting, that under the circumstances of the case the court would not interfere by rescinding the judge\u2019s order and restoring the appeal.\nMOTION to rescind an order made by Mr. Justice Taschereau, in chambers, dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal.\nThe facts presented to the court on the motion were: That judgment in the case was delivered in the Supreme Court of Manitoba on December 1st, A. D. 1886. That notice of appeal was duly given and the time for perfecting the security was extended to January 15th, 1887, and security was perfected on January 14th. That on March 15th an order was made by Mr. Justice Strong in chambers, extending the time for filing the case to April 8th. The case was not filed within the time allowed, and on April 25th, on application to Mr. Justice Taschereau in chambers, an order was made dismissing the appeal. The present motion was made to rescind the order of Mr. Justice Taschereau and have the appeal restored. The only ground upon which the motion was F founded, and the delay in prosecuting the appeal accounted for, was, as appeared by the affidavits read, that from the length of the case and the pressure of work in the printing office it could not have been printed earlier, and the appellants offered to go to hearing during the then present sitting of the court.\nMcCarthy Q. C, in support of the motion, asked leave to read affidavits not before the judge in chambers, citing Chit. Arch. Q. B. Prac. ([1]), which the court granted. The learned counsel then read the affidavits excusing the delay, and contended that the motion should be granted as the plaintiff would not be prejudiced if the case was argued at the present sitting. The appeal could, under no circumstances, have been brought on before, and if there was any improper delay the infliction of costs would be sufficient punishment.\nGormully, contra, claimed that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion. The matter can be dealt with by a judge in chambers, and there is no appeal from his decision. Citing Rev. Stats. Can. Ch. 135, sec. 53. Kilkenny v. Fielding (2).\nMcCarthy Q. C. in reply referred to Regina v. Mayor & c, of Maidenhead (3).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This is a case in which the proceedings were entirely regular. The appellants obtained an extension of time in the court below to enable them to perfect their security, which was accomplished on the 14th of January. This gave them until the 14th of February to file their case which they did not do, but on the 15th of March they obtained, by an order of a judge of this court, a further extension of time until the 8th of April to enable them to file their case. Of this indulgence the appellants neglected to avail themselves, and also neglected to apply for any further extension of time. In fact they took no steps whatever in the case with a view to the prosecution of their appeal.\nThe respondent, being entirely regular, was entitled, under the statute and rules of the court, to have the appeal dismissed, and applied to Mr. Justice Taschereau for an order dismissing the appeal. When this application came on for hearing, and not until then, the appellants simply asked that further time be granted, but were not, even then, in a position to have the case inscribed, or to file their factum, neither being ready. This was only seven days before the sitting of the court, in this present month of May, and not in time to comply with the rules of the court to bring the case on for hearing in the ensuing sittings.\nThe learned judge, in the exercise of his discretion, refused to grant any further time, but granted the order of dismissal asked for. There was no illegality, irregularity, or impropriety whatever in what the the learned judge did.\nI do not think the appellants have shown any sufficient excuse for having neglected to avail themselves of the indulgence granted to them, nor any reason for having neglected to apply within the proper time for an extension of time had they desired it. The appeal having been thus regularly dismissed, in accordance with the statute and rules of the court, and the respondent being legally entitled to the benefit of his judgment, and no miscarriage having been shown, the learned judge not having gone wrong in law, and there having been no mistake of facts shown, nor anything in the circumstances of the case that would justify this court in saying that there had not been a reasonable exercise of discretion which should not be lightly interfered with I can discover no grounds for rescinding an order thus legally and regularly made.\nThe rights of parties in judgments pronounced in their favor are very clearly set forth in three cases to which I shall call attention. The first I shall read at length, as it has likewise a bearing on the cases of O Sullivan v. Harty ([2]) and Walmsley v. Griffith ([3]) lately decided by this court, as to which there appears to have been considerable misunderstanding in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nIn International Financial Society v. City of Moscow Gas Company, ([4]) James L. J. says:\n\u201cNo other appeal\u201d\u2014that is, an appeal from a judgment or order, from a judgment, technically so called, or an order other than an interlocutory order.\u2014\u201cNo other appeal shall, except by such leave, be brought after the expiration of one year\u201d that is a positive direction. Then, of course, the year would be calculated from the time at which the judgment is supposed to take effect ; and by the order and by some of the former rules the judgment takes effect from the time when it was actually pronounced. That would be the natural construction if it stopped there. But there is a further provision made as to calculating time. The said respective periods shall be calculated from the time at which the judgment or order is signed, entered, or otherwise perfected (I am paraphrasing it) except in the case of the refusal of an application, and in that case the said respective periods shall be calculated from the date of such refusal. It appears to me impossible to say that it is not the plain grammatical construction of these words. That is to say, where it is necessary for any purpose, in order to enable a man to see what he is appealing from, that the judgment or order should be perfected, so that he may see exactly what is the final form which it takes, and by which he may be aggrieved, then he has a twelvemonth from that time to consider his appeal ; but where the application for final judgment or order is simply refused, although refused with costs, he knows exactly the fate of his application, and then he has a twelve, month from the time at which he knows that the order with which he is dissatisfied has been made. It appears to me that that is the meaning of the words) and is exactly within the object for which the rule is framed. You take it from the time of refusal\u2014that is all the appellant wants to know\u2014you take it from the time when the order is perfected when there may be reasonable ground for his saying, I want to see the shape in which the final order is made. In this case there was an application made to the court\u2014as every bill used to be drawn\u2014praying that a certain deed might be set aside, or a certain relief granted, and that application was refused.\nThesiger L. J.:\nAnd lastly, it being admitted that there are some final judgments and orders which do come within the words \u201c in case of the refusal of the application,\u201d for that has been practically admitted, it seems to me to reasonably follow that all judgments or orders, whether final or interlocutory, should be included in those words, and consequently an appeal against the refusal of an application of whatever sort should date from the time when the decision is given, and not from the time when an entry of that decision is made, and the same case on application to enlarge the time for appealing.\nAnd in the same case, on application to enlarge the time for appealing, James L. J. said:\nI am of opinion that we cannot give any time. The respondents here say they are within the rule, and they have a right (and I think it is as valuable a right as anything which a subject has in this country) to know when they can rely upon the decree or order in their favour. The limitation of the time to appeal is a right given to the person in whose favor a judge has decided. I think we ought not to enlarge that time unless under some very special circumstance indeed, that is to say, if there had been any misleading through any conduct of the other side, as was mentioned in the analagous case of vacating inrolment which came before Lord Cottenham, and afterwards before Lord Chelmsford, in which it Was laid down that the right of the suitor was ex debito justitice to keep his inrolment of the decree if it was made in due time, unless in very special cases. See Wardle v. Carter ([5]); Wildman v. Lade ([6]). For instance, where there was anything like misleading on the part of the other side, or where some mistake had been made in the office itself, and a party was misled by an officer of the court, or again where some sudden accident which could not have been foreseen\u2014some sudden death, or something of that kind, which accounted for the delay; in such cases leave might be given. But simply where a man says, \u201cI looked at the order, and I bond fide came to the conclusion that I had up to a particular day, and I determined to take the last day I could,\u201d then he has taken upon himself to calculate the last day, and if he has made a mistake in calculating the last day he must abide by the consequences of that mistake. Beyond all question, in this case there was abundance of time to have brought the appeal if it was intended really and bond fide to appeal from the order as pronounced.\nBaggallay L. J.:\nI am of the same opinion. This court has before expressed an opinion that the mere fact of a misunderstanding by the parties concerned of the provisions of the rules is not such a special circumstance as to induce the court to give that special leave which is required to extend the time.\nIn Craig v. Phillips (1), Jessel M. R. said:\nThis is an an application for leave to appeal from a final order or judgment of Vice Chancellor Bacon pronounced on the fourth of April, 1876, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill with costs. Nothing then remained to be done ; it was a final judgment entirely disposing of the suit. No fund remained in court ; there were no accounts to be taken; the whole litigation was at an end. If the plaintiff meant to appeal, his appeal ought to have been brought within a year, but it was not so brought. Thereupon, subject to the judicial discretion of the Court of Appeal to enlarge the time for appealing, the right of the defendant, under the judgment of the Vice Chancellor, was complete.\nThesiger L. J.:\nI am of the same opinion. I think that this court ought not lightly to interfere with the time fixed for bringing appeals, and ought to require very special circumstances to be shown before exercising its judicial discretion to enlarge the time.\nIn Ex parte Hinton, In re Hinton, marginal note (2):\nNotice of an appeal must be given within twenty-one days from the day on which the order appealed from was pronounced, not from the day on which it was drawn up.\nSir James Bacon C.J.:\nI have heard all that could be said on this subject, because of the reluctance that one must naturally feel to give effect to a purely technical objection. But the law of the court is very clearly expressed in the rule, and in the decisions which have been referred to. The reason of the policy of the law in this respect is very obvious. It was in the appellant\u2019s power to have got the order drawn up on the 3rd of November, or, at any rate, within the period of twenty one days after. The words of rule 143 are clear. The order must be considered as made upon the day on which it was pronounced. Indeed, on the face of the order it is stated that the application was heard and disposed of on the 3rd November. I am precluded from hearing this appeal, and it must be dismissed. But I shall give no costs, for the appellant has been misled by the act of the Registrar.\nUnder these authorities, and under the peculiar circumstances of the case, I do not think we ought to reverse the decision of the judge in chambers to whom the legislature has given express power to deal with the matter. I think no sufficient circumstances have been shown of such an extraordinary character as would warrant us in doing so, in face of the manifest neglect, and setting at defiance, of the rules of the court by the appellant. If we were to set aside this order I know of no case in which a party, after being guilty of the grossest violation of the rules of, the court, could not, with such a precedent, insist on having any regular order rescinded.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I think the indulgence sought by the appellant was one which might not unreasonably have been granted. The respondent would have been subjected to no delay. The appeal would have been heard as early as if all the steps had been taken with the utmost promptitude.\nThe English cases decided upon applications to enlarge the time for appealing to the Court of Appeal do not, in my opinion, apply to appeals to this court. The only preliminary proceeding which appeals to the English Court of Appeal require is a notice of motion; the proceedings are already printed and no security is given the appeal being, in fact, a mere re hearing. Here the appellant has to print the proceedings and also to find sureties and perfect his security. To do this thirty days appear to me to be a very short time. The time allowed for an appeal to the House of Lords, which is much more like an appeal to this court than an appeal to the Court of Appeals, is one year, and in the Privy Council two years are allowed.\nI think the respondent here could have had nothing to complain of if the appellant had been ordered to pay all costs and had been put upon terms of bringing the appeal to a hearing at the next term following the application.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by His Lordship the Chief Justice and think the motion should be refused.\nHENRY J.\u2014The law provides that an application of this nature may be made either to the court or a judge in chambers, and discretionary power is granted to be fully and equally exercised by either. When a judge in chambers exercises that discretionary power it is doubtful if the court has the power to review his decision, and, in my opinion, it should not be done in any event unless it can be shown that there are circumstances in the case which were not brought to his notice. When the judge gives a decision I am very strongly of opinion that this court has no jurisdiction to interfere with it in any way. The law does not provide, as in other cases, for an appeal from his decision, and although the court assumes certain functions not provided for by law, I think we have no right to interfere with the discretionary powers of a judge.\nIn this case I can see no reason why the court should interfere. The appellants were to blame all through. They very properly obtained two extensions, but failed to take advantage of the indulgence granted them. No application for further time was made, and they must have known that the appeal was liable to be dismissed. They take no further steps in the matter until the application to dismiss the appeal is made and they then come and say: \u201cAdmitting we were all wrong we ask as a favor to have the time further extended.\u201d\nUnder the circumstances I think the discretionary power exercised by the judge should not be interfered with. To say that a regular judgment by a judge in chambers should be set aside on a mere motion, without showing any usurpation of power on his part, is, I think, totally unauthorized.\nI think, therefore, that this application should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I wish to prevent its being supposed that I am of opinion that the case being supposed to be, by the order of the judge in chambers, out of court, deprives us of the right to interfere to grant an indulgence such as that asked; and as the appellants declared themselves ready to proceed with the argument at this co art, I think that visiting them with the payment of all costs would have been sufficient to attain the ends of justice. In a matter of practice I do not like differing from a majority of the court, but as I cannot concur in the grounds upon which the refusal of the motion is rested, I think it right to make these observations.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Chester Glass.\nSolicitor for respondent: W.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPatent\u2014Infringement of\u2014Coiled wire springs in groups\u2014Substituted for India-rubber\u2014Mechanical equivalent\u2014Want of invention.\nIn a suit for the infringement of a patent the alleged invention was the substitution in the manufacture of corsets of coiled wire springs, arranged in groups and in continuous lengths, for India-rubber springs previously so used. The advantage claimed by the substitution was that the metal was more durable, and was free from the inconvenience arising from the use of India-rubber caused by the heat from the wearer\u2019s body.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, that this was merely the substitution of one well known material, metal, for another equally well known material, India-rubber, to produce the same result on the same principle in a more agreeable and useful manner, or a mere mechanical equivalent for the use of India\u2011rubber, and it was, consequently, void of invention and not the subject of a patent.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Proudfoot J. in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice[2], by which the plaintiffs action was dismissed. The action was for infringement by the defendants of a patent granted to the plaintiff Florsheim which had been assigned to the plaintiffs the Chicago Corset Company. The latter had granted to the plaintiffs Brush & Brother a licence for using the said patent in Canada.\nThe following was the invention as described in the letters patent:\u2014\nFirst. An elastic gore, gusset, or section for wearing apparel composed of a covering material having tubes, spiral metal springs inclosed by such tubes and not extending to the edges of the covering material and stayed at their ends by such covering material, and inelastic margins outside of the springs, substantially as and for the purpose set forth.\nSecond. In an elastic gore, gusset, or section of the character described, the springs arranged in groups and made of a continuous length of coiled wire, substantially as described and shown.\nThird. In an elastic gore, gusset or section of the character described, metal fastenings extending across the ends of the tubes between the thicknesses of the covering material, substantially as described and shown.\nThe portion of the patent specially claimed as the patentee\u2019s invention was the metal springs arranged in groups and made of a continuous length of coiled wire. Previous to the patent metal springs had been used, but not in continuous lengths, and the manner in which they were used caused the covering material to become cut and frayed. There were also in previous use India-rubber springs in continuous lengths, but the India-rubber was an objectionable material, from liability to decay, and to contract when the body became heated, and so injure the health of the wearer.\nBy the statement of defence it was denied that Florsheim was the first and true inventor of the improvements described in the letters patent; that the alleged invention was new or useful, or that it was a patentable invention; and it was claimed that such alleged inventions were known and used by others previous to the issue of the patent, and that patents for the improvements were in existence in the United Kingdom and in the United States more than twelve months prior to Florsheim\u2019s application for a patent in Canada.\nOn the hearing before Proudfoot J. judgment was given dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action, the learned Judge holding that defendants had infringed the patent of the plaintiffs; that Florsheim was the first inventor, and that the invention was useful; but he also held that the coiled wire spring was only a mechanical equivalent for the india-rubber spring, and that it did not possess any element of invention, and therefore could not be the subject of a patent The Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. Cassets Q.C. and Akers for appellants:\nBy his judgment the learned judge who tried this case finds all the issues in favor of the plaintiffs but one. He finds as a fact that Florsheim was the inventor as between himself and Schilling. 2ndly. He finds as a fact that the defendants infringed the patent. 3rdly. He finds as a fact that \u201cit was clearly established that the invention was useful.\u201d 4thly. He finds that none of the patents set out by the defendants anticipated the invention of the plaintiffs, with the exception of a patent granted to one Miller on the 31st day of December, 1866, but because of this patent the learned judge, for reasons given in his judgment, was of opinion that plaintiffs\u2019 action must fail.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal concurred with Mr. Justice Proudfoot in all his findings in favor of the plaintiffs, but agree with him that the Miller patent anticipated the invention of the plaintiffs, and on this ground dismissed the appeal.\nThe patent sued upon is a patent for, among other claims, \u201can elastic gore, gusset, or section for wearing apparel composed of a covering material having tubes, spiral metal springs enclosed by such tubes and not extending to the edges of the covering material and stayed at their ends by such covering material, and inelastic margins outside of the springs.\u201d\nThe patent relied upon by the learned judges, as anticipating the plaintiffs patent, is a patent for a corset with continuous India-rubber springs. It is proved that the patent was never practically used.\nA patent similar to that granted in Canada was granted in the United States of America to Florsheim, on the 22nd of February, 1881. This patent was granted to Florsheim after an interference with Schilling. Before the patent was granted a reference was made by the officials of the Patent office to the Miller patent, relied on as a defence to this action, but after full consideration the American Patent Office were of opinion that the Miller patent did not anticipate Florsheim\u2019s invention, and the patent was granted to Florsheim.\nWe do not contend, of course, that the decision of the American Commissioner of Patents is in any way binding upon our Courts; but we say that where, after a protracted interference, with the full consideration of the Miller patent, the American Patent Office granted a patent it has some weight.\nIn Smith v. Goldie[3] Mr. Justice Gwynne is reported to have said: \u201cNow upon the question whether the combination is or is not the proper subject of a patent it appears to me, I confess, not to be altogether immaterial, although not conclusive, that after a protracted contestation, which must have involved enquiry into the patentable character of the combination, the plaintiff Smith obtained a patent in the United States.\u201d\nIn this case it was the same as in the Purifier case. With the full knowledge of the patent in question granted to Miller, and after full consideration of its effect, the United States granted a patent to Florsheim.\nAs hereinbefore stated, the patentee Florsheim by his specifications expressly states that the object he has in view \u201cis to produce the means for the successful and \u201cpractical substitution of metal springs for India-rubber.\u201d\nAs far back as the year 1815 those interested in the corset trade were endeavoring to invent some means for a practical application of spiral metal springs for corsets, the use of rubber being injurious and objectionable on various grounds.\nIn none of the prior patents relied on was a spiral metal spring made continuous, and it is beyond question that up to the time of Florsheim\u2019s invention the fact that spiral metal springs could be used continuously was unknown.\nThe learned counsel then contended upon the evidence that it was established beyond any reasonable controversy: (1) That for over sixty years those in the trade had been endeavouring to successfully substitute spiral metal springs in corsets in lieu of India-rubber; (2) That this had been attempted in various ways, all of which were found to be impracticable; (3) That the use of rubber in corsets was practically useless for the reasons hereinbefore set out; (4) That the improvement made by the defendants was of great value, and that thereby a vastly better article was introduced, and at a greatly reduced cost.\nThe following cases were cited and relied on;\u2014 Smith v. Goldie and cases there cited[4]; Unwin v. Heath[5]; Walton v. Potter[6]; Muntz v. Foster[7]; Dalton v, Nelson[8]; Smith v. Goodyear[9].\nMacLennan Q.C. and Osler Q.C. for respondents.\nThe evidence clearly establishes that Florsheim was not the \u201cfirst and true inventor\u201d of this article, for it was \u201cknown or used by others before his invention thereof in February, 1879,\u201d and had been anticipated by prior patents in England and the United States.\nThe substitution of a device well known and used for another device equally well known to obtain the same result does not possess any element of invention. The learned judge who tried the case so found (following Thompson v. James)[10], and the Court of Appeal has unanimously affirmed that decision.\nIn support of their case the respondents relied upon the reasoning of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal[11], and in addition to the cases cited by them, referred also to the following authorities:\u2014\nTerhune v. Phillips[12]; Pickering v. McCullough[13]; Hailes v. Van Wormer[14]; Smith v. Nicholls[15]; Crouch v. Roemer[16]; Hollister v. Benedict Manf. Co. [17]; Walker on Patents[18].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The learned judge who tried this case thought that the patent of the Millers, of the 31st Dec. 1866, No. 3451, embraced the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 invention. The only question then, he says, is \u201cwhether the substitution of a coiled wire spring for India\u2011rubber, and the arrangement of tubes into groups, are sufficiently novel, and display enough \u2018\u2018invention, to entitle the plaintiffs to a patent\u201d and the learned judge thought they were not; that the plain result of the evidence was, that the coiled wire spring is only a mechanical equivalent for an india-rubber spring, and that it does not possess any element of invention; or, as the learned chief Justice of Ontario says \u201cit therefore stands as a mere substitution of one very well known material for another equally well known material, to produce the same effect on the same principle in a more agreeable and useful manner.\u201d The evidence of Edward Wilhelm is very strong and conclusive upon this point. It is as follows:\n(His Lordship here read the evidence).\nI have been unable to escape from the conclusion arrived at by the learned judge in the court of first instance and by the Court of Appeal, that the use of the coiled wire was only a mechanical equivalent for the india-rubber spring in the Miller patent, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 patent, consequently, does not possess any element of invention; that the substitution in this case is in no sense the creative work of an inventive faculty, which the patent laws are intended to encourage and reward; and that the fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 improvement has proved successful and highly useful does not, necessarily, establish that it is an invention entitling the plaintiffs to a patent. Such was the case in Hinks v. The Safety Lighting Co.[19].\nThe employing one known material in place of another to produce the same result, though greater cheapness and durability may thereby be secured, is not invention; it involves no new mode of construction and developes no new uses and properties of the article formed, and does not produce a substantially different manufacture. It is a matter of mere mechan- ical judgment. The substitution may be new and useful but there must be some real novelty in the substitution, or in the application of an old invention to a new purpose. This cannot be said to be the application of an old thing to a new purpose; the means by which the intended result is obtained are substantially the same; there is no difference in function, mode of operation, or character of construction; there is identity of function and substantial identity of performing that function. The use of the coiled wire produced no new and different result not produced by the old combination. There is no change of action; the change of utility was nothing more than a question of degree, and merely did the same thing with better effect. Comparative utility, that is, comparative superiority or inferiority of utility, is not alone a criterion. In this case I cannot discover that the superiority of the plaintiffs5 patent over the Miller patent arises from any other cause than the superiority of one well known elastic substance over another equally well known elastic substance, and is, therefore, simply the superiority of material to in sure elasticity. India-rubber accomplished the end sought, coiled wire accomplished the same end; both did the same work in, substantially, the same way, accomplishing, substantially, the same result. What was this, then, but the substitution of a mere mechanical equivalent? In Thompson v. James[20], which was as to the question of substitution of steel springs in the place where other elastic materials were used before, though the Master of the Rolls found, as a matter of fact, that the substitution was new and useful, he felt bound to determine, as a judge, that the substitution of steel wire for whalebone was not the subject of a patent. I cannot distinguish that case from the present. In the United States, where the subject of patents has undergone so much judicial discussion, we naturally turn to ascertain the reasoning which has led to the decisions in that country, and in doing so we find the reasoning and principles enunciated in Thompson v. James acted on in the highest tribunal of that country. Thus, in Smith v. Nicholls[21] we find Mr. Justice Swayne, of the Supreme Court, speaking thus:\nA patentable invention is a mental result. It must be new and shown to be of practical utility. Everything within the domain of the conception belongs to him who conceived it. The machine, process or product is but its material reflex and embodiment. A new idea may be engrafted upon an old invention, be distinct from the conception which preceded it, and be an improvement. In such case it is patentable. The prior patentee cannot use it without the consent of the improver, and the latter cannot use the original invention without the consent of the former. But a mere carrying forward, or new or more extended application, of the original thought, a change only in form, proportions or degree, the substitution of equivalents, doing substantially the same thing in the same way by substantially the same means with better results; is not such invention as will sustain a patent. These rules apply alike, whether what preceded was covered by a patent or rested only in public knowledge and use. In neither case can there be an invasion of such domain and an appropriation of anything found there. In one case every thing belongs to the prior patentee, in the other to the public at large.\nChief Justice Waite, in Crouch v. Roemer,[22] delivers himself thus:\nIt is conceded in the patent itself that shawl straps with handles attached to a leather cross piece having loops at the ends were old. Eustace, one of the witnesses for the complainant, says he made his goods with a cross-piece of the firmest leather he could get, doubled and stitched, so as to render it firmer still. His object clearly was to keep the weight of the bundle from drawing the ends of the handle together so as to press against the sides of the hand.\nThe testimony leaves no doubt on our minds that handles fastened on rigid cross-bars and used to carry bundles were known long before the complainant\u2019s invention. Possibly in adjusting them to use, though this is by no means certain, the straps to bind the bundle were not passed through loops across the bar, yet it is clear beyond all question that the handle, rigid cross-bar, loop?, or their equivalent, and straps, or equivalents, were used in combination to keep together and carry one or more articles in a package made by piling or rolling the articles together. Under these circumstances it was no invention to stiffen by artificial means the leather cross-piece which had been before made as rigid as it could be by thickness, doubling and stitching. All that was done by the inventor was to add to the degree of rigidity which had been used before. The addition of metal or other substance as a stiffener of the known cross-piece, which had already been made rigid in a degree, was not invention. The substantial elements of a well known structure were thus, in no patentable way, changed.\nAnd in Blake v. San Francisco[23], Mr. Justice Wood, delivering the opinion of the court, says:\n\u201cIt is settled,\u201d says Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, \u201cby many decisions of this court\u2026 that the application of an old process, or machine, to a similar or analagous subject, with no change in the manner of application, and no result substantially distinct in its nature, will not sustain a patent, even if the new form of result has not before been contemplated. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v.Locomotive Truck Co[24]; and cases there cited.\u201d\nIf there is any qualification of this rule, it is that if a new and different result is obtained by a new application of an invention, such new application may be patented as an improvement of the original invention; but if the result claimed as new is the same in character as the original result, it will not be deemed a new result for this purpose.\nAnd the cases of Thompson v. Boisselier[25] and Stephenson v. Brooklyn R.R. Co.[26]; decided that it must not only be new and useful but must amount to invention.\nThe Appellants in their factum invoke, and also strongly urged on the argument, the following\u2014\nIt is not contended, of course, that the decision of the American Commissioner of Patents is in any way binding upon our Courts; but the appellants do say that where, after a protracted interference with the full consideration of the Miller patent, the American Patent Office granted a patent it has some weight. In Smith v. Goldie[27] Mr. Justice Gwynne is reported to have said: \u201cNow upon the question whether the combination is, or is not, the proper subject of a patent it appears to me, I confess, not to be altogether immaterial, although not conclusive, that after a protracted contestation, which must have involved inquiry into the patentable character of the combination, the plaintiff, Smith, obtained a patent in the United States.\u201d\nIn this case it was the same as in the Purifier case. With the full knowledge of the patent in question granted to Miller, and after full consideration of its effect, the United States granted a patent to Florsheim.\nAllowing every weight to the presumption in favor of the validity of the patent, arising from the action of the Patent Office in granting it, any such presumption is surely entirely rebutted by a judicial decision declaring that the patent so granted is void, which has actually taken place with reference to this very patent. The question of the validity of this patent came up for adjudication in the United States Circuit Court from the Northern District of Illinois, and was decided January 11th, 1886, and reported in the official gazette of the United States Patent Office under the Heading; \u201cdecisions of the Commissioner of Patents and of the United States courts in patent cases.\u201d It was decided on the same grounds, and for the same reasons, as was the action before us. After detailing minutely the plaintiffs\u2019 patents and the English patents to Mills of March 14th, 1815, to the Millers of December 31st, 1866, and the American patent to M.J. Van Norstrand of February 1st, 1876, the learned judge decided that the latter\u2019s patent No. 238,101 as to groups, 2308 as to elastic gussets and gores as to durability, &c., were voidable for want of patentable invention over the English patents to Jane Mills of March 14th 1815, the English patent to the Millers of December 31st, 1866, and the American patent to M.S. Van Nostrand of February 1st, 1876; that the substitution of one material, metal, for India-rubber springs is not a patentable difference. The learned judge says of the Miller patent:\nLetters patent, No. 238,100, corsets, and No. 238,101, elastic gore or gusset for wearing apparel, granted February 22, 1881, to Simon Florsheim, as inventor, and Thomas IL Ball, as assignee, are void for want of patentable novelty over the English patent to John Mills, of March 14th, 1815, the English patent to Miller, of December 31, 1866, and the American patent to Mary J.C. Van Norstrand, of February 1, 1876.\nPatent No. 238,100 claimed a corset having elastic side sections comprising two layers of cloth stitched together transversely so as to form tubes, wherein were inserted in groups of spiral metal springs formed of one continuous spring, and such sections having plain margins or edges for uniting the elastic sections to the non-elastic sections of the corset. The prior patents taken together disclosed this construction, except that they did not show an elastic section composed of groups of spiral metal springs. Held, that no invention, but only mechanical skill, was required to group such springs.\nSame\u2014Change of material.\nThe substitution of one material (metal for India-rubber springs) is not a patentable difference, even where a superior article is pro duced by such substitution.\nSame\u2014Complete device not shown in single prior patent.\nAlthough the complete devices described in these patents may not be found in any one of the prior patents, yet enough is shown in the Miller (1866) patent to invalidate them.\nThe English patent of John Mills, of March 14, 1815, shows elastic sections or gores in corsets made of cloth with tubes stitched into the same, into which are inserted metal spiral springs, so as to pucker the cloth over the springs and give the sections the required elasticity. The patentee, in his specifications says:\nFigure I is a representation of a stay composed of the same material as common stays, with the introduction of an elastic or expansive portion or slit down the middle, which will dilate or expand by a more than ordinary pressure or force being exerted, as in the case of breathing or exercising of the arms. This flexible portion is composed of springs either of brass, copper or iron wire, or of any other matter or thing capable of producing sufficient elasticity; but this which I recommend is small brass wire worm springs, which extend by a small degree of force. These I place close together in runners Or spaces stitched in between two pieces or layers of silk, satin, or other fit material puckered or quilted loosely to give room for expansion, the ends of the springs and their covering of silk, satin, or other matter on them sewed or otherwise fastened to and between the two half pieces of the stay, previously made of the usual material.\nHere we have an elastic section for a corset, the elasticity being secured by spiral springs transversely set into the material of which the section is made, and this section extending from the top to the bottom of the corset either at the back or front or both.\nIn the American patent, granted February 1, 1876, to Mary J.C. Van Nostrand, a corset is shewn with elastic sections at the sides extending from under the arms to the hips or bottoms of the corsets, this section being made of elastic webbings, the elastic material being presumably India-rubber. The elastic sections in this corset are located in the same place and perform the same functions as those shown in the complainant\u2019s corset.\nIn the English patent to Miller, of December 31, 1866, elastic gussets suitable for use on boots, stays, and for other purposes are described where the elastic material used is India-rubber strips run continuously back and forth in tubes formed in cloth. The patentee says:\nAccording to our invention we secure the vulcanized India-rubber springs between two pieces of woven fabrics, leather or other material by stitching with the sewing machine, the stitches running in parallel lines and passing through the two pieces of fabric or material between the India-rubber springs; and the springs, in place of being each a separate piece, are in one piece, the length of the vulcanized India-rubber cord at the end or each traverse across the gusset being turned around and caused to return parallel to itself; thus the liability of the India-rubber to slip and work out of the gusset is much reduced. When gussets made in this manner are worked into boots or other articles, the stitches by which they are secured are passed through a margin on each side of the gusset, and not through the India-rubber part of the gusset, as heretofore.\nWe first cut the material, leather, silk, cotton, or any other woven fabric, and the lining to the size required of the gusset when it is finished and for leaving the required margin. We then turn over the top edge and baste or tack it down to the lining. We then commence to stitch with a sewing machine a series of rows in parallel lines transversely across the gusset, the stitching passing through the two materials, commencing at the top, and so on, from row to row, until the whole of the gusset is stitched. The distance between the rows of stitches will depend on the thickness of the India-rubber thread to be inserted.\u201d They then describe the manner in which they pucker the cloth and a machine for doing puckering, and proceed:\n\u201cWe then insert with the bodkin or needle the thread or strand of India-rubber, which is in one length. We commence at the top cavity to insert the India-rubber thread or cord, and follow back in the next row or cavity, causing it to return parallel to itself, and so on, the same from row to row until the whole of the cavities are filled with India-rubber. We then pull back the margin that is left as large as required and tack it down with an ordinary needle, and the gusset is ready for use.\u2019\u2019\nThere can be no doubt that there is described in this patent a gusset with non-elastic margins, edges or ends, and the only conceivable difference between this device and the elastic sections in the complainant\u2019s corset patent is that an India-rubber spring is used instead of a metal spiral spring and the springs in this English patent are not grouped. This patent seems to fully instruct any person how to make a section like the section shewn in the complainant\u2019s corset patent with India-rubber springs. It does not seem to, me that there is any patentable difference between the gussets described in the English patent of Miller and the sections in the complainant\u2019s corset patent. The substitution of one material for another is not a patentable difference, even where a superior article is produced by such substitution, Hotchkiss v. Greenwood[28], Hicks v. Kelsey[29], Terhune v. Phillips[30].\nIn the corset patent the patentee gives his reasons for grouping the springs. He says:\nThe Springs are arranged in groups as shown. The number of Springs composing the group will vary according to location, so as to give the requisite stiffness and elasticity. Those at the top and bottom of the elastic side sections of the groups of springs should not be made so stiff as at the waist. It is essential also\u2019 that the springs be arranged in groups since if placed contiguous throughout the elastic sections the corset would be much too heavy and expensive, and such sections would be too stiff at some points and not stiff enough at others.\nHere is a mere mechanical reason given for grouping these springs clearly applicable to the change of material and the use to which the gusset or section is applied. Were a good mechanic to attempt to apply the Miller gusset or gore to a corset in the manner shown in the complainants corset patent, where an unequal degree of elasticity is required at different points, there can be no doubt that he would provide for that inequality of elasticity by placing his rubber springs closer together or farther apart, which would not require inventive ability, but mere mechanical skill of adaptation. With the part of corset making so far developed in the direction of complainant\u2019s device as is shewn by the elastic sections of Miller and Van Nostrand, and with the Miller section showing continuous springs and non-elastic margins, it would seem that all complainant did, in his corset, was fully entitled in the older art. The substitution of wire for rubber makes the Miller corset in all respects an elastic section such as is shewn in complainant\u2019s corset, except that the springs are not grouped, and this is not a patentable difference, as the only advantage of the grouping is to make the sections less rigid at some points than at others.\nAs to complainant\u2019s gusset or gore patent, it seems to me that all the elements of this patent are found in the English patent of Miller, just considered. The only difference is the material of the springs, and that I have already said in the discussion of the first patent is not a patentable difference. Miller\u2019s patent shows a gusset with tubes into which the springs are inserted, and upon which the cloth or gusset material is puckered, and margins for attaching the gusset to the garment where it is to be used or applied. The old Mills patent of 1815 showed a gusset with metal springs inserted in tubes, and the cloth puckered over those tubes, so as to provide for the expansion; but the patent did not expressly provide for a plain or a non-elastic margin, and all that Miller did in 1866 over Mills in 1815 was to put a non-elastic margin upon the Mills gusset, and all that Florsheim did was to substitute metal springs in place of the rubber springs shown in the Miller patent. This cannot amount to invention in the then state of the art. Coiled wire springs for a gusset or gore were old, and gussets with non-elastic margins were old and well known long before Florsheim applied for his patent, and the proof shows that he examined the Miller patent before he applied for the patent now under consideration, so that he must have known that the field was already covered before his device was produced.\nIt is urged on the part of complainant that the complete device as described in each of these patents is not found in any of the older devices; but, as I have already said, I find enough in the Miller patent alone to meet and anticipate both these patents. When Miller had shown how to make an elastic gusset or section for Wearing apparel with non\u2011elastic margins, there was no invention in applying such a gusset or section to a corset when corsets had already been made with elastic sections, although these older sections did not have non-elastic margins, as it did not require invention to put Miller\u2019s elastic sections into Mills or Van Nostrand stays.\nFor all these reasons I am constrained to conclude that the use of wire did not lay so much out of the \u2018track of the former use of India-rubber as not naturally to suggest itself, and, therefore, that the mere substitution of metal for India-rubber was destitute of patentable invention.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The principle of the invention claimed by the plaintiff is the same as that of the Miller patent, namely, a continuous spring instead of one cut into lengths. The substitution of a wire spring for one of India-rubber is no novelty, but a mere adaptation of a device already well known and used which attains precisely the same object. Numerous authorities show that there is nothing in this to entitle the plaintiff to a patent. It is sufficient to refer to two cases precisely in point and closely resembling the present in their circumstances, Thompson v. James[31], cited and relied on in the judgments in both the courts below, and that of Cave v. The Morgan Envelope Co.[32], decided by Judge Lowell in the Circuit Court of the United States.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Henry, whose judgment I have read, I am in favour of allowing the appeal\nHENRY J.\u2014The only question for decision in this case arises upon the issue raised by the 4th statement of defence of the respondents, wherein they allege that the invention claimed by the appellants was not patentable The statute provides that a party may obtain a patent for Any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter not known or used by others before his invention.\nThe claim in this case is for a new and useful improvement on a manufacture, and our inquiry is simply from the evidence to ascertain if the manufacture by the appellants of corsets within the terms of his patent was new and useful.\nThe learned judge who tried the action decided that it was useful, and on that point his judgment is fully sustained, and, I think, very properly so. In this connection I was struck by the statements of Mr. Justice Burton in his judgment in the court below as follows:\nI have not the slightest doubt that the improvement made by the plaintiffs was of great value, and that thereby a vastly better article was introduced, and at a greatly reduced cost, and I regret that the effect of our decision is to enable the defendants to avail themselves of the plaintiffs\u2019 ingenuity and skill without compensation. It does not commend itself to one as a very honest proceeding, &c.\nWith all due deference to the learned judge, I must express the opinion that entertaining such views, in which I fully concur, his judgment, in my opinion, should have been for the appellants. He finds, substantially, that the improvement produced two results\u2014\u201ca vastly better article,\u2019\u2019 and \u201cat a greatly reduced cost.\u201d Now, when we consider that the claim in the appellants\u2019 patent was for a new combination, which has produced the results just mentioned, it seems to follow as a necessary result that that \u201ccombination\u201d must have been new. Otherwise, no such results would have been produced. In Penn v. Bibby[33] the Chancellor says:\nTo this it is objected that the alleged invention was merely a new application of the old and well known theory. It is very difficult to extract any principle from the various decisions on this subject which can be applied with certainty to every case nor, indeed, is it easy to reconcile them with each other. And Sir A. Cockburn, in Harwood v. Great Northern Railway said[34];\nAlthough the authorities establish the proposition that the same means, apparatus, or mechanical contrivance; cannot be applied to the same purpose, or to purposes so nearly cognate and similar as that the application of it in the one case naturally leads to application of it when required in some other, still the question in every case is one of degree, whether the amount of affinity or similarity which exists between the two purposes is such that they are substantially the same, and that determines whether the invention is sufficiently meritorious to be deserving of a patent.\nUnder the ruling in the latter case, as well as the preceding one, the inquiry in a case like that before us must be directed to ascertain in the words of Sir A. Cockburn:\nWhether the amount of affinity or similarity which exists between the two purposes is such that they are substantially the same.\nIf the improvement of the appellants is not substantially the same as that of another opposed to it, and that the results are useful in the production of a better article and at a largely reduced cost, that, in the concluding words of Sir A Cockburn, determines that \u201cthe invention is sufficiently meritorious to be deserving of a patent.\u201d\nLet us now see how the matter stands by comparing the two opposing patents separately.\nIn the specification of the appellants\u2019 patent the applicant says;\nThe object I have in view is to produce means for the successful and practical substitution of spiral metal springs for India-rubber as an element in elastic gores, gussets and sections of wearing apparel. My invention consists, first, in securing the metal springs to the covering material, and extending such covering material beyond the ends of the springs, to form inelastic margins; second, in arranging the springs in groups, and in making the springs of two or more of such groups continuous; and third, in peculiar cross-fastenings for staying the springs at their ends when not made continuous.\nWith the exception of the substitution of metal springs for those made of India-rubber it is the same as that in the Miller patent referred to, and it claims nothing more. The ruling decisions as to mechanical equivalents include nothing beyond what is simply and solely mechanical.\nThere is very much beyond that in this case. An equivalent is to be considered not only in regard to its mechanical powers, but as to its general efficiency to do what is claimed for it. We may suppose the case of an inventor producing a machine in which he claims to use a material substance which on trial from the want, say, of elasticity or otherwise, failed to insure the working of the machine, and the patent lapses. It would have been, if successful, a valuable invention to the public, but its benefits are lost through the failure of the specified material substance. Another inventor substitutes suitable materials and succeeds in producing a machine valuable to the public. It is, therefore, meritorious and deserving of a patent. Here, then, we have an invention for the application of India-rubber. Two substantial objections to its use are shown to exist. First, its offensive smell, and next, that in a short time its elasticity is gone.\nIt is not shown that Miller\u2019s invention was ever practically used, but, on the contrary, there is evidence going to show that from the obnoxious qualities of India-rubber, and its want of durability as an elastic substance, it could not be successfully used. It is an English patent, but has not been shown to have had any practical value.\nThe public, therefore, derived, as far as we can discover, no benefit from it. On the other hand the appellants\u2019 improvement has been shown to have been a public benefit, and therefore well worthy of a patent. We have evidence of the application of spiral springs, but not continuous or at all adapted to the purpose of producing satisfactory results, The trial of them resulted in failure, because they were not continuous and were not fastened to elastic margins. Besides, in the plaintiffs\u2019 specification arrangements were made for groups of spiral springs in places where a greater amount of strain would naturally be felt, leaving the other parts, although connected, to be more easily affected; and, therefore, making the corset lighter and more easy and comfortable to the wearer. This case resembles very much that of Smith v. Goldie, decided lately in this court. There was a claim there for a combination only. It was by the simultaneous application by means of fans of a current of air to the revolving bolt of a grist mill and a set of brushes worked by machinery. The fans had been previously used for the same purpose and so had brushes, but no similar simultaneous action had been previously applied by means of machinery, and the result was the manufacture of a superior article of flour. This Court decided in favour of the patent for the combination as a meritorious invention on account of the improved results. I believe an application to the Privy Council to grant an appeal in that case was made and refused.\nThere was nothing new in that case but the simultaneous application of two well known and used powers both of which had been previously but ineffectually separately tried. On principle are not the two cases similar?\nThe India-rubber springs of Miller did not accomplish, as far as shewn, any beneficial result. The material is shown to contract with the heat of the wearer\u2019s body, and therefore to become to some extent uncomfortable if not injurious. Articles manufactured with India-rubber to give them elasticity very soon lose it, and if kept any time in stock become to that extent injured. It is alleged, therefore, that dealers refused to purchase articles so made. From the evidence before us the proper conclusion is that Miller\u2019s patent was worthless and that of the appellants most valuable.\nTo decide, then, that the former should be held to have anticipated the latter would not, in my opinion, be conformable to law, equity, or common justice I think the appellants have fully established their patent rights and are entitled to our judgment with the usual results in such cases, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action for alleged infringement by the defendants of a patent for invention granted to one Florsheim by letters patent bearing date the 29th day of April, 1881.\nThe defendants, among other defences, deny\n1st. That the alleged invention is new or useful.\n2nd. They deny that the alleged invention is a matter for which letters patent could be granted.\n3rd. They say that the alleged inventions were known and used by others before the alleged invention thereof by the patentee.\n4th. They say that patents for the said inventions were in existence in other countries, to wit, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United Stales of America, more than twelve months prior to the application in Canada for the said alleged patent.\n5th They say that the specification of the alleged patent does not correctly or fully describe the mode or modes of operating contemplated by the alleged inventor. Nor does the same state clearly or distinctly the contrivances or things claimed as new for which the patentee claimed an exclusive property or privilege.\n6th. They say that the said alleged patent claims more than the patentee had a right to claim as new. The letters patent of the 29th April, 1881, purport to grant to the patentee and his assigns, for the period of five years, the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using, and vending to others to be used, certain new and useful improvements on elastic gores, gussets, &c., for wearing apparel, of which he claimed to be the inventor, such his invention consisting, as stated, in the letters patent as follows:\u2014\nIt consists, 1st. in an elastic gore, gusset or section for wearing apparel, composed of a covering material having tubes, spiral metal springs inclosed by such tubes and not extending to the edges of the covering material, and stayed at the ends by such covering material, and inelastic margins outside of the springs.\n2nd. in an elastic gore gusset or section of the character described, the springs arranged in groups and made of a continuous length of coiled wire.\n3rd. in an elastic gore, gusset or section of the character described, the metal fastenings C extending across the ends of the tubes between the thicknesses of the covering material.\nIn the specifications referred to in, and made part of, the letters patent the patentee says;\nThe object I have in view is to produce means for the successful and practical substitution of spiral metal springs for India rubber as an element in elastic gores, gussets and sections for wearing apparel.\nMy invention (he says) consists first in securing the metal springs to the covering material and extending such covering material beyond the ends of the springs to form inelastic margins; second in arranging the springs in groups and in making the springs of two or more of such groups continuous and, third, in peculiar cross fastenings for staying the springs at their ends when not made continuous.\nIn 1815 Letters patent of invention were granted in England to one Mills for improved elastic stays. The invention for which such Letters Patent were granted was described to consist of the introduction of a flexible or elastic portion in those parts of the stays best calculated to give relief to the wearer and at the same time preserving that stability and support usually given to the body by the common adaptation of whalebone, steel, and other hard or inflexible materials. Three drawings of stays showing the elastic portions introduced are annexed to the specifications and are referred to therein as figures 1, 2, and 3. The improvement as introduced into the stays shewn in Figure 1 was described as follows:\nFigure 1 is a representation of a stay composed of the same materials as common stays with the introduction of an elastic or expansive portion or slit down the middle which will dilate or expand by a more than ordinary pressure or force being exerted as in the case of breathing or exercise of the arms. The flexible portion is composed of springs either of brass, copper, or iron wire, or of any other matter or thing capable of producing sufficient elasticity; but that which I recommend is small brass wire worm springs which extend by a small degree of force. These I place close together in runners or spaces stitched in between two pieces or laying of silk, satin or other fit material puckered or quilted loosely to give room for expansion; the ends of the springs and their covering of silk, satin or other matter on them, sewed or otherwise fastened to, and between, the two half pieces of the stay previously made of the usual materials such as jean, or other cotton, linen, silk woollen or leather, &c.\nAs to figure 2 the specifications say;\nThis elastic portion is composed of dilating springs as before expressed, either of copper, brass, iron or other matter, but brass wire worm springs I prefer, covered as before described. In this elastic portion the springs need not be placed so close together as in figure 1, and it will be found necessary to place stronger springs at the top and bottom than in the middle, the latter being intended to yield very readily, the power to help support and brace the body with busks of a \u00ablighter kind than usually adopted in common stays placed down the stay in order to distend it as seen in the drawing.\nIn all these drawings the ends of the coverings of the springs extending beyond and outside of the elastic portion were shewn to be sewn to the two half pieces of the stay between which the elastic portion was introduced.\nIt thus appears that before ever India-rubber was used as an elastic material in stays, or in gussets gores, &c., for wearing apparel, the use of metal spiral or worm springs was well known; to speak therefore of the substitution of spiral metal springs for India-rubber as an invention in 1881 seems rather anachronistic.\nIn 1866 letters patent of invention were granted to James Miller and James Miller Jr. for the invention of improvements in the manufacture of elastic gussets.\nBy this time the use of vulcanized India-rubber as an elastic material for gussets, gores &c. had become common and the improvement patented by these letters patent was in the making India-rubber gussets.\nThe specifications accompanying these letters patent describes the invention patented as follows;\u2014\nThis invention has for its object improvements in the manufacture of elastic gussets suitable for use in boots and stays and for other purposes. In the manufacture of gussets it is usual to weave the vulcanised India rubber springs into the fabric in the process of manufacture; the India-rubber forming a portion of the warp of the fabric; or when the gussets are of leather by means of cement, and in either case each spring or line of India-rubber has been a separate piece. Now, according to our invention we secure the vulcanised India-rubber springs between two pieces of woven fabric, leather, or other material by stitching with a sewing machine, the stitches running in parallel lines and passing through the two pieces of fabric or material between the India-rubber springs, which, in place of being each a separate piece are in one piece, the length of vulcanized India rubber cord at the end of each traverse across the gusset being turned round and caused to return parallel to itself; thus the liability of the India-rubber to slip and work out of the gusset is much reduced. When gussets made in this manner are worked into boots or other articles the stitches by which they are secured are passed through a margin on each aide of the gusset and not through the India-rubber part of the gusset as heretofore.\nNow, from these Letters Patent it is apparent, that if the mode as described in the Letters Patent of April, 1881, for securing metal springs to their covering material, and the extension of such covering material beyond the ends of the springs, to form a margin for the purpose of thereby attaching the covering material of the springs to other parts of the fabric to which the elastic portion was to be applied, had not been known ever since the granting of the Letters Patent to Mills in 1815, this mode of fastening springs in gussets and of attaching such gussets was known ever since the granting of the Letters Patent in 1866. The mode of securing springs in their covering material, or of attaching the covering material containing the springs to other portions of the fabric to which they were to be attached, were matters wholly independent of all consideration of the nature of the material of which the elastic springs were made. There would be no patentable novelty in the application of a mode of fastening, in a gusset, elastic springs made of one material, or of attaching the gussets containing such springs to another material, to the case of gussets containing elastic springs made of a different material, whatever novelty there might be in the use of a different material for the making of the elastic springs.\nIn 1872 Letters Patent of invention were granted in England to one Adlam for the invention of \u201can improvement in stays.\u201d In the Letters Patent and in the specifications accompanying the same the invention was described as:\nAn elastic fabric made of India-rubber webbing, or its elasticity may be derived from small spiral springs inserted in the fabric.\nThe patentee in the specifications referring to drawings therein, said:\nWhen metallic springs are employed I insert them in the following manner: The inner and outer fabric, a a, figure 2, are united together by a series of parallel stitches, b b, to form channels to receive springs, and the fabric is then reeved upon wires, which are withdrawn to enable the springs to be inserted. I may here observe that the springs are of brass wire, and are the same as those employed for garters or belts, which are covered in a similar manner to that above described.\nAnd again:\nThe elastic fabric may consist of India-rubber fabric, but I prefer small spiral springs inserted in the fabric as being more durable.\nNow, from these letters patent, it is apparent that the use of spiral metal springs in preference to India-rubber, for the purpose of making elastic fabrics, had long been well-known, and from the time of the granting of these letters patent we must take to be well known the mode there described of inserting the metal springs in the covering material in \u201cchannels,\u201d which seems to be but another word for the \u201ctubes\u201d mentioned in the letters patent to Florsheim of the 29th of April, 1881. On the first of February, 1879, one Gustav Schilling applied for letters patent of invention to be granted to him in the United States, for what he claimed to be a new and useful improvement in gloves and for which letters patent were granted to him on the 5th of August, 1879. The invention for which these letters patent were granted was said to consist in a series of springs made of very fine brass wire coiled upon a small mandrel so that their spirals are successively in close contact with each other, such springs being enclosed in finely wrinkled leather tubes and attached with their ends across the wrist portion of the glove. In his specifications the patentee declared that he was aware that elastic woven bands, straps or gores were well known and had long been used in gloves, such bands, straps, or gores being composed of india-rubber strands, upon which when under tension a filling of small threads has been woven. And he therefore disclaimed the invention of an elastic attachment for the purposes mentioned. He also declared that he was well aware of the shoe fastenings of Fitch and Jones, composed of a spiral spring coiled around an elastic core, and permanently secured to the shoe at one end only, and he therefore disclaimed the invention of a spiral spring coil to be used for gloves. He also declared that he was aware of an English patent of 1866, wherein was described an elastic gore for shoes, composed of leather, divided by stitches into numerous tubes, through which when wrinkled a small India-rubber strand is threaded back and forth, and he therefore disclaimed the invention described in such English patent. And all that he claimed as his invention was the combination with a glove of a series of spiral metal springs enclosed in separate puckered tubes and permanently attached at both ends to the wrist portion of the glove. We are not called upon now to determine whether this attachment to a glove\u00bb or as it is called \u201c combination with a glove at the wrist \u201c of a well known elastic fabric made of spiral metal springs producing the elasticity which spiral metal springs were known to produce, was a patentable invention. For our present purpose it is sufficient to say that the elastic fabric here described, for the combination of which with a glove the Letters Patent were granted in the United States, and its elastic property were things that were well known.\nOn the 7th of February, 1879, the same Gustave Schilling applied for Letters Patent to be granted to him in the United States for what he claimed to be a new and useful improvement in elastic gores for gaiters, and Letters Patent were granted therefor on the 22nd of April, 1879. The invention for which these Letters Patent were granted was said to consist in the application of a series of small coil springs enclosed in finely wrinkled tubes formed by uniting two Haps of thin leather with parallel seams of stitching and arranged in series with blank spaces between the different series so as to adjust the tension of the various parts of the elastic gore.\nIn the specifications accompanying these Letters Patent the springs are described as being made of very fine brass wire which are coiled upon a small mandrel so that its spirals are successively in close contact with each other, precisely as in the specifications accom- panying the application of the same applicant on the 1st of February, 1879, above mentioned. The specifications further say:\nThe leather tubes, after the springs are inserted therein, are contracted over the same so as to form a multitude of small wrinkles equally distributed over the whole length of the springs, and the ends of the latter are secured in the ends of the tubes in the gore, which again, with its edges, is secured by stitching between the edges of the material and the lining of the gaiter in the usual manner. The springs I arrange in the gore in series of two, three or four, with a blank space between each two series, in accordance with the required elastic resistance for making a tight and yet easy fit of the gaiter round the angle of the foot. Heretofore the gores for gaiters were made of an elastic fabric composed of rubber tiers interwoven with or covered with silk or cotton threads. Such gores, however, were not durable, soon lost their elasticity, and could not be blackened with the rest of the shoe, and therefore soon had a worn out appearance, while a gore of my above described construction will exert a uniform tension which will not relax with its use and will out-last the gaiter, can be shined with blacking, and will be impervious to water as much as the rest of the shoe. The unpleasant feeling of rubber to the skin, particularly in the summer time, is well known, and a substitute of leather gores is therefore something desirable.\nWhat I claim as my invention is the elastic gore for gaiters and boots, composed of wrinkled flaps and coiled metal springs placed in tubes between the flaps and arranged in series, with blank spaces between the series, substantially as described and shewn.\nIt is to be observed here that the covering material of leather is described as having ends or edges extending beyond the spiral springs and the tubes in which they are placed, by which edges the gore containing the spiral springs is sewn to the gaiter in what is called the usual manner. In the specifications the novelty which is relied upon seems to be the substitu-tion of leather for India-rubber.\nThat the use of spiral metal springs and their superiority as an elastic material over India\u2011rubber was well known I have already shewn. Whether the insertion of spiral metal springs in leather as a covering material was a patentable invention, we need not now enquire, for I refer to these Letters Patent for the purpose merely of showing that, neither in the use of spiral metal springs for the purpose of making an elastic fabric, nor in the mode of attaching such elastic fabric to the material in which the elastic fabric was to be inserted, by sewing to such material the ends or edges of the covering material of the metal springs extending beyond the ends of the spring, was there any novelty.\nOn the 4th of March, 1879, the above named Gustav Schilling, jointly with the plaintiff Florsheim, applied for, and on the 17th February, 1880, obtained, Letters Patent to be granted to them in the United States for what they claimed to be new and useful improvements in pantaloon garments, and they described what they claimed their invention to be as follows:\nOur invention consists in Pantaloons, Drawers, or Overalls as a new article of manufacture provided with elastic straps at the sides, such straps composed of a series of spiral springs held in puckered tubes between two layers of materials and arranged lengthwise of the waistband and supported by intermediate loops; and also in Pantaloons, Drawers, or Overalls as a new article of manufacture having a triangular gore at the back of the waistband composed of a series of spiral springs held in puckered tubes and arranged in a close group at the top, followed by puckered spaces separated by two spiral springs, all as more specifically hereinafter described.\nFigures are then referred to with letters upon them indicating the several parts as follows:\nC is an elastic gore inserted in the rear upper of the garment, and D D are elastic straps secured with their ends upon the waistband at the sides of the overalls, whereby the support of the garment is brought upon the hips and the loose portion of the waistband intermediate of the strap ends for the purpose of preventing its sagging down; has two loops, E E, attached, which inclose, and by which it is suspended on, the straps.\nThe gore C, as well as the straps, D D, are composed each of two flaps, c c, of thin leather or of cloth, which may be of a corresponding color with the fabric of the pantaloons. These flaps are cut about twice the length the gore or strap is to be when finished, and are united by longitudinal parallel seams of stitching so as to form small tubes between two such seams, into each of which is inserted a small coil spring, d. These springs are made up of very fine brass wire, which we coil upon a small mandrel, so that the spirals are successively in close contact with each other. The leather or fabric tubes are contracted over these springs so as to form a multitude of small wrinkles equally distributed over the whole length of the said springs and the ends of the latter we secure in the ends of the tubes to the fabric.\nFor the gore we arrange the springs in series of two, three, or four with a blank space between each two series and in accordance with the required elastic resistance necessary for insuring a close yet comfortable fit for the pantaloons and with the length of the springs proportioned to the varying width of the gore. For the side straps we arrange about four such springs side by side and we attach the ends of such straps upon the waistband and cover said ends by small patches of leather or fabric, and to the waistband at equal distance between the ends of, and over, the straps we secure two leather or fabric loops which will sustain the otherwise loose portion of the waistband.\nSuch springs interlaid between leather or cloth which will conceal and protect the same and will prevent their being stretched beyond the length of the covering material, make a much more durable elastic strap or gore than those made of rubber shirrs interwoven with or covered with the threads of the fabric, which are early influenced by the weather and become brittle with age, besides the disagreeableness of rubber where it comes in contact with the human skin.\nAlthough it may be desirable to apply both the gore and the straps to pantaloon garments, yet one or the other alone may be sufficient to bring about the desired good result, and, therefore, we do not wish to be restricted to their combined application.\nThe straps may be detachably secured by buttons or buckles so as to enable the same to be taken off while the overalls, pants or drawers are sent to the laundry for cleaning or washing, and such elastic straps may be applied with good advantage also to the vest in place of the rear latchets and buckles.\nAfter describing in this manner the mode of construction of the elastic fabrics made of metal springs, the use of which in pantaloons was claimed to be so superior to elastic fabrics made of India-rubber, and the use of which, as applied to vests, was claimed to be so superior to \u201crear latchets and buckles\u201d theretofore in use as to make the garment in which they should be inserted such \u201ca new article of manufacture\u201d as to entitle the applicants to have letters patent granted to them as for a new invention, the specifications nevertheless proceed to say;\nWe do not claim in this application the invention of spirally-coiled wire springs, held in puckered tubes between two layers of material, neither do we claim the application to pantaloons, overalls, or drawers of elastic gore, pieces or straps\u2014but as we have not found described and do not know of such garments provided with straps or with gores constructed, arranged, and applied as described in our specification. We do claim as new and as our invention;\n1. As a new article of manufacture pantaloons, drawers or overalls provided at the sides with elastic straps composed of a series of spiral wire springs held in puckered tubes between two layers of material arranged lengthwise of the waistband and supported by intermediate loops substantially as and for the purposes set forth.\n2. As a new article of manufacture pantaloons, drawers or overalls provided with a triangular gore composed of a series of spiral wire springs, held in puckered tubes and arranged in a close group at the top followed by puckered spaces, separated by two spiral wire springs substantially as and for the purposes set forth.\nWhat was claimed to be the new invention was not the spiral metal springs, as described, but, 1st, as a new article of manufacture, pantaloons, drawers and overalls provided at their sides with straps composed of a series of well known spiral springs arranged lengthwise of the waistband and supported by intermediate loops; and,\n2nd, as a new article of manufacture, pantaloons, drawers or overalls provided with a triangular gore composed of a series of the well known spiral metal springs arranged, &c., &c.\nFor the above, as new inventions, letters patent were granted. Whether such letters patent, if granted in this Dominion, could be held to be valid is not now the question. 1 refer to the specifications accompanying the application for these letters patent merely to point out the plaintiff Florsheim\u2019s disclaimer of elastic gore pieces composed of spirally coiled wire springs held in puckered tubes between two layers of covering material being a new invention. On the 10th March, 1879, the above named Gustav Schilling and the plaintiff Florsheim jointly applied for, and subsequently, on the 25th November, 1879, obtained, letters patent in the United States, to be granted to them for what they claimed to be a new and useful improvement in corsets.\nIn the specifications accompanying the application, and forming part of the letters patent, the applicants, describing their invention, say:\nThe object of our improvement is the production of a corset specially adapted for use in warm weather and in warm rooms and under circumstances of work or exercise which will produce free perspiration, and to that end we have now adopted a construction and an arrangement of parts which will ensure a constant, uniform, accurate fit of the corset to the wearer under all changes of her position, without chafing or annoying in any part, and will be cool, comfortable and exceedingly durable. To that end India-rubber elastic portions are dispensed with, as these soon loose their elasticity and durability in the presence of animal heat and perspiration, and instead of such, metallic spiral springs encased in puckered cloth tubes are used. For this same purpose the corset instead of being made in two parts as usual, is made practically of a single part, the central back portion being made of the elastic material above referred to inserted in the form of a piece with substantially parallel sides so as to give an equal degree of elasticity to all parts of the corset. For the same purpose, also, gores of the elastic material above referred to are inserted at the sides where an annoying pressure is ordinarily given by corsets to the hip bones; and shoulder straps of the same elastic material are provided in order to hold the corset, which should not fit tightly in any part, from a tendency to slip down under some circumstances.\nThe novelty of our invention consists in the application (to a corset constructed substantially as described) of shoulder straps composed of wire springs in puckered tubes substantially as described, and of the entire corset as a new article of manufacture, having the elastic back, hip gores and shoulder straps, all as more fully hereinafter described.\nAfter referring to certain drawings accompanying the specifications, they say:\nWe are aware that it is not original with us to use metallic wire coiled springs inclosed in cloth tubes in corsets, or to make a corset practically in one piece by inserting an elastic portion in the back, or to use elastic gores in corsets at the hips, or to provide corsets with partially elastic shoulder straps, and we disclaim all such inventions broadly.\nAfter this disclaimer I confess that I find a difficulty in seeing what remained to be patented as a new and useful improvement in corsets. The applicants, however, without defining precisely what they claimed to be novel, or claiming that they had obtained any new result by the combination of known materials, add:\nBut, as we believe that we have certain novelties in our corset for which we are entitled to letters patent, we claim as new and as our invention,\n1st. In combination with a corset the elastic shoulder straps composed of wire springs in puckered tubes throughout their entire length substantially as described and shewn; and\n2nd. As a new article of manufacture the corset described and shewn having an elastic back piece, elastic hip gores, and elastic shoulder straps, all constructed and arranged substantially as specified.\nThat is to say, they claim 1st. as a patentable novelty the application, throughout the entire length of the shoulder strap of a corset, of wire springs in puckered tubes, the use of which, partially in shoulder straps, was well known; and, 2ndly., they claim as novel the corset just as it was shewn in the drawing and model accompanying and forming part of the specifications, having elastic pieces made of well known materials producing well known effects, arranged in the particular manner shewn in such drawings and model. Now, in the model of the corset which accompanied the specifications, a copy or drawing of which, certified by the Commissioner of Patents of the United States, has been produced in evidence, is shewn the elastic back piece or strip used in the corset in the lower end of which (a copy or drawing of which on an enlarged scale is filed) the metallic wire coiled springs are shown to be inserted in one continuous coil. On the part of the plaintiffs it was contended, that, although the continuous coil of wire springs did so appear, yet that it did not form part of what was specifically patented by the letters patent; and the reason given was, that the continuity of the coil was, as was alleged, the invention of Florsheim, whereas the other matters were the joint invention of Schilling and Florsheim, and that they could not be united in the same letters patent. But whether the continuous coil of wire springs as part of the corset which was the patented article having an elastic back piece in which the continuous coil is shewn, was or not covered by the letters patent, or whether it was intentionally omitted for the reason suggested, appears to me to be of no importance; for the article which was patented, being a corset having the elastic back piece, as shewn in the drawings, which elastic back piece contained the continuous coil, the use of which, whether in itself the subject of a patent or not, plainly appeared, the plaintiffs Florsheim and Schilling by their specifications proclaimed to the world, if not already well known, the use of the continuous coil coil than twelve months before the plaintiff Florsheim applied for the letters patent of the 29th April, 1881.\nFrom these extracts from the above several letters patent, I think it very plainly appears, that the defendants have maintained their contention, that the letters patent of the 29th April, 1881, cover more than the patentee Florsheim had a right to claim as new, and that the several matters professed to be patented were known and used by others before the alleged invention thereof by the plaintiff Florsheim, and that letters patent for the several matters covered by the letters patent of April, 1881, or at least some of such matters, were in existence in other countries more than twelve months prior to Florsheim\u2019s application for such letters patent. In fact, those letters patent have been, in my opinion, well described as having been granted for divers matters for which, whether patentable novelties or not, letters patent had been granted, some to certain parties in Great Britain for some of the matters, and others to other parties in the United States, of whom the plaintiff Florsheim himself was one, for other such matters.\nThe letters patent of the 29th of April, 1881, profess to grant to the plaintiff Florsheim the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using, and vending to others to be used:\u2014\n1st An elastic gore, gusset or section, for wearing apparel, composed of a covering material having tubes; spiral metal springs inclosed by such tubes and not extending to the edges of the covering material, and stayed at their ends by such covering material, and inelastic margins outside of the springs.\n2nd. An elastic gore, gusset or section of the character described, the springs arranged in groups and made of a continuous length of coiled wire.\n3rd. An elastic gore, gusset or section of the character described, the metal fastenings, C, extending across the ends of the tubes between the thicknesses of the covering material.\nThe metal springs as used in the elastic gore or gusset, first and thirdly above described, are not continuous. The elastic gore secondly described differs from that first described only in the insertion in the tubes of a continuous coil or continuous coils of wire springs.\nAnd that thirdly above described differs from that first described only in the insertion of a wire fastening extending across the ends of the tubes, which in the elastic gore first described have no such fastening.\nNow, the elastic gore or gusset as first above described, the exclusive right or privilege of making and using which, and vending to others to be used, the letters patent purport to grant to the plaintiff Florsheim, is covered by the descriptions taken together as contained in the specifications forming part of the above English letters patent of 1815, 1866, and 1862, and as also covered by the descriptions as contained in the specifications forming part of the above letters patent to Schilling of the 22nd of April and the 5th of August l879; and by the description contained in the specifications accompanying the above recited application of the 4th March, 1879. In fact, a great part of what is covered by the first of the above paragraphs, taken from the letters patent of the 29th, April, 1881, is wholly disclaimed as being novel by the plaintiff Florsheim himself in the specifications accompanying this application.\nAs to the elastic gore described in the second of the above paragraphs taken from the letters patent of the 29th of April, 1881, the only novelty there suggested is the use of a continuous coil of wire springs in lieu of the wire springs mentioned in the first paragraph which were not continuous. As to this I am of opinion that the substitution of continuous wire springs for non\u2011continuous wire springs, there being no new result or special benefit attributed to the continuity merely, is not a patentable novelty. The use of continuous springs was known in 1866 as appears by the above recited letters patent granted in that year, and that the use of continuous wive springs for the same precise purpose had been known for more than twelve months prior to the plaintiff Florsheim\u2019s application for the letters patent of the 29th April, 1881, is apparent from the drawings and model of the corset described in the specifications, forming part of the United States letters patent which were granted to the plaintiffs Florsheim and Schilling on the 25th of November, 1879, upon their application of the 10th March, 1879.\nIn like manner, as to the insertion of a wire passed through the ends of non-continuous wire springs, as described in the third of the above paragraphs, taken from the Letters Patent of the 29th April, 1881, that does not appear to me to be a fit subject of Letters Patent as for an invention. No special benefit or novel result is attributed to this insertion of the wire. In fact upon the argument the whole benefits relied upon as supporting the Letters Patent were the superiority which metal springs had over India-rubber as an elastic material, and the manner of attaching the gore or gusset containing the springs, by its edges or margins, to the fabric in which the gore or gusset was to be inserted. Now, as to the superiority of wire springs over India-rubber, that was well known as early as 1815, and the substitution of wire springs for India-rubber was disclaimed by the plaintiff Florsheim as being novel, or as being his invention, in the specifications accompanying and made part of the above recited Letters Patent, granted to him and Schilling on the 25th November, 1879, and the 17th February, 1880, and such substitution of metal springs for India-rubber is not now claimed to be novel, or to be part of the invention for which the plaintiff Florsheim applied for the Letters Patent now under consideration; and as to the method pointed out in the specifications accompanying the Letters Patent of April, 1881, of attaching the gore or gusset containing the wire springs by the edges or margins to the fabric to which it is to be attached, that method sufficiently clearly appears to be substantially shewn in the description contained in the specifications accompanying the above recited English patents of 1815 and 1866 and in those accompanying the United States Letters Patent to Schilling of the 22nd April, 1879.\nIn fine, for the avoidance of the Letters Patent now under consideration, it is sufficient to say that a part, indeed, as it appears to me, almost the whole, if not the whole of the articles thereby patented as novelties were known and in use lor more than twelve months prior to the plaintiff Florsheim\u2019s application for the Letters Patent granted to him in April, 1881. The appeal, therefore, should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Akers.\nSolicitors for respondents: Mowat, MacLennan, Downey & Biggar.\n[1] 12 Ont.

Act sec. 91, subsec. 24\u2014Sec. 92, subsec. 5\u2014Secs. 109, 117.\nThe lands within the boundary of Ontario in which the claims or rights of occupancy of the Indians were surrendered or became extinguished by the Dominion Treaty of 1873, known as the North West Angle Treaty, No. 3, form part of the public domain of Ontario and are public lands belonging to Ontario by virtue of the provisions of the British North America Act[1].\nOnly lands specifically set apart and reserved for the use of the Indians are \u201clands reserved for Indians\u201d within the meaning of sec. 91, item 24 of the British North America Act[2]Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe judgment of Boyd C. in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario[3] and of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4] affirmed. Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting,\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario4, affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division3, which restrained the defendants from cutting timber on lands in Ontario claimed to be public lands of the Province.\nThis was an action by Her Majesty on the information of the Attorney General for the Province of Ontario against the St. Catharines Milling and Lumber Co. to prevent them from cutting and carrying away timber on lands in Ontario, lying south of Wabigoon Lake in the District of Algoma. It was claimed by the Attorney General that the lands in question were public lands of the Province, and that the defendants were trespassers and wrongdoers in cutting such timber.\nThe defendants justified under a license from the Dominion Government and pleaded the following special defence:\n7. \u201cThe defendants say that the tract of land in question, together with the growing timber thereon, was, with other lands in the said district or territory, until recently claimed by the tribes of Indians who inhabited that part of the Dominion of Canada, and that the claims of such tribes of Indians have always been recognized, acknowledged, admitted and acquiesced in by the various Governments of Canada and Ontario, and by the crown, and that such Indian claims are, as to the lands in question herein, paramount to the claim of the Province of Ontario, or of the crown as represented by the Government of Ontario, and that the Government of the Dominion of Canada, in consideration of a large expenditure of money made for the benefit of the said Indian tribes, and of payments made to them from time to time, and for divers other considerations, have acquired the said Indian title to large tracts of lands in the said territory, including the lands in question in this action, and the timber thereon, and by reason of the acquisition of the said Indian title, as well as by reason of the inherent right of the crown, as represented by the Government of Canada, the Dominion of Canada, and not the Province of Ontario, has the right to deal with the said timber lands, and at the time of granting the said leave and license had and still have full power and authority to confer upon the defendants the rights, powers and privileges claimed by them, as aforesaid, under which the said pine timber was cut.\u201d\nThe lands in question formed a portion of the territory declared, by what is known as the \u201cBoundary Award,\u201d to be geographically within the limits of the Province of Ontario, and in the year 1873 they were surrendered by the Indians to the Government of Canada by virtue of a treaty known as the North West Angle Treaty No. 3.\nThe question to be decided was whether under the provisions of the B.N.A. Act these lands belonged to the Province of Ontario or the Dominion.\nThe action was tried in the Chancery Division before Boyd C. who decided in favor of the Province, and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the decision of the Court of Appeal.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Creelman for the appellants.\nBefore discussing this case on the basis of the B.N.A. Act it is proposed to show, historically, that the Indians had a title to this land which never passed to the Province.\nAll this country was once occupied by Indian tribes. On its discovery by Europeans the discoverers acquired a right of property in the soil provided that discovery was followed by possession. See Sir Travers Twiss Law of Nations ch. headed \u201cRight of Acquisition,\u201d[5], as to the contest between England and the United States with reference to the mouth of the Columbia.\nIn case of conquest the only test as to the title of the conqueror is found in the course of dealing which he himself has prescribed. When he adopts a system that will ripen into law he settles the principle on which the conquered are to be treated.\nIn Canada, from the earliest times, it has been recognized that the title to the soil was in the Indians, and the title from them has been acquired, not by conquest, but by purchase.\nIn 1763 a royal proclamation was issued dividing the British possessions in America into separate governments and defining the powers of each. The rights of the Indians are conserved therein as the following extract will show:\u2014\nAnd whereas it is Just and Reasonable and Essential to Our Interests and the Security of Our Colonies that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with whom we are connected and who live under Our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds, We do therefore with the Advice of Our Privy Council declare it to be Our Royal Will and Pleasure that no Governor or Commander-in-Chief in any of Our Colonies of Quebec, East Florida or West Florida, do presume upon any pretence whatever to grant warrants of Survey or pass any Patents for Lands beyond the bounds of their respective Governments as described in their Commissions; as also that no Governor or Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief of any of Our other Colonies or Plantations in America do presume for the present, and until Our further pleasure be known, to grant warrants of Survey, or pass Patents for any Lands beyond the head or sources of any of the Rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the West and North-west, or upon any lands whatever, which not having been ceded to or purchased by Us as aforesaid, and reserved to the said Indians or any of them.\nAnd we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our Sovereignty, protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the land and territories not included within the limits of our said three new Governments, or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company; as also all the land and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved, without our especial leave or license for that purpose first obtained.\nAnd we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have either wilfully or in- advertently seated themselves upon any lands within the countries above described, or upon any other lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forth-with to remove themselves from such settlements.\n\u201cAnd whereas great frauds and abuses have been committed in the purchasing lands of the Indians, to the great prejudice of our interests, and to the great dissatisfaction of the said Indians, in order therefore to prevent such irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our Justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, we do, with the advice of our Privy Council, strictly enjoin and require, that no private person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settlement; but if at any time any of the said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands, the same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, in some public meeting or assembly of the said Indians to be held for that purpose by the Governor or Commander\u2011in-Chief of our colony respectively within which they shall lie; and in case they shall lie within the limits of any proprietaries conformable to such directions and instructions as we or they think proper to give for that purpose. And we do, by the advice of our Privy Council, declare and enjoin, that the trade with the said Indians shall be free and open to all our subjects whatever, provided that every person who may incline to trade with the said Indians do take out a license for carrying on such trade from the Governor or Commander\u2011in\u2011Chief of any of our colonies respectively where such person shall reside, and also give security to observe such regulations as we shall at any time think fit, by ourselves or commissaries to be appointed for this purpose, to direct and appoint for the benefit of the said trade; and we do hereby authorize, enjoin and require the Governors and Commanders\u2011in\u2011Chief of all our Colonies respectively, as well as those under our immediate government, as those under the government and direction of proprietaries, to grant such licenses without fee or reward, taking especial care to insert therein a condition that such license shall be void, and the security forfeited, in case the person to whom the same is granted shall refuse or neglect to observe such regulations as we shall think proper to prescribe as aforesaid.\u201d\nWilliam Penn was not the first to acquire Indian lands by purchase. He came to America in 1682 and made his treaty in 1683. Long before that settlements had been made in New York, first by the Dutch, next by the English, and then by the Swedes in 1674, and during ail that period the right to the land was held to be determined by the earlier acquisition of the Indian title. See Hazard\u2019s Annals of Penn.[6]\nPenn made his great treaty with the Indians in 1683. There is no written record of it in existence and no evidence as to its exact nature. But there is no doubt that Penn always recognized the Indians as owners of the soil and purchased lands from them.\nTo give two instances out of many. Penn in his own person made a purchase from the Indians of a considerable quantity of land lying between the Neshaminy and Pennepact Creek. The deed of sale is dated the 23rd June, 1683, and is of record; as is also another deed dated the 14th July following, for lands lying between the Schuylkill and Chester river. And see Hazard[7].\nThe following extracts and references will show that the same system was pursued in different States of the Union.\nPennsylvania\u2014Graham\u2019s history of the United States[8]. After relating the various circumstances connected with the celebrated treaty made between William Penn and the Indians in 1682, the author goes on to say:\u2014\n\u201cThe example of that equitable consideration of the rights of the native owners of the soil, which has been supposed to have originated with him, was first exhibited by the planters of New England, whose deeds of conveyance from the Indians were earlier by half a century than his, and was successively repeated by the planters of Maryland, Carolina, New York and New Jersey, before the province of Pennsylvania had a name,\u201d\nAnd see Hepworth Dixon\u2019s life of William Penn[9]; Memoirs of the Hist. Soc. of Penn.[10]; Broadhead\u2019s Hist. State N.Y.[11]\nIn Hazard\u2019s An.[12] will be found the documents connected with Penn\u2019s dealings with the Indians.\nNew England\u2014Neal\u2019s History of New England, London, 1720[13]:\u2014\u201cThe planters, notwithstanding the patent which they had for the country from the crown of England, fairly purchased of the natives the several tracts of land which they afterwards possessed.

New England[15].\u201d\nConnecticut\u2014Broadhead\u2019s History of the State of New York[16]:\u2014\u201cIt was therefore thought expedient that to their existing rights by discovery, and exclusive visitation, should be added the more definite title by pur- chase from the aborigines.\u201d And see Conn.

It was now determined to superadd a higher title by purchase from the aborigines.\u201d Smith\u2019s Hist.

We have not the precise words of this grant but we have all the conditions attached to it[34]. After providing against alienation by the Indians, except among themselves, it concludes as follows:\n\u201cProvided always, that if at anytime the said Chiefs, Warriors, Women and people of the said Six Nations, should be inclined to dispose of and surrender their use and interest in the said district or territory, or any part thereof, the same shall be purchased for us, our heirs and successors, at some public meeting or assembly of the Chiefs, Warriors, and People of the said Six Nations, to be holden for that purpose by the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor or person administering our Government in our Province of Upper Canada.\u201d\nIn 1796 the Six Nation Indians, then resident in Canada, by treaty with the Government of the United States ceded their lands in New York for valuable consideration. On 1798 the Mohawks and in 1802 the Seneca Nation did the same. In 1838 the Seneca Nation by Indenture conveyed their reserved lands in New York to the Assignees of Massachusetts. The Treaty will be found in the United States Statutes at large[35] Mention may be made in this connection of the Lake Superior and Lake Huron Treaties, in 1850, by which Canada purchased from the Ojibbeways for valuable consideration nearly all their lands.\nIn the Province of Quebec the French appear to have dealt with the Indians as a conquered people, and while they made them large grants their lands do not seem to have been acquired by purchase. The same principle prevailed in the Maritime Provinces. We are not obliged, however, to account for Ontario occupying a position different, in this respect, from that of the other Provinces. The B.N.A. Act simply dealt with the condition of affairs as it found them at the time it was passed.\nIn Nova Scotia and New Brunswick all questions with regard to Indians were well defined and nothing was supposed to be disturbed by the act of confederation.\nThe other Provinces not being concerned in the original formation of the Dominion this question cannot, so far as they are concerned, be discussed on the basis of the British North America Act.\nThe following statutes may be referred to as dealing with the matters in question here: 2 Vic. ch. 15, (U.C.); 12 Vic. ch. 9 (Can.): 13-14 Vic. ch. 14 (Can.); C.S.C. ch. 9; C.S.L.C. ch. 14; 27\u201128 Vic. ch. 68 (Can.) And the following cases are cited as decisions on the statutes. The Queen v. Strong[36]; Regina v. Baby[37]; Totten v. Watson[38]; Vanvleck v. Stewart[39]; and Bown v. West[40]; and as American authorities on the question of the Indian title see Kent\u2019s Com. Title by Discovery[41]; Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia[42]; Worcester v. State of Georgia[43]; Ogden v. Lee[44]; Godfrey v. Beardsley[45]; and Gaines v. Nicholson[46].\nIn all the treaties mentioned the word \u201ccede\u201d is used; this is a term usually employed in cases of transfers of land between different States. The Indians are dealt with as quasi-independent nations. The reason for this is pointed out in the case of the Cherokee Nation v. Georgia; see also Turner v. American Baptist Union[47].\nIt is not contended that item 24, section 91, of the British North America Act vests these lands in the Dominion, any more than that item 5 of section 92 vests them in the Province. What is contended is that section 92 must be read in conjunction with section 108 as to public works, section 109 as to lands, &c., in the Provinces, and section 117 as to mines and minerals, in order to get at the meaning of the act with respect to the question in this case.\nBy the North-West Angle Treaty, in 1873, the Dominion Government granted to the Indians certain hunting and fishing privileges, which would be inoperative if the contention of Ontario in this case is correct\nIt is claimed that the land always belonged to the Province, but until this treaty was made they could exercise no control over it. Only the Dominion could deal with it and the Governor\u2011General alone could make a treaty for its surrender. And the land was in a peculiar position in other respects. No white man could go upon it and deal with the Indians. This was made a criminal offence in 1841, and the Dominion Parliament was the only authority by which that law could be repealed. Can it be supposed then, that this territory passed to the Province under the word \u201clands\u201d in the British North America Act?\nThe lands intended to be under the control of the local authorities are lands which are valuable assets. It might be admitted that if the crown had any estate in these lands it would be in the right of the Province under the authority of Mercer v. Attorney-General for Ontario[48]; but there was no estate. The Indians had a right to occupy the land, to cut the timber and to claim the mines and minerals found on the land, and the land descended to their children; the only restriction upon their title was as to alienation; that might be called a limited or base fee. And was there any thing more vested in the crown than a mere right to the land when the Indian title was extinguished?\nAs to escheat see Stephens Black.[49]; Burgess v. Wheate[50]; 2 Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise Digest[51]; Mercer v. Attorney General for Ontario[52].\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Mills for the respondents.\nIn considering the argument of the appellants it must be clearly kept in mind that the authorities in the United States relied upon by the appellants are authorities dealing with the rights of the Indians in regard to lands specially reserved to them by treaties ratified and sanctioned by the United States. These authorities deal with the rights of the Indians as vested in them under and by virtue of these treaties.\nThe various treaties will be found in vol. 7 United States Statutes at Large. I more particularly refer to page 44.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants lay stress upon the negotiations by the Six Nation Indians with the United States after they came to Canada. These negotiations related to lands set apart to those Indians on the 11th November, 1794. See Ogden v. Lee[53]. The treaty in question is there set out, and so in regard to the other cases relied upon by the appellants.\nThere are four cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States which have a direct bearing upon the question in controversy. Nearly all, if not all other cases, are determined upon the particular terms of the various treaties These four cases decided by the Supreme Court are very applicable to the case in question, and are directly opposed to the contention of the appellant.\nThe first case, Fletcher v. Peck[54], is strongly in point. In that case prior to any surrender by the Indians the State had granted a patent. A surrender was obtained from the Indians in favor of the United States. It was contended that at the time of the patent the title was in the Indians, and that no title passed by the patent granted by the State. The court, however, held that the title to the soil was in the State, the right existing in the Indians being one merely of occupancy\u2014that the surrender merely operated as an extinguishment and for the benefit of the legal estate. This case was decided in 1810.\nIn 1815 the case of Meigs v. McClung[55] was decided. The facts in this case were a grant by the State prior to surrender and a subsequent grant from the United States, claiming title by virtue of a surrender from the Indians. The court held that the right in the Indians was merely one of occupancy, and that the surrender merely operated as an extinguishment of this right enuring to the benefit of the fee.\nJohnson v. McIntosh[56] is a leading case in the United States. In this case all the various treaties and statutes are referred to and the question exhaustively dealt with. [The learned counsel read extracts from this case showing that the Indian title, so-called, was merely one of occupancy.\nIn Clarke v. Smith[57], the same views are affirmed.\n[The learned counsel then referred to the various cases cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel pointing out and contending that each case was decided upon the particular treaty and could have no application to the case in question]\nThe cases in our own courts are also against the contention of the appellants. In Doe d Jackson v. Wilkes[58] it was held that a patent by the crown of an Indian reserve passed to the plaintiff.\nIn Bown v. West[59] and Doe d Sheldon v. Ramsay[60] the court held that the Indians had no title.\nReg. v. Baby[61] has been cited in support of the appellants\u2019 argument. That case when looked at will be found to be very different from what is contended for. So in Totten v. Watson[62].\nVanvleck v. Stewart[63] had reference to a special reservation set apart for the benefit of the Indians. In this case it was held that the Indians had a beneficial right in the lands reserved, and a right to the timber cut from these lands.\nChurch v. Fenton[64] related to the lands specially reserved for the benefit of the Indians. In November, 1786, a surrender had been obtained and by the terms of the surrender a special reserve was set apart for the benefit of the Indians. By this treaty it was stipulated that in the event of the Indians subsequently desiring to surrender the reserved lands so specially set apart the crown would sell them for the benefit of the Indians. The special reserve was surrendered in 1854, and the contest in Church v. Fenton arose in regard to these particular lands.\nThere are no other authorities bearing on the point.\nReference to the mode of dealing with the Indians in the United States does not warrant the contention of the appellants. For instance, in 1635 one Roger Williams was banished from Massachusetts for maintaining that the title to Indian lands was not in the King but in the natives. In 1632 the Dutch complained that their lands in New York, which they held by purchase from the Indians, had been taken from them. Counsel\u2019s opinion was that the Indians could pass no title to the lands.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants refers to the Articles of Capitulation and to the Proclamation of 1763. It is said that this proclamation is the charter of the Indians.\nAssuming this charter to be the foundation of their title what then becomes of their original title to the lands? If the Indian title is based upon a right acquired from the crown by virtue of this proclamation, then it must be the starting point of their title, and they can have no higher rights than those given to them by the proclamation in question.\nThe proclamation assumes the title to be in the crown and not in the Indians. By this proclamation the crown gives power to the Governors to grant lands east of a certain line. If the Indian title existed, how could they exercise this right? What becomes of the titles granted east of the line in question? The crown reserves for the present the lands west of the line. If the Indians accept title under this proclamation, then they accept a reservation during the pleasure of the crown. Subsequently by the statute, passed in 1774, the boundaries of the Province of Quebec are extended so as to embrace the lands in controversy, and the pro- clamation is annulled by the very terms of the act. If, therefore, this proclamation is the foundation of the Indian title, they accept it merely as an act of bounty from the crown, with the right to the crown to alter or annul it.\nThe effect of this proclamation is fully referred to in the case of Fletcher v. Peck[65] hereinbefore referred to, and in that particular case it was held that the extension of the territory forming the State of Georgia withdrew it from the operation of the proclamation of 1763.\nIf the Supreme Court of the United States is correct in holding that the effect of extending the jurisdiction of the Governor of Georgia to grant patents for lands reserved by the proclamation of 1763 was an annulling of that proclamation, so far as the extended area is concerned, surely an express statute has a similar effect. It is, therefore, submitted that the contention of the appellants is erroneous.\nThere is no instance on record where the courts have recognized the Indian title, or gone behind a grant from the crown to inquire whether or not an Indian title was well founded.\nWe next come to the effect of the confederation act. The learned counsel for the appellants have striven to argue that under the statute the lands in question are vested in the Dominion.\nIn order to arrive at the true meaning of the British North America Act the constitution of each of the provinces at the time of confederation must be considered. In the Province of Quebec no surrenders have ever been obtained from the Indians. If the contention of the appellants is correct, then the grants for nearly the whole of that province are of no effect. Such contention, however, has never been put forward.\nSection 91 item 24 of the British North America Act clearly refers to lands which have been specially reserved. Take the case of surrender of lands in Upper and Lower Canada prior to confederation. At the time of confederation would not the title to these lands be vested in the old provinces of Upper and Lower Canada? What becomes of these lands after confederation? Surely under the British North America Act they would be vested in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec respectively.\nSection 108 of the B.N.A. Act refers to the 3rd schedule; that schedule says nothing about the Indian reserves.\n[The learned counsel here referred to the various statutes of the different Provinces prior to confederation, contending that the confederation act plainly referred to reserves specially set apart under the various statutes]\nThen, since confederation the Dominion Parliament has clearly recognized such to be the case. For instance, in the statute of 1868, again in the statute of 1869, and so in the statute relating to British Columbia.\n[Here counsel refer to various statutes since confederation relating to the admittance of British Columbia into the Union, and the various statutes of the Dominion relating to Indians]\nIt is submitted that the extent of the Indian title is a mere right of occupancy, a mere right of hunting, &c., which can only be dealt with for the purpose of extinction. The utmost that can be contended is, that the fee is vested in the Province subject to the right of occupancy in the Indians.\n[Counsel read extracts from the judgments of the Chancellor and the judges in the Court of Appeal in support of their contention]\nThere are lands in Ontario which have never been surrendered and which are dealt with by the Crown Lands Department.\nA further point relied upon by the respondents is, that the contention now put forward by the appellants could not be put forward on the part of the Dominion without operating as a fraud on the rights of the Province of Ontario.\nIn the year 1871 the Dominion approached the Province of Ontario with the view to arranging for a provisional boundary pending the assignment of the true boundary. Negotiations between the Dominion and the Province of Ontario lay in abeyance until the Dominion obtained a surrender of the Indian title. Subsequently the Dominion renewed negotiations, pointing out that by virtue of this surrender the Indian title had become extinguished. An agreement was then entered into whereby the Dominion were to have a full right to grant patents to the lands west of the Provincial boundary, and the Province to have the right to grant patents to the lands east of this boundary, and by the agreement the Dominion and the Province respectively agreed to ratify each others acts and to confirm the patents in the event of the true boundary being determined to be east or west of the provisional line.\nProceedings were taken to have the true boundary ascertained and after eight years the contention was determined in favor of the Province.\nNotwithstanding this agreement, and the fact that for eight years the Province and the Dominion have been endeavouring to have the boundary settled, it is contended by the present appellants that all the time no matter what the courts might hold in regard to the true boundary, the lands were vested in the Dominion.\nIt is said that by the treaty in question of 1873 the Dominion obtained a title to the lands in dispute. The Dominion, however, treated this as operating as an extinguishment of the Indian title for the benefit of the Province in the event of its appearing the boundary of the Province was west of the lands in question, and it is submitted the Dominion could not now successfully contend that this surrender had other or further effect after the agreement entered into by the Province of Ontario.\nAnother point to be considered is, supposing the Indians had said to Governor Morris \u201cWe will not make a treaty with you,\u201d if the appellants\u2019 contentions are correct for all time to come these vast territories would have been withdrawn from settlement.\nTo maintain their position the appellants must assume that the Indians have a regular form of government, whereas nothing is more clear than that they have no government and no organization, and cannot be regarded as a nation capable of holding lands[66].\nWashburn on Real Property[67], and Story on The Constitution[68] were also referred to.\nIt is also contended that the crown had never recognized the aboriginal inhabitants of a country who were without any settled government as the proprietors of the soil. This was not only the rule uniformly acted upon by the Sovereigns of England, but it was a part of the common law of Europe. Answers of James I. and his Lords of Trade to the States\u2019 General[69]; Chalmer\u2019s Annals of the Colonies[70]; Vattel\u2019s Law of Nations[71]; see also various charters of Government and grants of land made by the Sovereign of England from 1585 to 1758 without reference to Indian occupation.\nAt the time of the discovery of America, and long after, it was an accepted rule that heathen and infidel nations were perpetual enemies, and that the Christian prince or people first discovering and taking possession of the country became its absolute proprietor, and could deal with the lands as such.\nCalvin\u2019s Case[72]; Butts v. Penny[73]; Gelly v. Cleve cited in Chamberlain v. Harvey[74]; East India Co. v. Sandy\u2019s[75]; The Slave Grace[76].\nIt is a rule of the common law that property is the creature of the law and only continues to exist while the law that creates and regulates it subsists. The Indians had no rules or regulations which could be considered laws.\nSt. John\u2019s argument on this subject and the authorities cited in The King v. John Hampden[77].\nParkman\u2019s War of Pontiac vol. 1; Paley\u2019s Moral Philosophy[78]; Bentham\u2019s Theory of Legislation[79]; Locke on Government[80].\nNo title beyond that of occupancy was ever recognized by the crown as being in the Indians, and this recognition was based upon public policy and not upon any legal right in the aboriginal inhabitants.\nOpinion of John Holt and others.

Mundy[88].\nThe King had no power to prevent the sale of lands by any proprietor. The reservation by the proclamation of 1763, for the present, of the lands west of a certain line, rests upon the King\u2019s ownership of the lands. It was an act arising out of his proprietary rights. And in no case did he undertake to deal with the Indians when he had parted with the fee. Penn dealt with the Indians of Pennsylvania, and so did the proprietors and corporators in other proprietary and charter governments.\nEntick\u2019s Hist. of Late War[89].\nYoung\u2019s Chronicles of New England[90]; Proud\u2019s History of Pennsylvania; Murdock\u2019s History of Nova Scotia.\nMcCarthy Q.C. in reply.\nThe decision of the Privy Council in the boundary case has never been adopted by act of Parliament and has not the force of law. It is claimed that it estops us from claiming this land, but even if it is binding it only decided that the land was, territorially, a part of Ontario. The question of title was not raised in that case.\nThe question to be decided in this case is: Had the Indians any title, and if they had was it of so limited a character that the crown had an estate in the land consistent therewith.\n[The learned counsel took up the American cases referred to by the counsel for the respondent, showing how in his opinion they failed to support the argument founded on them]\nThe case of Mitchell v. The United Stales[91] brings up the questions involved in this appeal more nearly than any I have found. In that case it was said that purchases from the Indians have universally been held good. Before Mitchell died the Indians had ceded to the crown of Great Britain, and the land was afterwards transferred to the crown of Spain, and finally to the United States. The court said if these facts were true the prior title must prevail.\nIt cannot be said that the Quebec Act of 1784 annulled the proclamation of 1763. The object of that act was to do away with the British, and restore the French, law, but it did not attempt to change the mode of dealing with the Indians.\nThe following cases may be referred to as dealing with this proclamation. Campbell v. Hall[92] referred to in Mitchell v. The United States; Sims v. Irvine[93]; Johnson v. Mcintosh[94]; and Worcester v. State of Georgia[95].\nNow, the question remains whether, the Indians having had the enjoyment of the lands without a right of interference in any body, there was any right or title in the crown. If so, what is the estate of the crown? Does it depend on the Indians becoming extinct? It is laid down by the Privy Council that an escheat is not an estate, and if not, how could it pass under the British North America Act?\nIf this property is under the control of the Dominion they alone can deal with it. But what duty rests on the Dominion to buy the land for the benefit of Ontario?\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion, that all ungranted lands in the province of Ontario belong to the crown as part of the public domain, subject to the Indian right of occupancy in cases in which the same has not been lawfully extinguished, and when such right of occupancy has been lawfully extinguished absolutely to the crown, and as a consequence to the province of Ontario. I think the crown owns the soil of all the unpatented lands, the Indians possessing only the right of occupancy, and the crown possessing the legal title subject to that occupancy, with the absolute exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title either by conquest or by purchase; that, as was said by Mr. Justice Story[96].\nIt is to be deemed a right exclusively belonging to the Government in its sovereign capacity to extinguish the Indian title and to perfect its own dominion over the soil and dispose of it according to its own good pleasure. * * The crown has the right to grant the soil while yet in possession of the Indians, subject, however, to their right of occupancy.\nThat the title to lands where the Indian title has not been extinguished is in the crown, would seem to be clearly indicated by Dominion legislation since confederation. See 31 Vic. ch. 42; 33 Vic. ch. 3; 43 Vic. ch. 36.\nI agree that the whole course of legislation in all the provinces before, and in the Dominion since, confederation attaches a well understood and distinct meaning to the words \u201cIndian reserves or lands reserved for the Indians,\u201d and which cover only lands specifically appropriated or reserved in the Indian territories, or out of the public lands, and I entirely agree with the learned Chancellor that the words \u201clands reserved for Indians,\u201d were used in the B.N. A. Act in the same sense with reference to lands specifically set apart and reserved for the exclusive use of the Indians. In no sense that I can understand can it be said that lands in which the Indian title has been wholly extinguished are lands reserved for the Indians.\nThe boundary of the territory in the north west angle being established, and the lands in question found to be within the Province of Ontario, they are necessarily, territorially, a part of Ontario, and the ungranted portion of such lands not specifically reserved for the Indians, though unsurrendered and therefore subject to the Indian title, forms part of the public domain of Ontario, and they are consequently public lands belonging to Ontario, and as such pass under the British North America Act to Ontario, under and by virtue of sub-sec. 5 of sec. 92 and sec. 109 as to lands, mines, minerals and royalties, and sec. 117, by which the Provinces are to retain all their property not otherwise disposed of by that act, subject to the right of the Dominion to assume any lands or public property for fortifications, etc., and therefore, under the British North America Act, the Province of Ontario has a clear title to all unpatented lands within its boundaries as part of the Provincial public property, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and absolute when the Indian right of occupancy is extinguished.\nI am therefore of opinion, that when the Dominion Government, in 1873 extinguished the Indian claim or title, its effect was, so far as the question now before us is concerned, simply to relieve the legal ownership of the land belonging to the Province from the burden, incumbrance, or however it may be designated, of the Indian title It therefore follows that the claim of the Dominion to authorize the cutting of timber on these lands cannot be supported, and the Province has a right to interfere and prevent their spoliation.\nThis case has been so fully and ably dealt with by the learned Chancellor, and I so entirely agree with the conclusions at which he has arrived, that 1 feel I can add nothing to what has been said by him. Many questions have been suggested during the argument of this case, and in some of the judgments of the court below, but I have, purposely, carefully avoided discussing, or expressing any opinion, on questions not immediately necessary for the decision of this case, leaving all such matters to be disposed of when they legitimately arise and become necessary for the determination of a pending controversy. STRONG J.\u2014By the report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the 23rd July, 1884, made upon a reference to it of the question of disputed boundaries between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and which report was adopted by Her Majesty and embodied in the Order in Council of the 11th August, 1884, the territory in which the lands now in question are included was determined to be comprised within the limits of the Province of Ontario. This decision of the Judicial Committee, whilst defining the political boundaries according to the contention of the last named province, does not, however, in any way bear upon the question here in controversy between the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario regarding the proprietorship of the lands now in dispute. The decision of the present appeal depends altogether upon the construction to be placed upon certain provisions of the British North America Act. By the 24th enumeration of section 91 of that act the power of legislation in respect of \u201cIndians and lands reserved for the Indians\u201d is conferred exclusively upon the parliament of Canada By section 109 of the same act,\nAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trust existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nBy sec. 92, enumeration 5, exclusive power of legislation is given to the provinces regarding\nthe management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province, and of the timber and wood thereon.\nThe contention of the appellants is, that the lands now in question, and which are embraced in the territory formerly in dispute between the Provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and which have been decided by the Judicial Committee to be within the boundaries of Ontario, were, at the time of confederation, lands which had not been surrendered by the Indians, and consequently come within the definition of \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d contained in sub section 21 of section 91, and are therefore not public lands vested in the province by the operation of section 109. The province, on the other hand, insists that these are not \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d within sub-section 24, and claims title to them under the provision of section 109 as public lands which at the date of confederation \u201cbelonged\u201d to the Province of Ontario.\nIt is obvious that these lands cannot be both public lands coming within the operation of section 109 and \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d and so subject to the exclusive legislative power of the parliament of Canada by force of the 24 sub-section of section 91. The \u201cpublic lands\u201d mentioned in section 109 are manifestly those respecting which the province has the right of exclusive legislation by section 92 sub-section. Then, these public lands referred to in sub-section and which include all the lands \u201cbelonging\u201d to the province, are clearly distinct from \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d since lands so reserved are by section 91 sub\u2011section 24 made exclusively subject to the legislative power of the Dominion. To hold that lands might be both public lands within section 109 and sub-section 5 of section 92, and \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d within sub-section 24 of section 91, would be to determine that the same lands were subject to the exclusive powers of two separate and distinct legislatures, which would be absurd[97]. This consideration alone is sufficient to dispose of any argument derived from the latter clause of section 109, saving trusts existing in respect of public lands within its operation. Moreover, the trusts thus preserved are manifestly of a different order from anything connected with lands reserved for Indians, for instance, those trusts subsisting in favour of persons who had contracted for the purchase of Crown Lands, but whose titles had not been perfected by grants. The word \u201ctrusts\u201d would not be an appropriate expression to apply to the relation between the crown and the Indians respecting the unceded lands of the latter. As will appear hereafter very clearly, such relationship is not in any sense that of trustee and cestui que trust, but rather one analogous to the feudal relationship of lord and tenant, or, in some aspects, to that one, so familiar in the Roman law, where the right of property is dismembered and divided between the proprietor and a usufructuary.\nIt will be convenient here to notice a point to which some importance has been attached in the courts below. It is said, that the British North America Act contains no clause vesting in the Dominion the ultimate property in lands reserved for the Indians over which an exclusive power of legislation is by section 91 conferred on the Dominion Parliament, and that consequently, even though the lands now in question should be held to come within the 24th enumeration of the last mentioned section, yet as they are not vested in the crown in right of the Dominion nothing passed by the lease or license under which the appellants claim title. The answer to this objection is, first, that as this is an information on behalf of the Province complaining of an intrusion upon Provincial lands, the question to be decided in the first instance is that as to the title of the Province. To support the information the respondent must establish that these lands were vested in the Province by the British North America Act, failing which the information must be dismissed, whether the lease or license granted by the Dominion to the appellants conferred a legal title or not. If, therefore, the respondent fails in making out the title of the Province, it is not essential that the appellants should be able to show that under some particular clause of the British North America Act, the lands of which I the locus in quo forms part were vested in the Dominion. I am of opinion, however, that the ultimate crown title in the lands described in sub-section 24 of section 91, whatever may be the true meaning of the terms employed (an inquiry yet to be entered upon), became, subject to the Indian title in the same, vested in the crown in right of the Dominion. The title and interest of the crown in the lands specified in sub-section 24 at the date of confederation belonged to it in the rights of the respective Provinces in which the lands were situated; for the reasons already given these lands were not vested in the new Provinces created by the confederation act; they must therefore have remained in the crown in some other right, which other right could only have been, and plainly was, that of the Dominion. For, having regard to the scheme by which the British North America Act carried out confederation, by first consolidating the four original Provinces into one body politic\u2014the Dominion\u2014and then re-distributing this Dominion into Provinces and appropriating certain specified property to these several Provinces, it follows that the residue of the property belonging to the crown in right of the Provinces before confederation not specifically appropriated by the appropriation clauses of the act, sections 109 and 117, to the newly created Provinces, must of necessity have remained in the crown, and it is reasonable to presume for the use and purposes of the Dominion. Next, inasmuch as all revenues, casual or otherwise, arising from the title and interest of the crown in \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d (whatever may upon subsequent consideration appear to be the proper meaning of that expression) are by the effect of section 1.02 allotted to the Dominion, this assignment of revenue to the Dominion, according to a well understood rule of construction, implies a vesting of the land and property from which the revenue is to arise. This last mentioned construction, which is analogous to that so familiar in construing wills by which a gift of rents and profits is held to be equivalent to a gift of the land itself, was referred to with approbation in Attorney General v. Mercer[98], though its application was excluded in that case for the reason that the right of escheat there was held to be expressly vested in the Provinces under section 109, which cannot be the case as regards \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d over which an exclusive power of legislation is conferred on the Dominion, whatever may appear as the result of further, consideration to be the proper meaning attributable to that expression.\nThe questions to be determined are therefore now restricted entirely to the construction to be placed on the words, \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d in sub-section 24 of section 91, and we are to bear in mind that whatever are the lands subjected by this description to the exclusive legislative power of the Dominion they cannot be lands belonging to the Province, since all these last mentioned lands are expressly subjected to the exclusive legislative powers of the Provinces. In construing this enactment we are not only entitled but bound to apply that well established rule which requires us, in placing a meaning upon descriptive terms and definitions contained in statutes, to have recourse to external aids derived from the surrounding circumstances and the history of the subject-matter dealt with, and to construe the enactment by the light derived from such sources, and so to put ourselves as far as possible in the position of the legislature whose language we have to expound. If this rule were rejected and the language of the statute were considered without such assistance from extrinsic facts, it is manifest that the task of interpretation would 3 degenerate into mere speculation and guess work.\nIt is argued here for the appellants, that these words \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d are to have attributed to them a meaning sufficiently comprehensive to include all lands in which the Indian title, always recognized by the crown of Great Britain, has not been extinguished or surrendered according to the well understood and established practice invariably observed by the Government from a comparatively remote period. The respondent, on the contrary, seeks to place a much narrower construction on these words and asks us to confine them to lands, first, which having been absolutely acquired by the crown had been re-appropriated for the use and residence of Indian tribes, and secondly, to lands which, on a surrender by Indian nations or tribes of their territories to the crown, had been excepted or reserved and retained by the Indians for their own residence and use as hunting grounds or otherwise. In order to ascertain whether it was the intention of Parliament by the use of these words \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d to describe comprehensively all lands in which the Indians retained any interest, and so to include unsurrendered lands generally, or whether it was intended to use the term in its restricted sense, as the respondent contends, as indicating only lands which had been expressly granted and appropriated by the crown to the use of Indians, or excepted or reserved by them for their own use out of some large tract surrendered by them to the crown, we must refer to historical accounts of the policy already adverted to as having been always followed by the crown in dealings with the Indians in respect of their lands.\nIn the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent and in some decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States we have very full and clear accounts of the policy in question. It may be summarily stated as consisting in the recognition by the crown of a usufructuary title in the Indians to all unsurrendered lands. This title, though not perhaps susceptible of any accurate legal definition in exact legal terms, was one which nevertheless sufficed to protect the Indians in the absolute use and enjoyment of their lands, whilst at the same time they were incapacitated from making any valid alienation otherwise than to the crown itself, in whom the ultimate title was, in accordance with the English law of real property, considered as vested. This short statement will, I think, on comparison with the authorities to which I will presently refer, be found to be an accurate description of the principles upon which the crown invariably acted with reference to Indian lands, at least from the year 1756, when Sir William Johnston was appointed by the Imperial Government superintendent of Indian affairs in North America, being as such responsible directly to the crown through one of the Secretaries of State, or the Lords of Trade and Plantation, and thus superseding the Provincial Governments, down to the year 1867, when the confederation act constituting the Dominion of Canada was passed. So faithfully was this system carried out, that I venture to say that there is no settled part of the territory of the Province of Ontario, except perhaps some isolated spots upon which the French Government had, previous to the conquest, erected forts, such as Fort Frontenac and Fort Toronto, which is not included in and covered by a surrender contained in some Indian treaty still to be found in the Dominion Archives. These rules of policy being shown to have been well established and acted upon, and the title of the Indians to their unsurrendered lands to have been recognized by the crown to the extent already mentioned, it may seem of little: importance to enquire into the reasons on which it was based. But as these reasons are not without some bearing on the present question, as I shall hereafter shew, I will shortly refer to what appears to have led to the adoption of the system of dealing with the territorial rights of the Indians. To ascribe it to moral grounds, to motives of humane consideration for the aborigines, would be to attribute it to feelings which perhaps had little weight in the age in which it took its rise. Its true origin was, I take it, experience of the great impolicy of the opposite mode of dealing with the Indians which had been practised by some of the Provincial Governments of the older colonies and which had led to frequent frontier wars, involving great sacrifices of life and property and requiring an expenditure of money which had proved most burdensome to the colonies. That the more liberal treatment accorded to the Indians by this system of protecting them in the enjoyment of their hunting grounds and prohibiting settlement on lands which they had not surrendered, which it is now contended the British North America Act has put an end to, was successful in its results, is attested by the historical fact that from the memorable year 1763, when Detroit was besieged and all the Indian tribes were in revolt, down to the date of confederation, Indian wars and massacres entirely ceased in the British possessions in North America, although powerful Indian nations still continued for some time after the former date to inhabit those territories. That this peaceful conduct of the Indians is in a great degree to be attributed to the recognition of their rights to lands unsurrendered by them, and to the guarantee of their protection in the possession and enjoyment of such lands given by the crown in the proclamation of October, 1763, hereafter to be more fully noticed, is a well known fact of Canadian history which cannot be controverted. The Indian nations from that time became and have since continued to be the firm and faithful allies of the crown and rendered it important military services in two wars\u2014the war of the Revolution and that of 1812.\nThe American authorities, to which reference has already been made, consist (amongst others) of passages in the commentaries of Chancellor Kent[99], in which the whole doctrine of Indian titles is fully and elaborately considered, and of several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, from which three, Johnston v. Mcintosh[100], Worcester v. State of Georgia[101], and Mitchell v. United States[102], may be selected as leading cases. The value and importance of these authorities is not merely that they show that the same doctrine as that already propounded regarding the title of the Indians to unsurrendered lands prevails in the United States, but, what is of vastly greater importance, they without exception refer its origin to a date anterior to the revolution and recognise it as a continuance of the principles of law or policy as to Indian titles then established by the British government, and therefore identical with those which have also continued to be recognized and applied in British North America. Chancellor Kent, referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia[103], says:\u2014\nThe court there held that the Indians were domestic, dependent nations, and their relations to us resembled that of a ward to his guardian; and they had an unquestionable right to the lands they occupied until that right should be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government[104].\nOn the same page the learned commentator proceeds thus:\u2014\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Worcester reviewed the whole ground of controversy relative to the character and validity of Indian rights within the territorial dominions of the United States, and especially with reference to the Cherokee nation within the limits of Georgia. They declared that the right given by European discovery was the exclusive right to purchase, but this right was not founded on a denial of the Indian possessor to sell. Though the right of the soil was claimed to be in the European governments as a necessary consequence of the right of discovery and assumption of territorial jurisdiction, yet that right was only deemed such in reference to the whites; and in respect to the Indians it was always understood to amount only to the exclusive right of purchasing such lands as the natives were willing to sell. The royal grants and charters asserted a title to the country against Europeans only, and they were considered as blank paper so far as the rights of the natives were concerned. The English, the French and the Spaniards were equal competitors for the friendship and aid of the Indian nations. The Crown of England never attempted to interfere with the national affairs of the Indians further than to keep out the agents of foreign powers who might seduce them into foreign alliances. The English Government purchased the alliance and dependence of the Indian Nations by subsidies, and purchased their lands when they were willing to sell at a price they were willing to take, but they never coerced a surrender of them. The English Government considered them as nations competent to maintain the relations of peace and war and of governing themselves under her protection. The United States, who succeeded to the rights of the British Crown in respect of the Indians, did the same and no more; and the protection stipulated to be afforded to the Indians and claimed by them was understood by all parties as only binding the Indians to the United States as dependent allies.\nAgain the same learned writer says[105];\nThe original Indian Nations were regarded and dealt with as proprietors of the soil which they claimed and occupied, but without the power of alienation, except to the Governments which protected them and had thrown over them and beyond them their assumed patented domains. These Governments asserted and enforced the exclusive right to extinguish Indian titles to lands, enclosed within the exterior lines of their jurisdictions, by fair purchase, under the sanction of treaties; and they held all individual purchases from the Indians, whether made with them individually or collectively as tribes, to be absolutely null and void. The only power that could lawfully acquire the Indian title was the State, and a government grant was the only lawful source of title admitted in the Courts of Justice. The Colonial and State Governments and the government of the United States uniformly dealt upon these principles with the Indian Nations dwelling within their territorial limits.\nFurther, Chancellor Kent, in summarising the decision of the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. United States, states the whole doctrine in a form still more applicable to the present case. He says[106]:\nThe Supreme Court once more declared the same general doctrine, that lands in possession of friendly Indians were always, under the colonial governments, considered as being owned by the tribe or nation as their common property by a perpetual right of possession; but that the ultimate fee was in the crown or its grantees, subject to this right of possession, and could be granted by the crown upon that condition; that individuals could not purchase Indian lands without license, or under rules prescribed by law; that possession was considered with reference to Indian habits and modes of life, and the hunting grounds of the tribes were as much in their actual occupation as the cleared fields of the whites, and this was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of all the colonies.\nIt thus appears, that in the United States a traditional policy, derived from colonial times, relative to the Indians and their lands has ripened into well established rules of law, and that the result is that the lands in the possession of the Indians are, until surrendered, treated as their rightful though inalienable property, so far as the possession and enjoyment are concerned; in other words, that the dominium utile is recognized as belonging to or reserved for the Indians, though the dominium directum is considered to be in the United States. Then, if this is so as regards Indian lands in the United States, which have been preserved to the Indians by the constant observance of a particular rule of policy acknowledged by the United States courts to have been originally enforced by the crown of Great Britain, how is it possible to suppose that the law can, or rather could have been, at the date of confederation, in a state any less favorable to the Indians whose lands were situated within the dominion of the British crown, the original author of this beneficent doctrine so carefully adhered to in the United States from the days of the colonial governments? Therefore, when we consider that with reference to Canada the uniform practice has always been to recognize the Indian title as one which could only be dealt with by surrender to the crown, I maintain that if there had been an entire absence of any written legislative act ordaining this rule as an express positive law, we ought, just as the United States courts have done, to hold that it nevertheless existed as a rule of the unwritten common law, which the courts were bound to enforce as such, and consequently, that the 24th sub-section of section 91, as well as the 109th section and the 5th sub-section of section. 92 of the British North America Act, must all be read and construed upon the assumption that these territorial rights of the Indians were strictly legal rights which had to be taken into account and dealt with in that distribution of property and proprietary rights made upon confederation between the federal and provincial governments.\nThe voluminous documentary evidence printed in the case contains numerous instances of official recognition of, the doctrine of Indian title to unceded lands as applied to Canada. Without referring at length to this evidence I may just call attention to one document which, as it contains an expression of opinion with reference to the title to the same lands part of which are now in dispute in this cause by a high judicial authority, a former Chief Justice of Upper Canada, is of peculiar value. In the appendix to the case for Ontario laid before the Judicial Committee in the Boundary Case[107] we find a letter dated 1st of May 1819 from Chief Justice Powell to the Lieutenant Governor, Sir Peregrine Maitland, upon the subject of the conflict then going on between the North West and Hudson\u2019s Bay Companies, and of which the territory now in question was the scene. The Chief Justice, writing upon the jurisdiction of the Upper Canada Courts in this territory and of an act of Parliament relating thereto, says:\nThe territory which it affects is in the crown and part of a district, but the soil is in the aborigines and inhabited only by Indians and their lawless followers.\nThere cannot be a more distinct statement of the rights claimed by the appellants to have existed in the Indians than this, and if the soil, i.e. the title to the soil, was in the Indians in 1819 it must have so remained down to the date of the North West Angle Treaty No. 3 made in 1873.\nThen it is to be borne in mind that the control of the Indians and of the lands occupied by the Indians had, until a comparatively recent period, been retained in the hands of the Imperial Government; for some fifteen years after local self government had been accorded to the Province of Canada the management of Indian affairs remained in the hands of an Imperial officer, subject only to the personal direction of the Governor General, and entirely independent of the local government, and it was only about the year 1855, during the administration of Sir Edmund Head and after the new system of Government had been successfully established, that the direction of Indian affairs was handed over to the Executive authorities of the late Province of Canada, Further, it is to be observed, that by the terms of the 24th sub-section the power to legislate concerning Indians, as distinct from lands reserved, is expressly assigned to the Dominion Government, and this legislative power appears, by the tacit acquiescence of all the new Governments called into existence by confederation, to include the burden of providing for the necessities of the Indians, which has since been borne exclusively by the Government of the Dominion. At all events, the exclusive right of legislating respecting Indian affairs is thus attributed by this clause to the Parliament of Canada. This must include the right to control the exercise by the Indians of the power of making treaties of surrender, and since, I as already shown, it is only by means of formal treaties that the Indian title can be properly surrendered or extinguished, Parliament must necessarily have the power, as incident to the general management of the Indians, of so legislating as to restrain or regulate the making of treaties of surrender which might be deemed improvident dispositions of Indian lands. If this were not so, and Parliament did not possess this power of absolute control over the Indians in respect of their dealings with their lands, the provisions of the 24th sub section would be most incongruous and unreasonable, for in that case, whilst on the one hand Parliament would have to provide for the necessities of the Indians, on the other hand it would not have the means of restraining these wards of the Dominion Government from wasting the means of self support which their hunting grounds afforded. Then, taking into consideration this wide power of legislation respecting the Indian tribes, and seeing that it must necessarily include a power of control over all Indian treaties dealing with proprietary rights, it is surely a legitimate application of the maxim noscitur a sociis to construe the words \u201cLands reserved for the Indians\u201d as embracing all territorial rights of Indians, as well those in lands actually appropriated for reserves as those in lands which had never been the subject of surrender at all.\nTo summarize these arguments, which appear to me to possess great force, we find, that at the date of confederation the Indians, by the constant usage and practice of the crown, were considered to possess a certain proprietary interest in the unsurrendered lands which they occupied as hunting grounds; that this usage had either ripened into a rule of the common law as applicable to the American Colonies, or that such a rule had been derived from the law of nations and had in this way been imported into the Colonial law as applied to Indian Nations; that such property of the Indians was usufructuary only and could not be alienated, except by surrender to the crown as the ultimate owner of the soil; and that these rights of property were not inaptly described by the words \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d whilst they could not, without doing violence to the meaning of language, be comprised in the description of public lands which the Provinces could sell and dispose of at their will. Further, we find from the conjunction of the word \u201cIndians\u201d with the expression \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d in the 24 sub-section of section 91 of the British North America Act, that a construction which would place unsurrendered lands in the category of \u201cpublic lands\u201d appropriated to the Provinces would be one which would bring different provisions of the act into direct conflict, since such lands would be subject to the disposition of the local legislature under sub-sec. 5, and at the same time it would be within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, in the exercise of its general right of legislation regarding the Indians, to restrain surrenders or extinguishments of the Indian title to such lands, and thus to render nugatory the only means open to the Provinces of making the lands available for sale and settlement. Then, there being but two alternative modes of avoiding this conflict, one by treating the British North America Act as by implication abolishing all right and property of the Indians in unsurrendered lands, thus at one stroke doing away with the traditional policy above noticed, and treating such lands as ordinary crown lands in which the Indian title has been extinguished, the other by holding that such unsurrendered lands are to be considered as embraced in the description of \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d it appears to me that the first alternative, which would attribute to the Imperial Parliament the intention of taking away proprietary rights, without express words and without any adequate reason, and of doing away at a most inopportune time with the long cherished and most successful policy originally inaugurated by the British Government for the treatment of the Indian tribes, is totally inadmissible and must be rejected. The inevitable conclusion is, that the mode of interpretation secondly presented is the correct one, and that all lands in possession of Indian tribes not surrendered at the date of confederation are to be deemed \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d the ultimate title to which must be in the crown, not as representing the Province, but in right of the Dominion, the Indians having the right of enjoyment and an inalienable possessory title, until such title is extinguished by a treaty of surrender which the Dominion is alone competent to enter into. To these considerations must be added the further and weighty reason, that the construction just indicated is most fair and reasonable, inasmuch as the Dominion, being burdened with the support and maintenance of the Indians, ought also to have the benefit of any advantage which may be derived from a surrender of their lands.\nTo these arguments the respondent opposes others of varying weight and importance, which may, as far as I can see, be all classed under two heads. First, it is attempted to show by reference to a variety of documents consisting of legislative and administrative acts, public correspondence and official reports, all of which I concede are quite admissible for the purpose, that the words \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d had, at the time of confederation, acquired a well recognised secondary meaning, and that they were synonymous with Indian reserves and were confined to lands appropriated to the Indians by grant from the crown, or lands which the Indians had themselves reserved by excepting them from treaty surrenders. The answer to this is, in my opinion, very plain. It is true that these documents do show that lands so specifically appropriated to the Indians have always been treated and are to be considered as lands \u201creserved\u201d for the Indians, and therefore lands comprised in the description given in the 24th sub-section of section 91, but it does not follow from this that the clear and undoubted title of the Indians to their peculiar interest in unsurrendered lands is not also included in the same description. The inference would rather be against a construction which would attribute to the Imperial Parliament the intention of making a purely arbitrary distinction between the two classes of Indian property, for if it is once admitted or established that the Indians have a proprietary interest in lands not surrendered by them, a point on which there can really be no serious doubt, the same reasons which induced Parliament to throw around the minor territorial interests of the Indians in the smaller classes of reserves the powerful protection of the Dominion Government, or rather stronger reasons than these, must also have applied to their more valuable and important territorial rights in unsurrendered lands.\nThe other principal argument relied upon for the respondent is one derived from the supposed inconvenience which would result from the proprietary interest in this large tract of territory becoming vested in the Dominion Government. I can see no force in this. I am unable to see that any such result must necessarily, or is even likely, to follow because the proprietorship of the soil in a large tract of land situate within the confines of a particular province is vested in the Dominion, whilst the political rights, legislative and administrative, over the same territory are vested; in the provincial government. Instances of such ownership by a federal government within the limits I and subject to the jurisdiction of local governments, provinces, or states, are easily to be found, and it has never been suggested that any political inconvenience) or clashing of jurisdiction, has resulted from them. In all the States of the American Union, except the original thirteen and seven others formed out of cessions of territory by original States, viz.: Maine, Vermont, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama and Misissipi, and Texas, (which was admitted to the Union as a state already formed out of foreign territory,) the federal government was the original proprietor of the soil, and still remains so as regards ungranted lands. We may, therefore, presume that a system which has prevailed and still prevails in seventeen states of the Union, and which also exists in our own Province of Manitoba, and must likewise apply to all future provinces formed out of the North-West Territory, cannot be so incompatible with the political rights of local governments, or with the material interests of the people, as to require us to depart from the ordinary and well understood rule of statutory construction, and to ascribe to the Imperial Parliament the intention of abolishing by implication Indian titles which the crown had uniformly recognized for a long course of time, and protection to which had been expressly ordained and guaranteed by a proclamation of the king more than a century old.\nThe objection that the interests of the public would be prejudiced by attributing the ultimate crown title in Indian lands to the Dominion instead of to the province, seems to imply that this dispute is to be considered as a continuance of the contest respecting the provincial boundaries of Ontario and Manitoba. I cannot assent to this. The question between the two provinces was one in which the rights of two distinct political communities, each representing separate and distinct portions of the general public of the Dominion, came into conflict. In the present case we are entitled, indeed bound, to assume that in the disposal of these lands for the purposes of settlement the interests of the public, as well the public of Ontario as of Canada at large, will be as well served by the Dominion as by the province. I have already shown that the ownership by the Dominion of territory included within the limits of the province, is in no way inconsistent with the political rights of the latter as regards government and legislation The only real question, therefore, can be and is, that as to which government has the better title to the fund to be produced by the sale of these lands, and if, in construing the statute, we are to take into consideration arguments based on the fairness and equity of giving to one government rather than to the other the title to this fund, I have no hesitation in assigning the better right to the Dominion. I see nothing inequitable or inconvenient, but much the reverse, in a construction of the statute which has the effect of attributing the profits arising from the surrender and sale of Indian lands to the Dominion, upon which is cast the burthen of providing for the government and support of the Indian tribes and the management of their property, not only in the Provinces, but throughout the wide domain of the North-West Territories, rather than upon the Provinces, who are not only free from all liabilities respecting the Indians, but are not even empowered to undertake them and cannot legally do so.\nSo far as arguments derived from expediency, public policy, and convenience are to have weight in removing any ambiguity which may be fairly raised with reference to the meaning of the terms \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d there were some invoked by the learned counsel for the appellants which, in my opinion, far exceed in weight any of the same class put forward on behalf of the respondent. Is it to be presumed that by the 109th and 117th sections of the British North America Act it was intended to abrogate entirely the well understood doctrine, according to which the Indians were recognized as having a title to the lands not surrendered by them, which had been acted upon for at least one hundred years, and which had received the express sanction of the crown in a royal proclamation, wherein the Indians are assured that, to the end that they might be convinced of the King\u2019s justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, their lands not ceded to or purchased by the crown should be reserved to them for their hunting grounds? And is it to be supposed that this was done of the mere motion of the Imperial Parliament, without any suggestion or request from the body of delegates assembled in the conference by which the terms and plan of confederation were settled, or otherwise from this side of the Atlantic? And can that be considered a reasonable construction which would attribute to Parliament the intention to make this great change, and thus to break faith with the Indian tribes by abrogating the privileges conferred by a proclamation which they had always regarded as the charter of their rights, just as Canada was on the eve of acquiring from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company a large territory which would place in subjection to the new Dominion an Indian population far in excess of the aggregate of that contained in all the old Provinces together, a population which it would be of the utmost importance to conciliate, and which would be sure to be affected by any want of good faith practised towards the Indians of the Provinces? Before we can say that the language of the 24th sub-section of section 91 is to receive the interpretation contended for by the respondent, we must be prepared to answer these questions in the affirmative. This I cannot bring myself to do, but I am compelled to prefer the plain primary meaning of the words in question contended for by the appellants, according to which lands reserved for the Indians include unsurrendered lands, or, in other words, all lands reserved for the Indians, and not merely a particular class of such lands.\nTo the objections just mentioned it is, however, answered, that all the obligations of the crown towards the Indians incidental to their unsurrendered lands, and the right to acquire such lands and to make compensation therefor by providing subsidies and annuities for the Indians, attach to and may be performed by the Provinces as well as by the Dominion. The proper rejoinders to this have been already indicated, but may be more fully stated as follows: First, a construction which, without any adequate reason, would apportion the management of the Indians and their lands between two Governments and two sets of officers, whilst it is obvious that an administration of Indian affairs as a whole by one Government and one set of officers could alone be practicable and beneficial, would be so eccentric and arbitrary that nothing but express words could authorise it. Secondly, the Provinces are Governments of limited capacities, executive as well as legislative, and amongst the powers attributed to the Provincial Governments and Legislatures by the B.N.A. Act none can be found which would authorise such a dealing with Indians in respect of their lands. It cannot be pretended that any such power is conferred in express terms, and none can be implied, since such an implication would be in direct conflict with the only meaning which can be sensibly attached to the word \u201cIndians\u201d as used in the 24th sub-section of section 91, considered apart altogether from the subsequent words \u201cand lands reserved for Indians,\u201d by which word \u201cIndians,\u201d standing alone, it must have been intended to assign to the Dominion the tutelage or guardianship of the Indians and the right to regulate their relations with the crown generally, a duty which could not be properly performed by the Dominion if the tribes were liable to be beset by the Provinces seeking surrenders of their lands. On the whole, therefore, the result is that the construction contended for by the respondent, that unsurrendered Indian lands vested in the Provinces under the 109th and 117th sections, would practically annul the well recognized doctrine of an Indian title in these lands, and for that reason alone is therefore inadmissible.\nIt appears to me, therefore, that the contentions of the respondent entirely fail, and that were there nothing more to be said the appellants would be entitled to judgment on this appeal.\nSo far I have considered and dealt with the case upon the assumption that there were no extrinsic circumstances, documents, or course of conduct, from which we could derive assistance in placing a meaning upon the words of the 24th sub-section, beyond the established usage of the crown, according to which the Indians were considered as possessing the proprietary interest already referred to in their unsurrendered lands. It appears, however, that a much stronger case than this is made in favour of the construction contended for by the appellants, for we find that in the proclamation of King George the 3rd, already incidentally alluded to, which had the force of a statute and was in the strictest sense a legislative act, and which had never, so far as I can see, been repealed, but remained, as regards so much of it as is now material, in force at the date of confederation, Indian lands not ceded to or purchased by the king, i.e., lands not surrendered, are expressly des- cribed in terms as lands \u201creserved to the Indians;\u201d the two expressions, \u201clands not ceded to or purchased by the king,\u201d and \u201clands reserved to the Indians,\u201d being expressly treated as convertible terms. This proclamation was that of the 7th October, 1763, by which provision was made for the government of certain territories acquired by Great Britain by conquest during the seven years\u2019 war, and which had been ceded by the treaty of peace concluded at Paris between France, England, and Spain on the 10th February, 1763. By this proclamation four separate governments were established, viz., those of Grenada, East and West Florida, and Quebec, and the limits of each province were defined, those of Quebec not comprising the whole territory of Canada ceded by France and being of much smaller extent than those afterwards ascribed to the second province of the same name by the Quebec Act passed in 1774[108]. The description of the territory included in the government of Quebec erected by the proclamation is as follows:\u2014\nFirst, the government of Quebec, bounded on the Labrador coast by the river St. John, and from thence by a line drawn from the head of that river through the lake St. John to the south end of Lake Nipissim, from whence the said line crossing the river St. Lawrence, and the Lake Champlain, in 45 degrees of north latitude; passes along the high lands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the said river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the sea; and also along the north coast of the Bay of Chaleurs and the coast of the gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres, and from thence crossing the mouth of the river St. Lawrence by the west end of the island of Anticosti, terminates at the aforesaid river of St. John.\nThis description, manifestly, does not include the lands now in question.\nThe proclamation, after declaring that the King had issued Letters Patent to the Governors of these several colonies directing the calling of general assemblies for purposes of legislation and some other provisions immaterial here, proceeds to ordain certain regulations respecting Indians and Indian lands as follows:\u2014\nAnd whereas it is just and reasonable and essential to our interest and the security of our colonies that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom we are connected and who live under our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions and territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds, We do therefore, with the advice of our Privy council, declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that no Governor or Commander in chief in any of our colonies of Quebec, East Florida or West Florida, do presume, upon any pretence whatever, to grant warrants of survey, or pass any patents for lands, beyond the bounds of their respective Governments as described in their Commissions; as also, that no Governor or commander in Chief in any of our other colonies or plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our further pleasure be known, to grant warrants of survey, or pass patents for any lands, beyond the heads or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north-west, or upon any lands whatever which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians or any of them.\nAnd we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the land and territories not included within the limits of our said three new Governments, or within the limit of the territory granted to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company; as also all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved, without our especial leave or licence for that purpose first obtained.\nAnd we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons what-soever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from such settlements.\nAnd whereas great frauds and abuses have been committed in the purchasing lands of the Indian, to the great prejudice of our interests, and to the great dissatisfaction of the said Indians, in order therefore to prevent such irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our justice and determined resolution to remove all reasonable cause of discontent, we do, with the advice of our Privy Council, strictly enjoin and require, that no private person do presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settlement; but if at any time any of the said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands the same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, in some public meeting or assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that purpose by the Governor or Commander-in-Chief of our colony respectively within which they shall lie.\nThis same proclamation was the subject of judicial consideration in the celebrated case of Campbell v. Hall[109], and its effect and operation was fully considered by Lord Mansfield in his judgment in that case.\nAs is well known, it was determined in the case of Campbell v. Hall109, that the king had power to legislate as regards ceded and conquered colonies, and that this identical proclamation now under consideration had the force of law in the colonies to which it applied, though it was also determined that the king, having by it ordained the calling of legislative assemblies in the several colonies mentioned, his power of legislation was thereby exhausted, and that a subsequent proclamation with reference to Grenada was of no legislative force. In the present case the importance of this proclamation is paramount, and appears to me to be by itself decisive of the present appeal. In the first place, it gives legislative expression and force to what I have heretofore treated as depending on a regulation of policy, or at most on rules of unwritten law and official practice, namely, the right of the Indians to enjoy, by virtue of a recognized title, their lands not surrendered or ceded to the crown; it prohibits all interference with such lands by private persons by way of purchase or settlement, and limits the right of purchasing or obtaining cessions of Indian lands to the king exclusively. Next, by the words \u201cto lands which not having been ceded to or \u201cpurchased by us are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid,\u201d it indicates that \u201clands reserved for the \u201cIndians\u201d was a description and definition applicable to, and indeed convertible with, unsurrendered or non-ceded lands. It thus furnishes us with a key to the meaning of the words \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d I an expression which appears to have originated in this proclamation, and it entitles us, whenever we find the same words used in a statute or public document without a context indicating that it is used in some restricted sense, to infer that it includes those rights of the Indians in their unsurrendered lands which it was one of the principal purposes of the proclamation to assure to them. If the effect of this proclamation as applicable to the present case stopped here it would, as it seems to me, be conclusive, for being a legislative act having the force of a statute it has never, in my opinion, been repealed, but has, so far as it regulates the rights of the Indians in their unsurrendered lands, remained in force to the present day. It was, therefore, in force at the date of the passage of the British North America Act, and, if I am correct in this, I am warranted in saying that in the face of its express provisions that Indian lands not surrendered or ceded to the crown shall be considered \u201clands reserved to the \u201cIndians,\u201d it is impossible to reject the equivalent interpretation that lands reserved for the Indians mean lands not ceded by the Indians, which is all the appellants contend for. But this proclamation has, as it appears to me, an application far beyond that already mentioned. It not only gives us a clue to the meaning of the term \u201clands reserved for or to the Indians,\u201d but it applies directly and in terms to the present lands. By the first clause of the extract from the proclamation which I have read the King declares it to be his will and pleasure to reserve under his sovereignty, protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all land and territory not included (1) within the limits of \u201cour said three Governments,\u201d (2) or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, (3) also all lands westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north west. Now this territory, of which the lands in question form part, and one controversy as to which was determined by the Order-in-Council of August, 1884, was clearly not comprised within the limits of the first Province of Quebec, as those limits were defined by this proclamation of October, 1763, nor was it included within the territory granted to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, nor did it lie to the west or north-west of the sources of the rivers falling into the Atlantic ocean. Then, what were the lands not included within the three Governments, nor within the Hudson\u2019s Bay territory, to which the proclamation refers as being thereby reserved for the Indians? Clearly it has reference to the residue of the territories mentioned at the outset of the proclamation, viz., the \u201ccountries and islands ceded and confirmed to us by the said treaty.\u201d And if this is correct, and I fail to see how it can be otherwise, this identical tract of territory now in question was, by this proclamation, which in Campbell v. Hall was adjudged to have legislative force, reserved to and set apart for the use of the Indians, and this provision of the proclamation, never having been repealed, nor in any way derogated from, by any subsequent legislation, remained in full force as a subsisting enactment up to the passing of the confederation act. In other words, it is a legislative act, applying directly to the lands now in question, assuring to the Indians the right and title to possess and enjoy these lands until they thought fit of their own free will to cede or surrender them to the crown, and declaring that, until surrender, the lands should be reserved to them as their hunting grounds, and being still in full force and vigor when the British North America Act was passed, it operated at that time as an express legislative appropriation of the land now in dispute for the rise and benefit of the Indians by the designation of \u201clands reserved to the Indians.\u201d Therefore the effect of the 24th sub\u2011section of section 91 of the British North America Act upon these lands, as lands \u201creserved to the, Indians\u201d by the proclamation, must be precisely the same as if, by an act of Parliament passed the day before the British North America Act, it had been declared that these same lands, designated by some appropriate description, should be \u201creserved to the Indians,\u201d in which case it could hardly be pretended that they were not lands \u201creserved for the Indians\u201d within sub-section 24 of section 91, but public lands belonging to the Province under sections 109 and 117 and subject to the exclusive legislation of the Province under sub\u2011section 5 of section 92.\nI now proceed to consider the objections which have been made on behalf of the respondent to the arguments based on the Proclamation of 1763. First, it is said that the proclamation was wholly repealed by the Quebec Act passed in 1774[110]. To this proposition I cannot assent. The proclamation had made provision for the civil government of the Province of Quebec, which was created by it, and it had defined the boundaries of that Province; and it was these provisions, and these only, which were repealed, altered, or in any way affected by the act of 1774. The repealing section, which is the fourth, is as follows;\nAnd whereas the provisions made by the said proclamation in respect of the civil government of the said Province of Quebec and the powers and authority given to the Governor and other civil officers of the said Province, by the grants and commissions issued in consequence thereof, have been found by experience to be inapplicable to the state and circumstances of the said Province, the inhabitants whereof amounted at the conquest to above 65,000 persons professing the religion of the Church of Rome and enjoying an established form of constitution and system of laws by which their persons and property had been protected, governed and ordered for a long series of years, from the first establishment of the said Province of Canada. Be it therefore further enacted: That the said proclamation, so far as the same relates to the said Province of Quebec and the commission under the authority whereof the Government of the said Province is at present administered, and all and every the ordinance and ordinances made by the Governor and Council of Quebec for the time being relative to the civil government and administration of justice in the said Province, and all commissions to judges and other officers thereof, be and the same are hereby revoked, annulled and made void from and after the 1st day of May, 1775.\nFrom the wording of this section, as well that portion of it which consists of preamble as the enacting clause itself, it is plain that the intention was only to revoke so much of the proclamation as had relation to the civil government, the powers given to the governor, and other civil officers, and to the administration of justice in the Province. By the proclamation the law of England had been introduced into the new Province erected by the King out of the territory ceded by France. This had proved a cause of great dissatisfaction to the French Canadian population, and had, as the fourth section recites, \u201cbeen found upon experience to be inapplicable to the state and circumstances of the Province.\u201d One principal object of the act was to remedy this grievance by providing (as it did) that in controversies as to property and civil rights the laws of Canada should be the rule of decision. The proclamation had also provided for the calling of legislative assemblies; such assemblies being considered unsuited to the state of the Province, this provision was also superseded by enacting that the legislative power should be vested in a council composed of members appointed by the crown.\nFurther, the act greatly enlarged the boundaries of the Province, extending them westward to the Mississippi (as I may now venture to say) and southward to the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi. It was this last provision which principally attracted attention to the measure in England, and led to great debates in Parliament, and particularly to the vigorous opposition of Mr. Burke, then the agent of the Province of New York[111]. This extension of the limits of the Province was, as is well known, induced by considerations of policy connected with the discontent then prevailing in the adjoining English Provinces, whose people greatly objected to the act and considered themselves much aggrieved by its passage.\nIt is nowhere suggested that anything connected with the questions of Indians or Indian rights led to this enactment. None of the changes in the terms of the proclamation which were introduced by the act have the most remote bearing on Indian land rights or Indian affairs. Neither the establishment of French instead of English law, nor the substitution of a council for an assembly, nor the enlargement of the Provincial boundaries, can by implication have any such effect, and the act does not contain a word expressly referring to the Indians. Further, the third section of the act contains an express saving of titles to land, in words sufficiently comprehensive to include the Indian title recognized by the proclamation. Its words are:\nNothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to make void, or to vary, or alter, any right, title or possession derived under any grant; conveyance or otherwise howsoever, of or to any lands within the said province or the provinces thereto adjoining; but that the same shall remain and be in force and have effect as if this act had never been made.\nThe words \u201cright,\u201d \u201ctitle\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d are all applicable to the rights which the crown had conceded to the Indians by the proclamation, and, without absolutely disregarding this 3rd section, it would be impossible to hold that these vested rights of property or possession had all been abolished and swept away by the statute. I must therefore hold, that the Quebec act had no more effect in revoking the five concluding paragraphs of the proclamation of 1763 which relate to the Indians and their rights to possess and enjoy their lands until they voluntarily surrendered or ceded them to the crown, than it had in repealing it as a royal ordinance for the government of the Floridas and Granada.\nThen it is said that the proclamation was, as regards the Indians, merely a temporary measure, and that its character as such is evidenced by the introductory words to the clauses now material: \u201cand we do further declare it to be our Royal will and pleasure for the present\u201d There is no force in this point unless it can be shown that the proclamation was revoked in a regular and constitutional manner. A statute which makes provision \u201cfor the present,\u201d without any express limit in point of time, or other indication by which its duration can be ascertained, remains in force until it is repealed. As I have already said, we are bound to regard this proclamation as having all the force of a statute, and as such it must be subject to the established rules of statutory construction. No act of Parliament, Order in Council, or Colonial statute or ordinance can be produced repealing, or assuming to repeal, so much of its terms as are applicable to the present question. We are therefore bound to conclude that, to the extent just indicated, it remained in full force and operation, and had all the effect of an act of Parliament, up to the passing of the British North America Act in 1867.\nThat the proclamation was not considered by the government and its officers to have been superseded by the Quebec Act, or otherwise, is shown by the strict observance of its terms in all dealings with the Indians respecting their lands. The Indians themselves have been allowed to consider it as still of binding force, and to look upon it as the charter of their rights. In the report of the Indian commissioners appointed by the; government of Canada, dated the 22nd January, 1844, and therefore made whilst the Indians were still under the protection of the Imperial Government, it is said:\nThe subsequent proclamation of His Majesty George Third, issued in 1763, furnished them with a fresh guarantee for the possession of their hunting grounds and the protection of the crown. This document the Indians look upon as their charter. They have preserved a copy of it to the present time, and have referred to it on several occasions in their representations to the government.\nSince 1763 the government, adhering to the royal proclamation of that year, have not considered themselves entitled to dispossess the Indians of their lands without entering into an agreement with them and rendering them some compensation. For a considerable time after the conquest of Canada the whole of the western part of the upper province, with the exception of a few military posts on the frontier and a great extent of the eastern part, was in their occupation. As the settlement of the country advanced and the land was required for new occupants, or the predatory and revengeful habits of the Indians rendered their removal desirable, the British government made successive agreements with them for the surrender of portions of their lands.\nIt is not suggested that between 1844 and the passage of the British North America Act anything occurred to detract from Indian rights. This constant usage for upwards of a century by itself raises a strong presumption in favour of the construction of the Quebec Act which I maintain, namely, that it had not the repealing effect contended for by the respondent. Further, in the case of Johnson v. Mcintosh[112], decided in 1823, the Supreme Court of the United States had to deal directly with this identical point of the binding effect, as a legislative ordinance, of the proclamation of 1763, and with its operation at a date subsequent to the Act of 1774 upon Indian lands included within the boundaries of the second province of Quebec created by that act. The lands there in question were within the territory, which, by the Treaty of Versailles (1783) settling the boundaries between Canada and the United States, became part of the United States and was known as the Territory of Illinois, and these lands had been purchased from the Indians in 1775 and 1778 in contravention of the terms of the proclamation. It was objected that the title so acquired was thereby rendered void. Chief Justice Marshall, in giving the judgment of the court, says:\nThe proclamation issued by the King of Great Britain in 1763 has been considered, and we think with reason, as constituting an additional objection to the title of the plaintiff.\nThe Chief Justice then proceeds to consider the constitutional validity of the proclamation, which he recognises to have been well established by Campbell v. Hall[113], and upon that, as well as upon other grounds, he gives judgment against the title. Now, if the Quebec Act, which, as it was a statute preceding in date the Declaration of Independence (1776), would have been considered in this respect binding by the American Courts, had repealed the proclamation, the Supreme Court would have been wrong in its conclusion that it applied to the case before them. It is out of the question to suppose that the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, several of whom were contemporaries of the revolution and actors in it (notably the Chief Justice himself), were not perfectly familiar with a statute so notorious throughout the old colonies as the Quebec act, which had been one of the pretended grievances set forth in the Declaration of Independence by way of justifying the revolution. We must therefore conclude that it was considered by the court not to repeal or in any way affect the provisions of the proclamation relating to the Indians. Lastly, the learned Chancellor himself, in his judgment in this case, concedes that \u201cthe proclamation has frequently been referred to by the Indians themselves as the charter of their rights;\u201d and, speaking of the clause \u201crelating to the manner of dealing with them in respect of lands they occupy at large or as a reserve,\u201d he says it \u201chas always been scrupulously observed in such transactions,\u201d but still he adds that it had been repealed by the Quebec act and had become obsolete. That so much of it as is now material was not repealed by the Quebec act, according to the proper construction of that statute, I have, I think, sufficiently established; and that it could otherwise have become legally obsolete was impossible, since, if Campbell v. Hall is to be considered sound law, it was a legislative ordinance of equivalent force with a statute, and consequently could only have been repealed by an act emanating from some competent legislative authority; but no such act can be referred to. That the proclamation ever in fact became practically obsolete from desuetude, is so far from having been the case that it is admitted to have remained since the act of 1774 \u201coperative as a declaration of sound principles which then and thereafter guided the executive in disposing of Indian claims.\u201d\nBut even if I am wrong in my view that the statute of 1774 had not the effect contended for, but that the proclamation was in point of law wholly revoked by it, there still remains the argument that its terms furnish a key to the meaning of the words used in the 24th sub\u2011section of section 91 of the British North America Act, upon the construction of which the decision to this appeal must wholly depend. Thus, using the text of the proclamation as a glossary, we find that in 1763 lands reserved for the Indians meant lands not ceded or surrendered by them to the crown. Then, as we find it generally admitted, that this proclamation, even if superseded, has down to the present time been regarded by the Indians as the charter of their rights, that it has remained operative as a declaration of sound principles, and that its terms have always been scrupulously observed in dealings with the Indians in respect of their lands (all of which are very nearly the learned Chancellor\u2019s own words), the result is inevitable, that the expression \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d employed in the proclamation retained its original significance as an equivalent for lands not ceded to or purchased by the crown down to 1867 when the British North America Act was passed, and that, consequently, when the same words were made use of in the 91st section of that act, it was with the intention that they should receive the same definite and well understood meaning as had always been thus attached to them.\nSome stress has been laid on the legislation of the Dominion since confederation, as indicating that the Parliament of Canada has adopted the construction of the British North America Act contended for by the respondent. Even if this had been so, I am not aware of any principle upon which what may be considered an erroneous view adopted by Parliament of this question of the meaning of sub-section 24 of section 91 could bind this court to adopt the same construction in a judicial decision, although, if there was room for doubt and there had in fact been any legislation, it would, as embodying the opinion of Parliament as to the proper interpretation of the Imperial act, be entitled to some, though not conclusive, weight and influence. It does not appear, however, that any such construction as is contended for by the respondent has, in fact, been placed by Parliament on the 24th sub-section of section 91. Three acts relating to the Indians and Indian lands have been passed by the Parliament of Canada since confederation, in 1868, 1876, and 1880 respectively. In the first of these statutes (31 Vic. ch. 42), an act organizing the Department of the Secretary of State, by section 6 all lands reserved for Indians, or for any tribe, band, or body of Indians, are declared \u201cto be deemed reserved for the same purposes as before the act,\u201d and by section 8 it was provided, that lands reserved for the use of the Indians should only be ceded to the crown by a formal treaty of surrender made in the manner prescribed by the act, and that until surrender no sale or lease of Indian lands should be valid. In the subsequent acts of 1876 and 1880[114], the same provisions were repeated, except that the word \u201creserves\u201d was used instead of \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d and by an interpretation clause it was declared that the term \u201creserve\u201d meant \u201cany tract of land set apart by treaty or otherwise for the use or benefit, or granted to a particular band of Indians, of which the legal title is in the crown but which is unsurrendered.\u201d With regard to these acts it is to be observed that in the first act the identical expression calling for interpretation, \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d is used In the second and third, the word \u201creserves\u201d has been substituted, and what I understand to be contended is, that this word \u201creserves,\u201d with the meaning affixed to it by the interpretation clause, has a narrower signification than one which includes all unsurrendered lands. I am not prepared so to understand the word \u201creserves\u201d as defined by the interpretation clause, for I cannot admit that it has a less comprehensive signification than the words \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d in the Act of 1868, and these latter words must receive the same construction as is to be attributed to precisely the same words as used in the British North America Act. But, conceding that the word \u201creserves\u201d did apply to Indian lands of a different class from those referred to as \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d what possible effect could that have on the present question, which is confined to the construction of an Imperial statute\u2014the confederation act? That Parliament has no power to divest the Dominion in favour of the Provinces of a legislative power conferred on it by the British North America Act is, I think, clear. But, assuming that it had, it has neither assumed to put forth any authoritative declaration of the proper construction of the clause in question in the British North America Act, or to relinquish in favour of the provinces any right of property or power of legislation vested in the Dominion by its provisions. At most, if my construction of the word \u201creserves\u201d is erroneous, it could be said, that, having the power to legislate for all lands occupied by and not surrendered by Indians, Parliament had only seen fit to exercise this power in relation to the class of lands comprised in the description of \u201creserves\u201d as defined by the interpretation clause, but on no principle that I ever heard or read of could this be said either to imply an authoritative declaration of the construction of the British North America Act binding on the courts, or a relinquishment in favour of the provinces of the exclusive right of legislation regarding lands reserved for the Indians, or a cession to the provinces of the rights of the crown in such lands. These statutes have, therefore, no application to the question the court is called upon to decide on this appeal.\nOn the whole my conclusion must be, that the lands included in the description of \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d in subsection 24 of section 91 were not vested in the provinces as public lands or property by sections 109 and 117, and that all lands occupied by Indians and not ceded by them to the crown are comprehended in the exclusive powers of legislation conferred on the Dominion, and that the ultimate property in such lands, subject to the Indian title, is vested in the crown for the use of the Dominion; that consequently the North-West Angle Treaty No. 3 conferred an absolute title to the lands in question in this case on Her Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada; and that this appeal must be allowed and the information dismissed in the court below with costs in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J. concurred with RITCHIE C.J. HENRY J.\u2014I have not considered it necessary, in the view I entertain of this case, to prepare a written judgment, but may say, in starting, that I entirely approve of the judgment of the learned chancellor, which, I think, embraces all the important points in the case.\nI think that after the conquest of this country all wild lands, including those held by nomadic tribes of Indians, were the property of the crown and were transferred to those who applied for them only by the crown. It was never asserted that any title to them could be given by the Indians. In 1763, after the conquest, the crown issued a proclamation by which all persons were prohibited from trading with the Indians in regard to purchase of lands, and it was declared that all such transactions should be void. The Indians were not permitted to transfer any of their rights as to the land to any individual, and no such transfers were valid unless made by the crown. These were restrictions on the rights of the Indians following the conquest of the country, and I refer to them with reference to the question whether or not the Indians could convey a title in fee simple of the lands in question to the Dominion Government, as contended for, or to any one else.\nIf the Province of Ontario owned these lands, subject to such rights, then arises another question, whether the purchase from the Indians by the treaty spoken of operated to give a title in them to the Dominion Government, or as an extinguishment of the rights of the Indians in favour of the Province of Ontario.\nIn the first place, I suppose nobody will assert that if a private individual entered upon any of the lands at any time the Indians could legally object, as the law does not permit them by any legal means to recover possession of the land, or recover damages for any trespass committed thereon. I mention this to show that the Indians were never regarded as having a title. In 1873 the crown, in its wisdom, decided to hold these lands as a hunting ground for the Indians. In the first settlement of the country to assert sovereignty and to put that assertion into operation would have caused war, and it was necessary to treat with the Indians from time to time in order to facilitate settlement. They were, therefore, dealt with in such a manner that they were not asked to give up their lands without some compensation. The treaty in question was made when the Dominion Government claimed that the lands in question were not a part of Ontario, and many years before the Privy Council decided that they were. The Dominion Government, asserting that it was a portion of the territory of Manitoba over which they had jurisdiction (for, by arrangement, all the crown lands and timber in Manitoba were reserved to the Dominion), entered into negotiations with the Indians for the extinguishment of their title. That being done we have to inquire what was the operation, in law, of that extinguishment.\nNow, suppose an individual had purchased from the Indians a part of this territory the crown would have the right to ignore the transfer. The Indians might have no further claim, but the extinguishment of the Indian rights would enure to the benefit of the crown. If the Indian claim had been extinguished by private persons it would, without doubt, have operated in favor of the crown. Apply that principle to this case and we will see that the extinguishment, if Ontario was the owner at the time, would in the same way operate in favor of the Province of Ontario.\nThis document signed by certain Indians is not evidence of a purchase. The conveyance itself shows that the title was in the crown, and the treaty is simply a cession of all the Indian rights, titles, and privileges whatever they were, and the consideration is stated to have emanated from Her Majesty\u2019s bounty, &c., The consideration was, therefore, on the face of the treaty, an act of bounty on the part of Her Majesty. It is not an acknowledgment of any title in fee simple in the Indians. The Indians were not in possession of any particular portion of the land; for years and years they might never be on certain portions of it; they could not be said to have yielded possession, for that they cannot be assumed to have had, but virtually only relinquished their claim to the lands as hunting grounds.\nA question of importance arises under the confederation act. By one of the sections of that act all lands reserved for the Indians were placed under the control of the Dominion Parliament. We must then inquire what was reserved for them. There are many ways of reserving real estate. It may be reserved by will, by deed, by proclamation, and so on, but it requires an act of some description. As regards the wild lands inhabited by nomadic tribes of Indians, by what process is it shown that they were ever reserved by anybody? They are in the same state as they were at the conquest. We find that several large tracts of land were at different times specially reserved for the use of Indian tribes, and have been held in trust for them by the Government. When the Indians did not require them they were sold and the money held for their use. There was another class. In many of the treaties by which the Indians gave up their right to portions of the country certain portions of the territory they were about to transfer were reserved for them in the treaties themselves. When, therefore, the Imperial act was passed there was sufficient material for the operation of the clauses relating to lands \u201creserved for the Indians.\u201d\nBut, I would ask, how can it be said that the lands in question in this suit were ever reserved? They were always the property of the crown. The Indians had the right to use them for hunting purposes, but not as property the title of which was in them. Thus, then, we have these words in the statute explained by the knowledge we have of certain lands being expressly reserved for the Indians.\nReservation cannot be effected by implication; there must be some act.\nThe words in the Imperial statute refer only to lands expressly reserved, and the other wild lands in the country are not affected by the provision referred to.\nThese very lands belonged to the Province before confederation, but the right to them was contested by the Dominion Government. A mere dispute does not alter the question of title. And when the matter came before the Privy Council it was decided that the lands were part of the Province of Ontario. The result of that decision reverted back to the time of the passing of the Imperial act. It was just as much the property of the Province all along as it would have been had no dispute arisen.\nWe have the Imperial Act which settles the whole question. All the lands, except those reserved in the act itself, shall belong to the several Provinces. How, then, could the Dominion get a title to these lands? If the transfer from the Indians had never taken place no such question could or would have arisen, and the right of Ontario to the lands now contested would no doubt have been admitted. The mere transfer by the Indians to the Dominion Government of their rights cannot affect the title of Ontario.\nI think, therefore, the right to grant licenses to cut timber on these lands was in no way given to the Dominion Government. If the lands are situate in Ontario they belong to Ontario, under the British North America Act. So that all we have to enquire is: Was the land a part of Ontario at the time of con- federation? If it was, it is in the same position as any other wild lands in Quebec, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick. The Dominion does not claim the lands in those other Provinces, and the mere surrender by the Indians could not give a title to those lands in Ontario.\nAs I stated before, I fully concur in the judgment of the learned Chancellor. If the lands in question belong to Ontario, and the Indian claims had not been extinguished, I maintain that it would be highly unconstitutional for the Dominion to interfere with them, as suggested, by the passage of an act to prohibit the Indians from dealing with the Government of Ontario therefor.\nFor the reasons given, I am of opinion that the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe question involved has been so thoroughly reviewed by the learned Chancellor in the court of first instance, and by the learned judges of the Ontario Court of Appeal, that I feel unable to add to their observations almost anything but useless repetition.\nThere is no doubt of the correctness of the proposition laid down by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, in Breaux v. Johns[115], citing Fletcher v. Pecks, and Johnson v. McIntosh, \u201cthat on the discovery of the American continent the principle was asserted or acknowledged by all European nations, that discovery followed by actual possession gave title to the soil to the Government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, not only against other European Governments but against the natives themselves. While the different nations of Europe respected the rights (I would say the claims) of the natives as occupants, they all asserted the ultimate dominion and title to the soil to be in themselves.\u201d I refer also to Brooks v. Norris[116], Martin v. Johnson[117], and De Armas v. New Orleans[118], in the same court.\nThat such was the case with the French Government in Canada, during its occupancy thereof, is an incontrovertible fact. The King was vested with the ownership of all the ungranted lands in the colony as part of the crown domain, and a royal grant conveyed the full estate and entitled the grantee to possession. The contention, that the royal grants and charters merely asserted a title in the grantees against Europeans or white men, but that they were nothing but blank papers so far as the rights of the natives were concerned, was certainly not then thought of, either in France or in Canada. Neither in the commission or letters patent to the Marquis de la Roche in 1578 and 1598, nor in the charter to the Cent Associ\u00e9s in 1627, nor in the retrocession of the same in 1663, nor in the charter to the West Indies Company in 1664, nor in the retrocession of the same in 1674, by which proprietary Government in Canada came to an end, nor in the six hundred concessions of seigniories extending from the Atlantic to. Lake Superior, made by these companies, or by the Kings themselves, nor in any grant of land whatever during the 225 years of the French domination, can be found even an allusion to, or a mention of, the Indian title.\nOn the contrary, in express terms, de la Roche was authorized to take possession of, and hold as his own property, all lands whatsoever that he might conquer from any one but the allies and confederates of the crown, and, likewise, the charter of the West Indies Company granted them the full ownership of all lands whatsoever, in Canada, which they would conquer, or from which they would drive away the Indians by; force of arms. Such was the spirit of all the royal grants of the period. The King granted lands, seigniories, territories, with the understanding that if any of these lands, seigniories, or territories proved to be occupied by aborigines, on the grantees rested the onus to get rid of them, either by chasing them away by force, or by a more conciliatory policy, as they would think proper. In many instances, no doubt, the grantees, or the King himself, deemed it cheaper or wiser to buy them than to fight them, but that was never construed as a recognition of their right to any legal title whatsoever. The fee and the legal possession were in the King or his grantees.\nNow when by the treaty of 1763, France ceded to Great Britain all her rights of sovereignty, property and possession over Canada, and its islands, lands, places and coasts, including, as admitted at the argument, the lands now in controversy, it is unquestionable that the full title to the territory ceded became vested in the new sovereign, and that he thereafter owned it in allodium as part of the crown domain, in as full and ample a manner as the King of France had previously owned it. That it should be otherwise for the lands now in dispute, I cannot see on what principle. To exclude from the full operation of the cession by France all the lands then occupied by the Indians, would be to declare that not an inch of land thereby passed to the King of England, as, at that time, the whole of the unpatented lands of Canada were in their possession in as full and ample a manner as the 57,000 square miles of the territory in dispute can be said to be in possession of the 26,000 Indians who roam over it.\nNow, when did the Sovereign of Great Britain ever divest himself of the ownership of these lands to vest it in the Indians? When did the title pass from the Sovereign to the Indians? Not by any letters patent. The appellants do not contend that any exist, but they contend that such was the effect of the royal proclamation of the 7th October, 1763. They failed, however, to establish that proposition. I cannot find in that document a single word that can be construed as a grant or to have the operation of a grant. The general provisions of this proclamation, it must not be lost sight of, did not apply to the territory now in controversy, for the Province of Quebec, thereby constituted, was bounded west at Lake Nipissing. But it is argued by the appellant that the following clauses support their contention:\nAnd whereas it is just and reasonable and essential to our interests and the security of our colonies that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our Dominion and Territories, as not having been ceded to or purchased by us, are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds, we do therefore, with the advice of our Privy Council, declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that no governor or commander-in-chief in any of our colonies of Quebec, East Florida or West Florida, do presume, upon any pretence whatever, to grant warrants of survey or pass any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their respective governments as described in their commissions; as also that no governor or commander-in-chief in any of our other colonies or plantations in America do presume, for the present, and until our further pleasure be known, to grant warrants of survey or pass patents for any lands beyond the head or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west and north-west, or upon any lands whatever which, not having been ceded to or purchased by us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians or any of them.\nAnd we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty, protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the lands and territories not included within the limits of our said three new governments, or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company; as also all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlement whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved, without special leave or license for that purpose first obtained.\nNow, as I read these clauses, they, it seems to me, far from supporting the appellants\u2019 case, are entirely adverse to them. First, rather superfluously and unnecessarily, the governors are forbidden to issue any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their respective governments. This applies to crown lands of course. Then the governors are prohibited, for the present, from granting patents for any lands in the territory of the North-West, or for any lands whatever which, not having been ceded to, or purchased by, the crown, are reserved to the Indians or any of them. Now, all this clause necessarily refers to is crown lands not previously conceded or granted; the governors never have been presumed to even grant patents for lands that had previously passed from the crown. It is to crown lands, to lands owned by the crown but occupied by the Indians, that the proclamation refers. The words \u201cfor the present,\u201d in this and the next clause, are equivalent to a reservation by the king of his right, thereafter or at any time, to grant these lands when he would think it proper to do so. He reserves for the present for the use of the Indians all the lands in Canada outside of the limits of the Province of Quebec as then constituted. Is that, in law, granting to these Indians a full title to the soil, a title to these lands? Did the sovereign thereby divest himself of the ownership of this territory? I cannot adopt that conclusion, nor can I see anything in that proclamation that gives to the Indians forever the right in law to the possession of any lands as against the crown. Their occupancy under that document has been one by sufferance only. Their possession has been, in law, the possession of tie crown. At any time before confederation the crown could have granted these lands, or any of them, by letters patent, and the grant would have transferred to the grantee the plenum et utile dominium, with the right to maintain trespass, without entry, against the Indians. A grant of land by the crown is tantamount to conveyance with livery of seisin[119]. This proclamation of 1763 has not, consequently, in my opinion, created a legal Indian title.\nFrom this result of my interpretation of it it is unnecessary, for my determination of this case, to consider how far the sections of the proclamation to which I have alluded, have been affected by the act of 1774[120]. I may, nevertheless, remark, that any right the Indians might have previously had could not, it seems, have been affected by this act, as by its 3rd section it is specially provided and enacted that \u201cnothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to make void, or to vary, or alter, any right, title, or possession derived under any grant, conveyance, or otherwise howsoever, of or to any lands within the said Province, or the Provinces thereto adjoining.\u201d\nIt was further argued for the appellants that the principles which have always guided the crown since the cession in its dealing with the Indians amount to a recognition of their title to a beneficiary interest in the soil. There is, in my opinion, no foundation for this contention. For obvious political reasons, and motives of humanity and benevolence, it has, no doubt, been the general policy of the crown, as it had been at the times of the French authorities, to respect the claims of the Indians. But this, though it unquestionably gives them a title to the favorable consideration of the Government, does not give them any title in law, any title that a court of justice can recognize as against the crown. If the numerous quotations on the subject furnished to us by I appellants from philosophers, publicists, economists and historians, and from official reports and despatches, must be interpreted as recognizing a legal Indian title as against the crown, all I can say of these opinions is, that a careful consideration of the question has led me to a different conclusion.\nThe necessary deduction from such a doctrine would be, that all progress of civilization and development in this country is and always has been at the mercy of the Indian race. Some of the writers cited by the appellants, influenced by sentimental and philanthrophic considerations, do not hesitate to go as far. But legal and constitutional principles are in direct antagonism with their theories. The Indians must in the future, every one concedes it, be treated with the same consideration for their just claims and demands that they have received in the past, but, as in the past, it will not be because of any legal obligation to do so, but as a sacred political obligation, in the execution of which the state must be free from judicial control.\nThe appellants\u2019 contentions, I may here remark, would appear to be supported by some extracts from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, in a case of the Queen v. Symonds (June 1847), which are to be found in the Imperial Parliamentary papers, 1860, vol. XLVII, p. 47, (Colonies New Zealand). But the nature of the Indian title in New Zealand is a peculiar one. Art. 2 of a treaty with the Indians, known as the treaty of Waitangi, guaranteed to them the full exclusive possession of all the lands occupied by them so long as they would desire to retain these lands, and by the interpretation put upon that treaty by the Home Government, it was considered that the Indians had a right of proprietorship over their lands.\nOn the interpretation of the words \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d in section 91 par. 24 of the B.N.A. Act, I adopt the reasoning of the Chancellor and of Chief Justice Hagarty. Even if such lands be specially reserved for the Indians, the title is in the Crown[121].\nThe Territory in dispute is not \u201creserved for the Indians\u201d in the sense of these words as contained in that section. And even if the Indians had any interest\u2019 in it, that would not affect the Province of Ontario\u2019s claim to it, as then the Province would, under the very words of section 109 of the B.N.A. Act, hold it subject to that interest.\nAs regards the question considered by Mr Justice Burton, whether or not the Lieutenant Governor in each Province is, as Her Majesty\u2019s representative under the B.N.A Act, the only party who could extinguish the so called Indian title, if any there be, I refrain from expressing any opinion, for the reason that the point does not come up for our determination, and consequently that anything I might say about it would be entirely obiter\nWere these lands at confederation crown lands, or the private property of the Indians, is the abstract question to be determined. I am of opinion that they were crown lands, and consequently that under sections 109 and 117 of the B.N.A. Act they belong, as before confederation, to the Province of Ontario and form part of its public domain by title paramount.\nGWYNNE J. In 1763 the Board of Trade made a report to His then Majesty King George the 3rd, wherein they suggested a plan for the future management of Indian Affairs in His Majesty\u2019s possessions in North America.\nThe plan suggested in this report was approved by His Majesty, and to give effect to it the proclamation of the 7th October, 1763, was issued, wherein is contained a declaration of His Majesty\u2019s Royal intentions towards the tribes of Indians in His Majesty\u2019s North American possessions. In that proclamation are contained the following passages[122]:\nIt has been argued that the above passages extracted from the proclamation, had no effect within the limits of the then Province of Quebec, although that Province is specially mentioned in the proclamation. This argument was founded upon the contention, that the Indians were never recognised by the French Kings as having any estate, right, or title in the lands situate within the limits of the French possessions in North America, and that the English title to those lands being derived from the treaty of Paris of 1763, the title of the Crown of England to the lands ceded by the French King by that treaty is the same as the title which the Kings of France formerly had.\nIt may be admitted that the Kings of France recognised no title in the Indians in any part of the territory in the possession of the Kings of France, whose mode of dealing with the Indians was to make, ex grati\u00e2, crown grants of land for their conversion, instruction, and subsistence, but the fact that the Kings of France so dealt with the Indians presented no obstacle to the Sovereign of Great Britain, upon acquiring the French title, placing the Indians upon a more just and equitable footing, and recognizing their having a certain title, estate and interest in the lands so acquired by the Crown of Great Britain; and in point of fact this proclamation, ever since its issue, has been faithfully observed in its integrity; as well within the limits of the then Province of Quebec as in all other the British possessions in North America. At the time of the cession by the French the greater part of that portion of French Canada which now constitutes the Province of Quebec had been already granted by the French Kings To lands so granted the proclamation, of course, had no application, but outside of those granted lands, if there were any Indians claiming title their rights, as declared in the proclamation, were respected.\nBy the Haldimand papers in the Canadian Archives it appears that in December, 1766, one Philibot, having an order of his Majesty in Council, dated the 18th June 1766, directed to the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Province of Quebec, for a grant of 20,000 acres in that Province, petitioned the Governor, praying that the grant might be assigned to him on the Restigouche at a place indicated by him, and the Committee of Council at Quebec having taken the matter of the petition into consideration reported that the lands so prayed to be granted to the petitioner were or were claimed to be the property of the Indians, and as such, by His Majesty\u2019s express command as set forth in his proclamation of 1763, not \u201cwithin their power to grant.\u201d It is with that part of French Canada which now constitutes the Province of Ontario that we are at present concerned, and so inviolably has the proclamation been observed therein that it, together with the Royal instructions given to the Governors as to its strict enforcement, may, not inaptly, be termed the Indian Bill of Rights. By an order of His Majesty and Council, dated at St James\u2019, May 4th, 1768, transmitted to the Honorable Thomas Gage, Major-General and Commander-in-Chief of all His Majesty\u2019s Forces in North America, he was ordered to\nPut Lieut. George McDougal, late of the 60th Regt., in possession of Hogg Island situate in Detroit River, three miles above the Fort of Detroit \u201cprovided that it can be done without umbrage to the Indians,\u201d and upon consideration that the Improvements projected by McDougal be directed to the more easy and effectual supply of His Majesty\u2019s Fort and Garrison maintained at Detroit.\nThe mode adopted on this occasion to extinguish the Indian title was, that General Gage forwarded the order to Capt. Turnbull, commanding at Detroit, with the following instructions as to the execution of it;\u2014\nAs Mr. McDougal\u2019s occupying these lands depends on the sufferance of the Indians who have claims thereto, it will be necessary that those Indians should be collected by the friends of Mr. McDougal and publicly signify to you, or rather give a written acknowledgment of, their consenting to the cession of these lands in favor of Mr. McDougal.\nThis must be a solemn act, performed in your presence by Indians concerned in the property of these lands, to which they must sign the mark of their tribes, and you will certify the same to be done by you, under my authority and in your presence; their permission at the same time must be had to people the Islands for cultivation, for every necessary particular should be mentioned in the writing for the cession of these lands, and the whole fully and distinctly explained to the Indians to prevent future claims or disputes.\nIn pursuance of the above instructions an indenture inter partes was made and executed by and between those chiefs of the Ottawa and Chippewa nations of Indians, of the one part, and George McDougal, of the other part, whereby it was witnessed that the said chiefs, for themselves and by the consent of the whole of the said nations of Indians, for and in consideration of property to the value of \u00a3194. 10s., thereby acknowledged to have been received, did grant, bargain, sell, alien and confirm unto the said George McDougal, his heirs and assigns for ever, the said island in the Detroit river, about three miles above the fort, that he might settle, cultivate and otherwise employ it to his and his Majesty\u2019s advantage, together with the houses, out- houses and appurtenances whatsoever to the said island, messuage or tenement and premises belonging or in any wise appertaining, and the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders, rents and services of the said premises and every part thereof, and all the estate, right, title, claim and demand whatsoever of them the said Indians of, in and to the said messuage, tenement and premises and every part thereof, to have and to hold the said messuage, and all and singular the said premises above mentioned, and every part and parcel thereof, with the appurtenances, unto the said George McDougal, his heirs and assigns for ever, and the said chiefs did thereby engage themselves, their heirs, their nations, &c., forever to warrant and defend the property of the said island unto the said George McDougal, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns for ever. In 1784 Governor Haldimand purchased from the Mississagas what is known as the Grand. River tract and settled thereon the Six Nations Indians who, shortly after the close of the revolutionary war, removed from their settlements in the State of New York into Canada.\nIn a letter dated at Quebec, the 26th April, 1784, addressed by Governor Haldimand to Lieut.\u2011Governor Hay on his departure from Quebec to enter upon his government, is the following paragraph defining his duty in relation to the Indians and their lands:\nThe mode of acquiring lands by what is called Deeds of Gift is to be entirely discontinued, for, by the King\u2019s instructions, no Private Person, Society, Corporation or Colony is capable of acquiring any property in lands belonging to the Indians, either by purchase, or grant or conveyance from the Indians, excepting only where the lands lie within the limits of any colony the soil of which has been vested in Proprietaries or Corporations by grants from the Crown; in which cases such Proprietaries or Corporations only shall be capable of acquiring such property by purchase or grants from the Indians. It is also necessary to observe to you that, by the King\u2019s instructions, no purchase of lands belonging to the Indians, whether in the name of or for the use of the Crown, be made, but at some general meeting, at which the Principal Chiefs of each Tribe claiming a property in such lands shall be present.\nIn 1781 the form adopted for the surrender of the Island of Michilimakinak was a deed poll whereby four chiefs of the Chippawa nation, on behalf of themselves and all others of their nation the Chippewas \u201cwho have or can lay claim to the said Island,\u201d surrendered and yielded up the said Island into the hands of Lieutenant Governor Sinclair for the behalf and use of His Majesty George the third, &c., &c., and his heirs for ever, and they did thereby make for themselves and posterity a renunciation of all claims in future to said Island. The deed contains the following clause:\nAnd we have signed two deeds of this tenor and date in the presence of (naming seven persons), one of which deeds is to remain with the Government of Canada and the other to remain at this post to certify the same, and we promise to preserve in our village a Belt of Wampum of seven feet in length to perpetuate, secure, and be a lasting memorial of the said transaction to our nation forever hereafter, and that no defect in this deed for want of law forms, or any other, shall invalidate the same.\nThis deed is signed by the Chiefs with their totems, according to Indian custom, and by the Lieutenant Governor and a Captain, Lieutenant and Ensign of the 8th regiment. The last clause in the deed seems to have been inserted with the design of shewing on the face of the deed that the transaction had been authorised in a council of the nation. The obtaining such authority in the first place was the invariable custom, and then a deed was executed for the purpose of evidencing the transaction\u2019 which the nation had authorised in council.\nBy the deed of surrender of about two million (2,000,000) acres along the shore of Lake Erie, executed on the 19th May, 1790, it appears to have been executed in a full Council of the Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottowatani and Huron Nations, which was attended by the Commanding Officer at Detroit, with a large staff of his officers as representing the crown, and in their presence as subscribing witnesses the deed is executed in the Indian manner by eight Chiefs of the Ottawa, eight of the Chippewa, six of the Pottowatani and thirteen of the Huron Nations.\nThe deed is in the form of a deed-poll, commencing:\nKnow all men by these presents that we, the principal Village and War Chiefs of the Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottowatani and Huron Nations, for and in consideration, &c. Have, by and with the consent of the whole of our said Nations, Given, granted, enfeoffed, alienated and confirmed, And by these presents do give, grant, enfeoff, alien and confirm unto His Majesty George III, King, &c., &c., a certain tract of land (describing it) To Have and to hold to the only proper use and behoof of His said Majesty, his Heirs and Successors for ever.\nThe deed contained a covenant for quiet enjoyment as follows:\u2014\nAnd we the said Chiefs for ourselves and the whole of our said Nations, and their Heirs, do covenant, promise and agree to and with his said Majesty (for quiet enjoyment by his Majesty, his heirs and Successors).\nAnd then concludes:\nAnd by these presents do make this our act and deed irrevocable under any pretence whatever, and have put his said Majesty in full possession and seizin by allowing houses to be built upon the premises.\nThe deed appears to have been recorded in the office of the clerk of the crown, in the district of Hesse, on the 22nd day of June, 1790.\nOn the 7th of December, 1792, a deed was executed which purports to be an indenture made between Five Chiefs of the Mississaga Indian Nation, of the one part, and our Sovereign Lord George the 3rd, King, &c., &c., of the other part, which recites an indenture, bearing date the 22nd of May, 1784, made between the ten persons (naming them and describing them as Sachems, War Chiefs and principal Women of the Mississaga Indian Nation), of the one part, and our said Sovereign Lord George the third, King, &c., &c., of the other part, whereby the said Sachems, principal Chiefs and Women, in consideration of \u00a31180, 7s. 4d., lawful money of Great Britain, did grant, bargain, sell, alien, release and confirm unto his said Majesty, his Heirs and Successors (certain lands therein particularly described); it then recites that there was found to be a certain error in that description, and that it was necessary and expedient that the boundary lines of the said parcel of land should be accurately laid down and described, the said chiefs, therefore, parties to the said deed of December, 1792, did thereby acknowledge and declare\nThat the true and real description of the said tract or parcel of land so bargained, sold, aliened and transferred by and to the parties aforesaid is all that tract or parcel of land lying and being, &c. (describing it by a corrected description), and therefore the said five chiefs (naming them) in consideration of the aforesaid sum of \u00a31180 7s. 4d., so paid as therein aforesaid, and of the further sum of five shillings to them in hand paid and for the better ratifying and confirming the thereinbefore recited indenture, did grant, bargain, sell and confirm unto his Majesty, his heirs and successors, all that tract of land (describing it by the corrected description), to have and to hold to His Majesty, his heirs and successors for ever.\nThe deed then contains the clause following:\nAnd whereas at a conference held by John Collins and William R. Crawford, Esquires, with the principal chiefs of the Mississaga nation (Mr, John Rousseau as interpreter) it was unanimously agreed that the king shall have a right to make roads through the Mississaga country; that the navigation of the said rivers and lakes shall be open and free for his vessels and those of his subjects; that the king\u2019s subjects should carry on a free trade, unmolested, in and through the country; now this indenture doth hereby ratify and confirm the said conference and agreement so had between the parties aforesaid, giving and granting to his said Majesty power and right to make roads through the said Mississaga country, together with the navigation of the said rivers and lakes for his vessels and those of his subjects trading thereon free and unmolested. In witness whereof the chiefs, on the part of the Mississaga nation, and His Excellency John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant Governor of the said province, &c., on the part of His Britannic Majesty, have hereunto set their hands and seals, &c., &c. The deed is executed by the four chiefs and the. Lieutenant Governor,,\nIn the interval between the years 1792 and 1836. many instruments similar in character, some in the form of deeds poll by way of grant and surrender, and others in form of deeds of bargain and sale, were from time to time executed by the Indians in the customary Indian manner, whereby divers large tracts of country situate within the Province of Upper Canada were granted, and surrendered, and sold, and transferred to the reigning sovereign for the time being in pursuance of resolutions passed in solemn councils of the respective nations of Indians occupying and claiming title to the lands so granted and surrendered. One of those deeds, which was executed by the Mississagas of the Bay of Quint\u00e9 in 1835, when we reflect that the form of those surrenders has been in every case devised by officials acting on behalf of the crown, and not by the Indians themselves is very instructive as to the light in which the Indian title has always been regarded by the crown. It is as follows:\nKnow all men by these presents that we (here follows the names of five Indians), sachems and chief warriors of the Mississaga tribe of Indians of the Bay of Quint\u00e9, in the Province of Upper Canada, in consideration of the trust and confidence by us reposed in His Most Gracious Majesty King William the Fourth, and in order that His said Most Gracious Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, may grant and dispose of the lands and tenements hereinafter comprised and described for the benefit of the said Indians, in such manner and form, and at such price or prices, as to His Majesty His Heirs and Successors shall seem best, do remise, release, surrender, quit claim and yield up unto His Majesty King William the Fourth, his Heirs and Successors, all and singular those certain parcels of land (&c. &c., &c., describing them) to the end, intent, and purpose that the said lands and premises shall and may be granted and disposed of by His said Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, in trust, for the benefit of the said Indians and upon and for no other use, trust and intent or purpose whatsoever. In witness whereof we the said Sachems and Chief Warriors of the said Indians have hereunto set our hand& and seals at Grape Island, in the Province aforesaid, the 15th December, 1835.\nThe deed is executed by the five Chiefs in the presence of J.B. Clench, then Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and two others.\nIn the month of August, 1836, Sir Francis Head, then Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, deeming the resolution of the Indians in council assembled to be the material element in effectuating the extinction of the Indian title, dispensed with the subsequent execution of any deed, and obtained the surrender to the crown of several large tracts of country by submitting certain propositions in writing (containing terms of surrender) to the Indians, to be considered by them in council, which, upon being approved and signed by the Chiefs in council assembled, constituted the surrenders. In his reports communicating the surrenders to Lord Glenelg, then Colonial Secretary, the Lieutenant Governor, after enumerating the tracts of land so acquired, says:\u2014\nI have thus obtained for his Majesty\u2019s Government from the Indians an immense portion of most valuable land.\nAlthough the opinion entertained by Sir Francis Head that the act of the Indians in Council was all that was necessary to effectuate the surrenders may be admitted to be correct, still in point of fact this would seem to have been the only occasion upon which deeds were dispensed with\u2014unless the surrender by the Saugeen and Owen Sound Indians in 1854 can be considered another. The resolution in council in that case seems to have been prepared with the view of serving both as the resolution in council and a deed of surrender, for it is framed in the form of a deed\u2014and, indeed, all the resolutions of the Indians in their councils, being signed by the Chiefs with their totems according to Indian custom, may be regarded as deeds. The surrender of 1854 above referred is in the following form:\u2014 We the Chiefs, Sachems and Principal men of the Indian tribes resident at Saugeen and Owen Sound confiding in the wisdom and protecting care of our Great Mother across the Big Lake, and believing that our good Father, His Excellency the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, Governor General of Canada, is anxiously desirous to promote those interests which will most largely conduce to the welfare of his Red children, have now, being in full Council assembled, in presence of the Superintendent General of Indian affairs and of the young men of both tribes, agreed that it will be highly desirable for us to make a full and complete surrender to the Crown of that Peninsula known as the Saugeen and Owen Sound Indian Reserve, subject to certain restrictions and Reservations to be hereinafter set forth.\nWe have therefore set our marks to this document, after having heard the same read to us, and do hereby surrender the whole of the above named tract of country, bounded &c., with the following reservations, to wit\u2014\nthen followed those paragraphs describing three several blocks of land out of the tract, one for the occupation of the Saugeen Indians, another for the occupation of the Owen Sound Indians, and the third for the occupation of the Colpoy\u2019s Bay Indians.\nThe instrument then proceeded:\nAll which reserves we hereby retain to ourselves and our children in perpetuity. And it is agreed that the interest of the principal sum arising out of the sale of our lands shall be regularly paid, so long as there are Indians left to represent our tribe, without diminution, at half yearly periods. And we hereby request the sanction of our Great Father, the Governor General, to this surrender, which we consider highly conducive to our general interests. It is understood that no islands are included in this surrender.\nThis instrument was executed under the respective hands and seals of the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs and of the several chiefs, sachems, and principal men of the tribe.\nIn the interval between 1886 and the passing of the British North America Act several surrenders of large tracts of land were made by the Indians to the crown by deeds executed by the chiefs and principal men of the tribes of Indians occupying and claiming title to such lands. In some of the instruments so executed the Indians specially reserved to their own use and occupation, from the operation of the deeds of surrender, certain specified tracts within the limits of the tracts as described in the instruments. In some cases the surrenders were made, as in that of 1854 above set out, upon the express condition and trust that the monies to be realized from sale of the lands surrendered should be applied by the crown for the benefit of the Indians.\nNow, in 1837, an act, 7 Wm. 4 ch. 118, was passed by the Legislature of the Province of Upper Canada, entituled \u201cAn Act to provide for the disposal of the Public lands in this Province and other purposes therein mentioned.\u201d\nThe act was passed for regulating the issue of Letters Patent granting lands known as and designated \u201ccrown lands,\u201d \u201cclergy reserves\u201d and \u201cschool lands,\u201d all of which lands were placed under the control of an officer styled the commissioner of crown lands, and the proceeds arising from the sale thereof were to be accounted for by him to the Receiver General, as forming part of the public revenue of the Province. The act did not affect any lands for the cession of which to His Majesty no agreement had been made with the Indian Tribes occupying and claiming title to the same, nor any lands which, although surrendered by the Indians to the crown, were so surrendered for the purpose of being sold and the proceeds applied for the maintenance of and benefit of the Indians themselves. These lands were all designated Indian lands, and the sale of those surrendered to be sold for the benefit of the Indians themselves, and the management and investment of the proceeds arising from their sale, were placed by the crown under the management of a special officer called the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who was under the direct super- vision of the Lieutenant Governor for the time being as representing Her Majesty, and who was accountable to the Imperial Treasury Department. The term \u201cpublic lands,\u201d as used in the act in relation to lands known as \u201ccrown lands,\u201d \u201cclergy reserves\u201d and \u201cschool lands,\u201d as distinguished from those known as \u201cIndian lands,\u201d has been maintained in several acts of the legislature of the Province of Upper Canada, viz., 4 and 5 Vic. ch. 100, 16 Vic ch. 159, Consolidated Statutes of Canada ch. 22, 23 Vic. ch. 2 and 23 Vic. ch. 151. By this last act it was enacted, that from and after the 1st day of July, 1861, the Commissioner of Crown lands for the time being should be Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and that all lands reserved for the Indians, or for any tribe or band of Indians, or held in trust for their benefit, should be deemed to be reserved and held for the same purposes as before the passing of the act, but subject to its provisions, and that no release or surrender of lands reserved for the use of the Indians, or of any tribe or band of Indians, should be valid except upon condition that such release or surrender should be assented to by the chief or, if more than one chief, by a majority of the chiefs of the tribe or band of Indians assembled at a meeting or council of the tribe or band summoned for that purpose according to their rules and entitled to vote thereat, and held in the presence of an officer duly authorised to attend such council by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and that nothing in the act contained should render valid any release or surrender other than to the crown; and it was further enacted that\u2014\nThe Governor in Council may, from time to time, declare the provisions of the act respecting the sale and management of \u201cthe public lands,\u201d passed in the present session, or of the twenty-third chapter of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the sale and management of the timber on public lands\u201d or any of such provisions, to apply to Indian lands or to the timber on Indian lands, and the same shall thereupon apply and have effect as if they were expressly recited or embodied in this act.\nThe inviolable manner in which the Indian title as declared by the Proclamation of 1763 has been recognised amply justifies the language of the commissioners appointed by the crown to report upon Indian affairs in the Province of Upper Canada in 1842 and 1856. The former commissioners in their report say:\u2014\nThe Proclamation of His Majesty George the third issued in 1763 furnished the Indians with a fresh guarantee for the possession of their hunting grounds and the protection of the crown. This document the Indians look upon as their charter. They have preserved a copy of it to the present time, and have referred to it on several occasions in their representations to the Government.\nAnd again:\u2014\nSince 1763 the Government, adhering to the Royal Proclamation of that year, have not considered themselves entitled to dispossess the Indians of their lands without entering into an agreement with them and rendering them some compensation.\nThe commissioners of 1856 in their report say;\u2014\nBy the Proclamation of 1763 territorial rights, akin to those asserted by Sovereign Princes, are recognised as belonging to the Indians, that is to say, that none of their land can be alienated save by treaty made publicly between the crown and them. Later, however, as this was found insufficient to check the whites from entering into bargains with the Indians for portions of their lands or for the timber growing thereon, it has been found necessary to pass stringent enactments for the protection of the Indian Reserves.\nAfter the most explicit recognition by the crown of the Indian title for upwards of a century in the most solemn manner\u2014by treaties entered into between the crown and the Indian nations in council assembled according to their national custom, and by deeds of cession to the crown and of purchase by the crown, prepared by officers of the crown for execution by the Indians\u2014it cannot, in my opinion, admit of a doubt that at the time of the passing of the British North America Act the Indians in Upper Canada were acknowledged by the crown to have, and that they had, an estate, title and interest in all lands in that part of the Province of Canada formerly constituting Upper Canada for the cession of which to the crown no agreement had been made with the nations or tribes occupying the same as their hunting grounds, or claiming title thereto, which estate, title and interest could be divested or extinguished in no other manner than by cession made in the most solemn manner to the crown. These cessions were made sometimes upon purchases made by the crown for the use of the public, in which case the lands so acquired became \u201cPublic lands\u201d because the revenue to be derived from their sale was appropriated for the benefit of the public and was paid into the Provincial Treasury. Sometimes the cessions were made to the crown upon trust for sale and investment of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians themselves, and sometimes upon trust to grant to some person upon whom the Indians desired to confer a benefit for special services rendered to them; but all such lands, until the cession thereof should be made by the Indians to the crown, constituted what were known as and designated \u201cIndian Reserves,\u201d \u201cLands reserved for the Indians,\u201d or \u201cIndian lands.\u201d It is the lands not ceded to or purchased by the crown which are spoken of in the proclamation of 1763 as the lands reserved to the Indians for their hunting ground\u2014and the unceded lands have ever since been known by the designation \u201cLands reserved for the Indians\u201d or \u201cIndian Reserves.\u201d\nWhen the Indians in the deeds or treaties by way of cession of land to the crown reserved from out of the general description of the lands given in the instruments of cession, as they often did, certain particularly described portions of the lands so generally described, for the special uses, occupation or residence of particu- lar bands, the parts so reserved did not come under the operation of the deed or treaty of cession, but were reserved and excepted out of it and so continued to be just as they were before, lands not ceded to, or purchased by, the crown, and therefore remained still within the designation of \u201cLands reserved for the Indians,\u201d or \u201cIndian Reserves.\u201d\nIt was not the exception of the particular parcels from the operation of the instrument of cession which made such parts come within designation of \u201cLands reserved for Indians\u201d or \u201cIndian Reserves,\u201d but because, being so excepted, they remained in the position they were before, namely, lands not yet ceded to or purchased by the crown.\nNow the lands upon which the timber which is the subject of this suit was cut, although admitted to have been within the limits of the old Province of Upper Canada, were, at the time of the passing of the B.N.A. Act, lands for the cession of which to Her Majesty no agreement had been made with the Indian Nations or Tribes occupying the same as their hunting ground and claiming title thereto; the lands had not been ceded to or purchased by the crown; they were not therefore \u201cPublic lands\u201d within the meaning of the statutes above referred to, viz;\u20144 and 5 Vic. ch. 100, 16 Vic. ch. 159, C.S.C. ch. 22, or 23 Vic. ch. 2. It was not competent for the Provincial Government to have sold the lands or any part thereof, for the lands, not having been yet ceded to or purchased by the crown, did not come under the designation of \u201cCrown Lands\u201d within the meaning of the above acts. No revenue could have been derived from the land which could have passed to the Province of Canada under the statute of 1846\u20149 Vic. ch. 114\u2014by which the crown surrendered to the Provincial Legislature in exchange for a civil list all the casual and territorial revenue of the crown. The Indians, whenever they should cede those lands to the crown might cede them only upon trust for sale and investment of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians themselves, so that the public might never acquire any interest whatever in the monies arising from the sale of the lands.\nFrom these considerations it follows, in my opinion, as an incontrovertible proposition, that in lands situate as those lands were at the time of the passing of the B.N.A. Act, namely, lands which had not been ceded by the Indians to the crown, the province or government of Ontario did not acquire by that act any vested interest. The lands did not come within item No. 5 of section 92, nor within section 109 of the act, but did, in my opinion, come within item 24 of section 91, which placed \u201cIndians\u201d and \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d under the legislative control of the Dominion Parliament. The B.N.A. Act did not contemplate making, and has not made, any alteration in the relations existing of old between the Indians and his Majesty, either in respect of the estate, title, and interest of the former in their lands not yet ceded to the crown, or indeed in respect of any other matter, further than to place all matters affecting the Indians under the control and administration of her Majesty\u2019s government of the Dominion of Canada and the parliament of the Dominion. The provincial government or legislature having been given no control whatever over Indian affairs, the power of entering into a treaty or agreement with the Indians for obtaining from them a cession of the lands in question became vested in her Majesty, freed from the operation of the Canada statute, 23 Vic. ch. 151, which became null and of no further validity. The B.N.A. Act having removed the Indians and their affairs wholly from under the management of a provincial Commissioner of Crown Lands, such an officer could no longer be Chief Superintendent of Affairs. The authorities of the Province of Ontario are invested by the B.N.A. Act with no jurisdiction whatever over the Indians, their lands or their affairs. All these matters are by the act placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion authorities. The power, therefore, of entering into a treaty between her Majesty and the Indians for the cession to her Majesty of their acknowledged title to any territory within the limits of the province not yet ceded to the crown can, since the passing of the B.N.A. Act, be exercised only either under the authority of an act of the Dominion Parliament or, in the absence of such an act, by her Majesty acting through the instrumentality of the Governor General of the Dominion as her representative and the Dominion Government, in whom and in the Indians claiming title to the land to be ceded must be vested the right of arranging the terms of the treaty of cession. It was in this manner that her Majesty did enter into the treaty with the Indians for the cession of the lands upon which the timber grew the right to which is in question now.\nIn the year 1873 a commission was issued by the Dominion Government to the Honorable Alexander Morris, then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, Lieut.-Colonel Provencher, then Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and S.J. Dawson, Esq., then a member of the Dominion House of Commons, appointing them commissioners upon behalf of her Majesty to treat with the Indians for the surrender to the crown of the lands now under consideration, and at a council of the Indians held in the month of October, 1873, after three days\u2019 spent in negotiating the terms of the cession, a treaty was concluded in the following terms:\nArticles of treaty made and concluded this third day of October, 1873, between Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by her commissioners, the Honorable Alexander Morris, Lieutenant\u2011Governor of the Province of Manitoba and the North-West Territories, Joseph Albert Herbert Provencher and Simon James Dawson, of the one part, and the Saulteaux tribe of Ojibbeway Indians, inhabitants of the country hereinafter defined and described by their chiefs chosen and named as hereinafter mentioned, of the other part.\nThe treaty then recites the assembling in council of the Indians inhabiting the territory, and the appointment by them in council of twenty-four chiefs and head men (naming them) to conduct on their behalf negotiations for a treaty with her Majesty\u2019s commissioners, and to sign any treaty to be founded upon such negotiations, and that the said commissioners and the said Indians had finally agreed upon and concluded a treaty as follows:\u2014\nThe Saulteaux tribe of the Ojibbeway Indians and all other the Indians inhabiting the district hereinafter described and defined do hereby cede, release, surrender, and yield up to the government of the Dominion of Canada, for Her Majesty the Queen and her successors forever, all their rights, title and privileges whatsoever to the lands included within the following limits, that is to say:\n(Here follows a description of the lands).\nTo have and to hold the same to Her Majesty the Queen and her successors for ever. And Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees and undertakes to lay aside reserves for farming lands, due respect being had to lands at present cultivated by the said Indians, and also to lay aside and reserve for the benefit of the said Indians, to be administered and dealt with for them by Her Majesty\u2019s Government of the Dominion of Canada, in such manner as shall seem best, other reserves of land in the said territory hereby ceded, which said reserves shall be selected and set aside where it shall be deemed most convenient and advantageous for each band of Indians by the officers of the said government appointed for that purpose, and such selection shall be so made after conference with the Indians. Provided, however, that such reserve, whether for farming or other purposes, shall in nowise exceed one square mile for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families, and such selection shall be made if possible during the course of next summer, or as soon thereafter as may be found practicable, it being understood, however, that if, at the time of any such selection of any reserves as aforesaid, there are any settlers within the bounds of the lands reserved by any Band, Her Majesty reserves the right to deal with such settlers as she shall deem just, so as not to diminish the extent of land allotted to the Indians, and provided also, that the aforesaid reserves of lands, or any interest or right therein or appurtenant thereto, may be sold leased or otherwise disposed of by the said Government for the use and benefit of the said Indians with the consent of the Indians entitled thereto first had and obtained.\nAnd with a view to shew the satisfaction of Her Majesty with the behaviour and good conduct of her Indians she hereby, through her Commissioners, makes them a present of twelve dollars for each man, woman and child belonging to the bands here represented, in extinguishment of all claims heretofore preferred.\nAnd further Her Majesty agrees to maintain Schools for instruction in such reserves hereby made as to her government of her Dominion of Canada may seem advisable, whenever the Indians of the reserve shall desire it.\nHer Majesty further agrees with her said Indians, that within the boundary of Indian Reserves, until otherwise determined by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, no intoxicating liquor shall be allowed to be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force, or hereafter to be enacted, to preserve her Indian subjects inhabiting the reserves, or living elsewhere within her North-West territories, from the evil use of intoxicating liquors, shall be strictly enforced.\nHer Majesty further agrees with her said Indians that they the said Indians shall have the right to pursue their avocations of hunting and fishing throughout the tract surrendered as hereinbefore described, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be made by her Government of the Dominion of Canada, and saving and excepting such tracts as may from time to time be required or taken up for settlement, mining, lumbering or other purposes by her said Government of the Dominion of Canada, or by any of the subjects thereof duly authorised therefor by the said Government.\nIt is further agreed between Her Majesty and her said Indians that such sections of the reserves above indicated as may at any time be required for public works or building of what nature soever, may be appropriated for that purpose by Her Majesty\u2019s Government of the Dominion of Canada, due compensation being made for the value of any improvements thereon.\nAnd further, that Her Majesty\u2019s Commissioners shall, as soon as possible after the execution of this treaty, cause to be taken an accurate census of all the Indians inhabiting the tracts above described, distributing them in families, and shall in every year ensuing the date hereof, at some period in each year to be duly notified to the lndians, and at a place or places to be appointed for that purpose within the territory ceded, pay to each Indian person the sum of Five Dollars per head yearly.\nIt is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians that the sum of fifteen hundred dollars per annum shall be yearly and every year expended by Her Majesty in the purchase of amunition and twine for nets for the use of the said Indians.\nIt is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians that the following articles shall be supplied to any Band of the said Indians who are now actually cultivating the soil, or who shall hereafter commence to cultivate the land, that is to say (here follows the enumeration of several agricultural implements).\nAll the aforesaid articles to be given once for all for the encouragement of the practice of agriculture among the Indians.\nIt is further agreed between Her Majesty and the said Indians that each Chief duly recognized as such shall receive an annual salary of twenty-five dollars per annum, and each subordinate officer not exceeding three for each Band shall receive fifteen dollars per annum; and each such Chief and subordinate officer as aforesaid shall also receive once in every three years a suitable suit of clothing; and each Chief shall receive, in recognition of the closing of this treaty, a suitable flag and medal.\nAnd the undersigned chiefs, on their own behalf and on behalf of all other Indians inhabiting the tract within ceded, do hereby solemnly promise and engage to strictly observe this treaty, and also to conduct and behave themselves as good and loyal subjects of Her Majesty the Queen. They promise and engage that they will in all respects obey and abide by the law; that they will maintain peace and good order between each other, and also between themselves and other tribes of Indians, and between themselves and other subjects of Her Majesty, whether Indians or Whites, now inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit any part of the said ceded tract; and that they will not molest the person or property of any inhabitant of such ceded tract, or the property of Her Majesty the Queen, or interfere with or trouble any person passing or travelling through the said tract or any part thereof; and that they will aid and assist the officers of Her Majesty in bringing to justice and punishment any Indian offending against the stipulations of this treaty, or infringing the laws in force in the country so ceded.\nIn witness whereof Her Majesty\u2019s said Commissioners and the said Indian Chiefs have hereunto subscribed and set their hands at the North-west angle of the Lake of the Woods the day and year first herein above mentioned.\nThe treaty is thus co-executed by the three Commissioners and the twenty-four Indian chiefs, in the presence of seventeen persons who subscribe their names as witnesses to the signatures of the several parties, and to the fact of the treaty having been first read over and explained by the Honorable James McKay. Now it is to be observed, that the faith of Her Majesty is solemnly pledged to the faithful observance of this treaty, and the government of the Dominion of Canada is made the instrument by which the obligations contained in it, which are incurred by and on behalf of Her Majesty, are to be fulfilled. The land ceded supplies the primary and indeed the only source from which the funds required to maintain the schools contemplated by the treaty, and to meet all the other pecuniary payments and obligations incurred, can be raised. The benefits received and to be received by the Indians under the treaty are in effect so many fruits issuing from their own acknowledged estate and interest in the lands ceded. The administration and management of the estate constituting the source from which the funds required to meet the obligations incurred by the treaty must remain under the control of the Dominion of Canada, which alone, by the B.N.A. Act, has jurisdiction in relation to the Indians and their affairs, at least until a sum shall be realized which, in the judgment of Her Majesty\u2019s government of the Dominion having the obligations of the treaty imposed upon them, shall be deemed sufficient to supply for all time to come the necessary funds. That portion of the ceded territory which shall be composed of the contemplated reserves, equal in extent to one square mile for every family of five, if sold, being to be sold for the benefit of the Indians themselves, must be sold by the Dominion Government, upon whom is imposed the duty of investing and administering the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians interested in each particular parcel; but if the contention of the Province of Ontario is to prevail the whole ceded tract, which constitutes the source from which alone the obligations incurred by the Dominion Government by the treaty can be fulfilled, becomes upon the passing of the B.N.A. Act and by force of that act absolutely and exclusively the property of the Province of Ontario, and therefore the Dominion of Canada have not and cannot have any control over these lands either for the purposes of the treaty or any other purpose. The Dominion, therefore, can have no control over, nor can the Indians have any interest in, the reserves contemplated in the treaty of one square mile for every family of five. If any part of the ceded tract became by the B.N.A. Act the property of the Province of Ontario, as is contended, these reserves did equally with all other parts, for all of it was then in the same condition, and the contention of the Province in substance and effect is, that by force of the B.N.A. Act the whole territory, upon the passing of that act, became the property of the Province of Ontario, and that therefore no part of it, not even the contemplated reserves, can be affected by the terms of the treaty, which cannot affect the rights acquired by the Province under the B.N.A. Act. To obtain a judicial decision to the above effect, by what appears to me a strange procedure, Her Majesty\u2019s name is used by the Province for the purpose of having the treaty which has been solemnly entered into by Her Majesty with the Indians, and for the faithful observance of which Her Majesty is solemnly pledged to the Indians, declared to be void and of none effect.\nThe learned Chancellor of Ontario, in his judgment pronounced in this case, draws from certain language of mine in Church v. Fenton[123] the conclusion that the lands now under consideration cannot come within item 24 of sec. 91 of the British North America Act as \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d but that Ianguage, read in the sense which was intended by me, leads to the contrary conclusion. The contention of the plaintiff in that case was, that the land in question there, which was part of the tract ceded by the Saugeen and Owen Sound Indians by the above recited treaty of 1854, did come within that item, and that therefore it was not liable to be sold for mere payment of taxes. The point adjudged was, that from the time that a contract of sale of the lot in question to a purchaser was entered into by the chief superintendent of Indian affairs, after the cession by the Indians of the land for sale for their benefit, the interest of the purchaser became liable to taxation precisely as the interest of a purchaser of crown lands would be, and that the patent for the lands in question having been issued to the purchaser before the sale for taxes under which the defendant claimed took place, the title of the defendant under that sale must prevail. In the course of my judgment I expressed the opinion that lands surrendered by the Indians, as the tract under consideration there was, for the purpose of being sold, although when sold the proceeds arising from the sale were to be applied for the benefit of the Indians, did not come within the designation of \u201clands reserved for the Indians\u201d within item 24 of sec. 91 of the British North America Act, that expression being, as I thought, more appropriate in relation to \u201cunsurrendered lands\u201d than to lands in which the Indian title had been extinguished.\nLands for the cession of which to Her Majesty no agreement had been made with the tribes occupying and claiming title to the same, and which were situate within the limits of the old Province of Upper Canadas have always been, in my opinion, considered to come within the designation of \u201clands reserved for the Indians,\u201d or \u201cIndian reserves,\u201d or \u201cIndian lands.\u201d These lands have always been regarded as Indian hunting grounds. My object was to draw a distinction between lands not ceded by the Indians to the crown and those which had been ceded by them; lands coming within the latter class not being, in my opinion, within the item 24 of section 91, while those of the former class, to which the lands now under consideration did belong at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, do come within that item.\nThe proclamation of 1763, which may be called the Indians\u2019 Bill of Eights, treats these unceded lands as being \u201clands reserved for the Indians as their hunting grounds,\u201d and as such they have always been regarded in that part of Her Majesty\u2019s dominions which formerly constituted the Province of Upper Canada, within the limits of which old province it is admitted that at the time of the passing of the British North America Act the tract under consideration was situate.\nUpon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that the tract in question did not become \u201cpublic lands belonging to the Province of Ontario\u201d by force of the British North America Act; that the right to sell the said tract, or any part thereof, and to issue letters patent therefor, or the right to sell the timber growing thereon, did not pass to the Province of Ontario by force of the act; that the Indian title in the tract remained the same after the passing of the act as it had been before; that the Indians had an estate, title, and interest in the tract as their hunting ground, declared and acknowledged in the most solemn manner by all the sovereigns of Great Britain since the proclamation of 1763, which precluded the Provincial Government from interfering; therewith in any manner, and which title, estate, and interest could only be divested and extinguished by a cession made in solemn manner by the Indians to Her Majesty; that the British North America Act did not invest the provincial authorities of Ontario with power or right to enter into any treaty with the Indians for the cession of such their estate, title and interest to Her Majesty; that such power and right remained in Her Majesty to be exercised by her through the instrumentality of her Government of the Dominion of Canada and her representative the Governor General; that the treaty of October, 1873, entered into with Indians for the cession of the tract in question is obligatory upon the Dominion Government, who are bound to fulfil the obligations therein contained upon the part of Her Majesty to be fulfilled, and for such purpose are entitled to deal with the lands and the timber growing thereon, unless and until some contract be entered into between the Government of the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government for the acquisition by the Province of a beneficial interest in any revenue to be derived from the sale of the said lands or of the timber growing thereon.\nThe Province of Ontario not having acquired such beneficial interest by the British North America Act nor by the terms of the treaty, such beneficial interest can, in my opinion, be acquired only by contract with the Government of the Dominion.\nThe latter part of sec. 109 of the British North America Act, viz: \u201cSubject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the Province therein,\u201d applies, in my opinion, only to lands beneficially belonging to the Province at the time of the Union, that is to say \u201cpublic lands,\u201d the revenues arising from the sale of which (the lands having been already ceded by the Indians to the crown) formed part of the public revenue of the Province, and has no application to lands which at the time of the passing of the British North America Act had not been ceded by the Indians to the crown. But, assuming that part of section 109 to have any application in the present case, then, as it appears to me, the \u201ctrusts\u201d and \u201cinterest\u201d in the sentence referred to must be held to be the \u201cpurposes\u201d mentioned in the treaty, in consideration of which the cession was made, and the interest which the Indians have in the due fulfilment of the terms of the treaty, of which the Dominion Government are the trustees, and are, therefore, entitled to hold the property ceded in the terms of the treaty of cession as their security and means of executing the trusts imposed on them, unless and until some agreement shall be entered into between the Provincial government and them. In fine, I am of opinion, that at the time of the commencement of this suit the Provincial Government had not, and that they have not now, any vested interest in the timber which is the subject of this suit, and that, therefore, their suit or claim must be dismissed with costs, and that this appeal be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\nSolicitor for respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario.\n[1] The following sections of the act bear upon the point in question:\u2014\n\u201cSec. 92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say\u2014\n\u201c5. The management and sale of the public lands belonging to the Province and of the timber and wood thereon.\n\u201cSec. 109. All lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Province in the same.\n\u201cSec. 117. The several Provinces shall retain all their respective public property not otherwise disposed of in this act, subject to the right of Canada to assume any lands or public property required for fortifications or for the defence of the country.\u201d\n[2] \u201cSec. 91. It shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say s:\u2014\n\u201c24.

J. Ritchie C. J. and Strong. Fournier, Henry and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE). *\nDamages\u2014Misdirection as to solatium\u2014New Trial\u2014Art 1056 C. C.\nIn an action of damages brought for the death of a person by the consort and relations under Art. 1056. C. C. which is a re-enactment and reproduction of the Con. Stats. L. C. ch. 78, damages by way of solatium for the bereavement suffered cannot be recovered.\nJudgment of the court below reversed and new trial ordered.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Court of Review on the motion granting a new trial. This was an action by a widow for herself and daughter for damages arising from the death of the husband of the former caused by an accident attributable to the fault of the defendant railway company. The case was tried by a jury, and there was a verdict for the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment was met by one for a new trial on the part of the defendants, which was made on five different grounds: 1st. The omission from the assignment of facts for the jury of some of the things necessary to be proved. 2nd. Misdirection. 3rd. Partiality on the part of the jury. 4th. the absence of an important witness at the commencement of the trial without any fault of the party and whose evidence was tendered before the close of the proceedings but refused by the Court. 5th. The discovery of new evidence since the trial\nThe part of the judge's charge reduced to writing conformably to Article 405 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in consequence of defendants' objections as to misdirection is as follows :-\n\"With reference to the fifth ground or head of objec-\"tions, and which is the only one involving a question \"of law the judge told the jury in effect, that in asssessing the amount of damages, if they found for \"plaintiff, they had right to and might consider the \"nature of the anguish and mental sufferings of the \"widowed mother and her orphan child.\"\nAnd another of the grounds for the motion for new trial was :\u2013\n\"Because an important and essential witness on be \"half of the defendants was absent at the time of the \"trial without any fault on their part and said witness ' appearing before the plaintiff had submitted her case to the jury his evidence was duly tendered by the defendants, but was refused by the Court, the said defendants having made due diligence to have the witness \"present in time at the said trial,. and he having been \"prevented by causes beyond his control or that of the d defendants; and the evidence of the said witness being \"still obtainable.\"\n\u201cThe following is an extract of the minutes of the prothonotary for the 28th April 1883.\n\u201cThe defendants move that the case be postponed to examine Charles Scott, of Philadelphia, a witness s summoned, now on his way to Montreal, Affidavit\" of R. T. Heneker fyled in support of said motion.\n\"The Court allows ten minutes in order to give time\" to said Charles Scott to appear before this Court and \" give his evidence.\n\"The time allowed by the Court to permit witness \" Scott to appear having expired, the enqu\u00eate of defendants is declared closed.\n\" The enqu\u00ebte on both sides is declared closed. \" Mr. Harry Abbott, counsel for defendants, addressed\" the court and jury.\n\"At the conclusion of Mr. Abbott's address Mr. \"Charles Scott the witness above mentioned being present into court, application is made by defendant's \" counsel for leave to examine him as a witness.\n\"Mr. Hatton, one of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, objects to the\" examination of said witness at this stage of the case.\n\"The objection of Mr. Hatton is maintained by the \"court.\" C. Scott's affidavit is as follows :\nCharles Scott, of Philadilphia, in the state of Pennsylvania, one of the United States of America, manufacturer. being duly sworn, doth depose and say:\u2014\n(1) I was the manufauturer and owner of the machine in question in this cause at the time the accident in question occurred to deceased, Patrick Flynn.\n(2) The machine on the day of the accident, was lying at the Grand Trunk Railway freight depot, and was brought from there to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's shops at Hochelaga, upon a waggon to the shed in question, hired by me.\n(3) I had previously applied to Mr. Blackwell, the then mechanical superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for permission to take the machine to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's shops, for the purpose of exhibiting a test of springs which had been sent up here by me. Mr. Blackwell referred me to Mr. Black, the mechanical foreman at Hochelaga Station. I asked Mr. Black if he would hire me some men to unload this machine, or whether I would send the men from the freight depot with the team. He replied that it was not worth while to do that; that he would furnish the men to unload the machine and put it in the shops; and I told him I would pay the men for their services.\n(4) I arrived at the shops shortly after the accident: and hear ing of it; expressed my willingness to Mr. Blackwell to do something for the man, Flynn, who had been injured; and gave him a cheque for one hundred dollars.\n(5) I paid Mr. Black the sum of twenty or twenty-five dollars, I am not quite sure which for the services of the men who had engaged in unloading the machine.\n(6) The machine was in my possession, that is to say, upon the waggon and in its unloading, until it was actually delivered in the Canadian. Pacific Railway shops, and it continued to be my property and was afterwards removed from there in the same manner that is without any special appliances except rails or planks, which were not fastened together or secured in any particular manner, merely sliding it off \\and on the truck.\n(7) I have always moved these machines in the same manner, and have never had an accident. I have never seen the rails or planks braced together under them; and I moved this very machine again from the Grand Trunk to the Canadian Pacific Railway new shops afterwards in the same manner.\nAnd I have signed.\nThe jury having returned a verdict awarding $2,000 damages to the respondent and $1,000 to her child, the Court of Review, on the motion for the new trial, granted the motion for a new trial. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, that Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Review and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of damages awarded by the jury.\nScott Q.O. and H. Abbott for the appellants.\nThe following authorities may be cited on the question of misdirection and improper rejection of evidence : Fuller v. G. T. R. Go. ([2]); Bourdeau v. G.T. R Co. ([3]).\nAs to the solatium allowed, see Ravary v. G. T. R. Co. ([4]); St. Lawrence & Ottawa Ry. Co. v. Lett ([5]).\nThe evidence shows that the accident was caused by the negligence of fellow servants of the deceased for which defendants are not liable See McDonald on Master and Servant ([6]); Morgan v. Vale of Neath Ry. Go. ([7]); Lovell v. Howell ([8]) * Howells v. Landore Siemens Steel Go. ([9]) * Feltham v. England ([10]).\nArts. 1056, 426 and 427 sub-sec. 7 were referred to.\nHatton Q C for the respondents.\nThe grounds relied on for a new trial should have been urged before the verdict was entered It is too late to bring them forward now. See Cannon v Huot ([11]).\nFuller v G. T. R. Go. and Bourdeau v. G. T. R. Co relied on by appellants'. counsel do not apply as the circumstances in those cases were different from the present. See Hall v. Canadian Copper & Sulphur Co. ([12]).\nThe propriety of the direction to the jury as to mental suffering, &c, must be decided according to the law of Quebec. Ravary v. G. T. R. Go. (3) contains the law on this point. The articles of our Code 1053\u20145 on this subject were copied from the Code Nipoleon Arts 1382\u20136 inclusive\nAs to the right to recover these damages see Labelle v. City of Montreal ([13]) * Evans v. .Monnette ([14]); Richelieu u Nay. Go. v. St. Jean ([15]).\nThe case of St. Lawrence &c Ottawa Ry. Co v. Lett (4) was decided under English law and does not apply to Quebec.\nThe following authorities were also referred to: Sourdat ([16]); Dalloz Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Vo. Responsabilit\u00e9 No. 1; Toulhier ([17]); Potter's Dwarris on Statutes ([18]) The resolution of the Barons of the Exchequer in Heydon's case ([19]); Allan et at v. Pratt Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) Montreal, coram Dorion C.J. Tessier, Cross and Baby J.J., reported in Montreal Daily Gazette of 19th March instant by Mr. Kirby, editor of the Montreal Law Reports, from the notes of Mr. Justice Cross who delivered the judgment of the Court which was unanimous.\nSIR W J. RITCHIE C.J. I think the damages must be estimated not by the injured feelings of the plaintiff but must rest on the privation of some advantage actually suffered or reasonably expected to be suffered from the homicide and to be compensated by a sum of money in lieu thereof.\nThe statute provides for the assessment of damages by a jury in proportion to the injury suffered by the wife, &c., from the death of the deceased. The code provides for his consort and his ascendant and descendant relatives recovering \" all damages occasioned by such death\" ([20]), all damages occasioned\u2014that is to say, according to the loss they have severally and personally sustained capabee of ascertainment by a reasonable calculation in money, in which calculation the feelings of the parties are not to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing damage, but the actual pecuniary damage sustained.\nI think the reasoning of Justices Badgeley and Duval in Ravary v. Grand Trunk Railway ([21]), should prevail.\nThe code appears to me to have intended to embody the provisions of the statute passed when Ontario and Quebec were in union and to be substantially the same, and under which statute the same rule for assessing damages would be applicable alike to Ontario and Quebec; and this I cannot think the code intended to alter, and which rule, on the authority of the cases in Ontario as well as those in England under a similar statute and from which the Canadian act was copied, clearly excludes damages by way of solatium for wounded feelings.\nI think it would be much to be regretted if we were compelled to hold that damages should be assessed by different rules in the different provinces through which the same railroad may run.\nIf the damages are so assessed as solatium to the widow and next of kin for the bereavement and mental suffering, how is it to be apportioned ? It seems to me very difficult, if not impossible, to say how much the feelings of the mother and each of the children have respectively suffered. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The respondent instituted this action, as well on her own behalf as in the quality of tutrix of her minor daughter Mary Agnes Flynn, to recover damages for the death of her former husband Patrick Flynn, which was the consequence of an accident met with by the deceased while in the employ of the appellants when engaged with other employees in unloading a machine from a waggon or truck, and which accident, as the respondent alleges, was occasioned by the negligence of the appellants in not providing proper appliances for performing the work in the course of which it occurred, The respondent in her declaration claimed a trial by jury The appellants pleaded two pleas; That the accident was not caused by the negligence of the appellants but by the negligence, carelessness and inattention of the deceased himself and that every possible means to prevent any accident were used by the appellants' employees at the time in question\u2014in short a plea of contributory negligence. The other plea was the general issue. The respondent replied to the first plea by a general answer denying its allegations.\nAssignments of the facts to be proved having been furnished by the parties the cause came on for trial on the 27th and 28th April 1885, before Mr. Justice Doherty and a jury. The fact of the marriage of the respondent with the deceased and the birth of the minor as issue of that marriage having been admitted, the jury after having heard the testimony of numerous witnesses found in answer to questions put to them by the judge (amongst other findings) :\u2014That the deceased Patrick Flynn was, in unloading the machine, acting under the orders of the appellants' officers and so in the employ of the appellants; that the accident was caused by the fault or negligence or want of skill of the company appellants or their servants; that, the deceased Patrick Flynn was not guilty of carelessness, negligence or rashness in connection with the unloading of the machine; that the respondent had suffered damage to the amount of $2000 and the minor child of the respondent to the amount of $1000 by reason of the death of their husband and father. It appears from the report of the trial made by the learned judge, and which forms part of the record, that overruling the objections on that head of the appellants' counsel, he told the jury in effect, that in assessing the amount of damages if they found for the respondent \" they had right to and \" might consider the anguish and mental suffering of the \" widowed mother and her orphan child.\"\nThe appellants moved before the Court of Review for a new trial on five specific grounds: (1) Because the assignment of facts submitted to the jury did not contain all the facts necessary to be found; (2) Because the judge misdirected the jury; (3) Because the jury exhibited undue partiality in favor of the respondent; (4) Because an important witness for the appellants was without any fault on their part absent at the time of the trial and that the witness appearing after the evidence had been closed but before the respondent's counsel had begun to address the jury the learned judge refused the application of the appellants' counsel to have him examined: (5) Because of the discovery of new evidence. The Court of Review considered all these grounds of the motion insufficient save the fourth but upon that ground granted a new trial on payment of costs.\nOn an appeal from this decision of the Court of Review the Court of Appeals disallowed all the grounds for a new trial, reversed the judgment of the Court of Review, and gave judgment in the respondent's favor on the verdict, for the damages found by the jury. From this last judgment the present appeal has been taken to this court.\nI entirely agree with both the courts below that the 1st, 3rd and 5th grounds assigned in the motion for a new trial are insufficient, and further with the Court of Appeals that the proposed witness Scott, whose absence without any fault on the part of the appellants formed the 4th ground of appeal, was not so material that it ought to have induced the court to remit the cause for the consideration of another jury. It appears to me that Scott's evidence, as detailed in his affidavit is not inconsistent with the finding of the jury that the deceased was in the actual employ of the appellants when the accident happened. It would not establish a case where workmen had (to use the expression of the present Master of the Rolls in the case of Murray v. Currie ([22]) ) been lent to another employer. The evidence of Oliver, the :appellants' own witness, shows conclusively that the deceased and the men engaged with him in unloading the machine which caused the accident were acting under the immediate directions of Oliver as foreman of the gang, who was himself acting in obedience to the orders of his superior officer, Jackson who acted as he did with the sanction of Mr. Black the general foreman of the appellants' mechanical works at Hochelaga.\nIn the face of this evidence at the trial taken in conjunction with what Scott says in his affidavit, no jury could be expected to find that the deceased was not in the employment of the appellants when the accident happened, and I am therefore of opinion that the Court of Appeal exercised a wise discretion in refusing to grant a new trial on this ground in exercise of the powers conferred by article 426, No. 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nAs regards the first ground for a new trial there was ample evidence of negligence which was entirely a matter for the consideration of the jury. The point principally made under this head, in the argument of the present appeal, was however, that the appellants were not responsible for the negligence of the fellow servants of the deceased. This point, however well founded in fact would be an insufficient defence in point of law, for, according to the best French authorities the rule of modern English law upon which that defence is founded is rejected by the French law which governs the decisions of such questions in the Province of Quebec ([23]).\nThe point on which I feel compelled with sincere respect to differ from the Court of Appeals is that comprised in the second ground specified in the motion viz: v. misdirection\u2014the particular misdirection which I consider fatal to the verdict being that the learned judge Strong J. told the jury that they were at liberty in estimating the damages to consider the anguish and mental suffering of the respondent and her child.\nThe present action is founded on article 1056 of the Civil Code which is as follows :\u2014\nIn all cases where the person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasioffence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction, his consort and his ascendant and descendant relations have a right but only within a year after his death, to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by such death. In the case of a duel, action may be brought in like manner not only against the immediate author of the death, but also against all those who took part in the duel, whether as seconds or as witnesses. In all cases no more than one action can be brought in behalf of those who are entitled to the indemnity, and the judgment determines the proportion of the indemnity which each is to receive. These actions are independent and do not prejudice the criminal proceedings to which the parties may be subject.\nThe first question which presents itself is: Whether this article is to be taken as a reproduction of the enactment contained in the consolidated statutes of Canada, cap. 78, and as providing for the continuance of the action conferred by that act, exclusively of all other actions by the persons named in the article, for the same cause or whether it is to be considered as putting an end to the remedy given by the statute and as continuing or reviving an action known to the former common law of Lower Canada, an action to be regulated as regards the recovery of damages by the principles of French law and irrespective altogether of the rules in relation to damages applied in proceedings under the act.\nFrom the terms of article 1056 it is apparent that the ' only action which can now be brought by or on behalf of the persons named in it to recover indemnity for the death of a relative is one subject to the provisions of the article, for it says in express terms, that no more than one action can. be brought for that purpose\u00bb Therefore the action given by article 1056 and the action conferred by the statute cannot coexist as cumulative and alternative remedies, but the statutory action must be considered as entirely superseded by an action depending on this article of the code. The question we have to decide therefore is one concerning the interpretation of the article, and the answer to it must depend on whether or not we can say that article 1056 contains in its terms intrinsic evidence of an intention to continue the remedies given by the statute rather than that given by the common law\u00bb\nThe consolidated statute cap 78 was derived from the statute of Canada 10 & 11 Vic. cap. 6. which in turn was (as is well known) a literal reenactment of the Imperial Statute 9 & 10 Vie cap. 93 commonly called Lord Campbell's Act. If, therefore, article 1056 is to be considered as embodying the provisions of the statute it is clear that, according to a rule of construction which has the sanction of the highest authority, it ought to receive the same interpretation at our hands as that which the English courts have applied to the original act.\nThe principal argument against the contention that article 1056 is to be interpreted in the same manner as the statute is that derived from the former law of Lower Canada as it existed at the time of the passing Of the statute in relation to the remedial rights of the relatives of deceased persons whose deaths had been caused by \" d\u00e9lits \" or quasi-delist.\" It appears that such an action could have been maintained on well established principles of the old ( French law. Further, it may be conceded that in P such an action the plaintiff was not limited to an indemnity in respect of such pecuniary or material loss as he might be proved to have sustained by the death of his relative, but beyond and apart from these damages, he might also recover in respect of that which the learned judge in his charge to the jury in the present case defined as \" the anguish and mental suffering of the plaintiff and her child ;\" and which Larombi\u00e8re ([24]), in a passage quoted in the respondent's factum, designates as t the moral wrong to the natural and \" legitimate affections of the party complaining ;\" in short that same element of damages which in the Scotch law is termed the \" solatium, \" by which name also it has been rejected by the English courts as a ground of damages to be recovered in an action brought under Lord Campbell's act. Whilst, however, I am willing to concede for the present purpose that damages by way of consolation for the bereavement suffered could be recovered in an action brought at common law before the statute, the judgment of Mr. Justice Badgley in Ravary v. G. T. R. Coy. ([25]), and the French authorities referred to therein shew that even this was by no means free from doubt.\nThe jurisprudence of the courts of the Province of Quebe bearing on the questions involved in the present case, so far as it can be collected from the published report of the decisions of those courts, is somewhat scanty. We have been referred however, to some cases of which the three following may be particularly noticed\nIn the case of Ravary v. The G. T. R.. Co' y. (2) which was decided by the dourt of Appeals, in 1860, a majority of the court consisting of Sir H. L. Lafontaine C. J., Mr. Justice Aylwin and lr Justice Bruneau (sitting ad hoc) held, that irrespective of the statute an action could be maintained by the widow and children of a man who had been killed by an accident resulting from the negligence of a railway company against the authors of the death and that in such an action damagres were recoverable in respect of a s solatium \"\u2014and this decision was based on the jurisprudence of the French courts both ancient and modern aid the opinions of writers of authority collected from several legal treatises, all referred to in the full and learned judgment of Mr. Justice Aylwin. It also seems to have been the conclusion of the majority of the court, that, even in an action avowedly brought under the statute, the rule as to damages would be the same and that in this latter case the decisions of the English courts against such a measure of damages would not apply. This decision was far from being arrived at unanimously Mr. Justice Badgley, in a judgment entitled to weight as well from the force of argument as from the great research which it displays, recorded his reasons for an opinion opposed to that of the majority of the court, and in this latter opinion Mr. Justice Duval concurred. In the Court of Review, on the motion for a new trial in the same case, two of the: three judges who composed that court, Mr. Justice Mondelet and Mr. Justice Day, expressed opinions coinciding with that of Badgley J, while the third judge, Mr. Justice Smith, was in favor of sustaining the verdict by which the jury had given damages for a considerable amount without any proof of material or pecuniary loss, such damages being attributed by them to a solatium exclusively. This verdict, too, was in direct contradiction, to the charge of the judge who presided at the trial, by whom the law was laid down in the same way as it was afterwards adopted by the majority of the Court of Review and by Mr. Justice Badgley in the Court of Appeal.\nThere Was, therefore, very considerable dissent from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and opposed to the views of the four judges whose opinions there prevailed there were those of five judges who all at different stages of the same cause, gave judgments in it, including the judge who presided at the trial, two judges in the Court of Review, and the two dissentient judges in the Queen's Bench. It is not therefore, surrising that in the case of Provost v. Jackson ([26]), decided in the Court of Appeals at Montreal in 1863 on an appeal from a judgment pronounced in the Superior Court in 1860, we find no disapproval expressed by the majority of the court of the \" motifs '' of the judgment of the Superior Court in Review, in which it was considered that an action by a father and mother for causing the death of their son depended entirely on the statute, although the ratio decidendi of the Court of Appeals certainly was the failure of the plaintiffs to prove their intermarriage. In Ruest v. Grand Trunk Railway Coy. ([27]), decided in 1878, Mr. Justice McCord determined that the action given by article 1056 is exclusive of any other action to recover damages for the loss suffered by the death of a relative within the degrees provided for by the article and he held that no such action was maintainable by the brothers and sisters of the deceased. The learned judge's own language is as follows :\u2014\nBut no such action lies except under the terms of article 1056 the express inclusives of which excludes the right of any other persons than those herein mentioned According to the terms of this article the consort and ascending and descendant relations can alone have the right to claim damages for death occasioned by quasi-offence. In so far therefore as the brothers and sisters of Ruest are concerned the action is not founded and the defence en droit will be maintained.\nThese are the only authorities to be found in the reports which throw any light on the question we have to decide on this appeal.\nThe conclusion I have arrived at after considering these and other authorities and. the terms in which the fourth section of the statute is expressed as well as those of the articles, is, that the common law action was entirely superseded, at least as regards the persons mentioned in the second section as those for whose benefit an action might be brought, by the action given by the statute, and that article 1056 was a reenactment and reproduction of the statute and is to be interpreted in the same way, The fourth section of the statute provides that \" not more than one action ' shall lie for and in respect of the same subject of complaint\".\u2014that is \" a subject of complaint \" entitling the parties named in the 2nd section to an action to be brought by a nominal plaintiff for their benefit. I think it impossible that the intention of the legislature to exclude all other actions for the benefit of the same parties and for the same cause, at common law or otherwise could have been more explicitly demonstrated than by these words. I am therefore of opinion that from the date of the enactment of the statute the remedy for the causes mentioned in it was confined to an action founded on it. In like manner, entirely agreeing in this respect with Mr. Justice McCord's decision in Ruest v. G T. Ry. Co., I am of opinion that the almost identical words, \" not more than one action can be brought on behalf of those who are entitled to the i indemnity \" contained in article 1056, have the same effect of restricting the remedy of the relations named in the article to an action founded on its terms. Then the state of the law of Lower Canada at the date of the promulgation of the Civil Code being such as I have mentioned \u2014 that the only remedy for persons coming within the degrees of relationship specified in the statute, was an action founded on the statute\u2014it would seem to be a reasonable inference, apart altogether from the internal evidence afforded by the language and provisions of the article, that the action given by it was intended to afford the same remedy and to be subject to the same limitations and restrictions as the former statutory action. When, however we find on an examination of the terms in which the article is expressed that it includes the same persons as those for whose benefit an action under the statute could alone be maintained that it is exclusive of all other actions for the same injury that it is subject to the same anomalous condition that the right to institute it may be intercepted by indemnity or satisfaction made to the deceased in his lifetime and that the same exceptionally short period 01 prescription applies to it and that whilst in all these features it resembles the statutory action, it differs entirely and radically from the action given by the old French law, it appears to me we may safety conclude that it was not intended by the code to lay down any new law or to give any new remedy or to revive the old extinct common law action, but merely to continue the same state of the law as that which previously existed under the statute.\nThis also accounts for the absence, as applied to art. 1056 of the marks by which the codifiers distinguished new law.\nThen taking it as established that art. 1056 is to be read and interpreted as an adoption into the code of the provisions of the statute, and having regard to the history of the legislation already stated, we are bound to follow the English course in the constructions which, in the early case of Blake v. Midland Railway Company ([28]), they placed on the original enactment, viz: that it does not authorize the assessment of damages in respect of the injured feelings and affections and mental sufferings of the party complaining. The rule that courts in construing colonial statutes copied from Imperial legislation, ought to follow the construction applied by the English courses has the sanction of the highest authority. In the case of Trimble v. Hill ([29]) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council lay down the rule just adverted to as one which ought invariably to be acted on and applied by colonial courts in interpreting statutes of English origin. It is true that the case of Blake v. Midland Railway company was not a decision of a Court of appeal, hut, independently of being the decision of a court comprised of very eminent judges, of whom the author of the act, Lord Campbell, was one, it has ever since been acquiesced in by text writers and acted on by the courts as an authoritative construction of the act. Moreover, it was tacitly recognized as a sound decision in Rowley v. P. & N. W. R. Co. ([30]) where the principle son which damages are to be calculated in an action brought by a widow and children for indemnity under Lord Campbell's act were considered, and certain rules laid down which entirely exclude the element of damage now in question.\nI am therefore of opinion that the learned judge should have instructed the jury that the plaintiff and her child were not entitled to recover any damages in respect of and by way of consolation for the bereavement they had suffered and that his direction to the contrary was erroneous.\nFurther, in view of the great injustice and inconvenience which would be sure to result if so impalpable a ground of damages as the solatium could be taken into account by juries in estimating damages in cases like the present, I should, if the question came before us without previous decision, as nova res, for these reasons, which are very ably pointed out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross, unhesitatingly adopt the same conclusion as that arrived at in the case of Blake v. Midland Railway Co.\nI am of opinion to reverse the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and restore and affirm that of the Court of Review for a new trial.\nFOURNIER and HENRY J.J. concurred with the Chief Justice that there had been misdirection.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judge at the trial misdirected the jury in telling them that in assessing the amount of the damages, they might consider the nature of the anguish and mental sufferings of the plaintiff, or in other words, that they could make an estimation of her tears, sighs, and sorrows, in pounds, shillings, and pence.\nThough the French law allowed a larger basis for a pecuniary compensation in such cases, I take it that now with us, under article 1056 of the code which is the reenactment of our statute 10\u201411 Vic. similar to Lord Campbell's Act there is no difference between the English law and ours on the subject. The Privy Council held in Trimble v Hill (1) that when a colonial legislature has passed an act in the same terms as an Imperial statute and the latter has been authoritatively construed by a Court of Appeal in England, such construction should he adopted by the courts of the colony. And in City Bank v. Barrow (2), in the House of Lords, on the interpretation of an article of\n(1)5 \u00c0pp. Cas. 342. (2) 5 App. Cas. 664. our code Lord Blackburn said that where a colony reenacts an imperial statute it is as if the English law was carried over bodily to the colony, and in construing\" the colonial law, the interpretation given to the similar law by the courts in England should be followed. I think this reasonable rule should be followed in this case.\nWhen by the 10th and 11th Vic. the legislature of the United Canada\u2019s reenacted Lord Campbell's act, it was the intention not only to provide for damages resulting from death in Upper Canada but also to put the law in both Provinces on the same footing. That is why the act was extended to Lower Canada, though the common law then gave a remedy for such injuries It cannot have been intended by this legislation, that if a man was killed in Upper Canada no solatium should be granted to his wife or legal representatives by way of damages, but that if he was killed in Lower Canada such a solatium could be given. That in the present case, for instance, this plaintiff can get a solatium, because her husband was killed in Lower Canada whilst if he had been killed a few miles further west, in Upper Canada, none would be granted under the same statute The statute and the code entirely changed the laws. 1st, As to prescription; by article 2261, C. C. it would be two years; 2nd As to the parties entitled to the action; 3rd, In giving only one action to all the parties injured; 4th, In denying, as in England ([31]), the action where the deceased party had himself obtained an indemnity ([32]). From this it is evident in my opinion that the action now given is an entirely different one from the common law action. And if different in four such important respects, can it be contended that as to a fifth, the measure of damages, the principles of the common law action can be engrafted on the statutory action ? This obviously would be to set at naught the intention of the legislator, who, for no other reason than to have the law in both Canadas on the same footing has extended this legislation to Lower Canada, and this no doubt as it was to principally affect companies incorporated for and running their roads through both Provinces.\nIt could not be contended, I take it for granted, that, if the English act had been extended to Scotland, it would not receive there the same construction as is given to it by the courts of England. A statute would not be held to mean one thing in England and another in Scotland. And so here, I take it, it cannot mean in Lower Canada what it does not mean in Upper Canada, or give a. larger remedy in one Province than in the other.\nFurthermore, in this section itself (1056) of the code, there is intrinsic and, to my mind, unmistaken able evidence that the Legislature intended that the measure of damages in such cases should be there after the same in Lower Canada as in Upper Canada. That is in the enactment that if the deceased has himself obtained an indemnity, this will be a bar to any action by his consort or legal representatives for their injuries resulting from his death. This, as I have already remarked, is entirely new law. Previously, at common law, the indemnity received by the deceased, or the action by him instituted for his injuries was no bar to his consort or relatives' action for their own injuries resulting from his death. They were held to be two distinct rights giving the two distinct actions ([33]). But now the code, as the statute did, though in no such express words, clearly re fuses a new action to the survivors in such cases ([34]). Now, is this not, as Mr. Justice Cross well remarked in the court below, enacting as clearly as if it were laid down in so many words, that anguish of mind and mental sufferings are not to, be the subject of pecuniary compensation. The injured man, if he settled before his death with the party who caused his injury, obviously did not settle for his .wife's or children's anguish of mind caused by his death. So that when the action in that case is taken away from said wife or children it is, it seems to me, equivalent to an express enactment that their anguish of mind is no ground for damages.\nThe code, in my opinion, has taken away the common law action and the remedy it gave.\nWhen Ravary v. The G T. R. ([35]) was decided, before the code, it might have been a question whether the statute had had that effect. But since the code there can be no doubt on the subject, and that case upon that ground is entirely distinguishable.\nIt is expressly enacted by art. 2613 thereof that all laws previously in force are abrogated in all cases in which express provision is thereby made upon the particular matter to which such laws relate. This clearly leaves for an injury caused by death nothing hut the action given by art. 1056, and the jurisprudence is all in that sense. Provost v. Jackson, judgment of Superior Court ([36]); Ruest v. G. T. By. ([37]); G. T. Ry. v. Godbout ([38]). And if the statutory action only now lies, the statutory damages can only be allowed. More\u00bb over, when Ravary v. The G. T. R. was decided Read v. The Great Eastern Railway had not been decided, and there was not in the statute, as there is now in art. 1056, the express refusal of the action where the deceased had received an indemnity. That consideration was consequently not before the judges who determined that case. I would, for all these reasons, hold that the charge of the learned judge at the trial in this case is as illegal here as it would be in Ontario or in England.\nBut I go further and would hold that even under the French law, supposing that it ruled this case, the charge of the learned judge was illegal by its vagueness. Laurent ([39]) would call it dangerous. I would say it is illegal, because it is dangerous. The jury may have been led to believe under the terms in which it was given, that they might consider the anguish of mind and mental sufferings of the plaintiff during the fifteen months that elapsed between the accident to the husband and his death. Clearly this could not be taken into consideration. Then, apart from this there is not a single authority that sustains such a charge. In this case, there is even no evidence of what the deceased earned at his death; nothing but the speculative opinion of one witness who hardly knew him. No evidence whatever of how much it would take to educate the child and to support her or her mother not a word of all this None. All the authorities cited by Mr. Justice Badgley in Ravary v. The G. T. R. demonstrate that there must be some basis upon which the damages can be assessed. I need not refer to them more particularly here As said by Mr. Justice Mondelet in that case in the Superior Court ([40]) :\u2014\nIf vindictive damages were to be given, without any rule, upon the mere caprice of juries excited by public clamor, there would he no safety for railway companies against the most monstrous fines.\nIf a jury could be charged, as has been in this case the court would lose all control over their verdict. In the present case for instance a verdict for $10000 or $200000 would he unassailable, if this one is. It is not a question of excessive damages. How could the court say that the damages are excessive, if it has no means to ascertain what principles and for what they have been assessed. The court it seems to me should direct the jury to state what amount they grant for actual real damages, and what amount for mental sufferings or anguish of mind. Otherwise, the court has no check on the verdict. The jury should also be charged that though they may take into consideration the mental sufferings and anguish of mind of the plaintiff\", yet the damages must not be assessed to an amount out of proportion with the actual pecuniary loss they have suffered. Such are the remarks of the court of Marseilles in the case cited by Laurent ([41]), of Compagnie P. L. M. v. Olivier ([42]). If in France, where the damages are \u00e0 Parbitrage du Juge, these considerations guide the courts in the assessments of such damages 1 think that with us in a case tried by a jury the court should direct them that they also are to be guided by these considerations. The jury should also be told of the rule of law, that, for a death caused by an accident they cannot give as heavy damages as for a death caused by an assassination or any crime a rule admitted by all the writers, and mentioned by the court in the case of Enfants Vervieis v. Constant ([43]). The law authorizes vindictive damages and damages for a prejudice moral in cases where the party causing the death has acted with malice or committed a d\u00e9lit, but not when the death was caused by a quasi-d\u00e9lit. For this proposition we have no less an authority than that of the Cour de Cassation, the highest tribunal in France in the case of Re Roche ([44]) who held that :\nLes dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats reclaims en mati\u00e8re criminelle ne doivent pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre restreints, come en mati\u00e8re civile au pr\u00e9judice mat\u00e9riel r\u00e9sultant du crime ou du d\u00e9lit; ils peuvent aussi, comprendre le pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la partie civile par ce crime ou par ce d\u00e9lit.\nSaid the court:\u2014\nAttendu que cet article n'est point applicable aux dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi d\u00e9lit; que les dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9clam\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re criminelle ne sont pas de la m\u00eame nature, et peuvent n'\u00eatre pas restreints comme doivent l'\u00eatre ceux qui sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re civile, que le pr\u00e9judice mat\u00e9riel r\u00e9sultant d'un crime ou d'un d\u00e9lit peut, en outre, \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9 d'un pr\u00e9judice moral qui peut entrer dans les appreciations du juge et, par consequent, influer sur la quotit\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il accorde \u00e0 la partie civile Rejet\u00e9.\nIs not this holding, as unequivocally as can be, though in the negative form, that though for a crime damages for a moral loss can be given, yet for a d\u00e9lit civil or a quasi-d\u00e9lit, none but the real damages for the pecuniary loss are allowable? And it is only for murders or other crimes that all the books and arr\u00e9ts in France before the bodes allow damages. This remark applies specially to the authorities cited by Sourdat at No. 54 ([45]). The arret of the 3rd of April, 1685 ([46]), (the reference in Sourdat is wrong) was in a case of murder in fact these cases are all trials in the criminal courts.\nThe respondent has invoked as supporting the legality of the judge's charge to the jury a passage from Sourdat ([47]) where the author says that an indemnity is due to a son for the death of his father even if his father had been entirely supported by him. This, is a mere opinion of the author, coupled with the argument of a member of the French bar in one of his cases and then it must be remarked that the author in that passage, as in No.. 54 of the same book, speaks of a death caused by a murder. The same remarks applies to the passage in Demolombe ([48]). To the opinions of those commentators I find a forcible answer by the annotator to the Magaud case ([49]) in Dalloz in the following words :\u2014\nCes arguments inspires par des reminiscences de notre ancienne l\u00e9gislationouu l'action publique et l'action civil n'\u00e9taient pas nettement distingu\u00e9es comme elles l'nt \u00e9t\u00e9 par notre droit penal moderne ne sont conformes ni aux principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sur Ia responsabilit\u00e9, ni m\u00eame aux sentiments qu'\u00e9veille aujourd'hui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans une famille l'accident ou m\u00eame le crime qui lui a enlev\u00e9 un des siens. II ne r\u00e9pugne pas moins \u00e0 la loi qu'aux sentiments les plus nobles de l'\u00e2me humaine de faire d'un malheur de famille une source de vengeance et de gain. La personne qui a perdu un enfant ou un p\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 sa charge ne nous parait donc pas fond\u00e9e \u00e0 venir demander \u00e0 l'auteur de l'accident le prix en argent de sa douleur L'individu qui a \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un prejudice moral, par suite de l'atteinte port\u00e9e a sa r\u00e9putation ou \u00e0 son honneur, est bien venu \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer une r\u00e9paration, parce qu'il craint d'avoir perdu l'amiti\u00e9, l'estime et le respect des honn\u00eates gens, et qu'il veut prendre des mesures pour faire taire ou pour punir le mensonge et Ia calomnie. Mais la personne \u00e0 qui un accident a enleve un p\u00e8re infirme ou un jeune enfant, n'a re\u00e7u aucune atteinte dans sa consideration 5 son maiheur a d\u00fb au contraire lui attirer de nouvelles affections et de nouvelles sympathies Et puis, si de pareilles questions pouvaient s'agiter devant les tribunaux, il faudrait permettre d'appr\u00e9cier, de discuter, et m\u00eame de nier les sentiments de tendresse et d'amiti\u00e9 qui existaient entre la victime et la r\u00e9clamante :\nEnfin quel criterium guiderait le juge dans la fixation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ? Il en faut donc revenir \u00e0 ce principe qu'on ne peut exiger une reparation p\u00e9cuniaire qu'\u00e0 raison du prejudice souffert dans ses int\u00e9r\u00eats mat\u00e9riels ou moraux* mais non dans ses affections et ses sympathies.\nLe juge accueillera la demande d'un p\u0141re, d'un enfant. d'une veuve, venant dire: cette mort, qui me frappe dans mes affections les plus ch\u00e9res, porte ausii un grave pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ma fortune, \u00e0 mon avenir, ou \u00e0 mon honneur. Mass ii ne pr\u00e9tera pas l'oreille au plaideur qui osera dire: cette mort me eause une immense douleur et des regrets \u00e9ternels ; diminue zen l'amertume et la dur\u00e9e au moyen d'une somme d argent !\nI refer also to Dalloz ([50]).\n11 ne suffit pas, pour justifier l'intervention civile d'une personee qu' elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e dans ses affections, ses go\u00fbts ou ses habitudes, par un fait criminel: il faut, que I'action civile soit ifond\u00e9e sur un prejudice s\u00e9rieux et appr\u00e9ciables And at No. 83\u2014 Une l\u00e9sion purement morale Peut servir de fondement \u00e0 une action civile des one cette l\u00e9sioin r\u00e9sulte d'un crime ou d'un d\u00e9lit.\nAnd to Mangin, Action publique ([51]) where he says :\u2014\nIl ne a suffirait pas non plus Que le delit l'e\u00fbt bless\u00e9 dans ses affections.\nAlso to Larombi\u00e8re ([52]) where the writer gives the considerations that should guide the judge in the assessment of damages for mental sufferings, which I hold the judge with us should mention to the jury for their guidance.\nIn the Magaud case ([53]) a widow with her children was suing a railway company for damages caused by the accidental death of her husband. The plaintiff recovered but there is not a word in the judgment of solatium or damages for mental sufferings on the contrary, the court distinctly holds, that\nLa reparation devant toujours \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e sur le prejudice r\u00e9el et sur la privation plus ou moins grande impos\u00e9e a celui qui se plaint.\nLikewise in a case of Boesch v. Gitz cited in Merlin ([54]), where 600 francs ($120) are granted to the widow of a man who has been killed by the defendant, \" pour dommages reels,\" but not a word of damages for sorrows and anguish of mind. The same remark applies to the case of Caderousse Gramont ([55]).\nI refer also to a case of Joire, 17 Febry, 1819, ([56]). It was there held that\nLe prejudice r\u00e9sultant d'un d\u00e9lit ne donne par lieu \u00e0 des dommages inter\u00eats s'il ne constitue qu'un pr\u00e9judice moral et non un pr\u00e9judice p\u00e9cuniaire.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Abbott, Tait, Abbott & Campbell.\nSolicitor for respondents: J.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nPledge without delivery Possession\u2014Rights of creditors\u2014Art. 1970 C. C.\nB., who was the principal owner of the south Eastern Railway Company, was in the habit of mingling the moneys of the company with his own. He bought locomotives which were delivered to and used openly and publicly by, the railway company as their own property for several years. In January and May, 1883, B., by documents sous seing priv\u00e9, sold with the condition to deliver on demand, ten of these locomotive engines to F. et al., the appellants, to guarantee them against an endorsement of his notes for $50,000. but reserved the right on payment of said notes or any renewals thereof to have said locomotives redelivered to him. B. having become insolvent, F. et al., by their action directed against B., the South Eastern Railway Company, and R. et al., trustees of the company under 43 and 44 Vie. ch. 49, P. Q., asked for the delivery of the locomotives, which were at the time in the open possession of South Eastern Railway Company, unless the defendants paid the amount of their debt. B. did not plead. The South Eastern Railway Company and R. et al., as trustees, pleaded a general denial, and during the proceedings O' H. filed an intervention, alleging he was a judgment creditor of B., notoriously insolvent at the time of making the alleged sale to F. Held, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the transaction with B. only amounted to a pledge not accompanied by delivery, and therefore F. et al., were not entitled to the possession of the locomotives as against creditors of the company and that in any case they were not entitled to the property as against O'H., a judgment creditor of B., an insolvent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the appellants' action.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given. See also report of the case in M. L. .R. 2' Q. B. ([2]).\nChurch Q.C. for appellants:\n\"Was this an agreement to pledge and not a sale? This seems to me the important question to be decided on this appeal.\nThat it was not a contract of pledge is, I contend, sufficiently established by two facts:\u2014\n1. The plaintiffs were not creditors of Barlow to whom a pledge could be given, because the notes which they endorsed were to be held, and were held. by the Bank of Montreal l and 2. The parties did not intend to make a pledge, because a pledge would have involved the transfer of possession of the locomotives from Barlow to the plaintiffs; on the contrary, they called their contract a sale in terms and acted upon it as such\u2014Art 1025 C. C.\nThe consideration of the sale appears by the documents to have been the endorsation of notes drawn by Barlow in favor of third parties which notes the appellants undertook to pay. Barlow, however, reserved the right practically (although not in formal terms) to intervene and pay the notes himself at maturity, or pay them after maturity, in which case he was entitled by the agreement to a redelivery of the locomotives sold. The accepted principle of construction and interpretation, made a rule of law in the Province of Quebec by Art. 1013 of the Civil Code, which provides that when the meaning of the parties to a contract is doubtful their common intention must be determined by interpretation rather than by an adherence to the literal meaning of the words of the contract should be applied here if there is any doubt of what was meant; and the subsequent rules laid down in articles 1014 and 1015 concur in showing that no ambiguity of meaning or expression shall be permitted to defeat the real meaning of the contact. These rules would manifestly be overlooked and set at naught if this agreement or contract were taken as a pledge. Moreover, the defendant Barlow and the other defendants could say that the contract was inchoate, because no delivery had been made, and therefore no pledge given, and the whole transaction, like the agreement, would become purposeless and meaningless. Moreover, the words of the contract show that a sale was intended; u I have this day sold\" are the words of the contract. The price was clearly the payment by the plaintiffs, at their maturity, of the notes. The delay of payment was the period which would elapse between the signing of the notes and their maturity. Considered as a contact of sale, this delay in payment, and non-delivery at the time of the sale did not affect it because article 1025 C. C. provides that a contract for the alienation of a thin certain and determinate makes the purchaser owner of the thing by the consent alone of the parties, although in delivery be made; and this interpretation makes the document a binding obligation, and avoids its miscarriage as a pledge. The things sold in this instance were certain and determinate, because the defendant Barlow sold ten locomotive engines of the make of the Rhode Island Locomotive Works then owned by him\u2014\" which I now own \" are the words of the contract\u2014 and it appears from the statement that of the fifteen locomotives of the make of the Rhode Island Locomotive Works, which were sold to the parties in this cause, ten only were sold to Barlow individually.\nSee also arte. 1472 1027, C. C.\nAs to the trustees of the bondholders they have no locus standi,\nThe bondholders could if they wished have intervened as they had been notified through their trustees of the suit\u00bb Our code in terms declares u no person can. plead in the name of another,\" and that c corporations plead in their corporate names' and that only those who have not the free exercise of their rights plead through others representing them. Vide, art. 19 C. C. P. Brown v. Pinsonneault ([3]) ; Robillard v. La Societ\u00e9 de Construction ([4]) ; Valliers v. Drapeau ([5])\nNow as to the intervenantes remedy, we contend that his only legal remedy would have been to take an attachment by garnishment of these locomotives in the hands of the South Eastern Railway Company, and the trustees, and the appellants; and that certainly he could have no greater right, even if allowed to intervene in the present cause than to ask that when the appellants had recovered possession of the engines, they should be ordered to hold them in the interest of the insolvent Barlow's creditors generally or that the seizure avail as a conservatory attachment in the interest of all Barlow's creditors or some conclusion of that nature. But this he has not asked he merely seeks to defeat appellants' action; and appellants submit that his prayer is not justified, and should be rejected.\nO'Halloran Q.C. for respondants contended that there had been no sale, no price mentioned, no absolute vesting of the property in the appellants, and cited and relied on Cushing v. Dupuy ([6]); Grand Trunk Railway v. Eastern Townships Bank ([7]); as to the intervenants claim it is clear that having proved Barlow's insolvency, plaintiffs cannot be entitled to the property of these locomotives in the possession of a third party as against the intervenant a judgment creditor of Bat low.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014By their action the appellants, Fairbanks and his partners, sought to recover possession of ten locomotive engines, which they alleged had been sold to them by Bradley Barlow, one of the respondents, to secure them against the endorsement of three promissory notes, of the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars endorsed at his request and which had been renewed and the renewals taken up by them. The suit was accompanied by a seizure and was directed as well against Barlow as against the South Eastern Railway Company, and against Redfield, Farwell & McIntyre, trustees, under a statute of Quebec, 43 and 44 Vic. ch. 49.\nThe defendant, Barlow, made default. The South Eastern Railway Company by their plea claimed the locomotives as their property and denied having given Barlow any authority to sell or pledge them.\nThe trustees pleaded their possession and ownership under the statute of Quebec 43 and 44 Vic. ch. 49, having in good faith received the locomotives from the South Eastern Railway Company.\nThe railway company pleaded that the locomotives belonged to them, and never were the property of Barlow, nor was he ever authorized to sell or pledge the same. The appellants produced the title under which they claimed being a sous-seing priv\u00e9 document dated 16th January, 1883, which declares that Barlow sold them.\nAfter a certain amount of evidence had been taken on these issues, the respondent, James O'Halloran, intervened, alleging that he was a creditor of Barlow, and denying any right, whether of ownership or authority, in Barlow to pledge the locomotives, or to guarantee them against an endorsement of his notes for $50,000; Barlow's insolvency long before the institution of the action; the non-delivery of the locomotive to the appellants and a denial of appellants having any right to or lien or privilege on the locomotives, and his right as a creditor, to have the pretended sale or pledge declared invalid. He concluded that the plaintiffs be declared to have no lien on the locomotives, and that their action should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiffs claim is on two instruments, the one dated the 16th January, 1883, and the other the 10th of May, 1888, as follows:\u2014 ST, JOHNSBURY, VT., January 16, 1883.\nHon. Horace Fairbanks and Hon. Franklin Fairbanks having endorsed for my accommodation two notes for twenty thousand dollars each, one dated January 1st, 1883, and one dated January 10th, 1883, and payable in four months at the Bank of Montreal, and one note of ten thousand dollars, dated January 16th, payable at the Bank of Montreal, in three months from date \u2014now in consideration of the said endorsement. I have this day sold to the said Horace and Franklin Fairbanks, ten locomotive engines of the make of the Rhode Island Locomotive Works, which I now own, and which I agree to deliver to the said Horace and Franklin Fairbanks on demand, to be held by them as collateral security for the payment of said notes at maturity, and when said notes are paid, the said ten locomotives are to be re-delivered to me.\n(Signed),\nBRADLEY BARLOW.\nST. JOHNSBURY, VT., May 10, 1883.\nWhereas, as appears by my agreement of the 16th of January, 1883, Horace Fairbank and Franklin Fairbanks endorsed for me certain notes to the amount of ($50,000) fifty thousand dollars, described in an agreement, signed by me, pledging ten locomotives as collateral security for the payment of said notes, the names of said locomotives now declared to be as follows: \"C. W. Foster,\" \"Bradley Barlow,\" \"B. B. Smalley,\" \"L. Robinson,\" Longueuil,\" \"Newport,\" \"North Troy,\" \"A. B. Chaffee,\" \"Richford,\" and \"Farnham,\" said locomotives to be held as collateral security for the payment of said notes, or any renewals thereof for value received.\n(Signed),\nBRADLEY BARLOW.\nAs regards this document, I quite agree with Judge Cross that\nIt is obvious that it does not make any evidence of a sale or that the transaction amounted to a sale. It was a mere pledge of the locomotives in security for the appellants' endorsement of notes fox Barlow's accommodation. A pledge that was wholly inoperative as against any party having an adverse interest in the absence of an effective delivery to and a lawful possession by the pledge of the locomotives, the subject of the pledge. The conclusions I deduce from the foregoing remarks, is that the appellants have shown no grievance entitling them to relief in any respect from the judgment they have appealed; it must consequently be confirmed.\nThe appellants' claim is based entirely on the property being the property of Barlow. Assuming such to be the case, of which, on the evidence I should very much doubt, then the appellants are out of court, and the conclusions taken by the intervention of O'Halloran must prevail.\nWhether the locomotives were owned by the railway company or by Barlow, who was insolvent, the plaintiffs proved no title to them, and no right to their possession, as against a bona fide creditor of Barlow, which O'Halloran clearly was.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For the reasons given by the majority of the court below, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014Les Appelants, demandeurs en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, out r\u00e9clame des Intim\u00e9s dix locomotives qu'ils all\u00e8guent leur avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es en gage, par Bradley Barlow l'un des d\u00e9fendeurs, comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 du paiement d'un billet de $50,000 qu\u2019ils out endoss\u00e9 pour lui.\nL'action all\u00e8gue que Barlow qui a re\u00e7u le produit des billets endoss\u00e9s pour lui \u00e9tait alors le g\u00e9rant de la dite compagnie et qu'il a disparu depuis pour se soustraire aux actions de ses cr\u00e9anciers.\nLes Appelants font reposer leur droit sur les deux lettres suivantes ([8]).\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette action par defence au fonds en fait et par exception p\u00e9remptoire que lorsque Barlow a fait les \u00e9crits cidessus cites les locomotives en question \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et en la possession de la dite compagnie, et non celle de Barlow quii n'a fait les dits \u00e9crits qu'en son nom personnel et non pas comme le repr\u00e9sentant autoris\u00e9 de la dite compagnie.\nLes autres Intim\u00e9s, Redfield, Farwell et McIntyre out plaide qu'en leur qualit\u00e9 de fid\u00e9i commissaires, en vertu d'un acte cr\u00e9ant un mortgage sur le South E. R., en feveur de ses porteurs de bons, la dite compagnie leur avait transport\u00e9 le dit chemin de fer et leur en avait confi\u00e9 l'administration, et que les locomotives en question qui se trouvaient alors faire partie du roulant du dit chemin de fer \u00e9taient aussi pass\u00e9es de bonne foi en leur possession, en leur qualit\u00e9 de fid\u00e9icommissaires et qu'ils avaient droit de les retenir en vertu de l'acte de fid\u00e9icommis. Ils ont aussi plaid\u00e9 le statut autorisant la compagnie \u00e0 constituer ce fid\u00e9icommis pour faire un emprunt.\nBarlow mis aussi en cause comme d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas plaid\u00e9.\nLa contestation \u00e9tait li\u00e9e et la preuve commenc\u00e9e lorsque l'Intim\u00e9 O'Halloran pr\u00e9senta son intervention alleguant: 10. qu'il \u00e9tait cr\u00e9ancier de Barlow en vertu d'un jugement; 2, que longtemps avant l'institution de l'action des Appelants Barlow \u00e9tait insolvable et en deconfiture; 3, qu'en admettant me la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de l'action des Appelants, ceux-ci n'avaient en cons\u00e9quence de leur d\u00e9faut de possession aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni privil\u00e8ge sur les dites locomotives \u00e0 l'encontre des autres cr\u00e9anciers de Barlow.\nLes Appelants ont r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'intervention par une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et par une r\u00e9ponse sp\u00e9ciale all\u00e9guant qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de leur transaction avec Barlow, celui-ci \u00e9tait solvable et en \u00e9tat de disposer librement de ses biens; ils ont aussi all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que leur transaction \u00e9tait une vente avec droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9,\u2014que l'intervenant agit de connivence et collusoirement avec la compagnie. Cette r\u00e9ponde \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'une d\u00e9fense en droit \u00e0 l'intervention, soulevant des questions qui ne pouvaient aucunement affecter lisse en cette cause et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e.\nLes diff\u00e9rentes contestations li\u00e9es entre les partes soul\u00e8vent les questions suivantes: 1. Lors de la transaction du 16 janvier 1883 Barlow \u00e9tait-il solvable et les locomotives en question lui appartenaient-elles? 2. La transaction du 16 janvier 1883 constitue-t-elle un contrat do vente on un contrat de gage?\nLes Appelants apr\u00e8s avoir dans leur d\u00e9claration qualifi\u00e9 la transaction du 16 janvier comme un contrat de gage se sont d\u00e9sist\u00e9s de cette pr\u00e9tention par leur , r\u00e9ponse sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 l'intervention. Ils l'ont \u00e9galement abandonn\u00e9e par leur factura dans lequel \u00e0 la page 5 ils donnent de fortes bonnes raisons pour d\u00e9montrer l'erreur de cette pr\u00e9tention; d'abord, qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas cr\u00e9anciers pouvant prendre un droit de gage, et ensuite que l'intention des parties n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 de faire un contrat de gage, parce que ce contrat aurait exig\u00e9 la remise par Barlow aux Appelants de la possession des locomotives\nApr\u00e9s une enqu\u00eate assez consid\u00e9rable, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure apr\u00e8s audition sur le m\u00e9rite de l'action et de l'intervention seulement a rendu le 12 mars 1885 jugement d\u00e9clarant que les Appelants n'avaient pas prouv\u00e9 leur droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et que la transaction all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait qu'une vente simul\u00e9e pour obtenir un privil\u00e8ge sur les locomotives, sans donner la possession. Elle a maintenu l'intervention et renvoy\u00e9 l'action des Appelants.\nCe jugement porte en appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9.\nLes Appelants ont product plusieurs t\u00e9moins pour prouver que Barlow \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire des locomotives en question. Aprs en avoir dispos\u00e9 comme de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 personnelle, Barlow ne pouvait gu\u00e8re faire autrement que de declarer comme ii l'a fait dans son t\u00e9moignage, que ces locomotives lui appartenaient. Mais le contraire de cette pr\u00e9tention a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par les faits prouv\u00e9s par lui-m\u00eame dans ses transquestions et par le t\u00e9moignage de A. B. Chaffee, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la compagnie South Eastern Railway, dont Barlow \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident et le g\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Tous deux \u00e9tablissent que tous les argents provenant soit de l'exploitation du chemin de fer, soit d'emprunts, \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au cr\u00e9dit personnel dc Barlow et pay\u00e9s par lui sur son propre cheque. Il achetait tout cc qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour le chemin de fer m\u00eame le droit de passage et prenait les titres en son nom. Il avait aussi fait mettre en son nom le comp\u00e8re pour l'achat des locomotives; mais elles furent envoy\u00e9es directement de la manufacture sur le chemin de fer de la compagnie qui en paya le fret. Elles furent, pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, employ\u00e9es comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la compagnie, sans aucune convention de loyer ou de paiement pour leur usage. Jamais Barlow n'\u00e9leva la pr\u00e9tention d'en \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire, avant sa fuite de la province de Que D\u00e9c. vers le 5 d'ao\u00fbt 1883. Au contraire, dans les rapports faits au gouvernement par la compagnie et sign\u00e9s par Barlow, comme pr\u00e9sident, elles sont mentionn\u00e9es comme faisant partie des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la compagnie. Dans un autre \u00e9tat des affaires de la compagnie, pr\u00e9pare sous la direction de Barlow pour la n\u00e9gociation d'un emprunt avec Stephens et autres, ces m\u00eames locomotives furent comprises comme faisant partie du rolling stock de la compagnie. En cons\u00e9quence les cr\u00e9anciers de la compagnie avaient droit de les consid\u00e9rer comme faisant partie du chemin de fer et la conduite de Barlow \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 les confirmer dans cette croyance. La pr\u00e9tendue vente que leur en aurait fait Barlow ne peut avoir aucun effet quelconque parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait ni propri\u00e9taire ni en possession, qu\u2019au contraire la compagnie en avait la possession ouverte et publique. La pr\u00e9tendue vente \u00e9tant d'une chose qui n'appartenait pas au pr\u00e9tendu vendeur Barlow et dont ii n'a jamais fait la tradition, est absolument sans effet \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la compagnie ([9]) qui en \u00e9tait en possession. Quant an caract\u00e8re de l'\u00e9crit dont les Appelants inf\u00e8rent maintenant une vente apr\u00e8s l'avoir trait\u00e9 comme un contrat de gage dans leur d\u00e9claration, je le consid\u00e8re absolument sous le m\u00eame point de vue que l'honorable juge Cross qui, dans ses notes, en parle dans les termes suivants '.\nIt is obvious that it does not make any evidence of a sale, or that the transaction amounted to a sale. It was a mere pledge of the locomotives in security for the Appellants endorsement of notes for Barlow's accommodation\u00bb A pledge that was wholly inoperative as against any party having an adverse interest in the absence of an effective delivery to and a lawful possession by the pledge of the locomotives the subject of the pledge,\nL'intervenant, ayant \u00e9tabli sa qualit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9ancier en vertu d'un jugement obtenu par lui contre Barlow et la Compagnie du South Eastern Railway, avait droit d'intervenir dans cette cause pour sauvegarder ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en faisant maintenir la dite compagnie, sa d\u00e9bitrice, dans la possession des locomotives r\u00e9clam\u00e9es.\nJe suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoya avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J. I am of the opinion from the evidence afforded by the documents that the appellants were but the pledges and not the bon\u00e2fide owners of the locomotives in question, and that inasmuch as they had not, as such pledges, the possession of them they cannot maintain this action, and that as the question of the ownership of them as between O'Halloran and the South Eastern Railway Company does not arise on the pleadings in this case, it is unnecessary 1 think to refer to it. The appellants, to recover, must show their rights to do so, and in that they have, in my opinion, failed. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREATU J\u2014The appellants were plaintiffs in the court of premi\u00e8ve instance. The respondents are the South Eastern Railway Company, William Farwell, Wm. C. Van Home, and Warmen R. Blodgett in their quality as trustees of the bondholders of the South Eastern Railway who were defendants with Barlow, and the intervenant, James O'Halloran, a judgment creditor of Barlow. The plaintiffs allege that defendant Barlow obtained their endorsation to promissory notes to the amount of $50,000, and for their security pledged to them ten locomotives then and still used and operated on the South Eastern Railway but never delivered the locomotives to plaintiffs. That said locomotives are in the possession of said railway company or the trustees of its bondholders, and that plaintiffs having a lien on said locomotives are entitled to demand and have the same out of the possession of said railway company or said trustees, inasmuch as they have had to pay said notes; unless said defendants prefer to pay said sum of $50,000 interest and costs. They also allege that Barlow, who had received the money on said notes, was president and general manager of the South Eastern Railway, at the time and that he has since absconded. Plaintiffs' action is accompanied with an attachment, saisie-arr\u00eat conservatoire.\nPlaintiffs action is based on the following documents ([10]):\u2014\nTo this action the South Eastern Railway Company pleaded:\u2014\n1. A general denial.\n2. That at the time when the plaintiffs allege that the foregoing letters of pledge were made to them by defendant Barlow the ten locomotives claimed to have been pledged to plaintiffs, were the property of the South Eastern Railway Company, and not of Barlow, who had no property or ownership in said locomotives. That as appears by said letters and plaintiffs' declaration, Barlow, in his transaction, with plaintiffs, was acting solely in his private individual capacity and not as an officer of the South Eastern Railway Company, and that any transactions which Barlow may have had with plaintiffs was without the knowledge, consent or authority of said railway company. They include that this attachment be quashed, and plaintiffs' action dismissed.\nThe plaintiffs have adduced a large amount of evidence to prove that the locomotives were Barlow's; and Barlow himself as a witness for plaintiffs, swears that six of them, at least, were his. But his own cross-examination and the evidence of defendant's witness, A. B. Chaffee, fully disposed of his pretentions. He was president and general manager of the company. All monies belonging to the company, whether derived from earnings or loans, were placed to his credit individually he disbursed them as he pleased. He was in the habit of buying for the company even real estate for right of way and other purposes, and taking the deeds in his own individual name. He appears to have taken bills of sale of the locomotives in question in this manner, but they came directly from the manufacture!: to the company's road, the company paid freight, and never until Barlow, on or about the fifth August, 1883, absconded from this province, was any pretension made by Barlow or anyone else, that these locomotives were not the property of the company. Plaintiffs allege in their declaration that they never obtained possession of the locomotives, but that they then (at the time of the institution of the action) were in possession of the defendants, the South Eastern Railway Company or the Trustees of its bond holders. There is no pretense that Barlow had any authority from the railway company to pledge the locomotives, or that the railway company over received a dollar of the proceeds of the promissory notes.\nThe question of the ownership of these locomotives seems to me quite immaterial if the determination of the present case and on the general issue alone, the plaintiffs' action must fail.\nBy the very documents upon which the plaintiffs base their claim, it is patent that there was no sale by Barlow of these locomotives.\nThey moreover admit it for their own declaration in this case is based on the ground that there was no sale to them. They do not claim these locomotives as their property, they do not rededicated them as theirs; they purely and simply allege that they have a lien upon them. That is as clear an admission as possible that they do not own them and that they did not purchase them.\nNow if these documents did not operate a sale if they did not vest the ownership of these locomotives in the plaintiffs, did they operate as a pledge in their favour? Clearly not. Since there can be no pledge without the delivery of the article pledged in the hands of the pledged. This delivery is of the essence of the pledge, and the pledged has no privilege if the article is not in his hands.\nThe plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to the possession of these locomotives, and their action was rightly dismissed by the two courts below There is no ground for the contention that their action can be maintained because they might be entitled as against Barlow to the specific performance of his obligations to deliver them up, the said locomotives; for the gist of their action against the South Eastern Railway and the Trustees, is that Barlow is not in possession of these locomotives.\nAs to the intervention, it was rightly allowed.\nO'Halloran had a clear right to intervene to protect his interest as a creditor of both Barlow and the South Eastern. For him, it is quite immaterial whether these locomotives belong to the company or to barlow, but it is of the utmost importance for him that the plaintiffs do not get them.\nGwynne J.\u2014Concurred with Taschereau J.\nAppealdismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Church, Chapleau, Hall & Nicolls.\nSolicitors for respondent: James O'Halloran, O'Halloran & Duffy.\n[1] M.

In a suit to foreclose the latter\u2019s interest,\u2014\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restoring that of the Common Pleas Division, that he was bound to account for the proceeds of such sale.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Common Pleas Division[2], whereby the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed and he was ordered to pay certain monies to the defendant.\nThe defendant, McLean, was the surviving executor of one Cameron, to whom the land in question in this suit had been mortgaged in 1856 by one Romaine.\nIn 1864 the mortgage was assigned to the respondent Hime, and in 1880 a second assignment was made to Selina Cameron who brought a suit to obtain possession of the mortgage from Hime. This suit was settled by Hime paying Mrs. Cameron $500.00 and her interest in the mortgage was assigned to him. The equity of redemption, in 1877, was in the executors of one Zimmerman to whom it had been assigned by Romaine. Hime, by representing that he was the holder of the mortgage which had originally been made to secure \u00a3550.00 and that the amount due on it was more than the value of the land, obtained from these executors, for the nominal consideration of $4.00, a release or quit claim to a trustee for himself of their equity of redemption and afterwards sold it for $6000.\nA suit was then brought by Frederic Shirley Wilkins, as trustee for Hime, to foreclose the interest of McLean, surviving executor of the original mortgagee, and by a subsequent order in the suit Hime was added as a plaintiff.\nAt the hearing before Ferguson J. in the Chancery Division judgment was given in favor of the plaintiff and an order for foreclosure was made in default of the sum due on the mortgage being paid within a time specified. The case was afterwards transferred to the Common Pleas Division where the judgment of Ferguson J. was reversed, the action was dismissed, and the plaintiff ordered to pay the difference between the amount realised from the sale of the equity of redemption and the sum due on the assignments to himself and to Selina Cameron.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the Common Pleas Division and restored that of the court of first instance. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and W. Cassels Q.C. for the appellant, argued that Hime could not take advantage of his position as mortgagee to secure the equity of redemption and make money by it. The following authorities were cited. Grace v. MacDermott[3]; Synod v. DeBlaquiere[4]; Dalton v. Smith[5]; Slee v. Manhattan Co.[6]; MacLean v. Hime[7]; Lees v. Fisher[8]\nMoss Q.C. for the respondents referred to Williams on Executors[9].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nSTRONG J.\u2014On the 23rd of January, 1856, Charles Edward Romaine mortgaged certain lands in the city of Toronto described as lots 20, 21, 22 and 23, on the south side of Adelaide street, to one John D. Cameron, to secure \u00a3550 and interest. In 1857 Cameron died, having first made his will, duly executed, whereby he appointed the late Hon. Archibald McLean and the present appellant, Archibald George McLean, his executors and residuary legatees and devisees. The Hon. Archibald McLean and the appellant duly proved the will, and took upon themselves the duties of executors thereof. The Hon. Archibald McLean died in 1865. The appellant, through the agency of his brother Thomas McLean, on the 26th of April, 1864, deposited the mortgage deed before mentioned with the respondent, Humphrey Lloyd Hime, as security by way of a derivative or sub-mortgage to secure $401 and interest, being the amount of a loan then made by the respondent Hime to the appellant through the intervention of Thomas McLean. On the 8th of May, 1880, the appellant, Archibald McLean, then the surviving executor and residuary legatee under the will of Cameron, the original mortgagee, made an assignment of the same mortgage\u2014also by way of derivative or sub-mortgage\u2014to one Selina Cameron, as a security collateral to a covenant of even date for the payment of the sum of $2050 and Interest.\nSubsequently, and on the 9th of October, 1880, Selina Cameron assigned this last mortgage and the debt which it was given to secure to the respondent, Frederic Shirley Wilkins, who was, as is admitted, a mere trustee for the respondent, Hime.\nOn the 31st of December, 1856, the original mortgagor, Charles Edward Romaine, conveyed the equity of redemption in the mortgaged lands to Samuel Zimmerman. In March, 1857, Zimmerman died, having first duly executed his will, whereby he appointed Richard Miller, Richard Woodruff, Joseph A. Woodruff and John L. Ranney his executors, and whereby he also devised all his real and personal estate to his executors in trust. In 1877 Hime, being then a sub-mortgagee of the property under the derivative mortgage of the 26th April, 1864, applied to the executors of Zimmerman for a release to him of the equity of redemption, representing to them that he \u201ccontrolled\u201d the original mortgage and that the equity of redemption belonging to the estate of Zimmerman was worthless; and thereupon, on the 10 December, 1877, the executors of Zimmerman, for the nominal consideration of $4.00, executed a release of the equity of redemption in favor of one Arthur B. Harris, who, it is admitted, was a mere trustee for the respondent Hime.\nOn the 15th day of January, 1879, Harris, by the direction of Hime, conveyed to one Robert Quinn, who, it is admitted, was also a trustee for Hime. Subsequently to the execution of this last deed Hime contracted to sell the mortgaged lands to Ann Mackay for the price of $5,500, which was to be paid and satisfied by the conveyance by Mrs. Mackay to Hime of other property valued at that amount, and accordingly on the 6th day of May, 1879, Quinn, by the direction of Hime, conveyed the property to one William Hope, who, it is admitted, was a trustee for the purchaser, Mrs. Mackay; and Hope afterwards, on the 8th of January, 1880, conveyed the same lands absolutely to his cestui que trust Ann Mackay. The property, the conveyance of which was to form the consideration for the sale by Hime to Mrs. Mackay, was duly conveyed by the latter to Hime and was by him afterwards sold for the price of $6500 as I gather from Hime\u2019s own evidence. The conveyances were all duly registered and Mrs. McKay, so far as any equitable right of the present appellant is concerned appears to have been a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice of the equity now asserted by the appellant and which will be hereafter explained. Previously to the assignment by Selina Cameron to the respondent Wilkins (as a trustee for Hime) of the 9th October 1880 already stated, Mrs. Cameron had filed her bill against Mrs. McKay, Romaine the original mortgagor, and the respondent Hime, alleging that she was an assignee of the mortgage of the 23rd of January 1856, and praying that the mortgaged lands might be sold for the satisfaction of her debt. To this bill Hime filed his answer put in under oath in which he swore as follows:\u2014\n2. I say that I have a lien upon the said mortgage in the bill mentioned and that the same was deposited with me on behalf of the late Chief Justice McLean, and of the said Archibald G. McLean, both in the bill mentioned, to secure the payment to me of the sum of four hundred and one dollars and twenty three cents, and interest thereon from the 26th day of April, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty four, the whole of which is still due to me.\n3. The said mortgage was so deposited with me and pledged as aforesaid, on or about the said twenty sixth day of April one thousand eight hundred and sixty four.\n4. The plaintiff had actual notice of such deposit and of my said claim and lien before the assignment to her of the said mortgage in the bill mentioned.\n5. I submit that I am entitled to be paid the said sum and interest and the costs of this suit before I am called upon to deliver up the said mortgage to the plaintiff.\nThis suit was never brought to a hearing but was compromised by Hime who paid off Mrs. Cameron and thereupon took the assignment of the 8th October, 1880, to the respondent Wilkins already stated. On the 5th of December, 1859, the Bank of Upper Canada having recovered a judgment against the executors of Zimmerman the sheriff, under a writ of fi. fa. issued thereon, assumed to sell the mortgaged lands, and the bank assumed to purchase the same and took from the sheriff a deed poll to carry out the sale, but such sale being wholly void and abortive according to the decisions of the Ontario courts, inasmuch as in the state of the statute law then existing an equity of redemption could not be sold under an execution against executors, the crown in whom all the estate and assets of the Bank of Upper Canada had become vested by statute, in order to waive any rights under the sheriff\u2019s deed on the 9th March, 1878, for the nominal consideration of one dollar, released the lands to Arthur B. Harris, as a trustee for the respondent Hime.\nOn the 28th of December, 1877, Catherine C. Heward, who it was supposed had some title to the mortgaged lands paramount to the mortgage by Romaine to Cameron, also by a deed of release of that date for the nominal consideration of one dollar released the same lands to Arthur B. Harris as a trustee for the respondent Hime.\nIn this state of facts and title the respondent Hime in the year 1881 commenced the present suit at first in the sole name of his trustee the respondent Wilkins (though Hime himself was afterward added as a plaintiff by amendment), as the assignee of the derivative mortgage made by the appellant to Mrs. Cameron on the 8th of May, 1880, already stated, praying a foreclosure in default of payment of the amount of the debt thereby secured and interest accrued thereon. The appellant filed an answer and supplemental answer in which he set up in substance the facts hereinbefore stated so far as the same are material, and claimed to be paid the sum produced by the sale of the property acquired by Hime from Mrs. Mackay. A replication having been filed, the cause came on to be heard before Mr. Justice Ferguson, when the fact that the release of the equity of redemption was obtained from the executors of Zimmerman in the manner hereinbefore mentioned was proved, and the other facts, deeds and documents before stated having also been clearly established, the learned judge, on the 9th December, 1882, pronounced the usual foreclosure judgment on the footing of the derivative mortgage of the 8th of May, 1880, made by the appellant to Selina Cameron, viz: that in default of payment within the usual period of the principal debt and interest originally due to Selina Cameron and assigned to respondent Hime, the appellant should be foreclosed as regarded his interest in the original mortgage and that in the event of redemption the respondents should re-assign to the appellant the original mortgage made by Romaine. The cause having been transferred from the Chancery to the Common Pleas Division, the appellant appealed to the latter Division sitting in banc, and on the 27th of June, 1883, a judgment was pronounced in that appeal allowing the same, and referring it to the official referee to take an account and ascertain how much of the value of the land received by Hime from Mrs. Mackay was to be attributed to the equity of redemption in these mortgaged lands, and that after deducting from such amount the sums due upon the mortgage by deposit made by the appellant to Hime in April, 1864, and that due upon the mortgage to Mrs. Cameron of the 8th of May, 1880, Hime should pay the balance to the appellant together with his costs.\nFrom this judgment the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal, which court on the 4th of November, 1886, pronounced an order whereby the appeal was allowed, the judgment of the Common Pleas Division reversed and that of Mr. Justice Ferguson restored with costs. The appellant has now appealed to this court.\nThere can be no doubt or question that Hime, when in 1877 he obtained the release of the equity of redemption from Zimmerman\u2019s executors, was a derivative mortgagee by deposit of the original mortgage made by Romaine. Hime\u2019s own evidence at the trial is amply sufficient to establish this,\u2014moreover in the extract from his answer filed in the suit brought by Mrs. Cameron, before set out, he distinctly swears that the mortgage was deposited with him as a security for the money lent by him to Thomas McLean for the use of the present appellant. Further, in an action of detinue brought by the appellant against Hime in the Court of Common Pleas, McLean v. Hime[10] as far back as 1876, to recover the mortgage deed, it was determined by that court in banc, upon a motion to enter a verdict for the defendant in the action, that Hime was a mortgagee of the principal mortgage under the transaction with Thomas McLean and entitled to retain the mortgage deed against the present appellant as a security for the amount of his advance of $401 and interest from the 26th of April, 1864, the court holding that Thomas McLean acted in the transaction with the privity and assent and as the agent of the appellant.\nThe question is then resolved into a pure question of equity, namely, was the appellant, in addition to his clear right to redeem Hime in respect to both the two sub-mortgages, viz; that originally made to Hime himself by deposit, and that of the 8th of May, 1880, made to Mrs. Cameron and assigned by her to Hime, entitled to an account of the money which had come to his hands as the proceeds of the sale of the property received by him from Mrs. MacKay as the consideration for the sale to her of the mortgaged property. In consequence of the sale to Mrs. MacKay, a purchaser for value without notice, the recovery of the specific property obtained by the release of the equity of redemption by Zimmerman\u2019s executors had become impossible and the appellant was therefore, on well established principles, entitled to enforce any equity which he had against the monies which had come to the hands of Hime as its produce or rather to the money into which the property received from Mrs Mackay had been further converted by sale.\nThe Common Pleas Division based their judgment entirely upon the ground that Hime had obtained the release of the equity of redemption by asserting himself to have the control of the original mortgage, and by alleging that the equity of redemption was worthless. Although these representations no doubt greatly strengthened the case of the appellant and now constitute a good ground for giving him costs he might not otherwise have been entitled to, they were not, I think, essential to the relief which the judgment of the Common Pleas Division gave him, for irrespective of these representations his character of a derivative mortgagee was by itself sufficient to disentitle him to retain for his own benefit as against the appellant asking to redeem, any estate in the mortgaged lands which he had acquired whilst he held the mortgage made by deposit in April, 1864.\nIn order to entitle the appellant to redeem any acquisition in respect of the same land as that comprised in the mortgage as well as the mortgage itself, it was not incumbent on him to prove that Hime had made use of the advantage which his position of deriv- ative mortgagee gave him to obtain such acquisitions or additions, for however innocent he may have been in his dealings with the owner of the equity of redemption his character of sub-mortgagee disabled him from obtaining by purchase or otherwise any interest in the equity of redemption which he could withhold from his mortgagor. A sub-mortgagee stands in a quasi fiduciary position as regards his mortgagor and the broad principle of equity first established in the leading case of Keech v. Sandford[11] applies to him in all its fulness. It is well established that a mortgagee of leaseholds who is not bound to renew, who may, after the right to renew has lapsed by effluxion of time, obtain with his own money and in his own name a renewal of the lease, holds it nevertheless subject to redemption by the mortgagor. As Lord Nottingham says in Rushworth\u2019s Case[12]:\nThe mortgagee here doth but graft upon his stock and it shall be for the mortgagor\u2019s benefit.\nAnd see in notes to Keech v. Sandford[13] and cases there cited[14].\nThe converse of the same principle also applies, and if the mortgagor obtains a renewal that in like manner enures to the benefit of the mortgagee irrespective of any agreement to that effect[15]. The case of a mortgagee of leaseholds obtaining a renewal is manifestly a stronger case than the present, though the principle on which it proceeds is the same, viz: that the mortgagee shall not intercept any advantage which the mortgagor might possibly have derived as the owner of the property mortgaged. In a case like the present it is obvious that the release of the equity of redemption by the executors of Zimmerman in order to avoid the trouble and annoyance of a suit for foreclosure was an advantage which might have been obtained by the appellant had he retained the mortgage in his own hands. Not merely the original mortgage itself but everything incidental to it was taken by Hime subject to redemption, and if he chose to speculate with the owners of the equity of redemption on the strength of his position as mortgagee he must be considered as doing so for the benefit of his mortgagor and be held accountable to him for the profits he may have made.\nI find no English case in which the doctrine of Keech v. Sandford has been applied in the actual case now before us of a derivative mortgagee obtaining a release of the equity of redemption, but in the American case of Slee v. Manhattan Co.[16] an equity judge of the highest eminence, Chancellor Walworth, unhesitatingly applied the doctrine to a case precisely similar to the present that of a derivative mortgagee purchasing the equity of redemption. The learned judge in that case says:\nAgain the purchase of Frear & Hallowell\u2019s equity of redemption accrued to the benefit of Slee on the well known principle of equity that where the mortgagee has gotten the renewal of a lease or obtained any other advantage in consequence of his situation as such mortgagee the mortgagor coming to redeem is entitled to have the benefit thereof.\nNothing can be clearer or more apposite than this; it exactly applies to the facts of the present case, and confirms me in the conclusion which I should otherwise certainly have arrived at on the general principles enunciated in Keech v. Sandford and the numerous cases which have followed that authority.\nI am of opinion that the appellant is entitled to a reversal of the order of the Court of Appeal and to have a judgment entered in the original court declaring him entitled to redeem Hime in respect of the purchase of the equity of redemption, and directing an account of how much of the money derived by Hime on the sale or conversion of the land obtained by him from Mrs. Mackay is to be attributed to the sale by him of lands comprised in the mortgage from Romaine to Cameron with interest from the date of the receipt of such amount, and that from the amount so found due there be deducted what upon the proper accounts being taken may appear to be due to Hime for principal and interest upon the foot of his two mortgages, namely, the mortgage by deposit of the 26th April 1864, and that by the appellant to Mrs. Cameron of the 8th of May 1880, and that any residue which may remain after such deduction be paid to the appellant and that the appellant be paid his costs in this court and in all the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Blake, Lash, Cassels & Holman.\nSolicitors for respondents: Edgar & Malone.\n[1] 13 Ont.

J. Ritchie C. J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry Taschcreau and Gwynne J J.\non appeal from the court 01 queens bench for LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nServitude\u2014Barn erected over alley subject to right of access to drain .-Aggravation\u2014At 557 6.0. Damages.\nIn 1843, B. at al (the plaintiffs) by deed obtained the right of draining their property by passing a good drain through an alley left open between two houses on another lot in the town of St. Johns. In 1880, W. et al. (defendants) built a barn covering the alley under which the drain was constructed and used it to store hay &c. the flooring being loose and the barn resting on wooden posts. In 1881 the drain needing repairs the plaintiffs brought an action confessoria against defendants as proprietors of the servient land, praying that they (plaintiffs) may be declared to have a right to the servitude constituted by the deed of 1843 and that the defendants be ordered to demolish such a portion of the barn as diminished the use of the drain and rendered its exercise more inconvenient, and claiming damages : the defendants pleaded inter alia that there was no chance of condition of the servient land contrary to law, and prayed for the dismissal of plaintiffs' action.\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that by the building of the barn in question, the plaintiffs' means of access to the drain had been materially interfered with and rendered more expensive, and therefore that the judgment of the court below ordering the defendants to demolish a portion of their barn covering the said drain, in order to allow the plaintiffs to repair the drain as easily as they might have done in 1843, when said drain was not covered, and to pay $50 damages should be affirmed.\nPer Gwynne J., That all plaintiffs were entitled to was a declaration of the right to free access to the land in question for the purpose of making all necessary repairs in the drain as occasion might require, without any impediment or obstruction to their so doing being caused by the barn which had been erected over the drain, and that the action for damages was premature. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Beench for Lower Canada (appeal side) maintaining the respondents action (1).\nThe question which arose on this appeal was whether the appellants, by building a barn in an alley in the town of St. Johns through which the respondents had a right to have a good drain, had aggravated the servitude so as to entitle the respondents to a judgment of the court ordering the demolition of a portion of the barn and to pay $50 damages.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the head note, report of the case in the court below ([1]) and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nRobertson Q.C, for appellants, contended that as the evidence proved there is no solid floor in the barn and that the drain could be raised up and repaired in the barn, just as well as, if not better than outside the barn there had been no change of the condition of the servient land as meant by law. Citing art 557 C. C. Demo-lombe ([2]); Laurent ([3]); Dalloz Vo. Servitude ([4]); Sirez Code Annot\u00e9 ([5]); Curasson Action Possesoires ([6]); Lepage Lois des b\u00e2timents ([7]); Pardessus Servitudes ([8]). He also contended that the appellants were never put en demeure.\nGeoffrion Q.C. for respondents.\nThe right of access to repair the drain is an essential part of the servitude, and that being so and the evidence clearly establishing that the building as it stands tends to diminish the use of our servitude, or at least to render its exercise more inconvenient we are entitled under art. 557 C. C. to the judgment we have obtained. In any case our action being an action confessoire, the appellants cannot succeed in having it dismissed.\nAs to notice We protested when the barn Was being built.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J.\u2014The present appellants in. their factum say they desire to submit to this court but one question, namely : Admitting that the servitude in question exists and hats been duly registered, does the record show or is there\" any proof, that the present' appellants as owners of the servient land, have done any act tending to diminish the use of the servitude or render its exercise more inconvenient? This was the only question submitted to the court that rendered the judgment appealed from and the only one submitted to this court.\nI think it clearly appears that the defendants have erected' upon and over the site of this drain a building which, in my opinion, tends to diminish the use of the servitude and renders its exercise more inconvenient. It would seem that repairs are now necessary, and that the barn is an obstacle Which actually interferes with making such repairs. If any damage was sustained by reason of the stoppage of this drain the person whose duty it was to repair it would be liable; at any rate, he has necessarily the right to enter and repair and is entitled to the opportunity and means of doing so whenever the necessity should arise, and, in my opinion the erection of this bam over this drain, as the evidence\" shows it to have been constructed necessarily obstructs the plaintiffs' right and deprives them of the same reasonable means of access that they would have had if the barn had not been erected I cannot think the right to enter and repair this drain can, as is contended, depend on consent to be obtained: for that \"purpose Suppose the defendants or their tenant refused leave, is the plaintiffs' cellar to remain full of water until the termination of a lengthy litigation? And where is the duty imposed on the plaintiffs to enter the defendants' barn, incur the expense of removing property that may be therein, taking up the floor, and generally removing all obstructions before being in a position to examine or open up the drain for repairs? Or, should repairs not be necessary for a lengthened period, and the plaintiffs allow the obstructions to remain for a sufficiently long time are the defendants to be permitted to acquire by prescription or otherwise the right to maintain the barn as it is and so to be in a position to resist any interference with it by the plaintiffs, or whoever may be the proprietor of the servitude?\nUnder these circumstances I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am also of opinion for the reasons given by the majority of the court below, that the appeal should be dismissed. I cannot agree with the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Ramsay. The law governing this case is precisely identical with the law of England as appears by the case of Goodhart v. Hyett ([9]). That decision is entirely in point, and the law it lays down is precisely similar to that of the Province of Quebec.\nFOURNIER, J. :\u2014L'action confessoria servitutis intent\u00e9e en cour inf\u00e9rieure par les pr\u00e9sents Intim\u00e9s, avait pour but de faire d\u00e9clarer que le lot de terre des Appelants d\u00e9crit en la declaration en cette cause \u00e9tait assuj\u00e9ti au profit du lot des Intim\u00e9s \u00e0 une servitude d'\u00e9gout en vertu d'un acte de vente consenti en 1843 Par Pierre Dubeau \u00e0 feu John Black cr\u00e9ant cette servitude dans les termes suivants : Le droit de drainer la cave ou les caves du dit lot 171, en construisant et faisant passer un bon drain \u00e0 travers le lot du dit Pierre Dubeau, situe dans la dite ville, entre les rues Richelieu et Champlain, connu sous la d\u00e9signation du lot T, le dit drain devant passer au-dessous d'une all\u00e9e entre les maisons sur le lot de Dubeau, allant d'une rue \u00e0 l'autre.\nCet acte de vente \u00e9tablissant la servitude en question, fut enregistr\u00e9 par sommaire le 6 octobre 1843, et le canal d'\u00e9gout fut construit conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la stipulation contenue au dit acte traversant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pierre Dubeau pour aller d\u00e9boucher dans le canal Chambly. Par acte de vente du 11 mars 1880 \u00e0 eux consenti par un nomm\u00e9 John Hugh Wise, les Intim\u00e9s achet\u00e8rent le lot de terre, pour le service duquel Pierre Dubeau avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 la servitude en question en faveur de feu John Black. Cet acte fut aussi enregistr\u00e9. Leur vendeur Wise \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire en vertu de bons et valables titres.\nLe 7 mars 1880 Louis Dubeau vendit aux Appelants le lot que Pierre Dubeau avait assuj\u00e9ti \u00e0 la servitude d'\u00e9gout en faveur de feu John Black. Les Intim\u00e9s, depuis leur acquisition et leurs auteurs avant eux, out toujours joui de leur droit de servitude sur ce dernier jusqu'\u00e0 l'automne 1880, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle les Appelants ont construit sur l'all\u00e9e o\u00f9 passe l'\u00e9gout une grange, qui les emp\u00eachait de faire au dit \u00e9gout les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires. Ils out conclu \u00e0 des dommages et \u00e0 la d\u00e9molition de l'obstacle mis \u00e0 leur paisible jouissance de la dite servitude.\nPlusieurs plaidoyers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits contre cette demande, mais les seuls qui m\u00e9ritent consid\u00e9ration sont les suivants :Que l'un des d\u00e9fendeurs, Coker, ayant cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre l'un des propri\u00e9taires de l\u2019immeuble servant l'action ne pouvait \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre lui. 20 Que l'acte de vente du 22 ao\u00fbt 1843, n'avait pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude r\u00e9elle sur le lot des d\u00e9fendeurs, parce que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question n'\u00e9taient pas contigu\u00ebs, mais, qu'au contraire, elles \u00e9taient s\u00e9par\u00e9es par un chemin public, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence les Intim\u00e9s et leurs auteurs n'avaient acquis qu'un droit personnel. 30. Que la servitude en question \u00e9tant un droit r\u00e9el, elle devait \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e, et l'enregistrement d'icelle renouvel\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9lais fixes par la loi mais que le renouvellement n'avait pas eu lieu que le drain en question est inutile.\nLes diff\u00e9rentes questions soulev\u00e9es par ces plaidoiries sont abandonn\u00e9es par les Appelants, qui ont formellement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne soumettre \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de la cour que la seule question de savoir s'ils ont commis quelque acte tendant \u00e0 diminuer la jouissance du droit de servitude ou \u00e0 en rendre l'exercice plus incommode Leur factum contient \u00e0 ce sujet la d\u00e9claration suivante:\u2014\nThe present appellant desires to submit to this court but one question :\nAdmitting that the servitude in question exists and has been duly registered, does the record show or is there any proof that the present appellants, as owners of the servient land have done any act tending to diminish the use of the servitude or render its exercise more inconvenient. This was the only question submitted to the court that rendered the judgment appealed from and the only one submitted to this honorable court\nLa cause se trouve ainsi r\u00e9duite \u00e0 une seule question de fait, savoir, si la preuve a \u00e9tabli que le trouble apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la jouissance des Intim\u00e9s par la construction d'une grange au-dessus du canal d'\u00e9gout a eu l'effet de diminuer l'\u00e9tendue de leur droit de servitude on d'en rendre l'exercice plus incommode. Sur ce point de fait plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus de part et d'autre.\nLe passage dans lequel Pierre Dubeau avait accord\u00e9 le droit de construire le canal d'\u00e9gout est aujourd'hui enti\u00e8rement obstru\u00e9 par la construction d'une grange de 35\u00bd pieds de largeur sur environ 90 \u00e0 100 pieds de longueur. Cette grange se trouve au-dessus du canal et doit partant n\u00e9cessairement diminuer les facilit\u00e9s des Intim\u00e9s pour la r\u00e9paration et l'entretien de ce canal. Le t\u00e9moin Oscame Pr\u00e9vost s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 ce sujet :\u2014\nIl est possible qu'on pourrait lever le canal sous la grange en creusant en dessous de la grange, mais ce serait bien dispendieux; ii faudrait d'abord vider ce qu'il y avait dans cette partie de la grange qui couvre le canal; ensuite ii faudrait d\u00e9faire le plancher, s'il y en a Un enlever la terre de surplus et la mettre en dehors de la grange, et refaire ensuite le plancher et remettre dans la grange les marchandises qui auraient Pu en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9es et c'est l\u00e0 le surcroit de d\u00e9pens\u00e9e que la r\u00e9paration de ce canal occasionnerait; il faudrait renouveler ces d\u00e9penses l\u00e0 chaque fois que le canal viendrait en mauvais ordre.\nJOSEPH ARPIN DIT :\u2014\nSi la grange \u00e9tait vide au moment o\u00f9 on aurait besoin de faire des r\u00e9parations dans ce canal, je consid\u00e8re que cette grange n'apporterait aucun obstacle \u00e0 ces r\u00e9parations pourvu qu'on en perm\u00eet l'entr\u00e9e ainsi que l'ouvrage; mais si.le canal se trouvait \u00e0 passer vis-\u00e0-vis une porte, sous une batterie, alors ce serait un obstacle s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 la confection de ces r\u00e9parations.\"\nFran\u00e7ois Dufour dit positivement que le canal d'\u00e9gout de la maison de brique des Intim\u00e9s passe sous la grange dans toute sa profondeur.\nLes t\u00e9moins des Appelants, parmi lesquels se trouve le p\u00e8re de Wheeler, disent qu'il serait facile malgr\u00e9 cette construction, de r\u00e9parer le canal. Wheeler dit :\u2014\nIt would be very easy to take off that floor (le plancher de la grange). It would not cost more than ten cents.\nPierre Joubert dit :\u2014\nEn \u00f4tant le plancher de la grange, je pense qu'il serait facile de creuser en dessous de la grange pour v d\u00e9couvrir un canal qui serait l\u00e0; et il serait facile d'\u00f4ter le plancher.\nIsra\u00ebl Daniel dit \u2014\nQu'il serait facile suivant moi de creuser en. dessous de la grange pour lever le canal d'\u00e9gout, attendu qu'il n'y a pas sole et qu'il n'v a qu'une \u00e9paisseur de planche, et du moment qu'il n'y a pas de four-rase dans la grange ce ne sera pas plus difficile de creuser dans la grange que dehors.\nC'est l\u00e0 toute la preuve offerte par les parties sur le seul point en contestation devant cette cour. Il en resort bien clairement qu'un changement consid\u00e9rable dans l'\u00e9tat du terrain sujet \u00e0 la servitude d'\u00e9gout a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par les Appelants. Au lieu d'exercer leur droit sur un terrain vacant, n'offrant aucun obstacle aux excavations \u00e0 faire pour d\u00e9couvrir le canal au cas de r\u00e9parations \u00e0 y faire, les. Intim\u00e9s auraient maintenant \u00e0 p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans la grange des Appelants\u2014ce qu'ils ne pourraient jamais faire sans. une permission sp\u00e9ciale\u2014 et avant de faire aucune excavation ils auraient \u00e0 lever le plancher de la grange, et si alors la grange contenait du foin ou autres effets, ii faudrait avant d'y d\u00e9poser la terre provenant de l'excavation, enlever ces articles, et remettre les choses dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat apr\u00e9s les r\u00e9parations faites. Ii est \u00e9vident que l'ouvrage serait plus consid\u00e9rable et plus dispendieux fait dans cette b\u00e2tisse que s'il devait \u00e9tre fait sur un terrain vacant. L'exercice du droit de servitude a \u00e9t\u00e9 certainement diminu\u00e9 et rendu plus difficile par la construction de la grange. Le droit des Intim\u00e9s de faire dispara\u00eetre les obstacles apport\u00e9s \u00e0 leur jouissance est \u00e9tabli par l'article 557, C. C. Demolombe ([10]) dit \u00e0 ce ujet :\u2014\nLorsque le propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant, a fait un ouvrage quelconque qui a rendu l'exercice de la servitude plus incommode ou moins complet ii est tenu \u00e9videmment de remettre les lieux dans leur premier \u00e9tat, sans pr\u00e9judice des dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats auxquels il pourrait en outre, \u00e9tre condamn\u00e9 suivant les circonstances. Et il ne nous para\u00eet pas douteux, qu'il ne pourrait pas alors en abandonnant le fonds assuj\u00e9ti, d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 699, s'affranchir de l\u2019 obligation personnelle, qu'il a contract\u00e9e par son quasi-d\u00e9lit envers le propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant.\nIl ne me parait pas douteux que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. It has been proved that the drain was stopped. There is a cross street and it is true that the stoppage may have been on that street but while the barn remained over the drain the plaintiffs were prevented from opening it so as to ascertain where the stoppage really was, and I do not think it could be said that they were not entitled to damages, because it was not proved that the stoppage was in the drain.\nThe law is perfectly plain. The party would be entitled to remove the barn and everything in the way of opening the drain. But if he removed it he would have to do it at his own expense and such a removal is very expensive. It makes no difference if the barn was so built as to be easily removed. That is not the question. We are trying the legal rights of the parties. They could agree on that themselves, but not having done so, the plaintiffs are entitled to the judgment of this court upon the legal question submitted.\nUnder all the circumstances, I think the plaintiffs are entitled to recover because the use of the drain has been hindered. The only question is as to the amount of damages.\nAs to the demolition, I think the court had a right to make the order. There is no other way of getting at the drain until the barn is removed. The plaintiffs would have the right to remove it themselves, and if so, the court has a right to order its removal. It may be a hardship, but we have nothing to do with that. We must decide the case without regard to hardship. Although it was the defendants' own land the record shows that the other party had the right of access without any interference whatever.\nTASCHEREU J.\u2014The respondents, claiming to be the owners of immoveable property to which was attached a right of drainage through the property of the appellants, and to have been deprived of the enjoyment and possession of the said servitude by the construction of a large barn over the said drain, brought the present action against the appellants to recover the sum of $300 damages for the loss and injury sustained thereby, and to have the property of the appellants declared to have been and to be still subject to the said servitude, and the said appellants ordered to demolish the portion of the said barn which tends to diminish the use of the servitude and to render its exercise more inconvenient. .The judgment of the court below granted the prayer of the complaint against the defendant Wheeler but the other defendant Coker having sold to said Wheeler his undivided half in the property before the commencement of the action, but after the construction of the barn, only that portion of the prayer of the complaint against Coker was granted which asked that the defendants be condemned jointly and severally to pay damages to plaintiffs, by reason of both having erected the building which deprived them of the said servitude.\nThe appellants appealed from this judgment to the Court of Queen's Bench, which confirmed it with a slight modification in the manner of executing it.\nOnly one question was submitted to this court by the appellants. Does the record show, or is there any proof that the appellants, as owners of the servient land, have done any act tending to diminish the use of the servitude or render its exercise more inconvenient? So that the appellants rest their case purely and simply on a question of fact, upon which they have against them the finding of the two courts below. The law of the case is so clear that they could not but admit it \"The proprietor of the servient land, (says art. 557 C. \" C.,) can do nothing which tends to diminish the use of the servitude or to render its exercise more inconvenient.\" Does the proof establish that by building the barn in question the appellants have rendered for the respondents the exercise of the servitude in question more inconvenient? The consid\u00e9rant of the Superior Court on this head is as follows :\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant quo dans l'esp\u00e8ce ii appert par le preuve quo les d\u00e9fendeurs ont dans l'automne 1880 \u00e9rig\u00e9 des constructions sur le lu fonds servant de mani\u00e8re a couvrir l'all\u00e9e dont il \u00e9tait question dans le titre cr\u00e9atif de la dite servitude, ainsi que le canal d'\u00e9gout s' y trouvant enfoui et consid\u00e9rant que les d\u00e9fendeurs n'avaient pas le droit, dans les circonstances do faire telle construction \u00e0 l'endroit et do la mani\u00e8re sus indiqu\u00e9e les demandeurs se trouvant dans l'impossibilit\u00e9, \u00e0 raison do la dite construction, de pourvoir \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration do leur canal d'\u00e9go\u00fbt do la mani\u00e8re dont ils pouvaient le faire en vertu du titre cr\u00e9atif de la dite servitude et do la mani\u00e8re dont les d\u00e9fendeurs devaient le souffrir en vertu du m\u00eame acte.\nThis finding is entirely supported by the evidence, and I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The judgment of the Court of Appeal appears to me to go further than is warranted by the evidence. The evidence, in my opinion fails to establish. any right in the plaintiffs to have a judgment in their favor, ordering the demolition of any part of the barn which has been erected on the servient land.\nIt fails to establish that there has as yet arisen any necessity for the plaintiffs to open the drain under the barn for the purpose of repairing the drain in question. It may be that the obstruction in the drain which causes the damages to the plaintiffs' house of which they complain is, as it has been before found to be, in that part of the drain which is under the street between the plaintiffs' tenement and that of the \u00abdefendant Wheeler, so that there may have as yet arisen no necessity whatever for opening the drain under the barn; and if upon further investigation it should prove to be necessary to open and inspect that part of the drain, the evidence I think fails to establish that the barn, as it stands would offer any obstruction which could not easily be overcome without the demolition of any part of it, or which could be said to abridge or impair the plaintiffs' power to exercise their right of servitude. The floor of the barn is said to be made of loose boards not nailed down at least in that part which is over the drain which boards could be easily removed; and if the barn should be empty or that part of it which is over the drain when the plaintiffs should require to repair the drain in that part which passes under the barn, the evidence seems to show that the barn would offer . no obstruction to the plaintiffs making all necessary repairs. No case is, I think, established to warrant at present the demolition of any part of the barn. Nor has any case been made out, in my opinion, to support the judgment for damages against the defendants for the mere erection of the barn. These damages can only be sustained upon the assumption that the mere erection of the barn although it should offer no obstruction to making repairs in the drain has caused and constitutes an abridgment of the plaintiffs' right of servitude. This appears to me to be erroneous. If, when a necessity arises for repairing the drain under the barn, it shall be found that all necessary repairs can he made and so that the servitude which the plaintiffs claim a right to can be fully exercised with the barn as it stands it cannot be said that the barn has diminished the \"plaintiff's use of the servitude or has rendered its exercise more inconvenient. The award of damages is, in my opinion, altogether pre-mature. I am of opinion, therefore, that the defendant Coker was and is entitled to \"judgment in his favor dismissing the plaintiffs' action against him with costs and as to defendant Wheeler, I am of opinion that the ends of justice would be satisfied by a judgment simply declaring that the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain the drain in question and to have free access to the piece of land of the defendant Wheeler in question for the purpose of making all necessary-repairs in the drain, as occasion may require, without any impediment or obstruction to their so doing being caused by the barn which has been erected over the drain or otherwise and as the defendant Wheeler has upon the record contested this right he should pay the costs of the action; but this appeal should be allowed, in my opinion, to the extent of making the above alteration in, and modification of, the \"judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Robertson, Ritchie & Fleet.\nSolicitors for respondents : Geoffrioni, Dorioti, Lafleur & Rinfret.\n[1] M.L.R. 2 Q.

B., for Bathurst, N. B., to load lumber under charter. Having sustained damages on the voyage she was taken to St. John, N. B., for repairs, and when such repairs were completed it was too late in the season to proceed to Bathurst. In an action against the owner for breach of charter party the jury found that the repairs could have been made at Sidney, C. B., in time to enable the ship to go to Bathurst.\nHeld, that the jury having pronounced on the questions of fact, and their verdict having been affirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, this court would not interfere with the finding.\nHeld, also, that under such finding taking the vessel to St. John was such an unnecessary deviation from the voyage as to entitle the charterer to recover.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], sustaining a verdict for the plaintiff and refusing a new trial.\nOn the 12th September, 1882, Kennedy F. Burns, the plaintiff, chartered the defendants ship, \"Her Majesty,\" to carry lumber from Bathurst, N. B., to Liverpool. The ship sailed for Bathurst some ten days after the charter being then in good repair and on the way out encountered heavy weather. When near Cape Scatterie, the eastern extremity of Cape Breton, the master of the ship decided that she would require repairs before going to Bathurst and took her to St. John to have such repairs made. Both Sidney and Port Hawkesbury were much nearer ports and if the repairs could have been made at either of those ports they would have been completed much sooner.\nThe ship went to St. John and seeing that it would be too late in the season to proceed to Bathurst after the repairs were finished the captain notified the plaintiff that the charter party would not be fulfilled and chartered her in St. John. The plaintiff thereupon brought an action for breach of the charter and obtained a verdict, the jury finding, in answer to questions submitted, that the repairs on the vessel could have been made at Sidney and completed in time to enable the vessel to load at Bathurst. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick refused a new trial. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nSkinner Q.C. for the appellant.\nW. Pugsley for the respondent.\nSkinner Q.C. having stated the nature of the appeal was stopped by the court.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am afraid you cannot get along with this appeal. It has been laid down in this court, and in the Privy Council, that where a jury have passed on a question of fact, and their finding has been affirmed by the court, a court of appeal will not override it.\nThe repairs could have been made at Sidney and the jury have found that it was not necessary to go to St. John and that had the ship gone to Sidney or Port Hawkesbury the repairs could have been made in time to enable her to carry out her contract. She put it out of her power to do that and I therefore think the court below was right upon the law and upon the facts as found by the jury.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C. N. Skinner.\nSolicitors for respondent: Harrison & Rand.\n[1] 25 N.B. Rep. 13.\n"}

S. C. ch. 9, sec. 10.\nAn order extending time for service of an election petition filed at Halifax from five days to fifteen days, on the ground that the respondent was at Ottawa, is a proper order for the judge to make in the exercise of his discretion under section 10 of ch. 9, R. S. C.\nSemble, per Ritchie C.J. and Henry J., that the court below had power to make rules for the service of an election petition out of the jurisdiction.\nPer Strong J.\u2014An extremely strong case should be shown to induce the court to allow an appeal from the judgment of the court below on preliminary objections.\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, overruling certain preliminary objections presented by the appellant against an election petition filed against the appellant by the respondents.\nThe petitioner Laurie was a candidate at the election, and resides in the County of Halifax, about two hundred miles from Shelburne. The other petitioner, Bowers, resides in Shelburne, in the County of Shelburne. The solicitors of the petitioners reside at Shelburne, about two hundred miles from Halifax.\nThe petition was filed at Halifax on the second day of May, 1887, in the afternoon. On the same day the petitioners' agent, at Halifax, telegraphed to the petitioners' solicitors, at Shelburne, informing them of the fact. An affidavit, which had been previously prepared, was immediately sworn to on the third day of May by the petitioner, John Bowers, for the purpose of obtaining an order to serve the petition out of the jurisdiction of the court, the appellant being then in the city of Ottawa. This affidavit was forwarded at once and reached Halifax on the morning of the fifth of May, and an application was immediately, on the same day, made to the Chief Justice for an order to serve the petition out of the jurisdiction, and to extend the same for service. This order was granted, and the documents were forwarded by the first mail to Ottawa and served on the appellant on the ninth of May, 1887.\nOn the 13th May, the appellant obtained an ex parte order to extend the time for presenting preliminary objections.\nOn the 23rd May, 1887, the appellant filed a notice of appointment of agent or appearance.\nOn the 28 May, 1887, the appellant filed preliminary objections, and amongst others the following:\u2014\n5. The service of said petition and of said notice and receipt was too late and made after the time limited therefor had expired, and was and is irregular and void, the said petition was presented on the 2nd of May, A.D. 1887, and the copy thereof and said notice and receipt not served on the respondent, Robertson, until May 9th, A.D. 1887, and the order granted May, 13th, A.D. 1887, extending the time for service was improvidently granted and on insufficient grounds, and was void and irregular for the following reasons:\u2014\n\"(a.) At the time of the presentation of said petition the respondent Robertson, was, to the knowledge of petitioners, attending the present session of Parliament at Ottawa, and with reasonable diligence said petition after presentation, could have been forwarded to Ottawa and served on said respondent personally, within five days after said presentation, and the application for an extension of such time, which was ex parte, disclosed no special circumstances or difficulty in effecting service, but on the contrary disclosed the fact that such application was made within three days of the presentation of said petition, with no attempt to serve said respondent up to that time, although from affidavits used in such application it appeared that the petitioners knew where such respondent was, and by the ordinary means of mail communication had ample time, had diligence been used, to serve said respondent at Ottawa within the five days.\n\"(b) Said application for extension was made, and the order granting such extension was made ex parte on the application of petitioners three days after the presentation of said petition without disclosing any facts not known to them on the date of presentation, and without accounting in any way for not having attempted to effect service up to that time.\n\"(c) When said petition was presented the respondent, Robertson, was, to the knowledge of petitioners, at Ottawa, in the County of Carleton, in the Province of Ontario, attending the present session of Parliament, holden at Ottawa, which was, and to the knowledge of the petitioners was, to continue in session, and the petitioners by reasonable diligence after presenting the petition herein on May 2nd, could have forwarded the same by the ordinary mail conveyance to Ottawa, and procured service thereof easily within five days after presentation.\n\"(d.) The petitioners, on the application for the said extension and the said order, improperly concealed the foregoing facts set out in paragraph (c), and by reason of such concealment obtained said order.\"\nOn the 14th day of June. 1887, on motion of the petitioners, the preliminary objections were set down for hearing before the Chief Justice, on the 5th day of July, 1887, on which day the appellant moved on affidavit, and obtained an order to continue the hearing until the 25th day of July, 1887.\nOn the 5th day of August, 1887, a rule was taken by the petitioners to have the preliminary objections heard before the court in banco, on the tenth day of August, 1887.\nOn the 6th day of August, 1887, the appellant gave notice of motion before the court in banco, for the said tenth day of August, 1887, to set aside the order granted by the Chief Justice on the fifth day of May, 1887, and on the fifteenth August, the said preliminary objections were dismissed and set aside with costs.\nThe 20th rule of the rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in relation to Controverted Elections, passed on the 26th day of April, 1887, is as follows:\u2014\n\"When the party against whom any petition is filed \"is not within the Province of Nova Scotia, the \"petition and accompanying documents shall be \"served in such a manner as one of the judges shall \"direct.\"\nR. W. Scott Q.C. for appellant contended that a copy of the petition was not served in time within five days after its presentation; that the order of the honorable the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia made in chambers, extending the time for effecting service for the period of fifteen days from the seventh day of May, was not based \"on any special circumstances\" or \"upon any difficulty in effecting service,\" and was therefore not warranted by the statute inasmuch as it is clear and undeniable:\nFirst. That the petitioners knew the appellant was in Ottawa attending to his duties as a member of the House of Commons.\nSecond. That had the copy of petition been sent to Ottawa for service even up to noon on the day after the presentation of the petition, the service might have been effected on the fifth of May, leaving still two days to spare before the expiration of the five days allowed by the statute.\nHe also contended that the application for such extension of time was not made till the third day after the presentation of the petition\u2014no effort having, in the meantime, been made to serve a copy on appellant, though it was well known at the time the petition was presented that appellant was in Ottawa.\nGraham Q.C. for respondent contended that the extending the time for service was a matter of discretion of the judge, and this court ought not to interfere with the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia declining to overrule his exercise of discretion. Wigney v. Wigney[1]; Huggins v. Tweed[2]; Golding v. Wharton[3]; Re Merchant Banking Co.[4]; In re Terrill[5]; Watson v. Rodwell[6].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I have not any hesitation in expressing my opinion in this case at once. I think that where the legislature has entrusted to a judge a discretion to be exercised by him, there should be strong and substantial reasons presented to warrant us in interfering with the discretion so exercised by him. And if after that discretion has been exercised, an application has been made to the full court, and that court with the knowledge of all the circumstances connected with the matter has confirmed the exercise of that power, there is still greater reason why this court should not interfere. I throw out of consideration altogether in this case the point raised as to the power of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to make rules in relation to the service of the presentation of the petition when the respondent is out of the province, and jurisdiction of the court in which the petition is filed. If I was called on to express an opinion at the moment, I would, as at present advised, think the court possessed such power. But in the view I take of the case, no necessity arises for expressing an opinion on that question. The circumstances of this case show in my opinion, that a very proper discretion was exercised by the learned Chief Justice in extending the time, having regard to the shortness of time, 5 days. Where the place where the party is to be served is so far from the Province of Nova Scotia as Ottawa, and where the transaction arose in Shelburne where the petitioners' agent is supposed to be, and in view of the possible interruption of the mail by accidents or otherwise, and that the party could not know whether the respondent was actually at the time in Ottawa or not (as we know that members are in the habit of often absenting themselves), and that the person to whom the letter is addressed might be out of town, having regard to considerations such as these, I cannot say the petitioners' agent did not exercise reasonable precaution in applying for an extension of time, or that the judge exercised a wrong discretion in granting a reasonable delay for serving the copy of the petition. It was in the discretion of the judge to say what under the circumstances would be a fair time and this court should not, as I said before, without strong and substantial reasons interfere with the discretion of the judge, and I cannot say there are any of these strong and substantial reasons suggested in this case, but the contrary.\nSTRONG J\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. In the first place I consider the order was an exercise of discretion by the judge which is not properly a subject of appeal. But even if we treat it as an appealable decision, I am of opinion that it was in every respect a proper order to be made. The application for an extension of time was only a proper precaution to take having regard to the short delay allowed, and to the possibility of the respondent being absent from Ottawa when the papers reached that place.\nIt was held in the second Charlevoix case[7] that an appeal did not lie from judgments on preliminary objections. Subsequently to that decision, the law was altered, and an Act was passed authorizing such appeals. I think, however, from the circumstance that such an appeal as the present has been brought, that the Court ought to be astute to find reasons for disallowing appeals of this kind, which in the majority of cases will probably be brought merely for dilatory purposes.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the appeal being dismissed with costs.\nHENRY J.\u2014I concur also on both points with the decision of the learned Chief Justice below and my colleagues. Service was required within a certain time, and I think the judges of the court below have power to make rules for service out of the jurisdiction. Under the circumstances I think it was positively necessary, and even if not this court should not interfere with the exercise of the judge's discretion.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. Upon reading the papers in this case I never thought this a serious appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: N. H.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fourier, Henry and Taschereau J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE DECISION OF MR. JUSTICE HENSLEY SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE PRINCE COUNTY, P.E. I., CONTROVERTED ELECTION CASE.\nLegislative Assembly\u2014Disqualification\u2014Enjoying and holding an interest under a contract with the Grown\u2014What constitutes\u201439 Vic. ch. 3 secs. 4 and 8 P. E. I.\nBy commission or instrument under the hand and seal of the Lieutenant Governor of P. E. I., one E. C. was constituted and appointed ferryman at and for a certain ferry for the term of three years, pursuant to the acts relating to ferries, and it was by the commission provided that E. C. should be paid a subsidy of $95.00 for each year of said term. E. C. had given to the government a bond with two sureties for the performance of his contract. By articles of agreement between E. C. and S. F. P. (the respondent) E. C. for valuable consideration assigned to S. F. P. one fourth part or interest in the ferry contract, and it was agreed that one fourth part of the net proceeds or profits of said contract should be paid over by the said E. C. to the said S. F. P. or his assigns. At the time the agreement was entered into S. F P. was a member of the House of Assembly of P. E. I., having been elected at the general election held on the 30th June, 1886. Subsequently S. F. I., was returned as a member elect for the House of Commons for the electoral district of Prince County, P. E. I., and upon his return being contested;\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Taschereau J. dissenting, that, by the agreement with E. C, F. S. P. became a person holding and enjoying, within the meaning of section 4 of 39 Vic. ch. 3, P. E. I., a contract or agreement with her Majesty, which disqualified him and rendered him ineligible for election to the House of Assembly or to sit or vote in the same, and by section 8 of the said act, to be read with section 4, his seat in the assembly became vacated ; and he was therefore eligible for election as a member of the House of Commons ([1]). APPEAL from the decision of Mr. Justice Hensley dismissing the petition against the return of Stanislaus F. Perry, as a member of the House of Commons, for the electoral district of Prince County, in the Province of Prince Edward Island.\nAt the general election for the Dominion House of Commons held in the month of February last, the respondent and James Yeo, Esq., were returned as members duly elected to represent Prince County, Prince Edward Island, the respondent having a majority of 225 votes over appellant.\nThe petition was filed by the appellant, Edward Hackett, a candidate at the said election, claiming the seat now held by the respondent for the petitioner, on the ground that on nomination day and on election day, the respondent was not eligible to be elected, he being as it was alleged, a member of the Local House of Assembly for Prince Edward Island, and that under the Revised Statutes ch 13 secs. 1 and 2, the votes given for respondent are absolutely thrown away.\nAt the trial it was proved by the petitioner that a general election for the local house was held in the month of June, A.D. 1886, and that at that election Mr. Perry was returned to represent a constituency for the local house; it was also proved that there had been no meeting of the local house up to the date of the general election for the Dominion House of Commons.\nIn answer to this case the respondent contended that before his nomination for the Dominion election he had removed his disqualification; first, by resigning his seat in the local house in the manner pointed out by the island statute, 39 Vic. ch. 3, and in support of this contention it was proved that the respondent gave to two members of the House of Assembly, under seal and properly executed, a resignation of his seat, and that these two members forthwith delivered to the Lieutenant Governor a notice of such resignation The judge at the trial held that respondent had not properly resigned his seat, as the Island Statute 39 Vic. ch. 3 had not provided for the resignation of a member in the interval between the dissolution of one general assembly, and the first session of the general assembly. This point, however, has since been settled by 50 Vic. ch. 1 sec. 1, P. E. I.\nThe respondent secondly contended that at the date of nomination his seat in the local house was vacated by reason of his holding and enjoying a share in a contract with the local government. In support of this contention the respondent proved that in the month of February, A.D. 1886, the Commissioner of Public Works for Prince Edward Island advertised for tenders for running of a ferry across Grand or Ellis River, which is a, small river in the body of Prince County; that one Edward Crossman duly tendered, and his tender was accepted by the commissioner in writing on the face of the tender, (which was adduced in evidence). It was further, shown that Crossman had obtained from the proper government officer a license authorizing him to carry on the ferry; by the terms of this license (which was given in evidence) Grossman was bound to supply certain boats and assistance, also to run the ferry at certain hours, and only to take certain rates of ferriage stated in the license, and he was to receive in addition to the fees earned a sum of ninety-five dollars per annum from the government; the license was to last for three years, from the year A.D. 1886. It was shown that Crossman was actually carrying on the ferry. It was also shown that Crossman had given to the government a bond with two sureties, for the performance of his contract, (this bond was also put in evidence). Before nomination day the respondent purchased a one-fourth share of this contract and the profits of it ; for this he paid $75, and Grossman gave him an assignment (also in evidence). The evidence showed that the purchase was actually a bon\u00e2 fide transaction, and, in fact, it was not attempted to be attacked on this ground.\nThe following are the material dates:\u2014\nCrossman's tender accepted 23rd March, 1886.\nLicense to Grossman dated 4th August, 1886.\nBond for due performance, dated 1st April, 1886.\nAssignment to Perry, dated 12th of February, 1887.\nLocal election held 30th June, 1886.\nPerry's resignation, dated 11th February, 1887.\nNotice to Lieutenant Governor, dated 11th February, 1887.\nNomination day for Dominion house, 15th February, 1887.\nElection day for Dominion house, 22nd February, 1887\nThe statute under which respondent's second contention arose is 39 Vic. ch, 3 P. E. I. ([2]). Hodgson Q.C. for appellant, on the point upon which this appeal was decided.\nThe words of the fourth section are that the contract\u2014that is the contract which is to disqualify\u2014must be entered into \"with Her Majesty or with any public officer,\" and the person who is disqualified must have entered into such contract. He may do it directly or indirectly, or by the intervention of a third party, but he must:\u2014\n(a.) Enter into a contract.\n(b.) Enter into such contract with the Queen or a public officer.\nHere Perry has entered into no contract with the Queen. He has not entered into any contract at all.\nApply this test to the case:\u2014\nIf Perry sat and voted in the House of Assembly would he be liable to the penalties therefore under the 39 Vic. ch.3 sec. 7?\nI submit he would not be liable.\nThe two cases of Miles v. McIlwraith ([3]) and Thompson v. Pearce ([4]), (this latter case being relied on by Mr. Justice Hensley) establish that before a disqualification can exist, the parties, that is the member and the government, \"must come immediately into contact, \"so\" that the government could have held the \"(disqualified member)\" bound to them.\"\nSee also the case of The Queen v. Franklin ([5]).\nIn the present case, Perry does not come into contact with the government at all, nor can they hold him bound to them.\nMoreover the appellant contends that section 4 (39 Vic. ch. 3) does not apply to a \"member\" of the legislature, but to the case of a \" person \" holding a contract at the time of his nomination, of whom it is declared, that he shall not be eligible as a member, that is, that no person coming within the disqualification mentioned shall be eligible for election.\nSection 8 mentions a \"member\u201d for the first time.\nIt (sec. 8) enacts that \u201cany member of the House of Assembly by accepting any office or becoming a party to any contract or agreement, becomes disqualified,\" etc.\nThe respondent contends that section 8 must be read in connection with section 4. But even if this be so, then appellant submits that this is entirely in favor of appellant's contention, that section 4 only applies to a person becoming a party to a contract or agreement with the government; and the legislature, when enacting section 8, must have so considered it, for by section 8 it assumed a member to be disqualified upon these grounds only:\u2014\n\"By accepting any office.\"\nOr \"becoming a party to any contract or agree\u00adment.\"\nHas Perry, since he became a member of the House of Assembly, \"accepted any office, or become a party to any contract?\" He has certainly not accepted an office. It is not asserted by the respondent that he has. It is equally clear that he has not become a party to any contract with the government. Section 8 disqualifies by implication only, and outside of this section there is no other enactment in the statute by which a member vacates his seat by reason of entering into a contract. The learned judge also holds that a commission, appointing a ferryman, is of the same force and effect, and operates as a grant of the ferry itself. I submit that such a proposition is not law. The appointment of Grossman was, as the minute of the executive council expresses it, \"one of personal trust and confidence.\" Upon Crossman's death, the right to ferry would not, as held by the learned judge, descend to his heirs, but would terminate. If Crossman misconducted in his office, he would be liable to indictment. Comyn's Digest, Piscary, (B.) Ferry. The learned judge has decided otherwise, but he cites no authority supporting such a proposition.\nIt is needless to cite authorities shewing that nothing will be held to pass in a grant from the crown except fey express words or necessary implication.\nWoolley v. The Attorney General of Victoria ([6]).\nIt is urged that a bond was given by Crossman for the faithful performance of the duties of his office, but Perry was no party to that bond.\nThe fact of tenders having been invited, and Grossman's being the lowest does not affect the question. This could mot enlarge Grossman's commission. He was not the less an appointee of the Lieutenant Governor.\nMoreover, I must add that by order in council passed on the 28th February, 1887, the crown has refused to recognize him as a joint grantee of the ferry. How, then, can it be said he had a contract with the government? See The Queen v. Smith ([7]).\nF. Peters for respondent:\nThe ferry license is in every sense a, contract or agreement within the meaning of the statute; it was granted under the provisions of the Island statute 3 Will. 4, ch. 8, which by the second section authorizes the Lieutenant Governor \"from time to time to let by tender * * * the several ferries within this island,\" and by the third section authorizes the\nLieutenant Governor to call for tenders for running said ferries, and to let any such ferry to the lowest tenderer, and to grant licenses for the same for three years, with a provision that the licensee shall enter into good and sufficient security for the fulfilment of his duties.\nI contend that the license in law amounted to a lease for three years; the words used in the statutes are \"to let,\" words peculiarly applicable for the purpose of making a valid lease. Washburn on Real Property ([8]), shows that a right to run a ferry is an incorporeal hereditament and as such capable of being granted; if the license in this case amounts to a lease of an incorporeal hereditament it follows, we contend, that an assignment valid at law can be given.\nThe case of Reg. ex rel. Patterson v. Clarke ([9]), is a direct authority that a lease of a right to build a bridge (which is similar to the right to run a ferry) is a contract within the meaning of a disqualifying statute similar to the one now under consideration.\nApart from all authority we contend that this license contains every ingredient necessary to constitute a contract. By its terms the ferryman binds himself to perform certain specified work in a certain specified manner, and the government binds itself to pay him a certain sum for this work; both sides are mutually bound for three years; neither party can revoke the contract except that the governor can do so for misbehaviour. It was argued by the appellant that the license was not a contract at all but was only a license personal to Crossman himself, granted to him because the government were supposed to place trust and confidence in him personally; we contend that this argument cannot be supported; the nature of the work is not such as required any personal trust, nor was the license granted on any such ground; it was granted simply because Crossman was the lowest tenderer, and the government protect themselves against its non-performance by bonds. It matters not to the government by whose hand the contract is performed, and in case of non-performance the bond of course stood as a security to them.\nAssuming that there existed a contract between Crossman and the government, Mr. Perry having purchased a share in this contract came within both the letter and the spirit of the fourth section above set forth, and his seat in the local house became vacated.\nIn construing this section it must be remembered that the object of the statute was to procure the independence of parliament by preventing members voting on matters in which they had any pecuniary interest. And this object could always be defeated if a member were allowed to enjoy the profits of a government contract held in the name of another person.\nSections 4 and 8 should be read together, and under these sections the respondent became disqualified to sit in the Local Assembly and therefore eligible to the House of Commons. Royse v. Birley ([10]); Maidstone Case ([11]); Thompson v. Pearce ([12]); West y. Andrews ([13]); Davies v. Harvey ([14]).\nHodgson Q.C. in reply contended that section 4 alone applies and that provides disqualification only for the person who becomes a party to a public contract.\nSir W. J. RITCHE C.J.\u2014I express no opinion on the question raised as to the construction of the provincial act with reference to the resignation of a member elect who resigns or seeks to resign between a general election and the first meeting of the legislature thereafter, it not being necessary to do so because I am of opinion that the ground on which the learned judge below dismissed the petition was correct, namely, that by purchasing a share in the ferry con- tract Mr. Perry's seat in the Local Legislature became vacant by virtue of the fourth and eighth sections of 39 Vic. ch. 3 of the acts of Prince Edward Island. There can be no doubt that, as between himself and his assignee, Crossman had a right to assign a share or interest in the subject matter of this contract, and no question is raised as to the bona fides of the transaction in this case. By the assignment of a share in this contract, Perry, by the express terms of his agreement with Crossman, became entitled to participate in its profits and losses, and consequently to receive his share of the $95 of the public money annually to be paid for the performance of the contract. If any question arose in the legislature as to the proper performance of this contract, or as to the payment of the subsidy, what difference would there be in point of interest whether Crossman or Perry was called on to vote on either one or other of these questions, or any other question touching the contract, both being alike interested in any such vote? No authority is wanted, in my opinion, to show that Mr. Perry's case is within the terms of the statute. Larger words could not have been used to cover the case of persons interested in any way in any contract or agreement with Her Majesty, or with any public officer or department with respect to the public service of the Province of Prince Edward Island, or under which any public money of the province is to be paid for any services or work. I need only cite the language of Montague Smith and Brett JJ. in Royse v. Birley ([15]).\nMontague Smith J. says:\u2014\nThe words \"undertake and execute,\" in s. I clearly apply only while the contract is executory; and, though the other words \" hold\" and 'enjoy' are more general, it seems to me they refer to holding a contract or enjoying a contract which is executory, that is, a contract under which something has to be done by the contractor, either one act or recurring acts, and that he is only disqualified \"during the time that he shall execute, hold, or enjoy\" any such contract. The words \u201chold and enjoy \u201cmay have been inserted to meet cases where a contractor holding a contract did not himself execute it.\"\nBrett J.:\u2014\nThe next point is, whether it is necessary that, at the time when the person is elected, the contract, even supposing it is made with the government, should be executory. That depends upon the view to be taken of this first section. Now, the first part of that section applies to any person who shall \u201cundertake, execute, hold or enjoy\" any contract therein mentioned. To undertake a contract would seem to be to enter into it; the word \"execute\" would seem to refer to the case of a person who takes on himself the execution of a contract not originally made with him; the word \" hold \" to the case of a possible transfer of a contract which had been already made with some other person; and the word \"enjoy \" to the case of a person with whom the contract was not made, but who as cestui que trust is to enjoy the benefit of it. But then the second part of the section says that any such person shall be incapable of being elected during the time he shall execute, hold, or enjoy any such contract.\" Now, for such person to be executing, it seems to me he should be in a position to be called upon to execute, and, if so, the words \" hold \" and \" enjoy \" would mean hold or enjoy in the same sense, i.e., holding or enjoying a contract which the contractor may be called upon to execute, or under which there may be something still to be executed.\nBut then it is urged that section 4 does not apply to this case, but that section 8 read by itself alone governs it, and that the words of section 8 are not as large or comprehensive as those of section 4. I am very clearly of opinion that to give effect to section 8 the two sections must be read together. How are we to discover whose election shall become void and the seat vacated, (the language of one section being \" by\u201d becoming a party to any contract or agreement the \u201cparty becomes disqualified by law to continue to sit \u201cor vote,\") but by reference to the fourth section, which declares the disqualification and prohibits the sitting and voting? The whole act has but one object, namely, that of preventing undue influence and secur- ing the freedom and independence of the legislature.\nThe case of the respondent is, in my opinion, not only within the express words, but also within the very spirit of the act. To hold otherwise than Mr. Justice Hensley did would simply be to ignore and frustrate the intention and object of the legislature, and, in fact, any other construction would, as the learned judge says,\" let in the mischief which\" it was intended to exclude.\" I am of opinion that it cannot be too strongly impressed on the courts of this Dominion, that all laws passed for securing the independence of the local legislatures as well as those for securing the independence of parliament should be \"jealously maintained\"; certainly not allowed to be frittered away so long as the respective legislatures or parliament deem it for the advantage of the public that persons who have any interest in any public con-tract should be absolutely disqualified from being, elected, or sitting, or voting in the local assembly or in parliament.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Hensley dismissing the petition against the return of Stanislaus F. Perry as a member of the House of Commons, for the electoral district of Prince County, in the Province of Prince Edward Island.\nThe House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island was dissolved on the 5th of June, A.D. 1886, and a general election took place on the 30th June, following.\nAt that election the respondent, Perry, was elected a member for the first electoral district of Prince County.\nThe new House of Assembly met for the first time after the general election on the twenty-ninth day of March, 1887. A general election for the House of Commons took place on the 22nd of February, 1887, and the appellant, the respondent, John P. Lefurgy and James Yeo, were candidates to represent the electoral district of Prince County. .\nPrince County elects two members, and James Yeo and the respondent were returned as elected by the returning officer.\nThe appellant filed a petition against the respondent's return on the ground that, being a member of the Provincial House of Assembly, he was not eligible as a member of the House of Commons, or capable of being nominated or voted for, and that it was the duty of the returning officer to return the appellant under ch. 13 Revised Statutes of Canada sec. 2 p. 191, on the ground that Perry was disqualified, and that the appellant had received the next highest number of votes.\nThe petition came on for trial before Mr. Justice Hensley. It was admitted that the respondent had been elected to the Provincial House of Assembly at the general election in June, 1886, and that the first meeting of that assembly did not take place until 29th March,1887; but it was contended on the part of the respondent :\u2014\n1st. That Perry was not a member of the House of Assembly, because he had not been sworn in.\n2nd. That he had resigned his seat.\n3rd. That his seat had become vacant under the provisions of the fourth section of the Provincial Act, 39 Vic. ch. 3, 1876.\nMr. Justice Hensley dismissed the appellant's petition, sustaining the third contention of the respondent, but deciding the first two grounds in favor of the appellant. From this decision the appellant now appeals to this court.\nAs I am of opinion that Mr. Justice Hensley rightly held that the respondent's seat in the assembly was vacated on the third ground before mentioned\u2014the acceptance of an interest in a ferry contract with the Provincial Government\u2014I do not feel called upon to express any opinion upon the question which was raised and argued both here and in the court below as to the legal sufficiency of the resignation, and I shall therefore say nothing on that head.\nBy the statute of Prince Edward Island 39 Vic. ch. 3 sec. 4 it is enacted as follows:\u2014\nNo person whosoever holding or enjoying, undertaking or executing directly or indirectly, alone or with any other, by himself or by the interposition of any trustee or third party any contract or agreement with Her Majesty, or with any public officer or department, with respect to the public service of the Province of Prince Edward Island, or under which any public money of the Province of Prince Edward Island is to be paid for any service or work, or who shall become surety for the same shall be eligible as a member either of the Legislative Council or the House of Assembly, nor shall he sit or vote in the same respectively: Provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to any person holding a share in any incorporated company.\nSect. 5 is as follows:\u2014If any person hereby disqualified or declared incapable of being elected a member, either of the Legislative Council or of the House of Assembly, is nevertheless elected and returned as a member, his election and return shall be null and void.\nSect. 6 is as follows:\u2014No person disqualified by the next preceding sections, or by any other law, to be elected a member of the Legislative Council or of the House of Assembly, shall sit or vote in the same respectively, while he remains under such disqualification.\nSect. 8 enacts that if any member of the House of Assembly, or of the Legislative Council, by accepting any office or becoming a party to any contract or agreement, becomes disqualified by law to continue to sit or vote in the same, respectively, his election shall thereby become void, and the seat of such member shall be vacated, and a writ shall forthwith issue for new election as if he were naturally dead; but he may be re-elected if he be eligible under the first section of this act.\nOn the 4th of August, 1886, the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island in exercise of his lawful powers in that behalf by a commission or instrument under his hand and seal, constituted and appointed one Edward Crossman to be the ferryman at and for the ferry known and called \" Ellis River or Grand River Ferry \" for the term of three years from the 1st day of April, 1886, pursuant to the acts relating to ferries, and it was by the commission provided that the said Crossman should be paid a subsidy of $95.00 for each year of the said term. By articles of agreement bearing date 12th of February, 1887, and entered into between Edward Crossman and Stanislaus F. Perry, the respondent, Crossman assigned to the respondent one-fourth part or interest in the ferry contract, and it was thereby agreed \"that a statement of \" the expense and receipts of the said contract shall \" be made up on the 1st day of January in each year \"and one-third part of the net proceeds or profits of \" said contract shall be paid over by the said Edward \" Crossman to the said Stanislaus F. Perry, or his \" assign.\" There can be no doubt but that there was a contract between the crown and Crossman in respect of the payment of the annual subsidy. This requires no demonstration for it is apparent on the face of the instrument itself. Then, was the effect of the assignment to the respondent to place him in the position of a person holding or \u201cenjoying \u201can interest in this contract? The judgment of Brett J. in the case of Royse v. Birley ([16]) shows very clearly that the case of a person taking an interest under a contract with the crown by virtue of a transfer from the original contractor was intended to be met by the word \"hold\", and that a cestui que trust with whom the contract was not made, but who is entitled to participate in the benefits received by it, is properly one who \" enjoys \" the contract. This case is directly in point, therefore, and the reasoning and good sense of the construction which it authorises, warrants us in applying it in the present case. I have no hesitation, therefore, in holding as Mr. Justice Hensley did that so soon as the assignment was perfected the respondent became a person \" holding \" and \u201cenjoying\u201d a contract or agreement with Her Majesty which disqualified him and rendered him ineligible for election to the assembly under section 4 of the statute before set forth. The fourth section, however, only applies to the case of disqualification for election; the material sections here are the sixth section which provides that a person becoming disqualified to be elected a member under the fourth section shall not sit or vote in the assembly, thus providing for the case of a member who acquires an interest in a contract after his election, and the eighth section which provides that:\u2014\nIf any member of the House of Assembly * * *\nby accepting any office or becoming a party to any contract or agreement becomes disqualified by law to continue to sit or vote respectively his election shall become void and his seat vacated.\nIt will be observed that the words of this section are \"becoming a party to any contract;\" can it be said that the respondent became a party to the ferry contract by taking the assignment It seems to me very plain that this question must be answered in the affirmative. I construe the words \"becoming a party\" as referring to the acquisition of an interest in a contract in the manner mentioned in the fourth section. There is no doubt that by force of the sixth section all persons disqualified from being elected under the fourth section, are, when the act of disqualification occurs after they have been elected, incapacitated from sitting and voting, and there could be no possible reason for discriminating as regards the avoidance of the seat between two classes of persons, viz., between those whose subsequent disqualification proceeds from an original contract with the crown and those whose disability proceeds from the acquisition of an interest in a contract already entered into by the crown with another person, the member thus becoming the holder or party enjoying a contract within the meaning of the fourth section. I am, therefore, of opinion that as the words becoming a party to a contract or agreement are large enough to comprehend all the classes of cases included in the fourth section, as well those where the interest in the contract is acquired derivatively as those in which it is an original agreement, the eighth section avoids the election and vacates the seat of members who subsequently to their election acquire such an interest in a contract or agreement with the crown as would, if they had held it at the time of election, have rendered their election illegal under section four. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J:\u2014In this case I entirely concur with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice.\nHENRY J:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Hensley on issues raised by a petition in the election court of Prince Edward Island signed by the appellant against the election and return of the respondent as a member of the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of Prince County in the said province in February, 1887.\nThe petition charges that at the time of his nomination the respondent was duly elected a member of the House of Assembly of the province aforesaid, and was therefore ineligible as a candidate to be nominated or elected as a member of the House of Commons, and that on the said election day he was still a member of the said House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island.\nThe respondent did not answer the petition, but the allegations in the petition were put in. issue by the statute.\nAt the hearing it was contended for the respondent that at the time of his said nomination he was not a member of the assembly of Prince Edward Island.\nFirst. That although duly elected as such member he had resigned his seat before his nomination as a member of the House of Commons; and\nSecondly. That after his election as a member of the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island, and before his nomination at the election now in question, he had become a party to a contract with the government of the said province, and therefore became immediately disqualified and his election as member of the House of Assembly aforesaid became void and his seat therein as such member vacated.\nI will deal with the two issues raised in the order I have referred to them.\nThe decision of the first is to be considered under the provisions of the act of Prince Edward Island, 39 Vic. ch. 3 sec. 15 in connection with the Dominion statutes, 35 Vic. ch. 15 and 36 Vic. ch. 2, Revised Statutes ch. 13.\nThe fifteenth section of 39 Vic. ch. 3 reads as follows:\u2014\nIf any member of the House of Assembly wishes to resign his seat in the interval between two sessions of the General Assembly, and there be then no speaker, or if such member be himself the speaker, he may address and causs to be delivered to any two members of the house the declaration before mentioned of his intention to resign, and such two members upon receiving such declaration shall forthwith notify the Lieutenant Governor thereof under their hand and seal, who is hereby empowered and required, within seven days after the receipt of such notification as aforesaid, to issue a writ for the election of a new member in the place of the member so notifying his intention to resign, and the member so tendering his resignation shall be held to have vacated his seat, and cease to be a member of the house.\nThe tender of resignation was made before the first meeting of the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, after the respondent was returned as a member. The resignation bore date on the 11th February, and the first meeting of the Assembly did not take place until some weeks afterwards.\nRevised Statutes of Canada ch. 13 secs. 1 and 2 read as follows;\u2014\nSec. 1.No person who, on the day of the nomination at any election to the House of Commons, is a member of any Legislative Council, or of any Legislative Assembly of any Province now included or which is hereafter included within the Dominion of Canada, shall be eligible as a member of the House of Commons, or shall be capable of being nominated or voted for at such election, or of being elected to or of sitting or voting in the House of Commons, and if any one so declared ineligible is nevertheless, elected and returned as a member of the House of Commons, his election shall be null and void; 35 Vic. ch. 15 sec. 1 ; 36 Vic. ch. 2 sec. 1.\nSec. 2. If any member of a Provincial Legislature, notwithstanding his disqualification as in the next preceding section hereof mentioned, receives a majority of votes at any such election, such majority of votes shall be thrown away and the returning officer shall return the person having the next greatest number of votes, provided he is otherwise eligible.\u201435 Vic. ch. 15 sec. 2.\nWe must in the first place decide whether or not the respondent having been elected and returned a member of the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but who had not been sworn in before any meeting of that house, was a member subject to the operation of the two sections lastly quoted. Deciding that point in the negative would call for a dismissal of the petition. I am, however, of the opinion that a member elected and returned, as was the respondent, should be considered as affected by the provisions of the two sections mentioned. It is true a member so returned would be subject to the result of a petition against his election and return, and through which he might be unseated, but I do not think that objection should prevail.\nThe next question is as to his resignation. If then the respondent at the time of his nomination and election was subject to the provisions of the two sections of the Dominion act was, his position such as to authorize his resignation? The words in the disquali- fying section of the Dominion act are: \"No person \" who on the day of the nomination at any election to \" the House of Commons is a member of any Legislative Council, or of any Legislative Assembly.\" The words in the local act are: \"If any member of the \"House of Assembly wishes to resign his seat, &c.\" They are, therefore, in effect the same. The same construction of them is therefore necessary. If, then, the respondent at the time of his nomination was affected by the disqualifying provisions of the two sections, I think he occupied the same position when his resignation was tendered and acted upon according to the provision of section 15 of the local act before recited. If not affected by either he would have been duly elected and returned even if he had not resigned his seat in the local house.\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the respondent was entitled to resign his seat for the local house, could he do so before the first sitting of the legislature? The words of the fifteenth section are:\" If any member of \" the House of Assembly wishes to resign his seat in \"the interval between two sessions of the General\" Assembly, and there be no speaker, &c.\" \"What then is meant by \"two sessions of the legislature.\" The provision is general, and unless some good reason can be found for the limited construction contended for should be construed accordingly. The only reason offered is one given by the learned judge who presided at the trial of the petition. I think, however, that the fact that the eighteenth section of the act which provides for the filling of vacancies occasioned by death or acceptance of office subsequent to a general election, and before the first meeting of the General Assembly does not necessarily affect the construction of section 15. On perusal of the act it appears to me that the legislature intended to provide for vacancies in all cases, so that when they should occur no time should be lost in filling them ; voluntary resignations might be made:\u2014\nFirst, by a member giving notice of it in his place in the house;\nSecond, by giving notice in writing to the speaker, either during the session or in the interval between two sessions, but in case of there being no speaker by giving notice to two members as was done in this case.\nAs a general rule there is always a speaker after the first meeting of the legislature\u2014the exception some times but not very frequently is found. If it was intended to limit the operation of the fifteenth section to a case where a speaker had been elected, but the office had become vacant by death, or otherwise, apt words might have been used for that purpose; but those used are significant, \" and there be then no speaker\" would imply that the notice was intended to apply to every case where there was no speaker, either before one should be appointed or in case of a vacancy in the office after appointment.\nCourts cannot of course add words to supply what may appear defective in an act, but that is not necessary. The words \"in the interval between two sessions\" are comprehensive enough; but being so, it is contended that the legislature intended the provision meant \"in the interval between two sessions\" of the same parliament. There is nothing in the act to suggest he limited construction, or rather to import into it words to produce that result. The section says in the interval between two sessions\u2014that means, according to the words, between any two sessions whether of one parliament or two. If the legislature meant the provision to apply only in the limited sense it should and, no doubt, would have said so. It is enough for us to see that the provision covers the interval between one session and another and so apply it.\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the respondent was a member within the terms of the Dominion and local statutes, I must hold that the notice of resignation given to the two other members was regular and that for the reasons given the respondent had duly resigned his seat, and was, therefore, eligible to be nominated and returned as a member of the House of Commons.\nI agree with the views of the learned judge whose judgment is appealed from as to the other issue for the reasons given by him in his judgment to which reference may be had.\nI am of opinion the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal. I am of opinion, first, that Perry had not legally resigned his seat in the provincial house, when he was elected to the House of Commons in February, 188 7. The words\u201d in the interval between two sessions of the General Assembly\" in sec. 15, 39 Vic. ch. 3 (P. E. I.), do not mean \u201cin the \u201cinterval between two parliaments.\" They mean \u201cbetween two sessions of the same General Assembly.\"\nMr. Justice Hensley was with the petitioner, present appellant, on that point. The reasoning, in that same sense, In re West Durham ([17]) seems to me conclusive.\nOn the other point, whether by a contract with the government of Prince Edward Island Perry had ceased to be a member of the General Assembly; I am also with the appellant. There has been no contract or agreement between Perry and Her Majesty, so as to vacate his seat under sec. 8 of 39 Vic. ch. 3. There is no privity between him and the crown, and the crown cannot hold him bound to any agreement. Miles v. McIlwraith ([18]). Moreover the crown has repudiated any such agreement and refused to recognize him as grantee of this ferry.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Edward J. Hodgson.\nSolicitor for respondent: Frederick Peters.\n[1] 39 Vic. ch. 3 P. E. I.: 4. No person whosoever holding or enjoying, undertaking or executing directly or indirectly, alone or with any other, by himself or by the interposition of any trustee or third party, any contract or agreement with Her Majesty, or with any public officer or department, with respect to the public service of the Province of Prince Edward Island or under which any public money of the Province of Prince Edward Island is to be paid for any service or work, or who shall become surety for the same shall be eligible as a member either of the Legislative Council or of the House of Assembly, nor shall he sit or vote in the same, respectively; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to any person holding a. share in any incorporated Company.\n5. If any person hereby disqualified or declared incapable of being elected a member, either of the Legislative Council or of the House of Assembly, is nevertheless elected and returned as a member, his election and return shall be null and void.\n6. No person disqualified by the next preceding sections, or by any other law, to be elected a member of the Legislative Council or of the House of Assembly, shall sit or vote in the same respectively, while he remains under such disqualification.\n7. If any person who is made by this act ineligible as a member of the Legislative Council or of the House of Assembly, or incapable of sitting or voting therein, respectively, does nevertheless so sit or vote, he shall forfeit the sum of two hundred dollars or everyday he sits or votes, and such sum may be recovered from him by any person who will sue for the same by action of debt, bill, plaint or information in the Supreme Court of Judicature of the Province of Prince Edward Island.\n8. If any member of the House of Assembly, or of the Legislative Council, by accepting any office, or becoming a party to any contract or agreement, becomes disqualified by law to continue to sit or vote in the same respectively, his election shall thereby become void and the seat of such member shall be vacated, and a writ shall forthwith issue for a new election as if he were naturally dead; but he may be re-elected if he be eligible under the first section of this act.\nCanada Revised Statutes ch. 3 Sec. 1. No person who on the day of the nomination at any election to the House of Commons, is a member of any Legislative Council, or of any Legislative Assembly of any Province now included or which is hereafter to be included within the Dominion of Canada, shall be eligible as a member of the House of Commons, or shall be capable of being nominated or voted for at such election, or of being elected to or of sitting or voting in the House of Commons, and if any one so declared ineligible is nevertheless elected and returned as a member of the House of Commons, his election shall be null and void.\nSec. 2. If any member of a Provincial Legislature, notwithstanding his disqualification as in the next preceding section hereof mentioned, receives a majority of votes at any such election, such majority of votes shall be thrown away and the returning officer shall return the person having the next greatest number of votes, provided he is otherwise eligible.\n[2] Ubi supra.\n[3] 8 App. Cas. 120.\n[4] 1 B. & B. p. 25\n[5] L.

Q., although no return had been made to the council by the company of the actual value of their real estate in the municipality.\n2. That a warrant to levy the rates upon such property for the years 1880-83, is illegal and void and that a writ of injunction is a proper remedy to enjoin the corporation to desist from all proceedings to enforce the same.\nAs to whether the clause in the Act of Incorporation of the town of St. Johns P.Q., extending the limits of said town to the middle Richelieu river, a navigable river, is intra sires of the legislature of the Province of Quebec the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the holding of the court below that it was intra sires\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment rendered by the Superior Court.\nThe Central Vermont Railway Co., a body corporate on the 19th day of December, 1884, presented a petition (requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e) addressed to any one of the judges of the $uperior Court for Lower Canada, together with an affidavit in support of said petition, praying that a writ of injunction should issue addressed to the respondents, the town of St. Johns and to one P. X. Lanier, a bailiff, enjoining upon them to suspend all proceedings upon a certain warrant of execution\u2014distress warrant issued by the said corporation of the town of St. Johns, against the appellants, for the collection of certain taxes upon one-half of appellants' railway bridge over the river Richelieu, its railway tracks and a wooden office which said warrant had been placed in the hands of the said Lanier for execution, until such time as a further order should be made; and praying also that the seizure or execution, and all proceedings relative thereto and acts in virtue of which taxes had been imposed against the appellants be declared illegal, null, and of no effect, and be annulled.\nThe grounds of complaint, as set forth in the petition for an injunction are the following :\u2014\n\"The respondents have no authority or power to levy a tax upon the appellants .\n\"1st. Because the said bridge and approach are not situated within the limits and boundaries of said town the clause of the act of incorporation of the said town fixing the limits of the said town in the middle of the Richelieu river is ultra vires and illegal, the said river being a navigable river, and therefore under the sole control of the Dominion Government of Canada and by reason thereof, the said bridge not being subject to taxation within the meaning of the law;\n\"2nd. Because according to section 86 of their act of incorporation the said corporation of the town of St. Johns have no right to levy a tax upon immoveable property, but only sur les personnes et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res de la ville, and the said railway bridge being an immoveable and therefore not subject to taxation by said corporation;\n\"3rd. Because the said assessment rolls prepared by the assessors duly named by said corporation are illegal exorbitant and irregular, so far as petitioners (appellants) are concerned, they being assessed for property not belonging to them and not in their possession, to wit : for all the portion of railway tracks, materials etc., from Jacques-Cartier street to Lon-gueuil street of said town of St. Johns, and this to the knowledge of said corporation, which although often urged to change and modify said assessment rolls in so far as petitioners (appellants) are concerned, refused so to do and persisted in said valuation and still persist therein although legally and duly notified of its irregularity and illegality;\n\"4th and 5th. Because respondents have exceeded their powers in imposing said taxes, and in causing said warrant to be issued for the recovery of said taxes and because the said warrant and seizure were issued illegally and are irregular, informal, null and void.\"\nThe respondents contested this petition by preliminary pleas and by demurrer and a contestation to the merits.\nIn their demurrer they alleged that the facts related in said petition do not disclose any ground for a writ of injunction; and in their plea or contestation to the merits, they contended that the allegations of appellants' petition are false; that in virtue of their charter, respondents have the right to impose taxes on all immoveable situated within the boundaries of said town, including that part of the said bridee situated within the limits of said town; that all the immoveable for which said appellants are assessed, are occupied by them and are entered in their name on the assessment roll of the said respondents and that no other proprietor thereof is known to the respondents; that the taxes in dispute have been regularly imposed by said respondents; that the assessment made by respondents is not exorbitant; that the warrant of execution has been regularly issued and that appellants had another and simple and inexpensive remedy against said taxation according to the act of incorporation of the respondents, and that they ought to have availed themselves of that remedy with in the three months after the homologation of the assessment roll of the respondents.\nThe respondents also pleaded the general issue.\nL R.

By section 326 of the Towns Corporation General Clauses Act (40 Vic. ch. 29):\u2014\nEvery iron railway company or wooden railway company other than those mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the preceding section and possessing real estate in the municipality, shall transmit to the office of the council in the month of May in each year, a return showing the actual value of their real estate in the municipality other than the road, and also the actual value of the land occupied by the road estimated according to the average value of land in the locality. Such return must be communicated to the valuators by the secretary treasurer in due time,\nAnd by section 327.\nThe valuators in making the valuation of the taxable property in the municipality shall value the real estate of such company according to the value specified in the return by the company. If such return has not been transmitted in the time prescribed, the valuation of all the immoveable property belonging to the company shall be made in the same manner as that of any other ratepayer.\nThis last section 327 is not in the Ontario Act but though no return was made by the company, I cannot see that it makes any more property taxable than could, be taxed under section 326 which I think in accordance with the decisions in Ontario is confined to the lands occupied by the road and does not include the superstructures.\nApart from the assessment on the bridge the assessment in this case would likewise be bad for assessing the railway track including the superstructure.\nThere is nothing whatever in my opinion in the objection that the 43 and 44th Vic, ch. 52, fixing the eastern boundary of the corporation of St. Johns at an imaginary line passing through the middle of the \"Richelieu river was ultra vires of the legislature of the Province of Quebec and therefore unconstitutional.\nThe appeal in this case should, I think, be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The decision of this appeal must depend on the construction to be placed on sections 326 and 327 of the Provincial Act 40 Vic., ch. 29. By the 98 section of the Act 43 and 44 Vic, ch. 62, for amending and consolidating the acts relating to the Incorporation of the town of St. Johns, these sections 326 and 327 of the former General Municipal Act are made part of the latter enactment.\nThese sections relate to the taxation of railways for municipal purposes and are as follows :\u2014\nSec. 326. Every iron railway company or wooden railway company other than those mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the preceding section and possessing real estate in the municipality, shall transmit to the office of the council in the month of May in each year, return showing the actual value of their real estate in the municipality other than the road and also the actual value of the land occupied by the road estimated according to the average value of land in the locality.' Such return must be communicated to the valuators by the secretary treasurer in clue time.\nSec. 327. The valuators in making the valuation of the taxable property in the municipality shall value the real estate of such company according to the value specified in the return by the company. If such return has not been transmitted in the time prescribed, the valuation of all the immoveable property belonging to the company shall be made in the same manner as that of any other ratepayer.\nThe proposition of the appellants is that under these provisions of the law, the respondents were not authorized to make the assessments which they have made of the appellants', property within the limits of the town of St. Johns and that the taxes which they have levied by distress being based on these assessments are void. These assessments are of \"the railway\" tracks from East Longueuil street to the bridge and \"part of railway bridge within the limits of the town\" of St. Johns.\"\nAs regards the property assessed under the denomination of \"Railway Tracks,\" it is manifest that by that description we must consider the superstructure of the permanent way, consisting of the ties and iron rails, to be included and that we cannot treat it as restricted to the mere land on which the ties and rails are laid. And as regards the bridge, it is equally beyond controversy that the structure alone is included in the valuation of the assessors. By section 326 the return which a railway company is required to make is to be, \"first of the value of the real estate in the municipality other than the road; and, second, of \"the actual value of the land occupied by the road.\" The first question is therefore whether the words l land occupied by the road \"authorizes the taxation of the superstructure consisting of ties and rails.\nThere can, I think, be scarcely any doubt that it does not. This description of the property to be taxed, and which is to be estimated according to the average value of land in the locality, does as plainly as language can express it, confine the subject of taxation to the mere land, minus the rails and ties, laid upon it by the railway company. An analogous provision in the municipal law of Ontario has always received that construction, and without assuming that the decisions of the Ontario courts are in any way binding authorities on the learned judges of the court below, I may refer to the cases of The Great Weastern Ry. Go. v. Rouse ([1]) and London v. G. W. Ry. Co. (2) as giving sound reasons for such a construction, which I adopt in the present case.\nSection 327 contains a provision for a valuation by the valuators of the municipality in case the railway company shall itself make no return of value within the time limited by the act and enacts that in such case the valuation of u all the immoveable property \" belonging to the company shall be made in the same u manner as that of any other ratepayer.\" It cannot\u00bb I think, be successfully contended that the words \" all immoveable property belonging to the company \" were meant to make that assessable by the valuators which was exempted in the case of a return being made by the company itself.\" There could be no reason for such a distinction and I refer the use of the expression \" all the immoveable property to the circumstance, that by section 326 the immoveable property of the company was divided into two distinct categories viz : (1) that other than the road; and ([2]) that occupied by the road. The words in question were, in my opinion, ' used as a comprehensive term including both the two classes of property previously distinguished.\nAs regards the bridge or so much of it as is within the limits of the municipality, I am of opinion that it is in no sense l land occupied by the road, \" and there is, therefore, no statutory authority whatever for its taxation. The result must be that the assessment having included property not legally liable to taxation and no distinction being made between such property and that \"which the statute does make liable the whole tax is void.\nThe remedy adopted by the appellants comes within the literal terms of the statute 41 Vic. ch. 14 sec. 1 sub sec. 1, as being an act of a corporation beyond its powers, and I am, therefore, of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs to the appellants here and in both the courts below.\nFOURNIER J. Dans cette cause il s'agit de la l\u00e9ga-lit\u00e9 de taxes impos\u00e9es par l'Intim\u00e9e sur certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en la possession de l'Appelante, dans les limites de la ville dc Saint-Jean. L'une des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s tax\u00e9es est la partie du pont construit sur la rivi\u00e8re Richelieu avec le quai d'approche et les piliers qui se trouvent situ\u00e9s dans les limites de la ville de Saint-Jean, \u00e0 partir du rivage \u00e0 aller j\u00f9squ'au milieu de la rivi\u00e8re Richelieu. L'autre est la partie du chemin de fer de l'Appelante situ\u00e9e dans la dite ville de Saint-Jean \u00e0 partir de la rue Jacques-Cartier \u00e0 aller jusqu'\u00e0 la rue Longueur!. Dans le role d'\u00e9valuation cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sons les termes de \" Railway track.\" La derni\u00e8re est une construction en bois servant de bureau\nL'Appelante, qui a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d'adopter dans le temps fix\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour attaquer le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, essaie, au moyen d'un bref d'injonction, d'arriver an m\u00eame but. Dans sa requ\u00eate elle invoque entre autres les moyens suivants : 10 Que le pont n'est pas situ\u00e9 dans les limites de la ville parce que la clause de l'acte d'incorporation qui en fixe les limites an milieu de la rivi\u00e8re Richelieu est inconstitutionnelle la dite rivi\u00e8re \u00e9tant navigable et comme telle Sous la juridiction exclusive du parlement du Canada; 2\u00b0. que la ville de Saint-Jean n'a pas le pouvoir de taxer les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res, mais seulement les personnes et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res de la ville; 3\u00b0 que le r\u00f4le de cotisation est ill\u00e9gal et exorbitant en ce qu'il taxe l'Appelante pour une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui ne lui appartient pas et qu'elle ne poss\u00e8de pas dans la ville de Saint-Jean,. savoir: le \" railway track,\" la partie du chemin de fer \u00e0 partir de la rue Jacques-Cartier \u00e0 aller \u00e0 la rue Longueuil 4\u00b0 enfin ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 du warrant d'ex\u00e9cution etc.\nL'Intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu qu'en vertu de sa charte elle avait droit de taxer toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res situ\u00e9es dans ses limites; que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour lesquelles l'Appelante est cotis\u00e9e sont occup\u00e9es par elle et qu'elle en est la seule propri\u00e9taire connue. L'Intim\u00e9e nie que l'estimation soit exorbitante all\u00e8gue la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 du warrant, et que l'Appelante aurait d\u00f9 dans les trois mois de la date du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation prendre les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s indiqu\u00e9s par l'acte d'incorporation pour attaquer le r\u00f4le.\nCette contestation soul\u00e8ve les questions suivantes : 10 La l\u00e9gislatures de Qu\u00e9bec avaitelle le droit de fixer le milieu de la rivi\u00e8re Richelieu comme limite de la ville de Saint-Jean? L'Intim\u00e9e a-t-elle par sa charte le pouvoir de taxer les immeubles situ\u00e9s dans ses limites s La cotisation du \" railway track\" de la rue Jacques-Cartier \u00e0 la rue Longueuil est-elle l\u00e9gale?\nLa premi\u00e8re question quant au pouvoir de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec de fixer les limites de la ville de Saint-Jean au milieu de la rivi\u00e8re Richelieu m\u00e9rite \u00e0 peine d'\u00eatre examin\u00e9e. S'il est incontestable que les rivi\u00e8res navigables sont pour les fins de la navigation sous le contr\u00f4le du parlement du Canada, il n'est pas moins vrai non plus que les provinces ont sur ces m\u00eames rivi\u00e8res le droit d'exercer tous les pouvoirs municipaux et de police, pourvu que leur l\u00e9gislation n'apporte aucune entrave \u00e0 la navigation. L'acte 43 et 44 Vic., ch. 53, qui a \u00e9tendu les limites de la ville de Saint-Jean jusqu'au milieu de la rivi\u00e8re Richelieu ne contient aucune disposition de nature \u00e0 affecter les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la na`vigation.\nEn vertu de son acte d'incorporation la ville de Saint jean a non seulement le pouvoir de taxer les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res, mais son pouvoir s'\u00e9tend aussi \u00e0 taxer \"all \"lands town lots and parts of town lots whether there \" be buildings erected thereon or not with all buildings \"and erections thereon.\" La pr\u00e9tention contraire soulev\u00e9e par l'Appelante est fond\u00e9e sur une omission sans importance qui se trouve dans Ia version fran\u00e7aise de la section 86 laquelle d\u00e9clare que l le dit conseil de \" ville aura le droit de pr\u00e9lever annuellement sur les \" personnes et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res de la dite ville l les taxes ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9es.\" Il est \u00e9vident que ce n'est que par inadvertance que le mot i immobili\u00e8res \" a \u00eat\u00ea omis \u00e0 la suite du mot \" mobili\u00e8res.\" Si cette partie de la dite section devait se lire sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce qui suit la pr\u00e9tention de l'Appelante aurait une apparence de plausibilit\u00e9. Mais la m\u00eame section continue de suite et dans la m\u00eame phase, \u00e0 designer les taxes qui seront impos\u00e9es, et la premi\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e est celle sur tous terrains, lots de ville on portion de lot, etc., ce qui, malgre l'omission du mot \" immobili\u00e8res \" dans la partie qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ne laisse aucun doute possible sur l'intention de conf\u00e9rer le droit de taxer les immeubles.\nLa version anglaise contient, ii est vrai, le mot \" immoveable\" qui manque dans la premi\u00e8re partie de la version fran\u00e7aise mais cela ne peut constituer une diff\u00e9rence affectant l'interpr\u00e9tation des deux textes car tous deux conf\u00e8rent \u00e9videmment le droit de taxer les immeubles. Si cette diff\u00e9rence \u00e9tait susceptible de cr\u00e9er un doute ii faudrait m\u00eame dans ce cas, suivant l'art. 12, C.C., interpr\u00e9ter la section 86 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 lui faire remplir son intention \u00e9vidente de fournir \u00e0 la ville de Saint-Jean par la taxe sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et immobili\u00e8res les moyens n\u00e9cessaires de mettre a ex\u00e9cution tous les pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par son acte d'incorporation. Je conclus que le pouvoir de taxer les immeubles est clairement donne.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de cette objection au pouvoir de taxer de la municipalit\u00e9, on a aussi soulev\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention que les ponts de chemin de fer \u00e9taient exempt\u00e9s du paiement des taxes, et on a m\u00eame contest\u00e9 \u00e0 ce genre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 la qualit\u00e9 d'immeuble. Ces deux pr\u00e9tentions me paraissent \u00e9galement mal fond\u00e9es. Par l'effet du statut, la Compagni est devenue en possession l\u00e9gale de cette partie du lit de la rivi\u00e8re sur laquelle repose le quai d'approche et les piliers qui soutiennent la superstructure du pont. Cette construction faite pour perp\u00e9tuelle demeure sur cette partie du lit de la rivi\u00e8re, \u00e0 l'occupation de laquelle la compagnie a un titre l\u00e9gal, a eu l'effet de faire de l'ensemble du pont une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re d'un caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie et dont une moiti\u00e9 se trouve dans les limites de la ville. Il est indiff\u00e9rent que le lit de la rivi\u00e8re soit comme ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Holman v. Green. ([3]) au sujet du havre de Summerside, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral on du gouvernement provincial comme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la cour du Banc de la Reine dans Normand v. la Cie du Saint-Laurent ([4]) il n'en est pas moins vrai que dans un cas comme dans l'autre cette partie du domaine public appropri\u00e9e en vertu des lois de chemin de fer de la Puissance tout aussi bien qu'en vertu des lois provinciales sur le m\u00eame sujet, a cess\u00e9, au moins pour tout le temps qu'elle sera employ\u00e9e au passage du chemin, de faire partie du domaine public de m\u00eame qu'un lot de terre conc\u00e9d\u00e9 par la couronne cesse de faire partie de son domaine et devient propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e et comme telle sujet \u00e0 toutes les taxes et charges de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. On arguerait done inutilement pour soutenir que le pont n'est pas taxable, du fait qu'il est construit sur une partie du domaine public exempt\u00e9 de toutes taxes. Cette exemption est sans doute incontestable pour le domaine \"public mais elle cesse d'exister lorsqu'il s'agit d'une partie de ce domaine devenue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de particuliers. On ne pent pas plus appliquer \u00e0 un pont ce privil\u00e8ge du domaine public qu'on ne le pourrait aux nombreux quais construits en eau profonde. Ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sont comme tous les autres immeubles sujets aux taxes impos\u00e9es sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re.\nIl est incontestable que le pont en question doit \u00e9tre d'apr\u00e9s les lois de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, comme d'apr\u00e9s les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux d'Ontario, voir Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Go. v. Gardner ([5]), consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e9re et comme telle sujette \u00e0 la taxe, \u00e0 moins que l'on ne justifie d'une exemption.\nPour que le pont en question put \u00eatre reconnu exempt de taxe il faudrait trouver un texte de loi qui le d\u00e9clare formellement, et ii n'en existe pas \u00e0 ma connaissance. Cette question int\u00e9resse \u00e0 un tr\u00e8s haut degre non seulement l'Intim\u00e9e, mais encore toutes les municipalit\u00e9s et elles \u00e9ont nombreuses, dans les limites desquelles se trouvent des pouts de chemin de fer, et d\u00e9clarer ce genre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9 de taxe, ce serait leur faire perdre un revenu consid\u00e9rable.\nEn vertu de la clause 98 de l'acte d'incorporation 43 et 44 Vie, ch. 62, la plus grande partie des clauses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales des corporations de ville sont rendues applicables \u00e0 la dite ville de Saint-Jean.\nParmi ces clauses se trouvent les 326 et 327 La premi\u00e8re ordonne aux compagnies de chemin de fer qui poss\u00e8dent des biens fonds dans la municipalit\u00e9 de transmettre an bureau du conseil, an mois de mai de chaque ann\u00e9e, un \u00e9tat d\u00e9signant la valeur r\u00e9elle de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res dans la municipalit\u00e9 autre que le chemin, et aussi la valeur r\u00e9elle du terrain occup\u00e9 par le chemin d'apr\u00e8s la valeur moyenne du terrain dans la localit\u00e9. Cet \u00e9tat doit \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 temps aux faire l'\u00e9valuation d'apr\u00e9s l'\u00e9tat fourni par la compagnie et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de transmission de cet \u00e9tat dans le temps prescrit ils sont obliges d'en faire l'estimation comme celle de tout autre contribuable.\nL'\u00e9tat requis par ces dispositions n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni dans le temps prescrit, les estimateurs out proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation du pont et des autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s au meilleur de leur jugement en ayant toutefois le soin de n'\u00e9valuer que le terrain sur lequel passe ce chemin et non les travaux du chemin. Les estimateurs appel\u00e9s comme t\u00e9moins se sont explquu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet dans leur t\u00e9moignage de mani\u00e9re \u00e0 faire disparaitre le doute que l'on aurait Pu soulever sur les expressions dont ils se sont servis. \"Roadway\" pour designer le terrien acquis par la compagnie pour y passer son chemin; ils disent positivement qu\u2019ils out fait la distinction voulue et n'ont pas tax\u00e9 le chemin c'est-\u00e0-dire les travaux du chemin.\nSi maintenant l'Appelante trouve leur estimation trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e elle ne peut s'en plaindre \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9e dont les estimateurs out agi avec bonne foi. Si l'\u00e9tat requis parla loi ett \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni dans le temps voulu le estimateurs auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 obliges d'en passer par la valeur d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par la compagnie.\nSi l'estimation est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e l'Appelante ne doit s'en prendre qu'\u00e0 elle-m\u00eame et doit subir la consequence de sa n\u00e9gligence.\nApr\u00e9s la confection de ce r\u00f4le, \u00e0 l'homologation duquel l'Appelante n'a fait aucune opposition, elle avait encode en vertu de la sec. 200 des clauses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales des corporations de ville, le pouvoir d'en faire-pronoacer la nullit\u00e9 pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, n'ayant pas adopt\u00e9e ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai voulu le role est devenu finalement clos \u00e9t ne pent plus \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 par le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 auquel l'Appelante a eu recours.\nL'Appelante a soulev\u00e9 lors de l'argument devant la cour du Banc de la Reine des pr\u00e9tentions dont elle n'a fait aucune mention dans sa p\u00e9tition. Une de ces pr\u00e9tentions est que l'acte 43 et 44 Vic, ch. 62 a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une nouvelle corporation tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente et distincte de celle qui avait exist\u00e9 auparavant; que cet acte ne contenant aucune disposition pour maintenir en force le r\u00f4le de cotisation de 1880 les taxes de cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 ne pouvaient \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9es.\nL'acte en question n'a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 une corporation nouvelle. C'est u un acte pour amender et consolider l'acte d d'incorporation de la ville de Saint-Jean et les divers actes l'amendant. Ce dernier acte quant \u00e0 la confection du r\u00f4le de cotisation et la perception des taxes n'est que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la loi ant\u00e9rieure copi\u00e9e dans la nouvelle, et qui partant n'a cess\u00e9 en aucun temps d'\u00eatre en force. Ii n'\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d'une disposition sp\u00e9ciale pour d\u00e9clarer que le r\u00f4le fait anterieurement continuerait en force paree que la loi n'\u00e9tait pas chang\u00e9e sous ce rapport. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par cette cour dans la cause de Suite vs. Corporation de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. ([6])\nJe dois ajouter que dans b\u00e9 cas actuel cette question souffre moins de difficult\u00e9 parce que les 7e et 117e clauses de l'acte 43 et 44 Vic, ch. 62 ont maintenu en force tous les r\u00e8glements existants en d\u00e9clarant :\nClause 7. Et tous les r\u00e8glements, ordonnances, conventions, dispositions et engagements quelconques passes et consentis par le dit conseil ou le maire actuel ou leurs pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs en office, auront et continueront \u00e0 avoir leur plein et entier effet, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les dits r\u00e8glements, conventions et engagements aient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement rescind\u00e9s et abolis,\nEt la 117e clause d\u00e9clare :\nSi quelqu'un transgresse aucun r\u00e8glement fait par le conseil de ville en vertu du pr\u00e9sent acte ou des actes par le pr\u00e9sent abrog\u00e9s, ou se met en contravention, etc., etc., sera passible de l'amende et do l'emprisonnement \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement de telle amende suivant que sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 en aucun des dits r\u00e8glements.\nCes dispositions sont clairement suffisantes pour maintenir en force non seulement les r\u00e8glements existants en vertu des lois d'incorporation ant\u00e9rieures, mais m\u00eame les r\u00f4les de cotisation et de perception qui n'ont d'effet l\u00e9gal qua apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par ordre du conseil.\nla\u2019 m\u00eame r\u00e9ponse s'applique \u00e0. l'objection faite \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du warrant.

The main question to be decided is : Whether rates levied by the municipal authorities of the town of St. Johns on a railway bridge of the appellant company over the Richelieu river\u2014one-half of which is within the limits of the town\u2014for the year 1880 and the two following years were authorized by law? Provision for the assessment of railway companies by municipalities was made by sections 326 and 3277 of the act 40 Vic. ch. 29; and it is upon the construction to be put on those sections and others that the rights of the parties herein are to be ascertained\n[The learned judge then read sections 326 and 327.]\nIt will then be seen that the municipal taxes on railway companies were limited to the real estate owned by the company in the municipality, other than the road and the actual value of the land occupied by the road, estimated according to the average value of land in the locality. Taxation otherwise was totally exclouded.\nThe bridge in question is over a navigable river, and the title to the land over which it flows is in the crown held for public uses. The company by the erection of the bridge over it obtained and have no title whatever to the soil and therefore it is not immoveable property of the appellant company. Such land is therefore not, as I think real estate belonging to the company to which the act applies. The land under the bridge may be said to be land occupied by the road; but still it could not apply to the parts or portions of it occupied by the pillars of the bridge. The spaces under the circumstances could not be deemed as in the occupation of the company, when as to such spaces the maritime rights of the public remain unaffected by the superstructure. Nor do I believe the statute was ever intended to apply' to such. What it meant was to authorize a tax on land belonging to companies exclusively occupied as the railroad, and I think we would be straining the provision in question to apply it to the bed of a navigable river.\nThat however is only incidentally necessary to be considered for the taxes were not levied on the land of the navigable river; but upon that half of the superstructure within the municipality. It is claimed because the land under the bridge is used by the company, that, although belonging to the crown, it is liable to taxation and a question would arise if the land had been alone taxed; but it is further claimed that because the land is in the occupation of the company, the bridge built on is immovable property within the provisions of the section hereinbefore in part recited\nThe law as to fixtures on immovable property is what should govern in this case and if so I cannot regard the bridge in question as one.\nThe question is raised as one determining the ownership of machinery or other property placed on immovable property to determine whether it belongs to a tenant or a landlord. Is the bridge in question of that necessarily permanent connection with the land under it that it would become the property of a landlord at the end of a tenant's term? It cannot be contended that a tenant during his term could not remove anything placed or erected by him on the devised property that was not a fixture. During the term, therefore, such could not be deemed a part of the real estate. A building erected upon blocks laid on the soil may be removed by the tenant. The bridge in question must I think he regarded in the same way and I can see nothing, and know no law, to prevent the company from removing it if desirous of so doing. How then can it be called immovable property and if not how can it be rated as such? If the company filled to return a valuation of the immovable property in the municipality, the valuators could do more than tax immovable property they could not tax movable property, nor could they in my opinion tax the bridge in question. The statutes exempt the rails, ties, and everything else composing a railway, on or even below the level of the railway track, including masonry in culverts, bridges and other erections on the immovable property of companies. Then why should not the bridge in question be exempt t If it had been built on land of the company liable to be taxed, the bridge would not be liable to taxation. Then why should the fact of its having been built over some other party's land, liable or not to be taxed make the slightest difference? It may be said, however, that as an appeal is given by section 331 of 40 Vic ch 29 from the tax roll to the council of the municipality the appellants not having taken such appeal and the roll having been homologated, they have no other remedy against the illegal assessment. Section 323 provides that :\u2014\nIt shall be the duty of the valuators in office to make annually, at the time and in the manner ordered by the council, the valuation of the taxable property of the municipality according to real value.\nThe duty of the valuators is therefore, confined to taxable property, and it is from their acts as such valuators within the scope of their authority that any person feeling aggrieved may appeal. The homologation of the roll, therefore, in my opinion, affects only taxable property.\nI am for the reasons given, of opinion that the appellant company is entitled to the remedy by injunction as sought in this action, such remedy being within the provision of the statute of Quebec in relation to injunction, with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. \u2014\u2014 As to the contention that the act extending the limits of the town of St. Johns to the middle of the Richelieu river is unconstitutional because the said rive, being navigable, is under the exclusive control of the federal parliament, there is nothing in it.\nAs to the second ground of appellants' petition, that movable property only is taxable by the charter of St. Johns, it is also untenable. By a misprint in the French version of the act the word immoveable has been left out but the context of that version itself shows that immoveable are taxable and the English version contains the word \" immoveable. \" The appellants did not press this ground of their petition at the argument.\nThe third ground of the appellants' petition is that they are not proprietors, and not in possession of a part of the property assessed On this the judger at the trial found, and his finding is fully supported by the evidence, that the company is in possession of all the property assessed.\nNow section 370 of 40 Vic. ch. 29 which is part of the charter of St. Johns by section 98 thereof specially provides that all municipal taxes may be collected from the tenant or occupant of the land.\nThe fourth, fifth and sixth grounds of the appellants' petition are general ones, that the corporation has acted illegally and beyond its powers in the assessment of the said property and in issuing the warrant of distress. Under these general allegations, the appellants take two distinct objections, one attacking the whole of the assessments for the four years and the second one attacking the assessment of 1880 only. The first which applies to all the taxes claimed on the part of the appellants' road on terra firma, is that only the land occupied by the road is taxable and not the road bed itself under section 326 of 40 Vic. ch. 29. This section reads as follows :\u2014\nEvery iron railway company or wooden railway company possessing real estate in the municipality, shall transmit to the office of the council in the month of May in each year, a return showing the actual value of their real estate in the municipality other than the road and also the actual value of the land occupied by the road estimated according to the average value of land in the locality. Such return must be communicated to the valuators by the secretary treasurer in due time.\nIt is in evidence here that the company never sent to the corporation the return mentioned in this section and consequently according to the very next section of the said act, their property had to be taxed, as that of any other proprietor in the municipality, viz :\u2014\nThe valuators in making the valuation of the taxable property in the municipality, shall value the real estate of such company according to the value specified in the return given by the company. If such return has not been transmitted in the time prescribed, the valuation of all the immovable property belonging to the company shall be made in the same manner as that of any other ratepayer.\nWe have been referred to the case of the Great Western Co. v. Rouse ([7]), in which it was held that only the land occupied by the railway and not the superstructure is taxable. But this case has no application here, because the statute of 1853, U. C. Assessment Act, 15 Vic. ch. 182 sec. 21 does not provide, as the Quebec statute I have cited does, that if the company fails to make a return to the council the valuation of all its immovable property shall be made as that of any other ratepayer. The two cases of the Corporation of London v. The Great Western Railway Co., ([8]) decided under 29 and 30 Vic., ch. 53 sec. are distinguishable on the same ground.\nNow as to the taxes of 1880;\u2014\nThe appellants argue that for 1880 the respondent cannot claim the taxes, because the old corporation was abolished on the 24th July of that year, by 43 and 44 Vic ch 62 and the new one then came into existence.\nI do not see any foundation for this contention.\nThe act 43 and 44 Vic. ch. 62 does not create a new corporation. The corporation of the town of St. Johns, as created by 22 Vic. ch. 106, (1858), under the very same name, is continued with extended powers and extended territorial jurisdiction. Section 7 specially enacts that all the officers then in office shall be continued until duly removed or the expiration of their functions, and as I read this clause with all the powers and duties of their offices. This seems to me unquestionable. If the officers are continued it must be with the view that they should fill the duties of their offices. Now this valuation of 1880 must have been made after the new act was in force and after the 24th July since in express terms it includes that part of the bridge within the limits of the town and the bridge was not within the limits of the town before that act was passed. By section 23 of 22 Vic. ch 106, there was no special date fixed to make the roll. This was left to the council though by 37 Vic., ch. 95, sec. 1, it had to be made every year. Now the appellants not having proved that the roll of 1880 was made before the 24th July, we must follow the rule omnia prcesumuntur rite esse acta.\nBut even if the roll had been made before the 24th July, as it is proved that even before the new act 90 feet of this bridge were within the limits of this municipality, and as the roll taxes part of the bridge within the municipality, we should read it as taxing these 90 feet.\nAs to the amount of the valuation we have nothing to do with it. No question on it can arise before us on a writ of injunction under section 1 of 41 Vic, ch. 14.\nThe enactments as to assessments in the new act did not come in operation until 1881, and the prior ones continued in force till then according to sections 8 and11of 49 and 50 Vic. ch. 95 which are re-enactments of the Interpretation Act, made in express terms applicable to the charter of St. Johns by its last clause, no doubt to cover this point.\nThey read as follows :\u2014\nSec. 8. When any provisions of a statute are repealed and others substituted therefore, the provisions repealed remain in operation until the provisions substituted become executor under the repealing, statute.\nSec. 11. Unless the repealing statute otherwise provides all acts, proceedings or things done or begun and all rights acquired in virtue of the provisions of any statute afterwards repealed may be continued completed, and exercised under such provisions, notwithstanding such repeal, by observing, in so far as applicable, the procedure set forth in the new act.\nAs to the distress warrant to levy taxes, the enactments of the new charter are similar to those of the first.\nIt has been urged on the part of the appellants that this bridge is not taxable at all. But this is erroneous. It is immovable property and therefore subject to taxation. See The Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge v. Gardner ([9])\nAnother objection taken by the appellants is that the interest accrued on these taxes could not he levied by warrant of distress. By sections 368 of 40 Vic. ch. 29 which is incorporated in the St. Johns charter, interest runs on all taxes from the date that they become due.\nThe appellants contention is that though for the taxes themselves a warrant of distress can issue the interest thereon is recoverable only by action. I cannot accede to this proposition. The interest is a part of the taxes due to the corporation and it would require a very clear text, and a novel one it would be, to convince me that the mode to recover the capital is not the same as that to recover interest. In an analogous case, Baker v. Kelly ([10]) the judge delivering the judgment of the Superior Court of Minnesota said : \u201c I can see no reason why the interest and costs should \" not follow the tax and be collected in the same \" manner.\" Such is my view of the question.\nI am of opinion therefore that the present appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The assessments and rates made and imposed for the years in question from 1880 to 1883 inclusive, are, in my opinion, clearly illegal and void. By the 98th sec. of 43 and 44 Vic. ch. 62 entitled \" An Act \" to amend and consolidate the act of incorporation of \" the town of St. Johns and the several acts amending \" the same, \" it is enacted that sections 326 and 327 together with several other sections of The Town Corporation General Clauses Act 40 Vic ch 29 shall form part of 43 and 44 Vic ch. 62 By these sections \"provision is made for the manner in which real estate and prescribing what real estate, of railway companies, shall be assessed by the municipality in which such real estate is situated.\nBy these sections it is enacted [The learned judge then read sections 326 and 327 ([11]).]\nNow, the manner to be adopted with other ratepayers is prescribed by the 323 section, which declares it to be the duty of valuators to make the valuation of the taxable property of the municipality according to real value and that they shall also maire a valuation of the annual value of such property, and shall enter it on the roll in a separate column In case the return is made by the company, as directed in the 326 section, the valuators shall adopt the valuation given by the company but if no such return be made they shall value the taxable property according to their own estimate of its real value It is in either case only the taxable property that is to be assessed. Now these sections 326 and 3217 owe their origin to the Lower Canada Municipal and Road Act of 1855, 18 Vic. ch. 100 sec. 4 which in its turn owes its origin to the Assessment Laws Consolidation Act of Upper Canada 16 Vic. ch. 182 sec. 21. Under this act it was decided by the Court of Queen's Bench for Upper Canada when the late Sir John Robinson was Chief Justice of that court in the case of The Great Western Railway Co. v. Rouse ([12]) that the language was too clear to admit of a doubt and that it exempts, and that the intention of the act was clearly to exempt, all the superstructure, such as the iron, rails, bridges, &c., &c., from all liability to assessment, and that as to the roadway all that is assessable is the land occupied by the railway, according to the average value of land in the locality; and further, that the decision of the County Court Judge (to whom an appeal had been taken) maintaining an assessment of superstructure was not final, the question not being as to over valuation of property liable to be assessed, but whether there was any authority to assess the superstructure at all and in London v. The Great Western Railway Co. ([13]), it was held by the same court that as the municipality had no right to assess superstructure the objection could be taken in an action, although there had been no appeal taken to the County Court Judge that the appeal given to the County Court Judge, whose decision thereon was by the statute made final was only for over valuation of property liable to be assessed and that the municipality could not, whatever the form of proceeding, recover a rate illegally imposed. These are, in my opinion, sound judgments which should he sustained. Now, in the present case it is shown in plain terms by the assessment rolls, that the assessments and rates which are objected to were imposed on superstructure, namely, on \" railway tracks \" from East Longueil to bridge,\" and for r part of railroad \" bridge within the limits of the town of St. Johns.\"\nThe \"railway tracks\" so assessed consist not only of t the land occupied by the road,\" but of the wooden sleepers and the iron rail laid down thereon which is what constitutes the \"railway track.\" And as to the bridge, which appears to be across the river Richelieu, the bed of which is vested in the crown, and is as such, exempt from taxation, it is a structure erected for no other purpose than to bear the iron rail which with its supports constitute the track across the river. This structure takes the place of sleepers laid on level ground. The railway being required to cross the river (the bed of which is in the crown) had of necessity to be supported by a structure different from that which is required to support the rails on land. The bridge therefore, which is erected over the bed of the river which is vested in the crown, is in all its parts superstructure and constitutes the \" railway track \" over the river and the stat table direction to estimate the value of the land occupied by the road according to the average value of land in the locality is wholly inapplicable to such a structure. Then it is clear by the 79th section of 43 and 44 Vic. eh. 62, that the process given to have the valuation or assessment rolls reviewed at the instance of persons considering themselves aggrieved by the assessment, applies only to cases of compaint as to excessive valuation of assessable property, But the rates, which are here objected to, having been wholly illegally imposed that is to say, imposed upon property not liable to assessment, the warrant to levy rates so imposed is void as ultra vires of the corporation of St. Johns, and the proceeding by injunction to restrain the enforcement of such warrant is an appropriate remedy expressly given by the statute 41 Vic. ch. 14 of the Province of Quebec. I can see no objection to the limits of the town being extended to the middle of the river by a provincial statute, and my judgment proceeds upon the assumption that they are effectually so extended.\nFor the reasons already given the appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court should be varied thus; Considering that there is error in the judgment of the Superior Court and that the assessments made and rates imposed for the years 1880 to 1883 inclusive, are illegal and void, as having been made on the railway track, and on the railway bridge crossing the river Richelieu, so far as the same are within the limits of the town of St. Johns, which being superstructure only and not l land occupied by the roadway \" were not liable to be assessed and. rated; and considering that the warrant to levy such illegal rates is illegal and void, order the said warrant to be quashed and enjoin the corporation to desist from all proceedings to enforce the same with costs (distraits) to the petitioners' solicitors\nAppeal allowed with costs (1).\nSolicitors for appellants : Church, Chaplean, Hall & Nicolls.\nSolicitors for respondents : Robidoux & Fortin.\n[1] 15 U.

The appellant, a contractor, undertook its completion for the price of $3,000, exacting as security a pledge of the property and materials. This pledge was executed by way of a direct sale or conveyance of the land, buildings and materials, executed by notarial deed of 24th April 1879.\nAt the same time a private writing contre-lettre was signed by the appellant, by which he bound himself to reconvey the property to plaintiff on receipt of $3,000, within three months from the date of the final completion of the work in accordance with the verbal agreement made between the parties on this point.\nThe contre-lettre is as follows :\u2014\nA Monsieur Paul Fournier, Entrepreneur Menuisier, de la, Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al\nMONSIEUR :\u2014\nJe m'engage par les pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 vous r\u00e9troc\u00e9der \u00e0 raison de la somme de trois molle piastres que vous me paierez comptant lors de la confection du dit acte de r\u00e9trocession en un seul paiement en aucun temps lurent l'espace do trois moss \u00e0 compter Dujour quo j'aurai termin\u00e9 los' b\u00e2tisses en voie de construction le lot No 428 quatre cent vingt. huit an plan et au livre do renvoi officiel pour le quartier SL.

This sum was at once paid to the bailiff, who the same day signified to the said company the sale and adjudication of the shares as required by law.\nThe petitioner prayed that the writ be declared to be null, and the secretary treasurer ordered not to transfer the shares.\nIn answer to the petition the respondent contended:\n1st: That the sale of the shares en bloc was perfectly legal.\n2nd. That the proceedings and conduct of the sale were regular and legal, and that even if there had been any irregularity, which is denied, it was waived and acquiesced in by the respondents.\n3rd. That the sale of the shares en bloc was to the advantage of the defendant Barlow and his creditors.\nOHalloran Q.C. for appellants and Geoffrion Q.C. and Hatton for respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014We are of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. Art. 599 of the C. P. R. enacts that no demand for the annulling or rescinding of a sale of movables under execution can be received against a purchaser who has paid the price saving in the case of fraud or collusion. Now here the purchaser, Morris has paid the price of the adjudication, and no fraud or collusion is alleged by the appellant. How could we in the face of such a clear enactment maintain the appellants' petition to set aside this sale? It is true that art. 595 enacts that the sale must not proceed beyond the amount necessary to satisfy the debt, but if the officer conducting the sale does proceed to sell more than necessary, is that a cause of nullity as against a bond fide purchaser? I do not think so, nor has the appellant cited any authority to support such a contention. By art 598 the ownership of the moveable\u2019s adjudged is transferred by the adjudication. At the very moment, upon his paying the price, the purchaser is. vested with the ownership of what he has bought. That is the general policy of the law, as regards moveable property. On this I refer to Rondi\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure civile ([2]) where the author under art. 622 of the Code Napoleon which also enacts that he should not proceed further than necessary to pay the execution debt, says, \"The sale terminated, the defendant or any third party cannot for \" any cause trouble the purchaser, because as to movables, possession is a title.\" The only recourse (he adds,) that the defendant or third parties have, is against the officer or the execution-creditor.\nAgainst a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser at a judicial sale of moveables, I take the law to be that there is no such thing as a petition to set aside the sale for the reason here invoked by the appellants. Even, if the seizure or the sale has been utterly illegal, the purchaser is protected. Bioche, dictionnaire de procedure ([3]) cites numerous authorities for that proposition. On ne peut depouiller des adjudicataires de bonne foi, Bioche says.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: George F. O'Halloran.\nSolicitor for respondent: J. C. Hatton.\n[1] M. L.

Gemmill (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1887: November 18, 19; 1887: December 20.\nPresent: Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCopyright\u2014Infringement of\u2014Sources of information\u2014Statutory form of notice of - Decree, form of.\nThe publisher of a work containing biographical sketches cannot copy them from a copyrighted work, even where he has applied to the subjects of such sketches and been referred to the copyrighted work therefor.\nIn works of this nature where so much may be taken by different publishers from common sources and the information given must be in the same words, the courts will be careful not to restrict the right of one publisher to publish a work similar to that of another, if he obtains the information from common sources and does not, to save himself labor, merely copy from the work of the other that which has been the result of the latter\u2019s skill and diligence.\nThe notice of copyright to be inserted in the title page of a copyrighted work is sufficient if it substantially follows the statutory form[1]. Therefore the omission of the words \u201cof Canada\u201d in such form is not a fatal defect, and, even if a defect, such defect is removed by sec. 7 sub\u2011sec. 44 of the Interpretation Act[2].\nDepositing in the office of the Minister of Agriculture copies of a book containing notice of copyright before the copyright has been granted does not invalidate the same when granted.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Chancellor of Ontario[3] in favor of the plaintiff. A suit was brought by the plaintiff Gemmill against the defendant Garland for infringement of a copy-right of the former, and for an injunction to restrain the defendant from publishing or selling the book alleged to be such an infringement.\nOne Henry J. Morgan was the compiler and publisher of a book called the \u201cCanadian Parliamentary Companion, 1862,\u201d and in 1872 he assigned all his right and title in the copyright of said book to C.H. Mackintosh. Mackintosh during the years 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880 and 1881, issued further editions of the said book and similar books copyrighted as \u201cThe Parliamentary Companion, 1862,\u201d and \u201cThe Canadian Parliamentary Companion, 1874\u201d under the style or title of \u201cThe Canadian Parliamentary Companion and Annual Register\u201d for the particular year.\nOn the 7th July 1882, the said Mackintosh assigned to the plaintiff all his right and title to the alleged copyrights in \u201cThe Canadian Parliamentary Companion 1862,\u201d \u201cThe Canadian Parliamentary Companion 1874,\u201d and in the several editions of \u201cThe Canadian Companion and Annual Register\u201d for the years 1877 to 1881 inclusive, and the plaintiff afterwards published and copyrighted the \u201cCanadian Parliamentary Companion, 1883.\u201d\nThe defendant, Garland, was the publisher of a work entitled \u201cThe Parliamentary Directory and Statistical \u201cGuide, 1885,\u201d which Gemmill claimed to be a piracy of his books, and the publication by Garland was the cause of the present suit.\nAt the hearing in the Chancery Division the defendant, in addition to denying the charge of piracy, attacked the plaintiff\u2019s copyright on two grounds.\nFirst, that before obtaining such copyright the plaintiff printed the book with notice thereon, that the copyright had been obtained and deposited two copies under sec. 7 of the Copyright Act of 1875, (38 Vic. ch 88) which it was claimed subjected him to a penalty under sec. 17 of said act and avoided the copyright. Secondly, because the notice required by sec. 9 of the said act to be inserted on the title page or page following of every copy of the book issued was defective, such notice being as follows:\u2014\u201cEntered according to the Act of Parliament, in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty three, by J.A. Gemmill, in the office of the Minister of Agriculture\u201d omitting the words \u201cof Canada\u201d after the word \u201cParliament.\u201d\nThe learned Chancellor overruled both objections the first because, though it might possibly subject the publisher to a penalty it did not invalidate the copyright, and the second because the form used was a sufficient compliance with the act; and he granted an injunction restraining the defendant from publishing, etc., his above mentioned book or any copies or future editions thereof containing matter pirated from any of the plaintiff\u2019s works.\nThe defendant appealed, and claimed that the Chancellor at the hearing had restricted the infringement to the plaintiff\u2019s book published in 1883, and if the defendant was liable at all the injunction should not go beyond that. The Court of Appeal, however, affirmed the decision as it stood. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Walker for the appellant.\nIn 1862 the respondent obtained a copyright, and his book was issued in subsequent years without the notice of copyright required by the statute. That made the matter contained in the book public property, and the book issued in 1883 was a mere reproduction of such matter with a few pages of new matter interlarded. It is submitted that the book of 1883, therefore, is not properly a subject of copyright. The omission of the words \u201cof Canada\u201d in the notice of copyright required by sec. 9 of the Copyright Act, 38 Vic., ch. 88 will, it is submitted, vitiate the copyright of the respondent. He is only entitled to his monopoly upon a strict construction of the statute giving it to him.\nWithout the interpretation act, R.S.C., ch. 1, sec.7, sub-sec. 44, it is clear that this omission would be fatal. Jackson v. Walker [4]; Wheaton v. Peters[5]; Donaldsons v. Becket[6]; and the notice required by section 9 of the Copyright Act is not a form within the meaning of the Interpretation Act.\nThe book copy-righted in 1883 was merely a repetition of the former matter, and the authorities are clear that the protection must be confined to the new matter.\nThe latest case on the subject of copyright is Pike v. Nicholas[7]; which follows Cary v. Kearsley[8]. Both these cases support the contention of the defendant in this case.\nThe American authorities also are generally in our favor. Law\u2019s Dig.[9]; Bump on Copyright[10]; and see Slater on Copyright[11]; Black v. Murray[12]; referred to in Slater p. 53.\nAfter a work has once gone to the public neither the author nor any other person can copyright the same matter on the same plan by making a few alterations or additions. Thomas v. Turner[13]; Langlois v. Vincent [14].\nArnoldi for the respondent:\nThe omission complained of in the notice of copy- right is immaterial. Nobody could be misled by it and if it is a defect it is cured by the Interpretation Act.\nIt has been found by the Chancellor, and is apparent on examination, that the defendant\u2019s book is a slavish copy of that of the plaintiff, and the decree for an injunction should stand.\nThe following authorities were relied on. Slater on Copyright[15]; Morris v. Wright [16]; Morris v. Ashbee[17]; Kelly v. Morris[18]; Coppinger on Copyright[19]; Bickford v Hood[20].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by GWYNNE J.\u2014The decree made in this cause not only restrains the defendant from selling the book published by him and known as The Parliamentary Directory and Statistical Guide of 1885 but also from publishing or selling any future edition thereof, or containing matter copied or pirated from the books of the plaintiff known as the \u201cCanadian Parliamentary Companion for the years 1862, 1874, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880, 1881 or 1883;\u201d of all of which works, except the last, the plaintiff is now proprietor by assignment from the authors thereof, and from publishing or selling any book containing any portions, passages or extracts taken or colorably altered from the plaintiff\u2019s said books, and from copying from the plaintiff\u2019s said books or any edition thereof in the preparation of or for the purpose of assisting in the preparation of any future edition of the defendant\u2019s said book, or any other book. The learned Chancellor of Ontario, before whom the case was tried, having made a very careful comparison of the new matter appearing in the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cCanadian Parliamentary Companion \u201cof 1883,\u201d with the defendant\u2019s book of 1885, and having come to the conclusion that much in the latter book, had been copied and pirated from the plaintiff\u2019s book of 1883, made no comparison between the defendant\u2019s book and the \u201cCanadian Parliamentary Companions published in the said years prior to 1883,\u201d of which, and of the rights of the author\u2019s thereof therein, whatever those rights were, the plaintiff is the assignee. The learned Chancellor in his judgment says:\u2014\nInhibiting the use by the defendant of the parts first published in the plaintiff\u2019s edition of 1883, will so substantially interfere with the whole of the defendant\u2019s publication of 1885, that it is not necessary to prosecute the enquiry further, as to whether there is copyright in the parts of the plaintiff\u2019s book which were published in the editions of 1874 to 1881.\nThe defendant appealed from the above decree to the Court of Appeal for Ontario upon various grounds of objection, which have been renewed before us, that court having dismissed his appeal. The question before us must be limited to an enquiry as to the piracy of matter contained in the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cCanadian Parliamentary Companion of 1883\u201d; for assuming the previous books published in the years mentioned in the decree to have been registered as required by the copyright act in force in those respective years, still the defendant contends that if there be any matter contained in his book which can be found also in the books published in the years prior to 1883, of which the plaintiff is the assignee, such matter was obtained by the defendant and the authors of those respective books from common sources, some of those sources having been, as is admitted, books previously published by the authors whose rights the plaintiff has purchased as regards the years mentioned in the decree but which previous books such authors had not registered as required by the Copyright Act, and in which therefore they had acquired no copyright, This branch of the defence not having been entered into and adjudicated upon by the learned Chancellor the decree should not have dealt with it as if it had been entered into and adjudicated upon against the defendant. In works of this nature, where so much may be taken from common sources and where much of the information given, if given correctly, must be given in the same words we must be careful not to restrict the right of the defendant to publish a work similar in its nature to that of the plaintiff if, in truth, he obtains the information from common, independent sources open to all and does not, to save himself labor, merely copy from the plaintiff\u2019s book that which has been the result of his skill, diligence and literary attainments. We must be careful not to put manacles upon industry, intelligence and skill in compiling works of this nature.\nThe parts which the learned Chancellor has found, and as I think corectly found to have been copied by the defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s Canadian Parliamentary Companion of 1883,\u201d consist of short biographical sketches of some of the members of the Parliament of Canada. It must, I think, be admitted, that the defendant set about the compiling his work in a perfectly legitimate manner by addressing circulars to each member of Parliament, requesting him to furnish a short sketch of his life for publication in the defendant\u2019s work. If all the gentlemen who received these circulars had answered them by writing in their own language, short sketches of their lives, and had sent them to the defendant for publication in his book, he would have had as much right to have published these sketches in the language in which they were sent to him, or in an abridgment thereof prepared by himself, as the plaintiff had to publish like sketches furnished to him, although the language in which both sketches might be expressed should be very similar; but unfortunately for the defendant, it appears that several of the gentlemen who had received the defendant\u2019s circular, instead of furnishing him with the biographical sketches he had asked for, replied to the effect that they had already supplied such a sketch to the plaintiff for publication and which was published in his book. The defendant conceiving this sufficient authority to entitle him to take from the plaintiff\u2019s book the biographical sketches of such gentlemen as so referred him to the plaintiff\u2019s work, did copy them from the plaintiff\u2019s book, and thus, ignorantly perhaps but not the less actually, was guilty of the piracy of which the plaintiff has accused him. To the extent of the matter so copied the plaintiff has established his right to have an injunction.\nIn view of the nature of the respective works of the plaintiff and defendant the plaintiff will obtain all the protection he is entitled to if the decree should be, and I think that it should be, in the form of the order for injunction in Lewis v. Fullarton[21]; and which was followed in Kelly v. Morris[22]; namely \u201cThe Court doth order and adjudge that the defendant, etc, (as in decree) be and he is hereby restrained and enjoined from further printing, publishing selling or otherwise disposing of any copy or copies of a book called The Parliamentary Directory and Statistical Guide, 1885, containing any articles, or article passages or passage copied, taken or colorably altered from a book called The Canadian Parliamentary Companion, 1883,\u201d published by the plaintiff.\nUpon the point as to the alleged defective entry in the plaintiff\u2019s book of the information required by the statute to be given of his copyright being reserved, by reason of the omission of the words \u201cof Canada\u201d after the words \u201cof the Parliament,\u201d I am of opinion that there is nothing in this objection. The object of the insertion of the entry is to give information to the world that the work is copyrighted, and that by reference to the office of the Minister of Agriculture the precise date from which such copyright runs may be ascertained. The entry as published in the plaintiff\u2019s book is sufficient for that purpose and, as I think, is sufficient independently of the enactment contained in sub\u2011section 44 of sec. 7 of the Interpretation Act of 1886; but if the entry was defective, apart from that act, such defect is, in my opinion, removed by the above section. The references to the cases decided upon the English Act have no application as they relate to a provision in the English Act, not in our act.\nNeither is there anything in the objection that the copies deposited in the office of the Minister of Agriculture, under the provision of the statute in that behalf, contained the entry of information as to copyright being secured, which is required to be inserted in every copy of every edition of a copyrighted book published during the term secured. The clause requiring such deposit to be made merely requires that two copies of the author\u2019s book shall be deposited in the office of the Minister of Agriculture, etc. Now the insertion of the entry (required to be inserted in the several copies of every edition published during the term secured,) in the copies supplied to the office of the Minister of Agriculture, cannot deprive them of their character of being the book of the author who is desirous of securing his copyright. The entry in the copies supplied to the Minister of Agriculture shows that the work is printed and ready for publication, but the point sought to be established is, that it proves that the work was published before the copyright was secured, and so that the copyright was lost. This may perhaps be said to be an ingenious, but it seems to be rather a very fallacious argument. Our judgment, I think, should be that the decree varied as above be affirmed with costs to be paid the plaintiff, and the appellant must pay the costs of the appeal, as he has failed on the material points. The decree being so varied, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Walker & McLean.\nSolicitors for respondents: Ferguson & Gemmill.\n[1] The form required by 38 V. c.88 s.9 is as follows; \u201cEntered according to Act of Parliament of Canada in the year by A.B. in the office of the Minister of Agriculture.\u201d 44.

Payment was resisted by the company on the ground of the policy and the application, which was made a part of the contract, containing untrue statements, and suppressing material facts.\nTo the questions answered in the application, the insured made this declaration:\u2014\n\u201cI, the said George Miller, (the person whose life is to be insured) do hereby warrant and guarantee that the answers given to the above questions (all of which questions I hereby declare that I have read or heard read) are true, to the best of my knowledge and belief; and I do hereby agree that this proposal shall be the basis of the contract between me and the said association, and I further agree that any mis-statements or suppression of facts made in the answers to the question aforesaid, or in my answers to be given to the medical examiner, shall render null and void the policy of insurance herein applied for, and forfeit all payments made thereon.

GEORGE MILLER,\nApplicant.\nWITNESS: J.R. TABOR, Examining Physician.\nThe witness to this declaration, Dr. Tabor, died before the action, and there is no evidence of his examination of the applicant.\nIt was contended by the company that this declaration was an absolute warranty of the truth of the statements in the application and the policy, and if any of such statements were untrue in fact the policy was void.\nAmong the statements made by the insured were the following:\u2014\n(a.) That none of his brothers or sisters ever had pulmonary or any other constitutional disease.\n(b.) That he had no serious illness, local disease or personal injury, except a broken leg in childhood and an illness of three days from cold.\n(c.) That his usual medical attendant was Dr. Tabor and that he had been attended by him for a cold, and that he had not required the services of a physician, except as aforesaid, for the past seven years or for any serious illness during that period.\n(d.) That he had not consulted any other medical man except one Dr. Aikins, who examined him while suffering from the cold.\n(e.) That no material fact bearing upon his physical condition or family history had been omitted in the foregoing questions and the answers thereto.\nAs to (a.) It was contended that two of the brothers of the insured had pulmonary disease as the evidence showed that they had been troubled with spitting of blood, though neither of them was proved to have died from the cause which produced it.\nAs to (b) the evidence showed that the deceased had been injured by being thrown from a load of hay some four years before the insurance for which he had brought an action and received $200 in settlement.\nAs to (c) and (d) it appeared that the deceased had at one time consulted Dr. Aikins, of Toronto, who said there was nothing the matter with him, but gave him some medicine.\nAt the trial the jury were directed to consider whether or not the statements by the deceased were wilfully false, and made to induce the company to grant the policy, or if he was guilty of wilful misrepresentation or concealment, in which case they should find for the defendants; but if the answers were reasonably fair and truthful to the best of the knowledge and belief of the applicant, they should give a verdict for the plaintiffs. A verdict was given for the plaintiffs.\nShortly after the trial the company obtained further evidence, in the shape of declarations made by the applicant himself early in the spring of 1884, showing that at that time and for some months previous he was suffering from congestion of the lungs. The declarations were made by the applicant in order to obtain an extension of time within which to perform homestead duties upon certain lands pre-empted by him in Manitoba, and were obtained by the company from the Department of the Interior.\nIn Michaelmas Term, 1885, the defendants obtained an order nisi to set aside the verdict and to enter a verdict for the company or for a new trial, upon the grounds briefly of misdirection and discovery of new evidence.\nThe motion to make absolute the order nisi was argued in the same term, before the Chief Justice Wilson and Mr. Justice Armour, and judgment was delivered in the following Hilary Term. The Chief Justice was of opinion that there should be a new trial, while Mr. Justice Armour was of opinion that the verdict should stand; and the court being divided the order nisi was discharged with costs.\nAn appeal from this judgment to the Court of Appeal was dismissed with costs. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and Beaty Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe company has the right to have true answers to all the questions put. It is no answer to say that this can only apply to material questions, for the insurers have a right to fix the standard of materiality for themselves, and aver that the questions in the application are material by requiring them to be answered.\nThe courts below have not construed the contract between the insurers and the insured, but have made a new contract by saying that, to avoid the policy, the mis-statements or suppressions must be wilfully and knowingly made. The company can make any con- tract they see fit, and have a right to insist on its performance.\nAnderson v. Fitzgerald[3] is a leading case on this subject. The judgments of their lordships in that case put forward the principles we are contending for here, and the correctness of which cannot be disputed.\nIn the case of Fowkes v. Manchester &c. Ass. Ass.[4], the declaration was very different. The test there was whether or not there was fraudulent concealment, or a designedly untrue statement, those words being used in the declaration signed by the assured, and the court held that the company had made that the basis of the contract.\nIn the London Assurance v. Mansel[5] the policy was declared void. In answer to the usual question as to other applications for insurance, the applicant said that he was already insured in two other offices suppressing the fact that he had made application elsewhere and had been refused.\nWe would refer also to Canning v. Farquhar[6]; Thomson v. Weems[7]; Huckman v. Fernie[8]; Geach v. Ingall[9]; Phoenix Life Ins. Co. v. Raddin[10]; Cazenove v. British Equitable Ass. Co.[11]\nDr. McMichael Q.C. and McCarthy Q.C. for the respondents.\nThere is a distinction between a suppression and an omission. The former implies an intention to conceal something which the party considers of importance, but a party seeking insurance must be at liberty to exercise a discrimination as to omissions in answering so general a question as that relating to serious injury in this case. If he is bound to state every injury he has ever received, no doubt the policy is forfeited; but if he can discriminate, it is for the jury to say whether the discrimination was properly exercised or not.\nIn the case of the Connecticut Mutual v. Moore[12], the insured had received several severe injuries of which he made no mention in his application, but the policy was not held void.\nA new trial is asked on the ground of discovery of new evidence. The evidence in question was known to the defendants before the trial, and they had made efforts to get it, but they did not ask for a postponement of the trial. That a new trial will not be granted in such a case, see McDermott v. Ireson[13], following Scott v. Scott[14]; Fawcett v. Mothersell[15]; The Queen v. McIlroy[16]; Murray v. Canada Central[17].\nThat absence of witnesses is not ground for a new trial, where post-ponement is not asked for, see Edwards v. Dignam[18]; Turquand v. Dawson[19].\nAs to the objection that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, see Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[20], explaining Solomon v. Bitton[21].\nAs to interfering with the discretion of a court below, see Jones v. Tuck[22]; Bickford v. Howard[23]; Eureka Woolen Mill Co. v. Moss[24]; Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Moore[25]; Black v. Walker[26]; where the authorities are collected in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nThe injuries and accidents contemplated by the question in the application must be such as would tend to shorten the applicant\u2019s life. The company do not desire information as to any trifling injury which does not effect the general health of the applicant. The case of Insurance Co. v. Wilkinson[27] is on all fours with the present case. To a question as to receiving serious injury, &c., in the same words as in the application here, the applicant answered no. On the trial of an action on the policy, evidence was given that the insured had fallen from a tree and received considerable injury. The jury were directed to find whether that fall had caused a permanent injury, or if all the effects of it had passed away, and it was held a proper direction.\nThen as to the real point in the case, that of the construction of the contract.\nI cannot agree with the proposition that knowledge and recollection are entirely distinct. I cannot be charged with knowledge of something which I may have once known, but have forgotten. Kelly v. Solari[28].\nAmbiguous contracts are to be construed most strongly against the insurance companies. Notman v. Anchor Insurance Co.[29]; Anderson v. Fitzgerald[30]; Fowkes v. Manchester[31].\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and HENRY JJ. concurred in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur, but not without strong doubts as to one point, that is, as to the Scarborough accident, and the names of those doctors who attended Miller for it. That this was considered at the time by. Miller to be a serious accident is unquestionable. Mr. Justice Armour says it was a severe accident, but not a serious one. Why not serious? Because three years later when he applied for this policy he thought he. had fully recovered from it. But does it not happen that the consequences of an accident of that nature are felt sometimes in after life, and break out years later, and long after the party thought he had fully recovered from its effects? All the judges in the courts below are of opinion that Miller should have mentioned this accident. That he knew of it when he applied for this policy the jury could not but answer affirmatively if the question had been directly put to them. It is said that the jury have found that though he knew of it yet, to the best of his belief, he did not think it serious. But was the company not entitled to judge of that before issuing the policy? And does the evidence support the finding that this was not a serious accident? Can this be called a trifling ailment, like a tooth ache, a slight cold, that cannot be expected to be remembered or mentioned? Is one who applies for an insurance not bound to remember an accident of this kind?\nIf it was not for the case of Moore v. The Connecticut Mutual I would have dissented. And yet, perhaps, in that case, as I gather from the concluding remarks of the judgment, the Privy Council would have granted a new trial if it had been contended for in the courts below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action upon a policy of insurance upon the life of one George Miller, the application for which, signed by the said George Miller, is made part of the policy. This application contained certain questions put to the applicant by the defendants, and his answers thereto, the truth of which is guaranteed in a clause prepared by the defendants themselves and inserted at the foot of the answers in the following terms:\u2014 I, the said George Miller, do hereby warrant and guarantee that the answers given to the above questions, (all which questions I hereby declare that I have read or heard read) are true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I do hereby agree that this proposal shall be the basis of the contract between me and the said association, and I further agree that any mis-statements, or suppression of facts, made in the answers to the questions aforesaid, or in my answers to be given to the medical examiner, shall render null and void the policy of insurance herein applied for, and forfeit all payments made thereon. It is also further agreed that should a policy be executed under this application the same shall not be delivered or binding upon the association until the first premium shall be paid to a duly authorized agent of the association during my life and good health. I do also hereby agree that this proposal and declaration shall be the basis of the contract between me and the association.\nA policy having been issued upon this application and the assured having died, this action was brought to recover the amount insured by the policy to which, the defendants pleaded a defence relying upon the alleged untruth of several of the answers to the questions in the application. It is only necessary to refer to a few of these questions and answers.\n1st. To a question:\u2014\nHow many brothers have you had\u2014how many are living\u2014what are their ages\u2014what is the state of their health\u2014how many are dead\u2014and at what age and of what disease did they die?\nThe applicant answered the last part of the question by saying that:\u2014\nA brother had died at 17 years of age, but of what disease he had died he could not say\u2014that he was overgrown.\nThe alleged breach of warranty relied upon, as regards this answer in the defendants statement of defence, is\nThat his \u201c(the applicant\u2019s)\u201d said brother who died at 17 years of age, did, in fact, die of consumption or some other pulmonary disease as said George Miller well knew and concealed from the defendants.\n2nd. To a question:\u2014\nHave you ever been addicted to the excessive or intemperate use of alcoholic or other stimulants\u2014tobacco, opium, chloroform or other narcotics?\nThe applicant answered No.\nAnd 3rd, to a question:\u2014\nAre you now affected with any disease, disorder or ailment, or are you aware of any symptoms of any?\nHe answered:\u2014\nNo, except a cold.\nIn their statement of defence the defendants, by way of alleged breach of warranty contained in the answers to these two questions, say that\nThe said George Miller was, in fact, when he made said application, suffering from constitutional ailment of the lungs, and had suffered from hemorrhage\u2014was of dissipated habits, and addicted to the immoderate use of intoxicants, all of which he concealed and caused the medical examiner to conceal from the defendants.\n4th. To a question:\nHave you had any serious illness, local disease or personal injury?\nThe applicant answered:\u2014\nBroken leg in childhood\u2014confined to bed three days from a cold.\nBy way of a breach of warranty in this answer, the defendants allege\nThat it was untrue, and that prior to said application for insurance and in or about the spring of 1880, the said George Miller fell from a load of hay and seriously injured himself, for which he sued the corporation of the Township of Scarborough and they paid him several hundred dollars damages.\nThe defendants conclude their statement of defence with the following averment:\u2014\nThe mis-statements and suppressions of fact as aforesaid, and the irregular habits and the impaired state of health of the said George Miller were material to the risk undertaken by the defendants, and were material to be known by the defendants upon the negotiation for the said policy, and by reason of such misstatements and suppressions of facts the said policy was and is and should be declared to be null and void.\nThe contention of the appellants is, that however qualified the first sentence in the warranty may be by reason of the use of the words:\nTo the best of my knowledge and belief;\nThe subsequent words, namely:\nAnd I further agree that any mis-statements, or suppressions of facts made in the answers to the questions aforesaid, &c., &c., shall render null and void the policy,\nare absolute and have the effect of avoiding the policy if there be anything stated in the answers not absolutely according to the fact however ignorantly and unintentionally such erroneous statement should be made, or if anything should be omitted which ought to have been stated however ignorantly and unintentionally such omission should occur, notwithstanding in fact that the applicant might have believed all his answers to have been strictly true in every particular; the contention being that the qualification, that his answers were true according to the best of his knowledge and belief, is not imported into the latter sentence in the warranty. The question is raised as a ground of objection to the learned judge\u2019s charge in directing the jury, that if they thought there was anything in the answers which was calculated to mislead the defendants, and induce them to enter into the contract when they otherwise would not have done it, then their verdict should be for the defendants, but that if on the other hand they should think the answers reasonably fair and truthful to the best of the knowledge and belief of the man, their verdict should be for the plaintiffs.\nThe question before us is really reduced to the fourth of the above questions, for as to the other answers the defendants in their statement of defence allege them to have been wilfully false with intent to deceive the defendants, and there can be no objection successfully taken to a judge\u2019s charge which submits the issue to the jury in the manner and form in which it is framed by the defendants themselves. Moreover, there was, in truth, no evidence in support of the positive averments made by the defendants in their statement of defence, upon which averments they rested their contention, as to the absence of truth in the applicant\u2019s answers to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd questions above extracted. Now as to the answer to the 4th of the above questions. The question relates to matters which are more or less matters of opinion. A person may have been ill several times, indeed few persons grow up to manhood without being ill from several diseases to which childhood and youth are subject, and yet when grown up, be quite unable to say whether his illness, during his suffering under any of those diseases, was serious. So he may have received several personal injuries during his passage from childhood to manhood without knowing any of them to have been, and without any of them having, in fact, been serious. If the jury in the present case had been asked: Had the applicant as matter of fact received any serious personal injury? they should have been told that it would not be every personal injury which would be serious, and as regards the particular one pleaded by the defendants as having been received by the applicant, that if its effects had all passed away, leaving behind no trace injurious to health, it was not serious within the meaning of that term in the question. That it was not at all serious, the doctor who attended Miller while suffering under it gave most unequivocal testimony; it was, however, contended by the learned counsel for the defendants, that the jury should have been told that the applicant\u2019s own evidence in his action against the Township of Scarborough was conclusive evidence that the injury was a serious one within the meaning of that term in the question. No authority in support of this contention was cited, nor is there any foundation for it in reason, for whatever opinion the sufferer may have formed of the serious nature of the injury at the time it was received, his experience of four years more without suffering from any continuing ill effects, might well have satisfied him that it had not been serious, and that his first im- pression had been erroneous.\nNow upon this point the learned judge, in plain terms, drew the attention of the jury to the statement of the applicant, as made by him. four years\u2019 before his application for the policy in his action against the Township of Scarborough, and added:\u2014\nYou have also heard the evidence that was given by Dr. Lapsley as to the nature of the injury. It is true you have heard\u2014and Mr. Blake urged that point very strongly\u2014if a person makes a statement he cannot be surprised if that statement is used against him afterwards to its fullest extent. You have heard all the evidence as regards the injury.\nAnd he directed them to say whether the answers given, in view of such evidence, can be said to be fairly true to the best of the man\u2019s knowledge and belief, or was the answer a wilful misrepresentation. The question had, think, been better put in two questions, namely: 1st. Was the injury referred to in point of fact a serious injury in the sense involved in the question, namely, an injury the evil effects of which had not passed away and was injurious to the health of the applicant for insurance? If they should answer this question in the negative it would not be necessary to go further, but if in the affirmative then that they should say:\n2nd. Whether the injury was in that sense serious to the knowledge and belief of the applicant? If the jury had adopted, as it is most probable they did, the evidence of Dr. Lapsley, who attended the applicant for the injury, they must have answered the first question in the negative. But I am of opinion that the learned judge rightly construed the warranty in holding that the subsequent clause relied upon by the defendants was qualified equally as the preceding one. In so far as personal injury is concerned, the answer in substance is:\u2014\nTo the best of my knowledge and belief, I have had no serious personal injury other than a broken leg in childhood, Now this statement being qualified by the words \u201cto the best of my knowledge and belief\u201d can only be untrue, if the contrary to what is stated be the truth\u2014namely, that to his knowledge and belief he had received some other serious personal injury than that stated. Whether that was so or not was for the jury to say, and the learned judge left to them all the evidence from which they might infer what was the knowledge and belief of the applicant upon the point in question. The rule of construction is that the language of the warranty being framed by the defendants themselves the warranty must be read in the sense in which the person who was required to sign it should reasonably have understood it, and it is impossible to conceive that a person who was interrogated as to his knowledge and belief in respect of the matters enquired into could have understood that notwithstanding that he should answer the questions put to him truly, according to the utmost of his knowledge and belief, he should nevertheless forfeit his policy if through ignorance the facts as stated by him should not prove to be absolutely true, apart altogether from his knowledge and belief. However, the evidence of Dr. Lapsley warranted the jury in finding, and this, I apprehend, is what they intended to find by their verdict, that in point of fact the injury spoken of and relied upon by the defendants was not a serious one whatever might have been Miller\u2019s opinion of it at the time he received it. The appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Beaty, Hamilton & Cassels.\nSolicitors for respondents: McMichael, Hoskin and Ogden.\n[1] 14 Ont.

J. Ritchie C. J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nB.N. A. Act sec. 92 sub-sec. 5, ss. 109 & 146\u201447 Vic. ch. 14 sec. 2 (B.C.)\u2014Provincial public lands\u2014transfer of to Dominion of Canada\u2014Effect of\u2014Precious metals\u2014Claim of Dominion Government to.\nBy section 11 of the Order in Council passed in virtue of sec. 146 of the B. N. A. act, under which British Columbia was admitted into the Union it was provided as follows: \u2014\nAnd the Government of British Columbia agree to convey to the Dominion Government, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway, (C. P. R.) a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout its entire length in British Columbia, not to exceed however twenty (20) miles on each side of the said line, as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands of the North-West Territories and the Province of Manitoba.\nBy 47 Vic. ch. 14 sec. 2 (B. C.) it was enacted as follows:\u2014From and after the passing of this act there shall be, and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, in trust, to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands along the line of railway before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located to a width of twenty miles on each side of the said line, as provided in the Order in Council, sec. 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into confederation.\nA controversy having arisen in respect of the ownership of the precious metals in and under the lands so conveyed, the Exchequer Court, upon consent and without argument, gave judgment in favor of the Dominion Government. On appeal to the Supreme Court:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, that under the order in council admitting British Columbia into confederation and the statutes transferring the public lands described therein, the precious mettais in, upon, and under such public lands are now vested in the crown as represented by the Dominion Government.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court rendered in favor of the respondent upon a stated case between the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of British Columbia. The stated case was as follows:\u2014\n\"The Attorney General of Canada alleges, and\n\"The Attorney General of British Columbia denies:\n\"That the precious metals in, upon and under the \"public lands mentioned in section 2 of the act of the \"Legislature of British Columbia, 47 Vic. ch. 14, intituled, \"'An Act relating to the Island Railway, the \"Graving Dock and Railway Lands of the Province,' \"are vested in the crown as represented by the Government \"of Canada, and not as represented by the \"Government of British Columbia.\n\"A controversy having arisen in respect of the \"premises, it is submitted for the decision of the said \"court pursuant to the provisions of 'The Supreme \"and Exchequer Court Act,' and the act of the Legislature \"of British Columbia, 45 Vic. ch. 2, intituled, \"'An Act to amend the act respecting the Supreme \"Court of Canada and the Exchequer Court of \"Canada.'\"\nThe judgment appealed from is as follows:\u2014\n\"The special case herein coming on to be heard before \"this court this day, in presence of counsel as well \"for the Attorney-General of Canada, as for the Attorney\" General of British Columbia, whereupon and upon \"reading the said special case, and hearing what was \"alleged by counsel aforesaid, this court did order and \"adjudge, that the precious metals in, upon and under \"the public lands mentioned in sec. 2 of the act of the \"Legislature of British Columbia, 47 Vic., ch. 14, intituled \"\"An Act relating to the Island Railway, \"the Graving Dock and Railway Lands of the Province \"\"are vested in the crown as represented by the \"Government of Canada, and not as represented by the \"Government of British Columbia.\"\nThe Orders in Council and statutes upon which the controversy arose are fully set out in the judgments hereinafter given.\nThe decision of the Exchequer Court was taken by consent and without argument, in order to facilitate the bringing of the case directly to the Supreme Court.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the appellant:\nThe object of the grant of these public lands was to enable the Dominion Government to assist the Canadian Pacific Railway; it was not for the purpose of handing them over as forming part of the territory over which the Dominion legislature exercise control as over the North-West Territories, but to aid in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n[TASCHEREAU J.\u2014If the lands had been granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., is it admitted the gold and silver mines would belong to British Columbia?]\nYes, that point is admitted. By section 10 of the terms of union, the provisions of the British North America Act are made applicable to British Columbia, as if it had been one of the Provinces originally united, and by section 146 of the British North America Act the terms of union have the same effect as if enacted by the Imperial Parliament.\nBy section 92 of the British North America Act, par. 5, the management and sale of the public lands of the Province, and of the timber and wood thereon, are preserved to the Province. So also, by sec. 109, it is distinctly enacted that \"all lands, mines, minerals \"and royalties belonging to the several Provinces \"... shall belong to the several Provinces \".. subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, \"and to any interest other than that of the Province \"in the same.\"\nWe contend, therefore, that the words \"public \"lands,\" in the terms of union, in the B. N. A. Act, and in the section under discussion, do not include mines or minerals; the words have their ordinary significance only, and are so dealt with in the B. N. A. Act, and as not including mines or minerals, or royalties. Where the latter are intended to be dealt with, apt and precise words are used so as to designate them as a subject matter wholly distinct from public lands.\nThe prerogative right of the crown to gold and silver found in mines will not pass under a grant from the crown unless by apt and precise words the intention of the crown be expressed that it shall pass, and the prerogative rights of the crown can be affected only by express words. The great case of Mines[1], followed by Woolly v. Attorney-General of Victoria[2], and cases there cited. See also Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[3] as to construction of sec. 109 of the British North America Act. Now, the Province, though it has conveyed this railway belt to the Dominion has not excised that tract of land from the Province; it remains part of the Provincial territory, subject to Provincial legislation. If it does not so remain, or if, in other words, the Dominion Government is to be treated in a better manner than an ordinary grantee from the crown, the argument carried to its legitimate conclusion would eliminate the railway belt from the boundaries of the Province. In the different land laws from time to time passed by the colony and the Province, provision has invariably been made in reservation of the right of free miners to enter sub modo upon lands alienated by the crown, and to mine therein for the precious metals. Vancouver Island Land Proclamation, 1862, sec. 32, No. 9, Appendix Revised Statues; Proclamation No. 15, Appendix, Revised Statutes, ss. 4 and 14; Pre-emption Consolidation Act, 1861, No. 21, Appendix Revised Statutes, ss. 16, 17 and 25; Land Ordinance, 1865, No. 24, Appendix, Revised Statutes, ss. 40 and 56,; Land Ordinance, 1870; No. 144, Revised Statutes, ss. 48 and 50; \"Land Act, 1875,\" ss. 80 and 81; \"Land Act, 1884,\" ss. 64 and 65. So also the colonial and Provincial mining laws have made similar provision. \"Gold Mining Ordinance, 1865,\" ss. 15 and 16; \"Gold Mining Ordinance, 1867,\" ss. 22 and 23; and \"Mineral Act, 1884,\" ss. 22 and 23. The Provincial land laws also authorize the taking of water from streams passing through private property for irrigating or manufacturing purposes, and prescribe that no person shall have the right to water, whether it flow naturally through or past his land or not, unless the right be recorded and exercised. These are Provincial laws applicable to all lands in the Province. Why is the Dominion not to be subject to them as regards the railway belt? The title paramount is in us. Lands both within and without the belt are subject to escheat to the Province and not to the Dominion\u2014for the belt is only conveyed to the Dominion in trust for railroad purposes; and when the Dominion, in furtherance of that trust, have sold the land it loses further interest therein. The purchaser holds it from the Province, and subject to its title paramount. Regina v. St. Catherines Milling Co.[4]. Section 13 of the terms of union provides that the Local Government shall, from time to time, convey to the Dominion Government, in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians, tracts of land of such extent as it has hitherto been the practice of the British Columbia Government to appropriate for that purpose.\nHere is an undertaking made with reference to a well-known policy, the establishment of reserves for Indians. But the British Columbia Government never reserved the minerals for the Indians, yet, consistently, the Dominion should contend that the word \"lands\" in this section mentioned also includes the precious metals.\nIt was because the railroad belt did not contain much land fit for settlement, and of that so fit much had been alienated by the Province, that the Legislature granted to the Dominion three and a half millions of acres of land in the Peace River country, mentioned in sec. 7 of the act referred to in the case.\nIn the same act there is, by sec. 3, a grant of lands on Vancouver Island to the Dominion, to aid in the construction of a line of railway from Esquimalt to Nanaimo. This grant is in express terms made to include all minerals, though it may be open to doubt whether the precious metals are included within the term \"minerals.\" This express grant of the minerals excludes the notion that under the grant of the mainland belt, in which no mention of them is made, they were intended to be included. This argument is fortified by reason of the whole of this act, 46 Vic cap. 14, having been arranged between the Dominion and the Province; vide Sir Alexander Campbell's report and the memorandum of arrangement between him and the Premier of the province, dated 20th August, 1883, set out in the report.\nThe judicious administration of the minerals would not produce revenue in excess of the cost of administration. Neither the mining laws of the province, nor the mining regulations of the Dominion, are calculated to produce more revenue than would be sufficient to cover the cost of administration; while, however, it is true that the more liberal the conditions are under which mining may be followed, the greater will be the number of persons engaged in that industry, with corresponding advantage indirectly to both the Dominion and the province.\nIt was not until the 8th of March, 1884, that the Dominion made any mining regulations (see p. 71, Orders in Council, Statutes of Canada, 1884). Most of those regulations are transcripts of the provincial mining laws, but in some particulars, notably in quartz claims, there is a great difference; and though it may be of no service to point out that the Provincial regulations are more conducive to the prosecution of mining industries than the Dominion, yet if the argument as to what is politic and convenient is to have any effect, it may be urged how extremely impolitic it would be to have a strip of land administered for mining purposes by one set of regulations and adjacent lands governed by another set. The limits of the 20-mile belt have not yet been ascertained, and miners have something else to do than to enquire whether a proposed location is to be governed by Dominion or Provincial legislation, or whether a mining claim is within or without the railroad belt.\nThe incongruity of such a dual system is more apparent when the Dominion regulations, 68-75, are considered. They profess to establish a court to determine mining disputes (involving, possibly, scores of thousands of dollars), when the constitution of such courts remains, under sec. 92 of the British North America Act, with the Province. Lastly, it is difficult to understand how the Dominion can receive the railway belt other than a quasi corporation, and for the purposes mentioned in the terms of union. The lands were provincial public lands vested in Her Majesty. They were transferred by the province without any words indicating the parting with any prerogative or sovereign incidents, and rights of escheat remain. The Queen cannot convey to herself, and no words are employed which even remotely suggest that Her Majesty's prerogative or sovereign rights in the railway belt or those general powers of legislation preserved to the province by section 92 of the British North America Act, have been transferred to the Dominion. The latter, it is submitted, could only have been done by an amendment to or modification of that act by the Imperial Parliament.\nBurbidge Q.C. for the respondent:\nThe conveyance to the Dominion Government by sec. 2 of 47 Vic. ch. 14 was of \"certain public lands\" not for the use of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, but \"to be appropriated as the Dominion Government \"may deem advisable,\" in other words to deal with them as they pleased. Mr. Campbell's report strengthens this view. British Columbia does not dispute that the Dominion Government is entitled to the base metals. The question on this appeal will have to be decided upon principle without reference to decided cases as there is no federal constitution similar to ours.\nIn the United States there is one case which can throw some light on this question. Moore v. Smaw[5] over ruling Hicks v. Bell[6]. The question is also discussed in Rogers on Mines and Minerals[7]. This is a question of title and not one of the relative powers of the Local Legislature and of the Dominion Parliament over the lands and minerals. It is possible such a question may arise, it was tried to put it as part of this case whether the mining regulations of British Columbia or of the Dominion should govern, but this was left out and we only want a decision upon the question of title.\nThe present case is not the case of a grant of land by the crown to a subject. The title to the land and to the minerals has at all times been in the crown; and the statute of British Columbia, 47 Vic. ch. 34, amounts to nothing more than a declaration that lands of which the crown theretofore was seized in the right of the Province of British Columbia, should thereafter remain vested in the crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada, and the interest in the Government of Canada would thereafter be as great as the interest of the government of British Columbia was before the passing of the act referred to.\nIn the grant of the lands in aid of the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway, the grant is stated to include all coal, coal oil, ores, stones, clay, marble, slate, mines, minerals and substances whatsoever thereupon, therein and thereunder.\nThe difference in the language used in the grants in the different cases, indicates that in the two cases of the Railway Belt and the Peace River lands it was the intention that the crown should stand seized thereof in as large an interest for the Government of Canada as that in which it had previously stood seized thereof for the Province of British Columbia; while in the case of the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway, in which the Government of Canada was simply a medium through which the lands would be transferred to the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway, it was not the intention to give the company any interest in the precious metals in the lands mentioned, and therefore the minerals which it was proposed to convey were enumerated, omitting the precious metals.\nIt is quite clear that none of the reasons on which \"The Great Case of Mines\" was decided can be urged in favor of the contention of British Columbia. It is therefore submitted that Her Majesty is now seized of the said lands in the right of the Dominion for an as large and the same estate as that of which she was formerly seized in the right of British Columbia, and that she does not stand seized thereof for the Dominion, subject to a sovereign or prerogative right of the Province of British Columbia in the precious metals.\nThe learned counsel cited and relied on Blanchard & Weeks on Mines and Minerals[8]; Rogers on Mines and Minerals[9]; Bainbridge on Mines and Minerals[10]; Chitty on Prerogatives of the Crown[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014By the 11th paragraph of the Order in Council, under which British Columbia was admitted into the union, it is provided:\u2014\nAnd the Government of British Columbia agree to convey to the Dominion Government, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway, a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout its entire length of British Columbia (not to exceed, however, twenty (20) miles on each side of the said line) as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands of the North-West Territories and the Province of Manitoba: Provided that the quantity of land which may be held under pre-emption right or by crown grant within the limits of the tract of land in British Columbia, to be so conveyed to the Dominion Government, shall be made good to the Dominion from contiguous public lands; and provided further, that until the commencement, within two years, as aforesaid, from the date of the Union, of the construction of the said railway, the Government of British Columbia shall not sell or alienate any further portions of the public lands of British Columbia in any other way than under right of pre-emption requiring actual residence of the pre-emptor on the land claimed by him. In consideration of the land to be so conveyed in aid of the construction of the said railway, the Dominion Government agree to pay to British Columbia, from the date of the Union, the sum of $100,000 per annum, in half-yearly payments in advance.\nOn the 8th of May, 1880, the Legislature of British Columbia passed the following statute:\u2014\nAn act to authorize the grant of certain public lands on the mainland of British Columbia to the Government of the Dominion of Canada for Canadian Pacific Railway purposes:\u2014\nHer Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. From and after the passing of this act, there shall be, and there is hereby, granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway line located between Burrard Inlet and Yellow Head summit, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway before mentioned (not to exceed twenty miles on each side of the said line), as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion from the public lands of the North West Territories and the Province of Manitoba, as provided in the order in council, section 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into confederation. The land intended to be hereby conveyed is more particularly described in a despatch to the Lieutenant Governor from the Honourable the Secretary of State, dated the 31st day of May, 1878, as a tract of land lying along the line of said railway, beginning at English Bay or Burrard Inlet and following the Fraser River to Lytton; thence by the valley of the River Thompson to Kamloops; thence up the valley of the North Thompson, passing near to Lake Albreda and Cranberry, to T\u00eate Jaune Cache; thence up the valley of the Fraser River to the summit of Yellow Head, or boundary between British Columbia and the North West Territories, and is also defined on a plan accompanying a further despatch to the Lieutenant Governor from the Secretary of State, dated the 23rd day of September, 1878. The grant of the said land shall be subject otherwise to the conditions contained in the said 11th section of the terms of union.\n2. This act shall not affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed. 3. This act may be cited as \"An Act to grant public lands on the mainland to the Dominion in aid of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 1880.\"\nIn August, 1883, the Hon. Sir Alexander Campbell, Minister of Justice, visited British Columbia, and adjusted with the Provincial Government certain matters in difference between the two Governments, which adjustment led to the passage of the Provincial statute referred to in the case.\nThe following is a copy of the statute:\u2014\n47 Vic. ch. 14. An act relating to the Island Railway, the Graving Dock, and Railway Lands of the province.\n[19th December, 1883.]\nWHEREAS negotiations between the Governments of Canada and British Columbia have been recently pending, relative to delays in the commencement and construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and relative to the Island Railway, the Graving Dock, and the Railway lands of the province.\nAnd whereas, for the purpose of settling all existing disputes and difficulties between the two governments, it hath been agreed as follows:\u2014\nThe agreement is then set out at length and the act proceeds:\u2014\nTherefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. The hereinbefore recited agreement shall be and is hereby ratified and adopted.\n2. Section 1 of the Act of the Legislature of British Columbia, No. 11 of 1880, intituled \"An act to authorize the grant of certain public lands on the mainland of British Columbia to the Government of the Dominion of Canada for Canadian Pacific Railway purposes,\" is hereby amended so as to read as follows:\u2014\nFrom and after the passing of this act there shall be, and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, in trust, to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands along the line of railway before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located, to a width of 20 miles on each side of the said line, as provided in the Order in Council, sec. 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into Confederation; but nothing in this section contained shall prejudice the right of the province to receive and be paid by the Dominion Government the sum of $100,000 per annum, in half yearly payments in advance, in consideration of the lands so conveyed, as provided in sec. 11 of the Terms of Union; provided always, that the line of railway before referred to shall be one continuous line of railway only, connecting the seaboard of British Columbia with the Canadian Pacific Railway now under construction on the east of the Rocky Mountains.\n3. There is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, for the purpose of constructing, and to aid in the construction of a railway between Esquimalt and Nanaimo, and in trust to be appropriated as they may deem advisable (but save as is hereinafter excepted), all that piece or parcel of land situate in Vancouver Island, described as follows: \u2014\nThen follows a description of the land and in addition No. 7:\u2014\n7. There is hereby granted to the Dominion Government three and a half million acres of land in that portion of the Peace River district of British Columbia lying east of the Rocky Mountains and adjoining the North West Territories of Canada, to be located by the Dominion in one rectangular block.\nOn the argument of this case it was not contended on the part of the Province of British Columbia that the lands mentioned in section 2 of the act of British Columbia, 47 Vic. ch. 14, did not pass to the Dominion government. The sole question raised and argued is, as to the right to the precious metals in, upon or under those lands,\nThe principle acted on in the construction of grants or conveyances to private persons, namely, that by a grant of land from the crown the precious metals would not pass unless the intention of the crown that they should pass was expressed in apt and precise words, is in no way, in my opinion, applicable to the present case. This is not to be looked upon as a transaction between the crown and a private individual, or to be governed by principles applicable to transfers between private parties. This was a statutory arrangement between the government of the Dominion and the government of British Columbia, in settlement of a constitutional question between the two governments, or rather, giving effect to, and carrying out, the constitutional compact under which British Columbia became part and parcel of the Dominion of Canada, and as a part of that arrangement the government of British Columbia relinquished to the Dominion of Canada, as represented by the Governor General, all right to certain public lands belonging to the crown, or to the Province of British Columbia as represented by the Lieutenant Governor; it was a statutory transfer or relinquishment by the Province of British Columbia of the right of that province in or to such public lands to the Dominion of Canada, to be managed, controlled and dealt with by the Dominion government in as full and ample a manner as the provincial government could have done, had no such act been passed, and, in my opinion, having the same force and effect as if the British North America Act, instead of declaring that the several provinces should retain all their respective public property, &c., and that all lands belonging to the several provinces should continue to belong to the several provinces, there had been engrafted thereon an exception of certain portions of such public lands which should belong to the Dominion government. This, it seems to me, is just what the legislature of British Columbia intended to do and did do. There was no necessity for any grant or conveyance; in fact there could be no grant, or conveyance from the crown to the crown. The title to the land was never out of the crown, but was in the crown as represented by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia; and when the Legislature of British Columbia granted to the Dominion of Canada the interest the Province of British Columbia had in these public lands the right to deal with, and dispose of, the lands which belonged to the Province of British Columbia passed, by operation of the statute, to the use and control of the Dominion government as represented by the Governor General, to be dealt with by the Dominion government in all respects as the Province of British Columbia could have done, the title to the lands, as I said before, continuing throughout in the crown, the disposal of the lands or the right of dealing with that title being simply transferred from the government of British Columbia to the government of the Dominion, and consequently whatever control over, or right or interest the Province of British Columbia had in, these lands when subject to the control of the government of British Columbia ceased by the legislation of British Columbia, and such control, rights and interest were thereby transferred to the government of Canada in as full and ample a manner as they had been held and enjoyed by the Province of British Columbia.\nThe only reservation or limitation on the Dominion Government in the appropriation of public lands along the line of railway is to be found in the second section of the act of British Columbia, passed on the 8th of May, 1880, which provides that \"this act shall not \"affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect \"to common or public highways existing at the date \"thereof within the limits of the lands hereby intended \"to be conveyed.\" Beyond this I can discover no exception or reservation, narrowing or limiting the right of the crown, as represented by the Dominion Government, from that possessed by the Government of British Columbia as representing the crown previous to the transfer, and therefore, in my opinion, the prerogative rights of the crown in such public lands simply continued in the crown as represented by the Dominion of Canada instead of in the crown as represented by the Government of British Columbia.\nIf we look at the negotiations which preceded the final arrangement as set out in the act it will, I think, appear tolerably clear, as a matter of fact, that it was the intention of the Government of British Columbia that the mines should pass to and be under the control of the 'Dominion Government. This appears to me to be indicated in the British Columbia minute of council, dated 10th February, 1883, and transmitted to the Government of Canada on the same day. The council having had under consideration the subject of the dry dock, railway lands and the Island railway, reported, after dealing with the dry dock question and after discussing the Island railway question and affirming the obligation of the Dominion Government to build it as a part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the committee proceeded to discuss the subject of the railway lands of British Columbia, and the report inter alia, says:\u2014\nThat the committee by an order in council of 4th May, 1880, stated that in the event of railway work being actively prosecuted the application of the Dominion government through Mr. Trutch contained in Mr. Trutch's letter of the 14th April, 1880, should receive a liberal consideration, and suggested that the lands which might be considered valueless for agricultural or economic purposes should' be defined, and that the Dominion government should indicate the lands which might be desired in lieu of the valueless lands, and to state how the Dominion government proposed to deal with them. That Mr. Trutch replied to this order by a letter dated 8th May, 1880, to which no reply appears to have been given.\nIt is admitted that a very considerable portion of the lands included in the railway belt, and of the lands contiguous to those lands which have been dealt with by the province, consist of impassable mountains and rocky lands useless for agricultural purposes.\nThe committee feel satisfied that a settlement of this question will conduce to the best interests of the province and enable the country to settle up.\nAnd the committee go on to say:\u2014\nThat the land on the east coast of Vancouver Island has been continuously withheld from settlement since July, 1873, up to the present time, and the development of that fertile tract of country abounding in mineral wealth has been retarded to an incalculable extent, and the commercial and industrial interests of an important section of the province have been prejudicially affected to a serious degree.\nThe committee therefore recommend as a basis of settlement between the Governments of the Dominion and the province of the railway and railway lands question, that the Dominion Government be urgently requested to carry out its obligation to the province by commencing at the earliest possible period the construction of the Island Railway, and complete the same with all practicable despatch; or by giving to the province such fair compensation for failure to build such Island railway as will enable the government of the province to build it as a provincial work and open the east coast lands for settlement and that the Dominion Government be earnestly requested to take over the Graving Dock at Esquimalt, upon such terms as shall recoup and relieve the province of all expense in respect thereof, and to complete and operate it as a Federal work, or as a joint Imperial and Dominion work, and the committee further recommend that in lieu of any expensive and dilatory method of ascertaining the exact acreage of lands alienated within the railway belt and otherwise rendered unavailable, there be set apart for the use of the Dominion, a tract of land of 2,000,000 acres in extent to be taken up in blocks of not less than 500,000 acres in such localities on the main land as may be agreed upon, the land to be taken up and defined within two years, and that it be one of the conditions that the Dominion Government in dealing with lands in this province shall establish a land system equally as liberal both as to mining and agricultural industries, as that in force in this province at the present time, and that no delay take place in throwing open the land for settlement.\nThe committee advise that the recommendations be approved, and that a copy be forwarded to the Honorable Secretary of State for Canada.\nWhat is the meaning of this last paragraph if it is not that the Government of British Columbia knew and intended that, in dealing with the public lands in the province, the Dominion Government was to have the control of such public lands including both mining and agricultural industries connected therewith? And how could they deal with the mining industries if no interest in, or control over, the mines passed to the Dominion Government? That apart from this when the public lands of the province, set apart by the Legislation of the Province of British Columbia for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, ceased by such Legislation to belong to that province that province necessarily ceased to have any interest in the mines under these lands, because the province only obtained an interest in the mines by reason of their being part and parcel of the public lands of the province; when therefore, the public lands in question ceased to be the public lands of the province the mines forming part of such public lands, as a necessary consequence, ceased to belong to the province. No doubt the mines might have been reserved to the province, but such not having been the case they passed to the Dominion as part and parcel of the public lands granted to them by the Province of British Columbia.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014La question soulev\u00e9e en cette cause est de savoir \u00e0 qui du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ou du gouvernement local de la Colombie-Anglaise appartient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des mines de m\u00e9taux pr\u00e9cieux dans les terrains octroy\u00e9s par le dernier gouvernement au premier, pour la construction du chemin de fer Pacifique du Canada.\nS'il s'agissait ici des droits de la Couronne aux mines d'or et d'argent dans une concession faite \u00e0 un particulier, la question ne souffrirait aucune difficult\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e depuis longtemps par les d\u00e9cisions, en Angleterre, qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant loi \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et particuli\u00e8rement par celle de The Great Case of Mines[12] Voir la m\u00eame cause discut\u00e9e dans l'\u00e9dition de 1878 par Brown, du trait\u00e9 de Law of Mines and Minerals[13] de Bainbridge.\nDans une cause de Wooley v. The Attorney General[14] of Victoria, Sir James W. Colville en rendant le jugement s'est exprim\u00e9 ainsi: \u2014\nNow, whatever may be the reasons assigned in the case of Plowden for the rule thereby established, and whether they approve themselves or not to modern minds, it is perfectly clear that ever since that decision it has been settled law in England that the prerogative right of the crown to gold and silver found in mines will not pass under a grant of land from the crown, unless by apt and precise words the intention of the crown be expressed that it shall pass\nLa loi anglaise \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard fait indubitablement partie de la loi de la Colombie. Ainsi le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans ce jugement \"that the prerogative right \"of the crown to gold and silver found in mines will \"not pass under grant of land from the crown, unless \"by apt and precise words the intention of the crown \"be expressed that it shall pass,\" doit recevoir ici son application.\nDans le fait que la concession n'est pas faite \u00e0 un particulier, mais en apparence \u00e0 la. Couronne par la Couronne, on a cru trouver un argument qui donne la solution de la question. En effet, a-t-on dit, il serait absurde que Sa Majest\u00e9 p\u00fbt traiter ou contracter avec elle-m\u00eame. Le savant conseil de l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que Sa Majest\u00e9 \u00e9tant toujours investie du droit aux terres et aux mines, la 47 Vict. ch. 14 n'a pas d'autre effet que celui de d\u00e9clarer que les terres dont la Couronne \u00e9tait jusqu'alors investie au nom de la Colombie-Anglaise seraient \u00e0 l'avenir investies (vested) dans la Couronne pour la Puissance du Canada. C'est tout simplement \u00e9noncer la question soumise et non la r\u00e9soudre.\nDans notre syst\u00e8me de gouvernement Sa Majest\u00e9, comme chef de l'ex\u00e9cutif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provincial, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme pr\u00e9sente dans chaque gouvernement o\u00f9 elle poss\u00e8de les droits et pr\u00e9rogatives qui lui sont attribu\u00e9s par l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord. Comme chef de ces divers gouvernements elleme doit y \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e non comme pr\u00e9sente en sa qualit\u00e9 de Reine de l'Empire Britannique, mais seulement comme la Reine, n'exercant que les droits et pr\u00e9rogatives qui lui sont attribu\u00e9s par les lois et la constitution de chaque gouvernement. Il n'est pas vrai en pratique de dire que Sa Majest\u00e9, comme chef de l'ex\u00e9cutif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, est la m\u00eame personnalit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale que Sa Majest\u00e9 comme chef du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif provincial, car on ne peut pas la s\u00e9parer des attributions \"particuli\u00e8res et souvent contradictoires que la constitution lui reconna\u00eet. Partant il n'y a aucune anomalie et encore moins d'absurdit\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que la Reine, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'ex\u00e9cutif provincial de la Colombie, puisse traiter ou contracter avec la Reine repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'ex\u00e9cutif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, sans que, par ce fait, aucun de ces gouvernements ne soit expos\u00e9 \u00e0 perdre ou gagner un avantage quelconque. Ils ne seront li\u00e9s que par les conventions arr\u00eat\u00e9es entre eux. Elle les repr\u00e9sente tous deux dans les limites de leurs pouvoirs respectifs, et dans le fait ce sont les deux gouvernements qui traitent ensemble avec l'assentiment de Sa Majest\u00e9.\nLa proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale absolue et sans restriction \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le savant conseil de l'intim\u00e9, que \"The \"title to land and to the minerals has at all times been \"in the crown,\" pourrait \u00eatre vraie s'il ne s'agissait que de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 en vertu de sa pr\u00e9rogative royale, mais appliqu\u00e9e aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont Sa Majest\u00e9 est investie en vertu d'un statut provincial, elle n'est vraie qu'avec la modification des restrictions apport\u00e9es par le statut ou par celles que pourrait y mettre la l\u00e9gislation de la province.\nPar la sec. 92, ss. 5, de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, la vente et l'administration des terres publiques et des bois et for\u00eats appartiennent \u00e0 la province. La section 109 va plus loin et d\u00e9clare que non-seulement les terres, mais que les mines et min\u00e9raux et royaut\u00e9s appartiendront aussi aux provinces. Le langage de ces sections fait voir que le l\u00e9gislateur ne pensait pas que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des mines aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tacitement transf\u00e9r\u00e9e avec le sol, puisqu'il en a fait le sujet d'une disposition \u00e0 part. En outre par la d\u00e9cision de cette cour, confirm\u00e9e par le Conseil priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Mercer v. la Reine[15], l'expression royaut\u00e9 dans la section 109 a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme comprenant les pr\u00e9rogatives royales au sujet de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Les mines d'or et d'argent appartiennent donc par l'acte constitutionnel aux provinces dont les gouvernements respectifs ont seuls le droit d'exercer la pr\u00e9rogative royale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cette pr\u00e9rogative ne peut en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9e ou modifi\u00e9e que par un acte du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif ou ex\u00e9cutif des gouvernements provinciaux ali\u00e9nant en termes pr\u00e9cis et sp\u00e9ciaux cette pr\u00e9rogative.\nDans le trait\u00e9 intervenu entre les deux gouvernements au sujet de l'entr\u00e9e de la Colombie dans la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Canadienne, ou dans la l\u00e9gislation respective des deux gouvernements au sujet de l'octroi des terres pour aider \u00e0 la construction du chemin de fer du Pacifique, trouve-t-on quelque dispositions ou expressions comportant une cession expresse des mines d'or et d'argent, en m\u00eame temps que les terres. Pour s'en assurer il est n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux principales transactions des deux gouvernements \u00e0 ce sujet.\nPar la sec. 11 des conditions arr\u00eat\u00e9es par les deux gouvernements, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral s'est oblig\u00e9, dans deux ans de l'acte d'union, \u00e0 faire commencer la construction du chemin de fer du Pacifique qui \u00e9tait une des conditions mises par la Colombie \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e dans la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9 le gouvernement de la Colombie, pour aider \u00e0 la construction de ce chemin, s'obligeait dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nTo convey to the Dominion Government, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway, a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway, throughout its entire length in British Columbia, not to exceed, however, twenty (20) miles on each side of said line, as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands in the North-West Territories and the Province of Manitoba: Provided, that the quantity of land which may be held under pre-emption right or by crown grant within the limits of the tract of land in British Columbia to be so conveyed to the Dominion Government shall be made good to the Dominion from contiguous public lands; and, provided further, that until the commencement, within two years as aforesaid from the date of the union, of the construction of the said railway, the Government of British Columbia shall not sell or alienate any further portions of the public lands of British Columbia in any other way than under right of preemption, requiring actual residence of the pre-emptor on the land claimed by him. In consideration of the land to be so conveyed in aid of the construction of the said railway, the Dominion Government agree to pay to British Columbia, from the date of union, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars per annum, in half-yearly payments in advance.\nPlus tard, la l\u00e9gislature de la Colombie, pour donner effet \u00e0 son obligation mentionn\u00e9e dans la sec. 11 ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, a pass\u00e9 l'acte 43 Vict. ch. 11, contenant la disposition suivante:\u2014\nThe lands being granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway line located between Burrard Inlet and Yellow Head Summit, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable.\nPar la 2e sec. de l'acte 47 Vict. ch. 14, de la Colombie, il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi qu'il suit:\u2014\nFrom and after the passing of this Act there shall be, and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, in trust, to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands along the line of the railway before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located, to a width of twenty miles on each side of the said line, as provided in the Order in Council, section 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into Confederation.\nLe proviso qui termine cette section ne peut aucunement affecter la question sous consid\u00e9ration.\nPar ce dernier acte, sec. 3, il est aussi accord\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral comme aide \u00e0 la construction du chemin de fer d'Esquimalt \u00e0 Nanaimo, en fid\u00e9icommis, une certaine \u00e9tendue de terre y d\u00e9crite avec cette d\u00e9claration:\u2014\nAnd including all coal, coal oil, ores, stones, clay, marble, slate, mines, minerals and substances whatsoever thereupon, therein and thereunder. La sec. 7 en accorde une antre dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nThere is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, three and a half million acres of land in that portion of the Peace River District of British Columbia lying east of the Rocky Mountains and adjoining the North-West Territory of Canada, to be located by the Dominion in one rectangular block.\nCette l\u00e9gislation a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en vertu de l'acte 47 Vict. ch. 6. La sec. 11 de cet acte pourvoit \u00e0 l'administration des terres dans cette r\u00e9gion le long de la ligne du chemin de fer, et la sec. 12 \u00e0 celle des terres dans la r\u00e9gion de la Rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 la Faix.\nA part de la correspondance entre les deux gouvernements au sujet des retards et des difficult\u00e9s survenus dans l'ex\u00e9cution des conditions de la sec. 11 du trait\u00e9, tels sont les principaux actes l\u00e9gislatifs \u00e0 consulter pour d\u00e9finir la nature de l'octroi fait par le gouvernement de la Colombie au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nLa Colombie faisant de la construction du chemin de fer du Pacifique une des principales conditions de son entr\u00e9e dans la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, a fait, comme c'est assez l'usage, des concessions de terres, en fid\u00e9icommis, au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour en assurer la construction. Bien que cette condition se trouve dans un trait\u00e9 o\u00f9 il s'agissait de grands int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques et gouvernementaux, il n'en est pas moins \u00e9vident que la transaction au sujet des terres n'est que la cession d'un avantage mat\u00e9riel pour assurer la construction du chemin de fer et qu'elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s les termes qui ont \u00e9tabli ce contrat, sans \u00e9gard aux autres parties de ce trait\u00e9 qui ont rapport aux arrangements politiques entre les deux gouvernements. On ne peut en conclure, comme le fait le savant conseil de l'intim\u00e9, que le statut de la Colombie 47 Vict. ch. 14 n'est au fond qu'une d\u00e9claration que les terres, dont la Couronne \u00e9tait saisie pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la Colombie, seraient \u00e0 l'avenir investies dans la Couronne pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce dernier gouvernement serait \u00e0 l'avenir, aussi grand que celui de la Colombie apr\u00e8s la passation de cet acte. Ceci n'est qu'une induction qu'aucune expression du statut ne peut justifier. Il faut donner aux termes employ\u00e9s toute leur signification l\u00e9gale et rien de plus. L'id\u00e9e qu'un gouvernement s'est trouv\u00e9 substitu\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement aux droits de l'autre dans les terres octroy\u00e9es n'est qu'une pure supposition que repousse les expressions employ\u00e9es pour faire la concession.\nDans le trait\u00e9, sec. 11, l'obligation est \"to convey to \"Dominion Government, &c., &c., a similar extent of \"public lands,\" dans l'acte 43 Vict. ch. 11, \"lands being \"granted to the Dominion for the purpose, &c., &c.,\" dans la 47e Vict. ch. 14 (Colombie) sec. 2, \"there shall \"be, and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, \"in trust, &c., &c., to be appropriated as the \"Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public \"lands along the line of the railway, &c., &c.\" Dans la sec. 7 de ce dernier acte les expressions sont: \"There is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, three and a half million acres of land, &c., &c.\" On voit que dans toutes les expressions employ\u00e9es pour faire l'octroi, il n'en est pas une seule qui comporte l'id\u00e9e qu'il y ait autre chose que la terre qui soit octroy\u00e9e. Toutes les expressions sont claires, pr\u00e9cises, n'accordant qu'une seule chose, la terre, et ne laissent aucune place au doute. D'apr\u00e8s le principe reconnu du droit anglais que l'octroi de la terre n'entra\u00eene pas la concession de la pr\u00e9rogative royale au sujet des mines, il n'y a donc pas eu dans le cas pr\u00e9sent d'octroi des mines. Ce principe doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des octrois faits par statut, de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 ceux faits administrativement \u00e0 des particuliers, car il est de principe que la pr\u00e9rogative royale n'est jamais affect\u00e9e par un statut, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'en soit fait une mention expresse. Dans tous les statuts cit\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'exception d'un, et dans tous les documents officiels concernant cette affaire, on ne trouve rien qui puisse justifier la pr\u00e9tention que la pr\u00e9rogative royale devait ou pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e par les octrois de terres. Deux principes indiscutables s'opposent donc \u00e0 ce que les mines de m\u00e9taux pr\u00e9cieux soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme ayant pass\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral,\u2014d'abord, le principe que l'octroi de terres n'entra\u00eene jamais la pr\u00e9rogative au sujet des mines, ensuite, que la pr\u00e9rogative ne peut jamais \u00eatre affect\u00e9e que par une loi qui en fait mention sp\u00e9ciale.\nJ'ai dit qu'il n'y avait qu'une seule exception dans le langage employ\u00e9 par les divers statuts, c'est celle que l'on trouve dans la sec. 3 de la 47 Vic. ch. 14 (Colombie), au sujet de l'octroi de terres pour le chemin de fer d'Esquimalt \u00e0 Nanaimo, elle est en ces termes:\u2014\nAnd including all coal, coal oil, ores, stones, clay, marble, slate; mines, minerals, and substances whatever thereupon, therein and thereunder.\nSi l'on pouvait interpr\u00e9ter ces termes comme suffisants pour op\u00e9rer la concession des mines d'or et d'argent, cela prouverait du moins que la l\u00e9gislature savait en faire la diff\u00e9rence, et que lorsqu'elle voulait les conc\u00e9der elle employait un langage suffisant \u00e0 cet effet. Cette exception ne ferait que confirmer la r\u00e8gle que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des mines ne peut \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e que par une concession sp\u00e9ciale. Mais elle n'a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par cette disposition.\nSi l'on peut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la correspondance qui a amen\u00e9 un arrangement final entre les deux gouvernements, on acquerra la conviction que l'id\u00e9e de r\u00e9clamer les mines d'or et d'argent est de date r\u00e9cente, et qu'elle n'existait pas lors des n\u00e9gociations qui ont eu lieu au sujet des divers octrois en question. Le but, en effet, \u00e9tait d'obtenir une aide efficace pour la construction du chemin et pour cela on comptait sur des terres d'une valeur r\u00e9elle, et non pas sur une valeur al\u00e9atoire comme celle des mines. Aussi voit-on dans divers documents cit\u00e9s qu'il y est toujours question de terres available for farming or other purposes. Dans la lettre de M. Trutch, agent du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aupr\u00e8s du gouvernement de la Colombie, les terres dont il est question sont toujours d\u00e9crites comme available for farming or other valuable purpose. Cette derni\u00e8re qualification or other valuable purposes ne peut pas comprendre les mines d'or puisqu'il est de principe qu'elles ne sont transf\u00e9r\u00e9es que par des expressions expresses, mais les mots other valuable purposes qui doivent recevoir leur application pourraient sans doute comprendre les terres favorables \u00e0 l'exploitation des bois, les mines de charbon, et carri\u00e8res, etc., et ranches, mais non les mines d'or et d'argent. Dans le ch. 14 de l'acte de 1883, mettant \u00e0 la disposition des colons des terres dans l'\u00eele de Vancouver, il est fait une distinction entre les terrains miniers, coal and other minerals, et les terres \u00e0 bois. Ces terrains pourraient aussi, sans doute, \u00eatre compris dans les termes other valuable purposes. Quoi qu'il en soit, on ne trouve dans, aucune des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives sur ce sujet des expressions suffisantes pour op\u00e9rer le transport de la pr\u00e9rogative royale au sujet des mines de m\u00e9taux pr\u00e9cieux, et encore moins en trouve-t-on qui permettent de conclure que l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative et ex\u00e9cutive de la Colombie dans les territoires o\u00f9 sont situ\u00e9es les terres octroy\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral par suite d'une transaction d'int\u00e9r\u00eats purement mat\u00e9riels, comme celle du subside au Pacifique. Pour op\u00e9rer un tel transfert du pouvoir politique il ne faudrait rien moins qu'un acte imp\u00e9rial modifiant les limites de la Colombie Anglaise telles que d\u00e9finies au moment de son entr\u00e9e dans la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne, et il n'en existe certainement pas.\nQuoique le jugement en cour d'Echiquier ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par moi, je suis tout de m\u00eame d'avis qu'il doit \u00eatre infirm\u00e9. Je dois ajouter que, du consentement des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sans audition, et purement par forme, afin de leur permettre de porter sans d\u00e9lai cette cause devant la cour Supr\u00eame. HENRY J.\u2014This case has been presented to obtain the decision of this court as to the title to gold, deposits of silver and other precious metals in lands in British Columbia known as the twenty mile belt on each side of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In the case of The Queen v. Farwell[16] and in four other cases tried before me at Victoria in 1886, I decided that the title to the lands comprising the belt in question was not vested in Her Majesty the Queen, and being still of that opinion I must necessarily decide that the deposits of gold, silver, and other precious metals are not vested in Her Majesty for the use and benefit of Canada, but in Her Majesty for the use and benefit of British Columbia. The case of The Queen v. Farwell appealed from my judgment to this court has been argued, and is now pending for judgment. In the special case therein my judgment will be found, and I refer to it for my reasons and conclusions in that case which govern the decision of this.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014There can be no doubt that the right of Her Majesty to the precious metals does not depend upon her being seized of the lands in which they are found, her right to them whether they be in her own lands or in the land of a subject is by the same title, namely, by prerogative royal in right of her crown, but such her title or the rule that the transfer of land, eo nomine, by grant from the crown to a subject, does not transfer to the grantee any interest in the precious metals which may be in the land so granted, has not, in my opinion, any application in the determination of the question arising in the present case. What was the intention of the parties to the contract under consideration is the question before us, and that must be gathered from the nature of the transaction and of the instruments in which the contract is contained and the circumstances under which and the parties between whom such instruments were framed.\nBy the 146 section of the British North America Act, it was enacted that it should be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of Her Majesty's most honorable Privy Council on addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the houses of the respective legislatures of the colonies or provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia, to admit those colonies or provinces or any of them into the union constituted by the act the Dominion of Canada, on such terms and conditions as are in the addresses expressed, and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of the British North America Act, and that the provisions of any order in council in that behalf should have effect as if they had been enacted by the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nThe effect of this enactment was, in my opinion, to constitute the Province of British Columbia, represented by its Legislative Council, an independent power to the extent of enabling it to negotiate a treaty with the Dominion of Canada, represented by the two Houses of the Parliament of Canada, as another independent power, and together to agree upon terms upon which the Province of British Columbia should be received into and become part of the Dominion of Canada, which treaty, if and when approved of and ratified by Her Majesty in her Privy Council, should have the force and effect of an act of the Imperial parliament.\nThe transaction thus authorized being of the nature of a treaty between these two independent bodies, the Province of British Columbia represented by its Legislative Council on the one part and the Dominion of Canada represented by the House of Commons and the Senate of Canada on the other; and Her Majesty being in no wise concerned in it, save as ratifying and approving the terms of the treaty when agreed upon by and between the parties interested, the case must be regarded not at all in the light of a grant of land by the crown to a subject, but in the light of a treaty between the two independent contracting parties upon the faith of which alone the Province of British Columbia was received into and became part of the Dominion of Canada, and being given by the British North America Act the force of an act of parliament. The addresses of the Legislature of British Columbia and of the House of Commons and Senate of Canada respectively to Her Majesty in pursuance of the above section of the British North America Act show the proceedings taken by the province and the dominion respectively for the purpose of negotiating a treaty of union.\nThe address of the Legislative Council of British Columbia is as follows:\u2014\nTo the Queen's most excellent Majesty, most gracious Sovereign:\nWe, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the members of the Legislative Council of British Columbia in Council assembled, humbly approach your Majesty for the purpose of representing that during the last session of the Legislative Council the subject of the admission of the colony of British Columbia into the union or Dominion of Canada was taken into consideration, and a resolution on the subject was agreed to embodying the terms upon which it was proposed that this colony should enter the union.\nThat after the close of the session delegates were sent by the government of this colony to Canada to confer with the government of the Dominion with respect to the admission of British Columbia into the union upon the terms proposed.\nThat after considerable discussion by the delegates with the members of the government of the Dominion of Canada the terms and conditions hereinafter specified were adopted by a committee of the Privy Council of Canada and were by them reported to the Governor General for his approval.\nThat such terms were communicated to the government of this colony by the Governor General of Canada in a despatch dated July 7th, 1870, and are as follows:\u2014\n1. Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of British Columbia existing at the time of the union.\nThe 2nd to the 10th paragraphs inclusive it is not necessary to set out.\n11. The government of the Dominion undertake to secure the commencement simultaneously within two years from the date of the union, of the construction of a railway from the Pacific towards the Rocky Mountains, and from such point as may be selected east of the Rocky Mountains towards the Pacific to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada, and further to secure the completion of such railway within ten years from the date of the union.\nAnd the government of British Columbia agree to convey to the Dominion government, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout its entire length in British Columbia not to exceed, however, twenty (20) miles on each side of the said line as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion government from the public lands in the North West Territory and the Province of Manitoba; Provided that the quantity of land which may be held under pre-emption right or by crown grant within the limits of the tract of land in British Columbia to be so conveyed to the Dominion government shall be made good to the Dominion from contiguous public lands; and provided further that until the commencement within two years as aforesaid from the date of the union, of the construction of the said railway, the government of British Columbia shall not sell or alienate any further portions of the public lands of British Columbia in any other way than under right of pre-emption requiring actual residence of the pre-emptor on the land claimed by him.\nIn consideration of the land to be so conveyed in aid of the construction of the said railway the Dominion government agree to pay British Columbia from the date of the union the sum of $100,000 per annum in half yearly payments in advance.\nThe 12th to the 14th paragraphs it is unnecessary to set out. The address then proceeds:\u2014\nThat such terms have proved generally acceptable to the people of this colony.\nThat this council is therefore willing to enter into union with the Dominion of Canada upon such terms, and humbly submits that under the circumstances it is expedient that the admission of this colony into such union as aforesaid should be effected at as early a date as may be found practicable under the provisions of the 146th section of the British North America Act, 1867.\nWe, therefore, humbly pray that your Majesty will be graciously pleased by and with the advice of your Majesty's most honourable Privy Council under the provisions of the 146th section of the British North America Act, 1867, to admit British Columbia into the union or Dominion of Canada on the basis of the terms and conditions offered to this colony by the government of the Dominion of Canada hereinbefore set forth.\nSimilar addresses having been presented to Her Majesty from the House of Commons and the Senate of Canada, Her Majesty was pleased by an order in council at the court at Windsor, dated the 16th May, 1871, to approve of the said terms and conditions, and it was thereby ordered and declared by Her Majesty by and with the advice of her Privy Council, that from and after the 20th day of July, 1871, the said colony of British Columbia should be admitted into and become part of the Dominion of Canada upon the terms and conditions set forth in the said addresses, copies of which are annexed to the said order in council.\nThis language of the 11th article of the treaty with reference to the transfer from British Columbia to the Dominion of Canada of this tract of land never could be literally complied with, that is to say that by no species of conveyance could the land be conveyed to the Dominion government as grantees thereof. That government, from the nature of the constitution of the Dominion, could not take lands by grant or otherwise, nor could it have the power of appropriation of the tract in question, otherwise than under the direction and control of the parliament of Canada. When, therefore, as part of the terms upon which British Columbia was received into the Dominion, it was agreed that a tract of the public lands of the Province of British Columbia should be conveyed in such manner as to be subjected to being appropriated as the Dominion government may deem advisable, what was intended plainly was, as it appears to me, that the beneficial interest which the province had in the particular tract of land as part of the public domain of the province should be divested, and that the tract, although still remaining within the Province of British Columbia, should be placed under the control of the Dominion parliament as part of the public property of the Dominion for the purpose of being appropriated by the Dominion government, in such manner as that government should deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the railway which that government had undertaken to construct, subject, however, to a payment for ever by the Dominion to the Provincial government of $100,000 per annum by half yearly payments in advance. That this was the view entertained by the Dominion government and parliament as to this provision of the treaty of union entered into by them with the Province of British Columbia is apparent from an act of the parliament of Canada passed in 1875, 38 Vic. ch. 51, of the passing of which act the Province of British Columbia must have become aware, by which it was enacted that the Dominion Land Acts of 1872 and 1874 and the several provisions thereof should be, and were thereby extended, and should apply to all lands to which the government of Canada were then, or should at any time become entitled, or which were or should be subject to the disposal of parliament, in the Province of British Columbia.\nIt is now contended on the part of British Columbia that the 11th article of the treaty of union does not cover, and was not intended to cover, the precious metals in the tract of land in question; and this contention is based wholly upon the rule applied to a grant of land, en nomino, by the crown to a subject, that under such a grant the precious metals do not pass. That rule, as I have already said, has not, in my opinion, any application to a contract of the nature of the treaty under consideration made between two independent powers of such constitutional character as are the Province of British Columbia and the Dominion of Canada. The question here is not between the crown and a subject, so that no question arises as to the prerogative rights of the crown. Indeed, if such a narrow construction should be put upon this treaty upon the faith of which British Columbia was received into the union, the chief benefit expected to accrue to the Dominion under the clause under consideration would be disappointed for as the Canada Pacific Railway through almost its whole extent within the Province of British Columbia passes through and across the two ranges of the Rocky Mountains, the lands on either side of which, except when the railway lies in the valleys of the mountain streams, are wholly unsuitable for agricultural purposes, and have little or no value other than that which consists in the precious metals which are believed to abound in them; if those metals should be regarded as excepted from the operation of the treaty, the exception would effectually deprive the Dominion Government of all benefit from the tract of land so declared to have been intended to be subjected to appropriation in such manner as the Dominion Government should deem advisable, and would make the 11th article of the treaty in so far as the Dominion in this tract is concerned quite illusory.\nThe contention of British Columbia is that the precious metals in the tract of land referred to in the 11th article are the property of the province, notwithstanding the treaty and that the search for them and all things relating to the prospecting for, and the opening and working of the mines are to be governed by the laws of British Columbia relating to gold mining, and for the benefit of the Provincial Government. It will be convenient here to refer to those laws, for the purpose of seeing what benefit from the tract in question would remain to be enjoyed by the Dominion after the exercise by the Provincial Government of the powers vested in them by the laws relating to gold mining if the precious metals in the tract in question be reserved as the property of the province.\nBy an act of the Provincial Legislature passed in 1867 to amend the land relating to gold mining, it is enacted: \"That the Governor of the Province may from time to time appoint such persons as he should think proper to be Chief Gold Commissioner and Gold Commissioners either for the whole province or any particular districts therein. That every gold commissioner upon payment of the sums in the act mentioned to the use of the province should deliver to any person over the age of 16 years applying for the same a certificate to be called a Free Miner's certificate entitling the person to whom it is given to all the rights and privileges by the act conferred on Free Miners. That such Free Miners certificate shall, at the request of the applicant be granted, and continue in force for one year or three years from the date thereof upon payment by such applicant to the use of the province of the sum of five dollars for one year and fifteen dollars for three years. That every free miner shall during the continuance of his certificate have the right to enter upon any of the waste lands of the crown not for the time being occupied by any other person; but in the event of such entry being made on lands already lawfully occupied for other than mining purposes, previous to entry free compensation shall be made to the occupant or owner for any loss or damage he may sustain by reason of any such entry, such compensation to be determined by the nearest stipendiary magistrate or gold commissioner with or without a jury of not less than five.\nThat no person shall be recognized as having any right or interest in, or to any mining claim or ditch or any of the gold therein unless he shall be, or in case of disputed ownership unless he shall have been at the time of the dispute arising, a free miner.\nThat all claims must be accorded annually, but any free miner shall upon application be entitled to record his claim for a period of two or more years upon payment of the sum of two dollars and fifty cents for each year included in such record. That the interest which a miner has in a claim shall be deemed to be a chattel interest equivalent to a lease for such period, as the same may have been recorded renewable at the end thereof.\nThat it shall be lawful for the Gold Commissioner upon being so requested to mark out for business purposes or gardens, on or near any mining ground, a plot of ground of such size as he shall deem advisable subject, however, to all the existing rights of free miners, then lawfully holding such mining ground, and any buildings erected or improvements made thereon for any such purpose, shall in every such case be erected and made at the risk of the person erecting and making the same; and they shall not be entitled to any compensation for damage done thereto by such free miners so entitled in working their claims bon\u00e2 fide.\nThat it shall also be lawful for the Gold Commissioner upon being so requested, to mark out for business purposes or gardens on or near any mining ground not previously pre-empted a plot of land of such size as he shall deem advisable to be held, subject to all the rights of free miners to enter upon and use such lands for mining purposes upon reasonable notice to quit being given to the occupier, such notice to be subject to the approval of the Gold Commissioner; and further upon due compensation for any crops thereon, and for the buildings and improvements erected on such plots, such compensation to be assessed by the Gold Commissioner previous to entry, with or without a jury of not less than three rand that a monthly rent of five dollars shall in every such case be payable by the grantees of such plot or their assigns to the Gold Commissioners.\nThat every registered Free Miner shall be entitled to the use of so much of the water naturally flowing through or past his claim, and not already lawfully appropriated, as shall, in the opinion of the Gold Commissioner, be necessary for the due working thereof. That the size of claims should be as follows: For \"Bar Diggings\" a strip of land 100 feet wide at high water mark and, thence, extending into the river to its lowest water level.\nFor \"Dry Diggings\" 100 feet square. \"Creek Claims\" one hundred feet long measured in the direction of the general course of the stream and extending in width from base to base of the hill on each side Where the bed of the stream or valley is more than 300 feet in width each claim shall be only 50 feet in length, extending 600 feet in width; when the valley is not 100 feet wide the claims shall be 100 feet square.\n\"Bench Claims\" shall be 100 feet square.\nThe Gold Commisssoner shall have authority in cases where benches are narrow to mark the claims in such manner as he shall think fit, so as to include an adequate claim.\nEvery claim situated on the face of any hill and fronting on any natural stream or ravine shall have a base line or frontage of 100 feet, drawn parallel to the main direction thereof. Parallel lines drawn from each end of the base line, at right angles thereto, and running to the summit of the hill shall constitute the side lines thereof. The whole area included within such boundary lines shall form a \"Hill Claim.\"\nFor the more convenient working of back claims, or benches or slopes, it was enacted that the Gold Commissioner may, upon application made to him, permit the owners thereof to drive a tunnel through the claim fronting on any creek, ravine or water course and impose such terms and conditions upon all parties as shall seem to him expedient. It was further enacted that \"Quartz Claims\" should be 150 feet in length, measured along the lode or vein, with power to follow the lode or vein and its spurs, dips and angles anywhere on or below the surface included between the two extremities of such length of 150 feet but not to advance upon or beneath the surface of the earth more than 100 feet in a lateral direction from the main lode or vein along which the claim is to be measured. That it should be lawful for the gold commissioner upon the application thereinafter mentioned to grant to any bed rock flume company for any term not exceeding five years, exclusive rights of way through and entry upon any mining ground in his district for the purpose of constructing laying and maintaining bed rock flumes. That such companies upon obtaining such grant, for which they should pay $125 into the colonial treasury should be entitled, among, others, to the following rights and privileges. The rights of way through and entry upon any new and unworked river, creek, gulch or ravine, and the exclusive right to locate and work a strip of ground one hundred feet wide and 200 feet long in the bed thereof to each individul of the company also. The rights of way through and entry upon any river, creek, gulch, or ravine worked by miners for any period longer than two years prior to such entry, and already wholly or partially abandoned, and the exclusive rights to stake out and work both the unworked and abandoned portions thereof one hundred feet in width, and one-quarter of a mile in length. Also the use and enjoyment of so much of the unoccupied and unappropriated water of the stream on which they may be located, and of other adjacent streams as may be necessary for the use of their flumes, hydraulic power and machinery, to carry on their mining operations, and they shall have their right of way for ditches and flumes to convey the necessary water to their works, they being liable to other parties for any damage which may arise from running such ditch or flumes through or over their ground, and they shall have a right to all the gold in their flumes. And, further, it was enacted that all bed rock flume companies should register their grant when obtained, and that a registration fee of $25.00 (twenty-five dollars) should be charged therefor, and that they should also pay an annual rent of $12.50 (twelve dollars and fifty cents) for each quarter of a mile of right of way legally held by such company. It was further enacted that leases for a term of ten years might be granted upon payment of the sum of $125.00 (one hundred and twenty-five dollars) into the colonial treasury for the quantities of land following, that is to say:\u2014\nIn Dry Diggings, ten acres.\nIn Bar Diggings unworked half a mile in length along the high water mark.\nIn Bar Diggings worked and abandoned one mile and a half in length along the high water mark.\nIn Quartz Reefs unworked half a mile in length.\nIn Quartz Reefs worked and abandoned one mile and a half in length with liberty in the two last cases to follow the spurs, dips and angles on and within the surface for 200 feet on each side of the main lead or seam.\nNow from the conformation of the country through which, within the Province of British Columbia, the Canada Pacific Railway must necessarily have been located it may be confidently affirmed that the tract of land on either side of it intended by the treaty of union to be appropriated by the Dominion Government, as they should deem advisable, had no appreciable value except such as might consist in the precious metals which might be found therein, and that the above Gold Mining Regulations of the Province of British Columbia would, if they apply to the above tract, absorb the whole of so much of the tract as did not consist of inaccessible mountain ranges of naked rock. The chief value, even, of the valleys through which the mountain streams flow consists, or is deemed to consist, of the gold found therein, and it is no doubt because of the gold that is therein that the above mining regulations give to the miner what may be said to be almost absolute control over the beds of the streams and the lands in the valleys through which the streams flow, in whatever lands those gold mining regulations apply to and, therefore, if they be held to apply to the railway belt in question, and if the Province of British Columbia retains a right to the precious metals therein, the right of appropriation of that belt by the Dominion Government, as expressed to be intended to be secured to it by the terms of the treaty of union would be so utterly illusory that it is, in my judgment, impossible to conceive that it was the intention of either of the parties to that treaty that what constituted what may be said to be the sole value of the tract should be exempt from the operation of the 11th article, and should be retained still as the property of the Province of British Columbia, and we can not, in my opinion, impute to them such an intention by implication, because of the existence of a rule which is applicable to the particular case of a grant of land by the crown to a subject, which establishes that such a grant does not pass the precious metals unless they be specifically named. The conditions which gave birth to that rule not existing, the rule itself cannot have any application. In the month of September, 1878, the Secretary of State of the Dominion in pursuance of an order in council in that behalf addressed a communication to the government of British Columbia informing them of the route of the line of railway, as then recently adopted and notifying them that all public lands in the Province of Manitoba and the North West Territories within 20 miles on each side of the line had been set apart to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway, and requesting the government of British Columbia in accordance with their agreement in that behalf on their entering the Dominion to convey to the Dominion government intrust to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the railway, a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout the entire length of British Columbia, and to make good to the Dominion from contiguous public lands, the quantity of land, if any, which may be held under pre-emption right or by crown grant within the limits of the land in British Columbia to be so conveyed to the Dominion government. In the interval between the sending of this communication and the month of May, 1880, it was found so impracticable to apply the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act, as was contemplated by the 38 Vic. ch. 51 to the survey and administration of the tract on either side of the railway in British Columbia, that this latter statute was repealed by an act passed on the 7th May, 1880, 43 Vic. ch. 27. By that act, after reciting that it had been ascertained that the conformation of the country upon and in the vicinity of the located line of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Province of British Columbia, is such that it is inexpedient to attempt to apply the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act to the survey. administration and management of the lands thereinafter mentioned it was enacted.\n1st. That the act 38 Vic. ch. 51 is hereby repealed.\n2nd. The governor in council shall have full power and authority by orders to be made from time to time to regulate the manner, terms and conditions, in and on which any lands which may have been or may be hereafter transferred to the Dominion of Canada under the terms and conditions of the admission of British Columbia into the Dominion shall be surveyed, laid out and administered, dealt with and disposed of, and from time to time to alter and repeal any such order and the regulations therein made and make others in their stead; provided that no regulations respecting the sale, leasing, or other disposition of such lands shall come into force until they shall have been published in the Canada Gazette, and shall have been laid before both houses of parliament for one month without being disapproved of by either house. Simultaneously with the passing of this act an act was passed by the Legislature of British Columbia for the purpose of giving effect to the 11th article of the treaty of union, which enacts as follows[17]:\u2014\nNow, it is to be observed that this act, as, indeed upon its face appears, was passed for the purpose of effectually fulfilling the terms of the 11th article of the treaty of union, it must therefore be construed in the light of the treaty, and not in the light of the narrow rule applicable to the case of a grant of land by the crown to a subject.\nThe Legislature of British Columbia in passing the act, must, as it appears to me, be held to have intended to divest itself of all control over the tract or belt described in the act as public property of the province, and to have placed it under the control of the Dominion parliament as public property of the Dominion, and thus to give effect to the condition upon which British Columbia was received into the union, although the tract being within the limits of the province, (where granted by the Dominion government to individuals like all other lands vested in individuals) will be subject to the laws of the province affecting the estate granted to such individuals as to local taxation, &c.\nTitle to any part of the land within the described belt can only be acquired by individuals under and in virtue of a grant from the Dominion authorities, that is to say by a crown grant executed under and in pursuance of the authority of the laws of the Dominion affecting Dominion lands; if, therefore, the rule as to crown grants of land not passing the precious metals unless they be specifically named therein is to have any application in the present case, it seems to me that as the power to grant the lands to individuals is transferred from the province to the Dominion unrestricted by any qualification as to the precious metals, it must be intended that the Dominion authorities should have power to grant them in such manner as the authorities having control of Dominion lands should think fit, and that therefore in a grant of the land or of any part thereof they might specifically grant also the precious metals therein by using appropriate language for that purpose, and if they could do so, then the rule as to the precious metals not passing if appropriate language should not be used would enure to the benefit of the Dominion and not to that of the province. The power to pass title to the land by grant from the crown being acknowledged to be in the Dominion authorities, all the incidents to that power must be in the Dominion also in the absence of any express qualification of the power contained in the instrument, in this case the treaty, vesting the power in the Dominion.\nSubsequently to the passing of this act, some delay took place in the construction of the railway occasioned partly by reason of a contemplated change in the manner of constructing the railway, that is to say, through the means of a company to be incorporated for the purpose instead of by the government as a government work in which manner it was being constructed in 1878, and partly by reason of searching for a better line through the Rocky Mountains than that which had been located in 1878.\nIn 1881 an act was passed entitled an act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway, incorporating a company to construct and work it when constructed, By this act the railway was divided into three sections, the eastern, the central and the western\u2014the central extending from Selkirk on the east side of the Red River in Manitoba to Kamloops in the Rocky Mountains, and the western extending from Kamloops to Port Moody on Burrard Inlet; the Dominion government undertook the completion of this western section. The search for a better line through the Rocky Mountains to Kamloops than that which had been located in 1878 occupied some time, and while this search was still in progress an act was passed by the Dominion parliament in the month of May, 1882, whereby it was enacted that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company might, subject to the approval of the Governor in council, lay out and locate their main line of railway from Selkirk to the junction in the western section at Kamloops by way of some pass other than the Yellow Head Pass.\nDifficulties also had arisen between the Dominion and the Provincial governments in relation to the construction of a railway and graving dock on Vancouver Island and other matters. At length in the month of February, 1883, the Provincial government in a paper addressed by them to the Dominion government setting forth the view taken by the Provincial government of the various matters therein stated in relation to the railway and graving dock on Vancouver Island, made a proposition as a basis to lead to a final settlement between the two governments as well in relation to the delay in the construction of the railway as in relation to the said other matters, which proposition is as follows:\u2014\nThat the Domininion government be urgently requested to carry out its obligation to the province either by commencing at the earliest possible period the construction of the island railway and completing the same with all possible despatch, or by giving to the province such fair compensation for failure to build such island railway as will enable the government of the province to build it as a provincial work and open the east coast lands for settlement; and that the Dominion government be earnestly requested to take over the graving dock at Esquimalt upon such terms as shall recoup and relieve the province of all expense in respect thereof, and to complete and operate it as a federal work or as a joint imperial and Dominion work; and that in lieu of any expensive and dilatory method of ascertaining the exact acreage of lands alienated within the railway belt and otherwise rendered unavailable there be set apart for the use of the Dominion a tract of 2,000,000 acres of land is extent, to be taken up in blocks of not less than 500,000 acres in such localities on the main land as may be agreed upon, the land to be taken up and defined within two years, and that it be one of the conditions that the Dominion government in dealing with lands in this province shall establish a land system equally as liberal both as to mining and agricultural industries as that in force in this province at the present time and that no delay take place in throwing open the land for settlement.\nThis last clause clearly shows that up to this time the idea has not been conceived that the precious metals were not intended to pass under the provisions of the 11th article of the treaty of union. It shows also that the provincial government's understanding of that article was that the lands in British Columbia, which by that article were agreed to be transferred to, and placed under the control of, the Dominion authorities, should be under such control for all purposes, mining as well as agricultural.\nIn the summer of 1883 Sir Alex. Campbell, then Minister of Justice, was sent by the Dominion government to British Columbia with instructions to negotiate a settlement of all existing differences, and to procure a change in the lands to be transferred by the province to the dominion between Kamloops and the eastern limit of the province rendered necessary by the contemplated change in the location of the line through the mountains east of Kamloops. The provincial authorities and Sir Alex. Campbell agreed upon terms of settlement, which were embodied in an agreement which contained a clause that the terms agreed upon should be taken by the province in full of all claims of the province against the Dominion in respect of delays in the commencement and construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and in respect of the non-construction of the Esquimalt and Nanaimo railway and should be taken by the Dominion government in satisfaction of all claims for additional lands under the terms of union, but should not be binding unless and until the same should be ratified by the parliament of Canada and the legislature of British Columbia. In the month of December, 1883, the legislature of British Columbia accordingly passed an act in which after setting out the agreement at large they ratified it and enacted that[18]:\nThese sections comprised the whole of the act which relates to the lands agreed to be given to the Dominion government by the 11th article of the treaty of union; the three and one-half million of acres in the Peace River district being given in satisfaction of all claims of the Dominion for additional lands in substitution for such lands within the limits of the railway belt as might be held under pre-emption right or crown grant as provided by the said 11th article of the treaty. The residue of the act relates wholly to giving effect to the agreement made between Sir Alexander Campbell and the provincial government in respect of the Vancouver Island railway, and the graving dock and has no bearing whatever upon the subject under consideration. It was argued, however, that in the clause which appropriates certain lands in aid of the construction of this railway the words \"including all coal, coal oil, ores, stones, clay, marble, \"slate, mines, minerals, and substances whatsoever \"thereupon, therein, and thereunder,\" being inserted, and nothing being mentioned in the clause relating to the Canadian Pacific railway belt but \"public lands \"along the line of the railway wherever it may be \"finally located, &c.,\" it must be inferred that mines and minerals were not intended to pass under the latter designation. But it is quite an accidental circumstance that the two matters are referred to in the same act. It is by the treaty of union and not by anything contained in this act that the extent of interest in the public lands within the limits of the railway belt intended by the treaty of union to be placed under the control and administration of the dominion government and parliament is to be determined; whereas the interest in the lands appropriated in aid of the construction of the Island railway, the beneficial interest in which lands was to be vested in the company to be incorporated to construct the railway, is determined by this act, which adopts the language of the act No. 15, of 1882, referred to in the agreement with Sir Alexander Campbell, whereby like provision was made in the interest of the company thereby incorporated. The dominion government having no beneficial interest whatever in the lands so appropriated, were naturally indifferent to the language used by the provincial authorities in making the appropriation, and they cannot be prejudiced in their title to the lands within the railway belt in which they are beneficially interested by the language used in making the appropriation of lands in which they have no beneficial interest. From the provision, therefore, made in the interest of the company which should construct the Island railway no inference can be drawn to qualify the extent of the interest of the Dominion of Canada under the treaty of union in the Canadian Pacific railway belt, any more than such an inference can be drawn from like language used in a grant of land from the crown to a subject. The intention of the parties to the treaty of union is alone what must govern; and that the intention of both parties to that treaty was that the precious metals should pass to the dominion in the sense of being under the absolute administration and control of and for the exclusive benefit of the dominion authorities appears to me to be clear for the reasons already given.\nThe Dominion parliament by the Act 47 Vic. ch. 6 has enacted:\u2014\nSec. 11. That the lands granted to Her Majesty represented by the government of Canada in pursuance of the 11th section of the terms of union by the act of the legislature of the Province of British Columbia, number eleven of one thousand eight hundred and eighty as amended by the act of the said legislature, assented to on the 19th December, 1883, shall be placed upon the market at the earliest date possible and shall be offered for sale on liberal terms to actual settlers.\n2. The said lands shall be open for entry to bon\u00e2 fide settlers in such lots and at such prices as the Governor in Council may determine.\n3. Every person who has squatted on any of the paid lands prior to the 19th day of December. 1883, and who has made substantial improvements thereon shall have a prior right of purchasing the lands so improved at the rates charged to settlers generally.\n4. The Governor in Council may from time to time regulate the manner in which, and the terms and conditions upon which, the said lands shall be surveyed, laid out, administered, dealt with and disposed of, provided that regulations respecting the sale, leasing or other disposition of such lands shall not come into force until they are published in the Canada Gazette.\nBy the 12th section it is enacted that the three and one-half million acres of lands in the Peace River district in British Columbia granted to Her Majesty as represented by the government of Canada by the said act assented to on the 19th day of December, 1883, shall be held to be Dominion lands within the meaning of the Dominion Lands Act, 1883.\nIn placing these lands in this manner by the Dominion parliament under the administration and control of the Dominion government as dominion lands, the parliament has, in my opinion, acted in perfect accordance with the letter and spirit, true intent and meaning of the 11th article of the treaty of union and the question therefore submitted in the case must be answered in favor of the affirment, The Attorney General of Canada, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McIntyre & Lewis.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor & Hogg.\n[1] 1 Plow. 310\n[2] 2 App. Cas. 166.\n[3] 8 App. Cas. 767.\n[4] 10 O. r. 196; 13 Can.

IV. Ch. 2 (which limits the quantity of land to be held in trust for the purposes mentioned in the act to five acres), Jonathan Bowerman, one of the grantors named in the deed of 1821, purported to convey three acres (being half the land granted by the deed of 1821) to Jonathan Clark and Gilbert Dorland, trustees of the West Lake Monthly Meeting of Friends, and to their successors, in trust for the said Meeting \u201cso long as the members constituting it shall remain and be from time to time continued in religious unity with the Yearly Meeting of Friends (called Quakers) as now established in London, Old England, and no longer.\u201d\nThe Society of Friends (called Quakers) is one body of Christians composed of Yearly Meetings with their subordinate branches in England, Ireland, the United States and Canada.\nIn 1821 and down to 1867 the West Lake Monthly Meeting was under the jurisdiction of the New York Yearly Meeting. In 1867 the New York Yearly Meeting, with the consent and approbation of the various other yearly Meetings of Friends, set off the Canada Yearly Meeting, to which, through the West Lake Quarterly Meeting, the West Lake Monthly Meeting has been since and is now subordinate.\nIn 1821 and down to 1859 the New York Discipline of 1810 as from time to time altered and amended by the Yearly Meeting was in force in the West Lake Monthly Meeting. In 1859 the New York Yearly Meeting revised their Discipline, and the said Discipline of 1859 was in force in Canada until the constitution of the Canada Yearly Meeting in 1867.\nIn 1867 the Canada Yearly Meeting on the 2nd day of its first session adopted the New York Discipline of 1859.\nIn 1877 the New York Yearly Meeting again revised their Discipline and the said Discipline so revised was adopted by the Canada Yearly Meeting in 1880.\nThe defendants and others members of the Westlake Monthly Meeting, claimed that the Discipline adopted by the Yearly Meeting in 1880 was not regularly adopted for want of unity among the members and other informalities, and also that it was an entire departure from the established doctrines and usages of the society, and they constituted themselves a separate society with its own yearly and subordinate meetings, and elected from among themselves trustees for the above described property. Eventually, the plaintiffs had to bring this suit to determine which body was, in law, the Westlake Monthly Meeting.\nOn the hearing before Mr Justice Proudfoot judgment was given for the defendants the learned judge holding that as the right to property was in question he was obliged to inquire into the religious opinions of the opposing parties to see who were the beneficiaries, and he found that the defendants were, and the plaintiffs were not, in religious unity with the Yearly Meeting of Friends as established in London, England, when the trust was created. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, and held that the criterion as to the Monthly Meeting was only its continued existence as such, and that depended upon its adherence to the supreme body, the Yearly Meeting. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMacLennan Q.C. and Arnoldi for the appellants cited Attorney General v. Jeffrey[3]; Attorney General v Pearson[4].\nS.H. Btake Q.C. and Clarke for the respondents referred to Williams v. Bishop of Salisbury[5]; Attorney General v. Gould[6]; White lick Quar. Meeting v. White lick Quar. Meeting[7]; White v. Nelles[8].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal, namely, that the adoption of the discipline of 1877 was matter with which it was competent for the yearly meeting to deal as having the final and controlling jurisdiction. So far as I can understand the yearly meeting is recognized as the tribunal of last resort; its decisions on all matters within its jurisdiction are conclusive, and all true Friends are bound by them; and the matter in question was properly and regularly dealt with and determined by that meeting, in accordance with the mode in which the doings of yearly meetings of Quakers are conducted and the results of them ascertained, and without objection declared and minuted by the clerk, the regular officer in that behalf, or refusal to acquiesce or submit, and so substantial unanimity was secured; no alterations were made in the practice and discipline which the yearly meeting was not competent to make and effect, and if it was not properly and regularly dealt with and adopted by that meeting, then, as suggested by Mr. Justice Patterson, if the adoption and promulgation of that book of discipline was not the act of the meeting matters, so far as the meeting was concerned, remained as they were. In this case I can discover, as Chief Justice Shaw expresses it;\nNo such departure from the fundamental principles on which the society is founded on the part of the yearly meeting, the responsible head and representative of the whole body, in fact the society itself, so deep and radical as to destroy its identity with the Society of Friends who had been invested by law with the enjoyment of property and civil rights\nThe attempt to set up a separate quarterly meeting at Pickering, ignoring the yearly meeting regularly appointed to meet the following year at Norwich, and not in the regular order of the society, was, so far as I can understand the case, wholly unwarranted and contrary to discipline and usage, and therefore irregu lar and void, not having been formed according to discipline, but \u201cto avoid the rightful authority and controlling action of the yearly meeting to which they were subordinate,\u201d and in doing so the defendants put themselves out of the society and so ceased to be in unity with the Society of Friends, and therefore cannot properly claim to be the Westlake Monthly Meeting for whose use and benefit this property was purchased.\nI therefore think that the plaintiffs are the persons who now truly and lawfully answer the description of the Westlake Monthly Meeting of Friends, and as such represent the real Westlake Monthly Meeting, which is really the only point in controversy.\nThis case has been so fully and ably discussed in the judgment of the court below and in the authorities cited, particularly those decisions of the American courts which have so exhaustively and learnedly dealt with the history, constitution, doctrine, modes of proceeding, discipline and practice of this body known as the Society of Friends, or Quakers, and with all the principles by which this case must be governed, that I feel that I can throw no new light on the subject, and I therefore content myself with thus shortly stating the conclusions at which I have arrived. Therefore, I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For the reasons given by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I have arrived at the conclusion, not without a great deal of difficulty, that this appeal should be dismissed. I have failed to find any sufficient evidence of departure from the rules of the society to enable the parties to hold this property. I think, for the reasons given in the judgment of the court below, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to the property referred to in their statement of claim, for the reasons given by Patterson J. in the Court of Appeal.

After certain negotiations between the governments of Canada and British Columbia, and in order to settle all disputes, an agreement was entered into, and on the 19th December, 1883, the legislature of British Columbia passed the statute 47 Vic. ch. 14, by which it was enacted inter alia as follows: \"From and after the passing \"of this act there shall be, and there is hereby, granted to the \"Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to \"aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific \"Railway on the main land of British Columbia, in trust, to be \"appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, \"the public lands along the line of railway before mentioned, \"wherever it may be finally located, to a width of twenty miles \"on each side of said line, as provided in the order in council \"section 11 admitting the Province of British Columbia into \"Confederation.\" On the 20th November, 1883, by public notice the government of British Columbia reserved a belt of land of 20 miles in width along a line by way of Bow River Pass. In November, 1884, the respondent in order to comply with the provisions of the provincial statutes, filed a survey of a certain parcel of land situate within the said belt of 20 miles, and the survey having been finally accepted on the 13th January, 1885, letters patent under the great seal of the province were issued to F. for the land in question.\nThe Attorney General of Canada by information of intrusion sought to recover possession of said land, and the Exchequer Court having dismissed the information with costs, on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, Henry J. dissenting, that at the date of the grant the Province of British Columbia had ceased to have any interest in the land covered by said grant and that the title to the same was in the crown for the use and benefit of Canada.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court, (Henry J.) dismissing the plaintiff's information and giving judgment for the defendant.\nThis was an information of the Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, brought against the respondent for intrusion on lands known as lot number six, in group one of the District of Kootenay, in the Province of British Columbia, such lands being situated within the 20 miles belt of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The pleadings, documentary and oral evidence bearing upon the case are stated at length in the judgment of Henry J. in the Exchequer Court, and in the judgment of the Chief Justice hereinafter given.\nThe action was tried at Victoria, B. C., on the 23rd of September, 1886.\nDrake Q.C. appeared for the crown.\nRichards Q.C. and T. Davie for defendant.\nOn the 27th December, 1886, Henry J. delivered the following judgment in favor of the respondent:\u2014\nThis action was commenced by an information of the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty, the Queen, as follows:\n\"To the Honorable the Chief Justice and Justices of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\n\"The information of Her Majesty's Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty sheweth as follows.\n\"1. That certain lands and premises situate in group one of the district of Kootenay, in the Province of British Columbia, within the railway belt of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and being composed of lot No. 6 in the said group number one in the district of Kootenay aforesaid, containing 1175 acres, more or less, on the 25th day of January, A.D., 1885, and long before that date were and still ought to be in the hands and possession of Her Majesty the Queen.\n\"2. That the defendant, to wit: on the said 25th January, A.D. 1885, in and upon the possession of our said lady the Queen of and in the premises, entered, intruded and made entry and the issues and profits thereof coming, received and had and yet doth receive and have to his own use. CLAIM.\n\"The Attorney General on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen claims as follows:\u2014\n\"1. Judgment for possession of the said lands and premises.\n\"2. Judgment for an account of the issues and profits of the said lands and premises, from the said 25th day of January A. D. 1885 till possession be given.\n\"3. Judgment for the costs of this action.\"\nThe statement of defence is as follows:\n\"1. In answer to paragraph one of the information herein the defendant says that on and prior to the 13th day of January, A.D. 1885, the said lands were in the hands and possession of Her Majesty and on the said day Her Majesty by patent duly issued under the great seal of the Province of British Columbia, granted the said lands unto and to the use of the defendant, his heirs and assigns for ever.\n\"Wherefore the defendant upon and since the said grant entered upon and has taken possession of the said lands and has since enjoyed and now enjoys possession, use and occupation of the same which is the intrusion and trespass complained of.\n\"And saving and except as herein is admitted the defendant denies all and every the allegations in the information set out.\"\nTo which statement of defence the following replication was filed:\u2014\n\"1. Her Majesty's Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty joins issue upon the defendant's statement in defence herein.\n\"2. And for a further replication to the said statement in defence of the defendant, Her Majesty's Attorney General says that the lands and premises in the information and statement in defence herein mentioned, were on 13th of January, A.D. 1885, in the hands and possession of Her Majesty, in the right of her Dominion of Canada and not in the right of her Province of British Columbia, and that a grant of the said lands under the great seal of the Province of British Columbia conveyed no interest therein to the defendant.\"\nIt will thus be seen that the issue raised is as to the title to the lands in question on the 13th of January, 1885, the date of the grant or patent issued to the defendant duly executed by the Lieutenant Governor under the great seal of the Province of British Columbia of the lands in question.\nIt having been admitted on the part of the plaintiff that the title to the lands up to the year 1883 was in Her Majesty for the Province of British Columbia it is claimed on the part of the plaintiff that previous to the grant or patent to the defendant the title of the province therein was by law transferred to Her Majesty in trust for the Dominion of Canada.\nOn reference to the exhibits and evidence it will be seen that the application by the defendant was duly made on the 22nd of November, 1883, under the statutes of British Columbia, for a patent of lands covering the locus. That under the authority of the Crown Lands Department it was surveyed as provided by the statutes in October, 1884, and the survey was formally approved and accepted by the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands of the province on the 13th April, 1885, and the grant issued.\nOn the part of the defendant it is contended that he had earned under his application, accepted by the department, and by the payment of the purchase price, the right to complete his purchase by pursuing the terms of the statute in regard to the survey and other respects and finally to a grant or patent; and that the statutes of the Province and of the Dominion subsequently passed in respect of the railway could not deprive him of his right to the land obtained under the provisions of the statute. The position may require to be dealt with in case of a decision in favor of the plaintiff on the issue raised more prominently by the pleadings.\nAs before stated the plaintiff claims title as owner of the lands in dispute at the time and before the issue of the grant or patent to the defendant\nThat claim rests not upon any grant or other ordinary conveyance by which the title is alleged to have been transferred to the plaintiff but upon certain statutes passed by the Legislature of British Columbia and by the Parliament of Canada and on the minutes of council of the Government of Canada and of the Government of British Columbia and other documents put in evidence on both sides.\nThe first to which I consider it necessary to refer is the II article of the terms of the union of British Columbia with Canada as agreed upon by Government of the latter and the Legislature of the former of the 25th of July, 1870.\nThe article is as follows:\u2014\nThe Government of the Dominion undertake to secure the commencement simultaneously, within two years from the date of union, of the construction of a railway from the Pacific towards the Rocky Mountains, and from such point as may be selected east of the Rocky Mountains towards the Pacific, to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada; and further, to secure the completion of such railway within ten years from the date of the union.\nAnd the Government of British Columbia agree to convey to the Dominion Government, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said railway, a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout its entire length in British Columbia, not to exceed however, twenty (20) miles on each side of said line, as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands in the Northwest territories and the Province of Manitoba. Provided, that the quantity of land which may be held under pre-emption right or by crown grant within the limits of the tracts of land in British Columbia to be so conveyed to the Dominion government shall be made good to the Dominion from contiguous public lands; and provided further, that until the commencement, within two years as aforesaid from the date of the union, of the construction of the said railway, the Government of British Columbia shall not sell nor alienate any further portions of the public lands of British Columbia in any other way than under right of pre-emption, requiring actual residence of the pre-emptor on the land claimed by him. In consideration of the land to be so conveyed in aid of the construction of the said railway, the Dominion Government agree to pay to British Columbia from the date of the union, the sum of 100,000 dollars per annum, in half-yearly payments in advance.\nThe terms of the article were carried out by the government of British Columbia by withdrawing all its public lands from sale or alienation according to the terms of the article, but on the expiration of two years the railway not having in the interim been commenced the Government of British Columbia declined to convey certain lands on the east coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, that then being considered a part of the railway referred to in that article, although requested to do so by a communicated minute of council of the Government of Canada.\nNumerous orders in council were during several years passed by the Dominion and Provincial governments, and despatches and telegrams passed the latter government complaining of delay in the building of the railway which, in my opinion, do not affect the issue in this case very much; a perusal of them, however, shows a continuous want of effective co-operation and ineffectual negotiations. Nothing was really done of any consequence to hasten the commencement of the railway for several years. The western terminus was at an early day fixed to be at Esquimalt and much difficulty had arisen in regard to the building of the line on Vancouver Island. That difficulty was, however, removed by an order of the Dominion Council passed on the 29th of May, 1878, rescinding the previous order locating the terminus at Esquimalt and fixing it on the mainland at Burrard Inlet. The line then adopted was as notified to the Government of British Columbia to pass through T\u00eate Jaune Cache by way of the Thomson river and Kamloops.\nBy section 15 of the act of the Dominion of 1881 ch. 1, the line was provided to be built as continuous \"from the terminus of the Canada Central Railway \"near lake Nipissing known as Callender Station to \"Port Moody,\" under the name of \"The Canadian \"Pacific Railway,\" and by \"section 17\" the consolidated Railway Act of 1879 with certain modifications was made applicable to that railway. It will be seen that by this act no change was made in the line through Manitoba, the North West Territories, or the mainland of British Columbia, except that involved by the adoption of Port Moody as the terminus instead or Esquimalt in Vancouver Island. On the contrary so far as this controversy is concerned the northern line by T\u00eate Jaune Pass was that provided for. By the eleventh section of the schedule to the act and made part of it is provided as follows:\u2014\nThe grant of land hereby agreed to be made to the company shall be so made in alternate sections of 640 acres each extending back 24 miles deep on each side of the railway from Winnipeg to Jasper House, in so far as such lands be vested in the government the company receiving the sections bearing uneven numbers.\nNo change that I can find was ever made in that appropriation appropriating the whole of the lands to the extent of twenty miles, or for any extent on each side of the railway except by alternate sections as before stated.\nBy the provision of the eleventh article of the terms of union the agreement of the Government of British Columbia was to convey to the Dominion Government:\u2014\nA similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout its entire length in British Columbia not to exceed, however, twenty (20) miles on each side of said line as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion government from the public lands in the North West Territories and the Province of Manitoba.\nBy section 2 of the act of British Columbia of 1883, ch. 14 there was granted to the Dominion Government to aid in the construction of the portion of it on the mainland of that province:\u2014\nA similar extent of public lands along the line of the railway before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located (not to exceed twenty miles on each side of the said line) as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion from the public lands of the North West Territories and the Province of Manitoba as provided by the order in council section 11 admitting the Province of British Columbia into confederation.\nBy section one of the act of British Columbia of 1880, ch. 11, the same provision was made but the line was therein stated to be between Burrard Inlet and Yellow Head summit the line to begin:\u2014\nAt English Bay or Burrard Inlet and following the Fraser river to Lytton thence by the valley of the Thomson river to Kamloops thence up the valley of the North Thomson, passing near to lakes Albrida and Cranberry to T\u00eate Jaune Cache thence up the valley of the Fraser river to the summit of Yellow Head or boundary between British Columbia and the North West Territories. The grant of the said land shall be subject to the conditions contained in the said 11th section of the terms of union.\nBy section 2 of the Act of British Columbia of December, 1883, ch. 14, the section of the act just in part recited was amended to read as follows:\u2014\nFrom and after the passing of this Act there shall be and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of construction and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia in trust to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands along the line of the railway before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located, to a width of twenty miles on each side of the line as provided in the Order in Council section 11 admitting the Province of British Columbia into Confederation. 401\nThat may be construed as a grant of twenty miles of the public lands of the Province as provided in section eleven, therein referred to. By section eleven, and the acts of British Columbia previously passed the extent was provided to be limited by that \"appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the public lands in the NorthWest Territories and the Province of Manitoba.\" If then, but alternate sections were appropriated on the east side of the boundary line does not that limit the contribution to be made on the west side of the line?\nIf that be the true construction would the Province of British Columbia, under any circumstances be bound to do more than to convey each alternate mile to the extent of 20 miles on each side of the railway. Up to the date of a notice given by Mr. Trutch the agent of the Dominion Government to the Commissioner of Crown Lands of the Province, the route by the \"T\u00eate Jaune Pass\" was that dealt with by the government of that province.\nThat notice dated on the 5th November, 1883, is as follows:\u2014\nDominion Government Agent's Office,\nVictoria, British Columbia,\n5th November 1883.\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to apprise you that I have to-day received from the Rt. Hon. Sir John A. MacDonald a reply by telegraph to the telegram and letter which I addressed to him on the 23th ulto. upon the subject matter of the interview which I had on that day with you and your colleagues in the Ministry.\nSir John MacDonald directs me to inform you that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have definitely abandoned the Yellow Head Pass, and have adopted aline crossing the Rocky Mountains by the Bow River Pass and the Selkirk Range through what is known as Roger's Pass by the Beaver Creek and Illecillewant River Valleys, and through Eagle Creek Pass to Kamloops.\nSome improvement may be made in this line between the summit of the Rocky Mountains and the Columbia River before work is recommenced in the spring which may render it not strictly accurate to speak of the line as following the Kicking Horse Pass although that pass is entirely practicable and will be followed unless some one of the alternative lines in the immediate vicinity which are now being examined is found to afford lighter work and easier grading.\nSir John Macdonald further directs me to request you to place the belt of land 20 miles on each side of the railway line along the route so above indicated under reservation as the land to be granted to the Dominion by British Columbia, instead of the land along the Yellow Head Pass conveyed by the British Columbia Act, ch. II, in accordance with the agreement now existing between your Government and that of the Dominion.\nI beg accordingly that you will be pleased to have the said lands at once placed under reservation for this purpose.\nI have the honor to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sd). Joseph W. Trutch.\nIt will be seen that the object of that notice was to request the local government to place 20 miles on each side of the general line indicated under reservation instead of the land along the line by the Yellow Head Pass conveyed by the local act 43, vic., ch. 11, (1880).\nThe request to place the lands on the line referred to in the notice under reservation is a clear admission that such lands were then the lands of British Columbia, and subsequently to that notice the lands \"were reserved until further notice.\" But that act of reservation conveyed no title to the Dominion Government nor did it prevent the Government from raising or removing such reservation by the receipt of application for the purchase of any portion of them or from conveying the same by grant or patent. The subsequent act did not grant according to that reservation.\nOn the 29th November, 1883, a notice signed by the Chief Commissioner of lands and works of the province was published in the Provincial Gazette which after reciting sec. 2, of 46 Via, ch. 14 (1883) of British Columbia continues as follows:\u2014\nAnd whereas official informai ion has been received that a definite route has been adopted by way of Bow River Pass and that via Yellow Head Pass has been abandoned. Public notice is therefore given that the following belt of land is hereby reserved until further notice, viz: commencing at Kamloops, thence on a line by the valley of the South Thomson river and through Eagle Pass to the Columbia river, thence by the Illecillewant river and Beaver Creek \"Valley's, and by Roger's Pass through the Selkirk Range to the boundary of British Columbia at Bow River Pass and having a width of 20 miles on each side of said Une.\nThe Provincial act of December, 1883, does not however refer to any line in particular, but makes the provision in respect of the public lands along the line of the railway wherever it may be finally located as provided in the order in council, sec. 11, before recited and frequently referred to.\nIt is under the provisions of that act that the claim of the plaintiff to recover is made.\nAfter the plaintiff's case was rested, council on behalf of the defendant urged substantially in defence the points and objections following:\u2014\n1st. That to make title the lands should have been conveyed by patent under the seal of the province.\n2nd. That the grant to the \"Dominion Government\" passed no title to Her Majesty the Queen.\n3rd. That the land is not described or defined.\n4th. That the statute did not operate as an immediate transfer and is therefore void as a transfer.\n5th. That the notice of location under the date of the 5th November, 1883, was not a sufficient notice of the final location of the line so as to enable the belt on each side to be definitely located and that no further notice was shown to have been given.\n6th. That the location as by notice might have been changed.\n7th. That no evidence was given that any lands in the North West Territories or Manitoba has been appropriated by the Dominion Government on the adopted line.\n8th. As the charter gives to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company only alternate sections a survey was necessary of the lands in British Columbia before any title vested in the Dominion Government even of the alternate sections.\n9th. The defendant having applied and his application having been received and acted on before any statute as to the railway was passed or reservation made, he became entitled to a grant as purchaser having been shown to have complied with the terms and conditions provided by statute.\nAs to the first point I have no doubt that the Legislature of British Columbia had the power of passing a title of public lands by an act and by doing so might repeal to that extent any previous statutory provisions to the contrary.\nTo the second point I have given attentive consideration and have failed to arrive at the conclusion that grant or conveyance to the \"Dominion Government makes any title to Her Majesty the Queen. In the first place a grant or conveyance of land must be to one, or a body capable of receiving a title to and holding land with the power of transmitting or conveying it and I cannot see how the Dominion Government as such has any legal status or entitled or authorized to do any of those acts. When a conveyance for public uses is taken of land it is directly made to the Queen in trust. Nor can I conclude that even if the Dominion Government by that title could receive, hold and convey land why Her Majesty would necessarily have a title thereto; and in that case an action to recover possession should be, not by the Queen but by those to whom the title was made. Had the grant by the statute been to Canada or to the Dominion of Canada the application to it of the rules of law would be essentially different.\nThere is no statute providing for the purchase of land or receiving a title thereto by the Dominion Government and there is none providing that, should such be done, a conveyance to it should be held or deemed to be a conveyance to Her Majesty. The fee simple of land is never in abeyance. If A owns land and conveys it to B the fee simple is immediately transferred to the latter if he is capable of holding it. If not, or if the conveyance be defective, the fee simply remains in A. If the Dominion Government as such is incapable of holding the title of the lands referred to in the statute the title remains in Her Majesty on behalf of the Province of British Columbia, the legal result of which is that the plaintiff has no title upon which to sustain this action, and that even if the defendant had no legal title from Her Majesty through his grant or patent he is entitled to the judgment of this court.\nIt may be suggested that the statute was intended to give a title to Her Majesty in the lands in question although the grant is to the \"Dominion Government\"; but we cannot go outside of the words used in it and must not speculate as to what may have been intended. The title to land is in question and we must not depart from the rules of construction necessary to sustain titles or, in an opposite direction, affect them. We cannot import words much less speculations as to intentions into conveyances, which on their face are capable of but one construction.\nThe third objection that the land is not described or defined is an important one.\nIn a grant, deed or other conveyance of land, the land requires to be so described that on the execution of the conveyance the location, quantity, and shape may be ascertained by the usual means.\nThe land may be described by a line commencing at a certain specified, and, at the date of the conveyance, ascertainable point and running by metes and bounds round it to the place of commencement. It may be described by the lines of adjoining lands or in many other modes so as distinctly to point ont the land conveyed. It may also do so by references to documents, lines, boundaries, monuments, and otherwise then existing, but not subsequently to be made or established.\nThe land must be capable in some way of being ascertained by means of the directions of the conveyance immediately after it is executed independently of other supplementary evidence making an addition to the words of the conveyance.\nTesting then the statute of December, 1883, under which the plaintiff claims title by the rules just stated the question is: Who could immediately afterwards lay out and ascertain the exact or even approximate boundaries of the land?\nBy the statute the land referred to in it was enacted to be 20 miles on each side of the railway wherever it may be finally located. It is well known that from the 49th parallel the southern boundary of British Columbia to its northern boundary there are several hundreds of miles. There is no evidence of any location of the line of railway when that act was passed and the act does not provide to give lands on any line but one to be subsequently located. Who could then, on the passing of that act, say what part of the territory of British Columbia of the hundreds of miles in extent between its southern boundaries was conveyed?\nThere is nothing in the statute to determine it and no reference to other objects then existing by which it could be determined. If not then does any title to any land pass by it?\nAn ordinary conveyance in such terms would be void for uncertainty, and I know not why the statute in question should be construed differently. It is unnecessary for me to decide what the statute amounts to, whether an agreement or otherwise. It is only necessary in this case to ascertain if it amounts to an absolute conveyance, and I think it does not.\nThe fourth objection is, I think, equally available for the defence. The statute to amount to a transfer of title must operate to define the land, as it should in every other respect, as soon as passed. If not then a transfer in law, it could not afterwards become so so as to affect any particular lands. It did not purport to convey all the lands of the province between the boundaries before mentioned, and it contained no directions by which on its passage a surveyor or any other party could have ascertained what particular lands were conveyed. In fact such an enquiry could not be made as the legislature that passed the act did not itself know where the line was to run.\nI will deal with the fifth and sixth objections together.\nThe notice of the 5th November, 1883, signed by Mr. Trutch is certainly no evidence that any line had been finally located, but, on the contrary showed that it was not, and that alterations in the projected line were expected to be made. Under such circumstances no surveyor could have made measurements to cover 20 miles on either side of the railway, and if such had been attempted it was likely to have proved to have been labor lost. No surveyor could ascertain the land under the statute until the line was finally located on the ground and a plan of it correctly made shewing courses and distances. A survey without such being previously done could not properly locate the lands referred to in the statute, and, if otherwise done, would no doubt improperly place portions inside and other portions outside of the belt. As far as the evidence goes nothing of the kind has ever yet been done. It may, however, be found that the lands now in question are within the belt, and, in fact, that seemed to me to be conceded at the trial. That, however, does not affect in any way the construction of the statute.\nTo the 7th objection I may say that although my attention on the trial to any appropriation of lands for the railway by the Government or Parliament of Canada on the side of the adopted line was not directed, and although I have not succeeded in finding any direct appropriation, I am of the opinion that it was inferentially done in a sufficient manner as was done in respect of the more northern line.\nIn reference to the 9th objection, I will only observe that in the view of the other parts of the case which I have taken, I have not thought it necessary to deal with that point.\nI have reason to expect that an appeal to the whole court will be had whatever my judgment may be, and I have therefore principally endeavored to place the facts upon which the decision of the case depends in a compass to be easily ascertained.\nIn doing so, however, I have felt it but proper to give my views on the legal points generally, having reason to believe they will again be fully argued and my views if wrong corrected.\nFor the reason given I am of opinion that the plaintiff did not make out the case alleged in the information, and that the defendant is entitled to judgment with costs.\nThe Attorney General of Canada for the appellant:\nThis appeal involves the title to lands claimed by the Dominion Government in British Columbia, amounting to a million acres. The suit is by writ of intrusion for lot known as No. 6 group 1. The defendants claim under a grant from the Government of British Columbia. The Canadian Pacific Railway crosses the lot at a quarter of a mile north of the location of Two Rivers.\nWe claim this land in British Columbia as within the twenty mile belt. An order in council was passed under section 146 B. N. A. Act on March 16th, 187[Illegible Text], admitting British Columbia into the union. That order has the same effect in relation to British Columbia as the British North America Act has to the other Provinces. It has the effect of an Imperial statute.\nOn the question as to whether this was a present right or only an agreement, I would refer to the fact that the Dominion Government agreed to pay $100,000 a year from the date of the agreement and has paid it.\nThis concession of lands in British Columbia is to be distinguished from the appropriation of lands in Manitoba. By the terms of the union the quantity of land in British Columbia was limited to twenty miles on each side of the railway. In Manitoba and the North West Territories we granted twenty-five millions of acres to the Canadian Pacific Railway and we are entitled to the whole twenty miles in British Columbia.\nThe British Columbia Government stipulated that no sales were to be made until the completion of the railway.\nThe defendants application bears date October 20, 1883. That is not the actual date as it was only delivered to the Government of British Columbia on 19th November, 1883. On November 5, 1883, it was understood that the present route of the railway would be selected. The patent is dated 16th January, 1885. The official acceptance of the application is the notice in the Gazette which is 13th January, 1885. The application was made under the Land Amendment Act of 1882. Some confusion arises from the contention of the defendant that the termini of the road were never fixed. The act of 1872 ch. 71 defines the termini. That act makes it perfectly plain that the termini were not uncertain.\nI next refer to ch. 14 of the act of 1874 to show the quantity of land granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway in the North West Territories.\nCh. 11 of the acts of 1880, British Columbia, for the first time undertook to define the limit where the lands should be. That statute never had any effect, because it was opposed to the terms of union which had the force of an Imperial statute. Then the Dominion Act of 1881 ch. 1, the Canadian Pacific Railway incorporation act, finally fixed the quantity of land to be given in the North West Territories at twenty-five million acres.\nNext is the statute of 1883 ch. 14 British Columbia. That repealed the act of 1880.\nWe say that no grant was necessary to pass these lands. They were held by Her Majesty for the benefit of the province. Her Majesty could not grant to herself. The Province of British Columbia undertook to use a larger word than was necessary to vest the lands in the Dominion Government.\nThe next point is this: It is contended that the words used do not vest any right in Her Majesty, because the expression used is \"Dominion Government\" The British North America Act says that Her Majesty shall continue to be the executive Governor of Canada. Then, the terms of union, having the effect of an Imperial statute, use that very expression.\nThen, as regards the definiteness of the grant It was a title capable of being vested immediately. When the statute passed in 1883, a large portion of the railway had been completed. There is evidence that the construction in British Columbia had been begun nearly four years before.\nA good deal of contention appears in the case as to whether this was treated by either government as a grant vesting a title. It is contended by the respondent that it was treated only as an agreement.\n[The Attorney General referred to the Dominion Act of 1875, ch. 51, providing for the sale of these lands. Statute of 1880 43 Vic. ch. 27, repealing 38 Vic. ch. 51, also to the Statute of 1884, ch. 6, and produced map to show that the land was never unsurveyed.]\nBurbidge Q.C. follows: There was never any change of route west of Kamloops. From Port Moody to Kamloops the line follows the direction given in the act of 1880. In the contract the line is described as going by Yellow Head Pass. In 1882 this was found impracticable, and the Act 45 Vic. ch. 23 was passed. That authorizes a change from the Yellow Head to a more southerly pass.\nIn May, 1880, British Columbia passed an act reciting the agreement with the Dominion Government. Two matters in dispute were the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway and the Graving Dock. The Dominion Government could not confirm this legislation, because it was contrary to the terms of union.\nSir Alex. Campbell went to British Columbia in August, 1883, and an agreement was made between him and Mr. Smith.\nOn 5th November Mr. Trutch gave notice to Smith of the final line of the road. As far as Kamloops the line was located, and it could not be that there was to be a subsequent location. They had to strike Columbia river which is where these lands are. Mr. Trutch said that it might have to be improved when they came to strike the line at Columbia River, and that is their whole agreement. Theodore Davie for the respondent:\nThe title of the Dominion Government to these lands takes its origin from the terms of union. The order in council contains a provision, that the government of the province should convey to the Dominion a quantity of land similar in extent to that in the North West Territories. No attempt had been made to survey it, and it was thought it would take at least two years to make a survey. The contracting parties had two difficulties. The settlement of the country must go on, and it was thought that the lands should not be locked up, and again, that they should not be sold to the Dominion. And the agreement was, that after two years the province should deal with the lands as before. Work was not commenced within two years and a good deal of dispute arose The Dominion Government had nominated Esquimalt as on the line of railway. Application was made to the local government to reserve land on Vancouver Island. On June 30, 1873, Esquimalt was fixed as the terminus. (Refers to act of 1875 granting land to Dominion Government.)\nIn 1878 Burrard Inlet was by order in council made the terminus.\n(Refers to statute of 8th May, 1880, B. C. Reads sec. 1.)\nOn November 5 Mr. Trutch gave his notice of the abandonment of the Yellow Head Pass route. Before this notice respondent had made his application to purchase.\nIn 1883 negotiations were entered into between the Province and the Dominion for the settlement of this dispute as to the lands for the Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia, and under these negotiations the Province agreed to concede the claim of the Dominion to additional land to make up for valueless portions within the railway belt, and to meet this point, as well as the question of alienation, it was arranged that the Province should cede to the Dominion three and a half millions of acres in Peace River. This was subsequently embodied in an act which was disallowed by the Dominion, and finally the agreement between Sir Alex. Campbell and Mr. Smith was made. This agreement resulted in the act known as the 2nd Settlement Act of British Columbia.\nThe Dominion Parliament did not ratify this agreement until April 1884, 47 V., c. 46. Therefore the title of the Dominion to lands under the settlement act did not arise until that date.\n47 V., c. 16 B. C, the land act under which the defendant's grant was made, was assented to on 18th February, 1884, before the ratification of the Settlement Act. Sec. 76 of that act is as follows:\u2014\n76. Notwithstanding anything in this act contained any person or persons who have prior to the passing of this act, bon\u00e2 fide located and applied for land under the provisions of the act hereby repealed, or any, or either of them shall be entitled to acquire such land in like manner as he or they would have been or would be entitled, if this act had not been passed, but subject to proof to the satisfaction of the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works that the provisions of the previous act have been complied with, provided however, that unless all the provisions of the said acts, including payment, are complied with by the applicant within nine months from the passage of this act all claims of the applicant to be entitled to complete his purchase shall cease and determine.\nThe case for the crown is defective in two particulars. It is not shown what quantity of land has been appropriated for railway purposes in Manitoba and the North West Territories. They can only claim in British Columbia the same quantity. It is said that they have appropriated 25,000,000 of acres. (refers to Act of 1881, c. 1 D). The Settlement Act points to a new appropriation.\nThere is no evidence to show that the line was ever located. There is no evidence of surveyors running the line. The following cases were cited: Hegdenfeldt v. Doney, Gold and Silver Mining Co.[1]; Ehrhardt v. Hogabone[2]; Butt v. Northern Pacific Railway Company[3].\nAttorney General of Canada in reply.\nThe legitimate conclusion of the defendant's argument is that the line can never be located, the rights of the crown can never accrue, and the grant is inoperative.\nThen as to the quality of land granted to North West Territories, (reads from S. 11 of 44, V. c. 1.)\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The crown seeks to recover possession of certain property known as lot No. 6, in group number one, of the district of Kootenay in the Province of British Columbia. The Canadian Pacific Railway runs through this lot which is situate on the Columbia river at and near where the Illecillewant river empties into the Columbia. The defendant claims the lands in question by virtue of a grant or letters patent under the Great Seal of the Province of British Columbia, dated the 16th January 1885. The evidence shows that the defendant made an application for certain lands under the land amendment act, 1882, (B.C.) as follows:\u2014\nLAND AMENDMENT ACT, 1882.\nSale of Unsurveyed Land,\nDistrict of Kootenay, British Columbia,\nOctober 20th 1883.\nTo the Hon. the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, Victoria.\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to inform you that I desire to purchase, under clause 1 of the \"Land Amendment Act, 1882\" one hundred and fifteen thousand (115,000) acres of unsurveyed, unoccupied, and unreserved crown land, situate in the land recording district of Kootenay; a sketch plan of the land required is drawn on the back of this application, and I propose employing Mr. Edward Stephens, C. E., to survey the same and request you to forward instructions to him in reference thereto addressed to post office, Victoria.\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nA. S. FARWELL.\nN. B\u2014A sketch plan of the land required, giving distances and boundaries, must be drawn on the back of this application.\nThis application though dated the 20th October, 1883, does not appear to have been received at the office of the Surveyor General until the 19th November, 1883, and a survey came to the office some time in the autumn of 1881, prior the surveyor general says, to the 17th and 18th November, at which date under clause 79 application was made, but this survey was never accepted by the government until 13th January 1885.\nThe evidence bearing on the application is as follows: Mr. Gore, Surveyor General of British Columbia: Q. Will you produce Mr. Farwell's application? (Application produced).\nQ. When was that received at the office? A. It is stamped November 19th, 1883. It is an application for 115,000 acres.\nq. Is that the only application you have with regard to Mr. Farwell's land grant? A. Yes.\nQ. Is the land conveyed to him a portion of that land? A. Yes.\nQ. Was any plan furnished to the office of Mr. Farwell? A. There is a plan drawn on the back of the application for 115,000 acres.\nQ. Any with regard to the 1175 acres? A. He furnished a plan with the field notes of the survey of 1175 acres.\nQ. Then he reduced his application afterwards? A. This is the only application I had.\nQ. There was not an application for 1175 acres? A. None.\nq. When was the plan accepted by the Chief Commissioner? A. It was finally accepted in January, 1885 I believe. (Application handed in marked D.)\n* * * * *\nQ. You were aware of Mr. Farwell's application of that date I suppose? A. Oh yes.\nQ. And when did the survey come in? A. The survey came in sometime in the autumn of 1884, prior to the 17th or 18th November, at which date under clause 79 application wan made. The acceptance of the survey was on the 13th January, 1885 in the Gazette.

C., January 13th, 1885.\nOn the 16th January, 1885, letters patent were issued to defendant as follows:\u2014\nTo all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting:\nKnow ye, that We by these presents, for Us, our Heirs and Successors, in consideration of the sum of eleven hundred and seventy-five dollars to us paid, give and grant unto Arthur Stanhope Farwell, his heirs and assigns, all that Parcel or Lot of Land situate in Kootenay District, said to contain eleven hundred and seventy-five acres, more or less, and more particularly described on the map or plan hereunto annexed and coloured red and numbered Lot six (6) Group one (1) on the Official Plan or Survey of the said Kootenay District, in the Province of British Columbia, to have and to hold the said Parcel or Lot of Land and all and singular the premises hereby granted with their appurtenances, unto the said Arthur Stanhope Farwell, his heirs and assigns forever.\nMany of the questions raised in this case (I may say all the questions on which the case turned in the court below) have been disposed of in the case of The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada, and the only question remaining to be decided, it appears to me is: Had the Government of British Columbia any right to make this grant?\nBy 47 Vic. ch. 14 passed on 19 December, 1883, the act of 1880 is amended to read as follows:\u2014\nFrom and after the passing of this act there shall be, and there is granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, in trust, to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands along the line of the railway before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located, to a width of 20 miles on each side of the said line as provided in the order in council, section 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into confederation; but nothing in this section contained shall prejudice the right of the province to receive and be paid by the Dominion Government the sum of $100,000 per annum, in half yearly payments in advance, in consideration of the lands so conveyed, as provided in section 11 of the terms of union.\nWith no other proviso than that the line of railway shall be one continuons line of railway only, connecting the seaboard of British Columbia with the Canadian Pacific Railway now under construction on the east of the Rocky Mountains.\nOn the 19th April, 1884, the Dominion parliament passed an act similar to the British Columbia act approving and ratifying the agreement set out in both acts, so that assuming the provincial act was inoperative until the legislation of the Dominion parliament in relation thereto, from that time I am of opinion that the legislature of British Columbia had put it out of the power of the executive of British Columbia to deal with the lands so referred to and granted by the said act, otherwise than in the manner and for the purpose provided for by the act.\nThere can be no question that before the passing of either of these acts the Government of British Columbia knew full well of the abandonment of the Yellow Head Pass and the adoption of the line on which the road was subsequently constructed, as the following correspondence clearly demonstrates:\u2014\nThe Hon. Mr. Trutch, C.M.G., to the Hon. Mr. Smithe.\nDominion Government Agent's Office,\nVictoria, B.C., November 5, 1883.\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to apprise you that I have received from the Right Honorable Sir John A. Macdonald, a reply by telegraph to the telegram and letter which I addressed to him on the 24th ult. upon the subject matter of the interview which I had on that day with you and your colleagues in the ministry.\nSir John Macdonald directs me to inform you that the Canadian Pacific Railway have definitely abandoned the Yellow Head Pass, and have adopted a line crossing the Rocky Mountains by the Bow River Pass and the Selkirk Range, through what is known as Roger's Pass, by Beaver Creek and Illecillewant River Valleys, and through Eagle Creek Pass to Kamloops. Some improvements may be made in this line between the summit of the Rocky Mountains and the Columbia River before work is recommenced in the spring, which may render it not strictly accurate to speak of the line as following the Kicking Horse Pass, although that Pass is entirely practicable and will be followed, unless some one of the alternative lines in the immediate vicinity, which are now being examined, is found to afford lighter work and easier grading.\nSir John Macdonald further directs me to request you to place the belt of land, 20 miles on each side of the railway line along the route so above indicated, under reservation, as the land to be granted to the Dominion by British Columbia, instead of the land along the Yellow Head Pass conveyed by the British Columbia Act, 43 Vic. ch. 11, in accordance with the agreement now existing between your government and that of the Dominion.\nI beg, accordingly, that you will be pleased to have the said lands at once placed under reservation for this purpose.\nI have, etc.,\n(Signed) JOSEPH W. TRUTCH.\nAnd which the Government of British Columbia acted upon on the 20th November, 1883, by a public notice in the Royal Gazette as follows:\u2014\nPUBLIC NOTICE.\nWhereas section 2 of 46 Vic. ch. 14 grants to the Dominion Government, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, a tract of land not exceeding 20 miles in width on each side of the line of the railway, wherever it may be finally located, in lieu of that heretofore conveyed along the line located to Yellow Head Pass.\nAnd whereas official information has been received that a definite route has been adopted by way of Bow River Pass, and that via Yellow Head Pass abandoned.\nPublic notice is therefore hereby given, that the following belt of land is hereby reserved until further notice, viz: \u2014\nCommencing at Kamloops thence on a line by the Valley to the South Thompson River and through Eagle Creek Pass to the Columbia River, thence by the Illecillewant River and Beaver Creek Valleys, and by Roger's Pass through the Selkirk range to the boundary of British Columbia at the Bow River Pass, and having a width of 20 miles on each side of said line.\nWM. SMITHE,\nChief Com. of Lands and Works.\nLands and Works Department;\nVictoria, B.C., November 20, 1883.\nMr. Smithe on 24th November, 1883, replied as follows to the above letter of Mr. Trutch: \u2014\nHon. Mr. Smithe to Hon. Mr. Trutch, C.M.G.\nVictoria, 24th November, 1883.\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 5th instant, in which you advise me of a telegram received from the Right Honorable Sir John A. Macdonald, which conveys intelligence that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have definitely abandoned the Yellow Head Pass route, and have adopted one by way of Bow River Pass, and through what is known as Roger's Pass in the Selkirk Range of Mountains by Beaver Creek and Illecillewant River Valleys, through Eagle Creek Pass to Kamloops, and in which you request that, pending the final passage of the Settlement Bill, a reserve shall be placed on the land along the proposed new line of railway.\nIn complying with the request of the Dominion Government, thus conveyed to me, I cannot refrain from urging on you the pressing necessity that exists for giving facilities to settlers to take up lands within this belt. The Yellow Head Pass route has been under reserve for many years, to the great injury of provincial interests, and that reserve and the conveyance of lands was made by the province in fulfilment of the terms of union, and hitherto the province has had just cause of complaint owing to the delays which have occurred by reason of the Dominion Government not having recognised its own responsibilities.\nThe clause in the Settlement Act under which alone the demand can properly be made for a grant along the new line of railway in place of that abandoned along the old route, can only be fully acted on when the conditions upon which it is based have been complied with.\nThis government, however, recognize the fact that the Dominion Government have partially assumed the responsibilities which that act entails on them, and giving that government the fullest credit for a sincere desire to complete the arrangements which have been agreed upon, have made the reserve asked for.\nIt will of course be necessary before any actual possession of these lands can be allowed to the Dominion Government under the act that the Dominion Parliament shall have passed a confirming act, and that the Dominion Government by order in council shall have formally abandoned the Yellow Head route and have adopted one by way of Bow River Pass.\nI have, etc.,\n(Signed) WM. SMITHE.\nThis notice and letter which I have just read likewise show that the only objection raised to the Dominion Government taking the actual possession of these lands was that before a clear possession could be allowed to the Dominion, it was necessary that the Dominion Parliament should have passed a confirming act, and have formally abandoned the Yellow Head route and adopted one by way of Bow River Pass.\nOn this point Mr. Trutch, agent of the Dominion Government, thus speaks and there is nothing to the contrary in the evidence:\u2014\nQ. You say in this letter of 1883 that Sir John Macdonald requests that a reservation be placed upon the land along the line of Yellow Head Pass? A. It was of course granted.\nQ. Then what was the objection of the Dominion Government? A. It is very clear; the statute says that the conveyance made at that date was for a railway belt along the line wherever finally located. On the 5th November I wrote that the line had been officially located along Eagle and Rogers Passes, and therefore that is the line claimed under the statute.\nQ. If the land was already conveyed there was no necessity for asking the Local Government to place it under reservation. Does it not appear to you as if the act of 1883 was not operating as a conveyance. A. The Local Government desired to place it under reservation.\nQ. Did you request them to do it? A. Yes; they were requested because it was their desire, as they wanted to know where the belt would be.\nQ. It was in consequence of the request of the Provincial Government that the specific line was located in order that the rest of the land might be released? A. Yes undoubtedly. My letter was communicated to the Premier in order that the act relieving the land not identified in that letter from reservation should be passed, and as a matter of fact that was the course taken.\nTherefore so soon as the act of the Dominion adopting and confirming the legislation of the Province was passed, the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway thus selected by the Dominion Government and adopted by British Columbia passed out of the control of the executive government of British Columbia, and was held by the crown as represented by the. Governor General of Canada, no necessity existing for, nor indeed could there be, any actual change of possession because the possession was always in the crown whether held for British Columbia or the Dominion.\nThis line indicated in Mr. Trutch's letter was no doubt taken possession of by the Dominion Government.\nMr. Trutch says:\u2014\nQ. In May 1886 was railway construction going on in the province? A. Certainly.\nQ. When did that commence? A. In the month of May 1880.\nQ. The construction from Yale up to Savona? A. On the section contracted for between Emory and Boston Bar was the first section that was commenced.\nQ. That was by the Dominion Government? A. By Onderdonk under contract with the Minister of Railways.\nQ. When did construction commence east of Kamloops towards Kicking Horse Pass, east of Savona? A. It commenced in the spring of 1884, about April or May. That work was under contract between Savona and Kamloops between Onderdonk and the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nQ. That was along the line as defined in your letter of the 5th November? A. Yes, on the south shore of Kamloops Lake.\nQ. Does the railway pass through the land claimed by defendant? A I don't know exactly, I believe it does. Mr. Davie: Speak as to your own knowledge. Mr. Drake: You will know if you see the plan? A. I presume I shall be able to identify the land. (Plan produced).\nQ. On looking on that plan you say that the railway passes through? A. Yes, I recognize at this sketch the Illecillewant river emptying into the Columbia, and I know that the railway crosses about three quarters of a mile north of that, which places the line of railway within the tract of land colored red, Gp. 1, lot 6.\nAnd this line so far as can be discovered from the evidence has never been departed from, and it has not been disputed that the railway has been constructed on the line thus indicated, nor is it denied that the land in dispute is within the 20 miles' belt. But the defendant claims this land under and by virtue of the 45 Vic. cit. 6 (21 April, 1882), \"An Act to amend the Land Act, 1872,\" which is as follows:\u2014\nStatutes of British Columbia, 1882, 45 Vic., ch. 6.\nSECTION 1 SUB. SEC. 4.\u2014\" SALE OF UNSURVEYED LANDS.\"\n1. Every person desiring to purchase unsurveyed, unoccupied, and unreserved Crown lands shall give two months notice of his intended application to purchase by a notice inserted, at the expense of the applicant, in the British Columbia Gazette, and in any newspaper circulating in the district wherein such land lies; and such notice shall state the name of the applicant, the locality, boundaries and extent of the land applied for, such notice shall be dated, and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the land sought to be acquired, and on the government office, if any, in the district. He shall also place at each angle or corner of the land to be applied for a stake or post at least four inches square and standing not less than four feet above the surface of the ground. Except such land is so staked off before the above notice is given all the proceedings taken by the applicant shall be void. He shall also have the land required surveyed, at his own cost, by a surveyor approved of and acting under the instructions of the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works or Surveyor General; and such lands shall be surveyed on the rectangular or square system now adopted by the government, and all lines shall be run due north and south and due east and west, except where from the nature of surveys made it would be impossible to conform to the above system; and the said survey of the said land shall be connected with some known point in previous surveys, or with some other known point or boundary, unless otherwise ordered by the Chief Commissioner of Land and Works or Surveyor General; and the price of said land shall, except as further provided, be one dollar per acre, which shall be paid in full at the time of the purchase; but no title can be acquired to any such land until after such land, shall have been surveyed, and such survey shall have been accepted by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works or Surveyor General in writing and payment made for the said land; provided always, that it shall not be lawful to survey or sell any lands under authority of this section in such manner as to dispose of a less quantity of land than 160 acres, measuring 40 chains by 40 chains, except where such area cannot be obtained or such measurement carried out, nor shall the application above mentioned of itself confer any right or title to the land applied for upon the applicant.\nThe defendant thus claims that on the 22nd November, 1883, he made application for a patent of lands covering the lands in dispute, that these lands were surveyed in October, 1884, and that the survey was accepted by the Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands in British Columbia on 13th January, 1885, and that his grant issued on the 16th January, 1885.\nI am clearly of opinion that the application of the defendant on the 22nd November, 1883, conferred on him no right, title, or interest in the land applied for. I am also of opinion that the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as well in law as in fact, was on the 13th January, 1885, when the survey and plan were fyled in the Lands and Works Department of British Columbia, duly located, that the filing of such survey and plan conferred on defendant no right, title, or interest in the land, and that on the 16th day of January, 1885, the date of the grant, the Province of British Columbia had ceased to have any interest in the land covered by said grant, and that the title to the same was in the crown for the use and benefit of the Dominion of Canada and consequently conveyed no right, title, or interest to the defendant in said lands.\nThere was nothing in the objection that as Canada only gave the company every alternate section only the alternate sections could be appropriated in British Columbia and until a survey it was not possible to say whether the land in question belonged to Canada or not, but the conclusive answer to this is that British Columbia, agreed to grant a similar extent of public lands along the line of railway throughout the entire length of British Columbia (not exceeding 20 miles on each side thereof) as might' be appropriated for the same purpose by Canada from the public lands in the Territories and Manitoba. Canada appropriated 25 millions of acres. A belt of land 20 miles wide on each side of the Canadian Pacific Railway, viz., 508 miles long, the length then in British Columbia by 40 miles wide would contain 13,004,809 acres, so that it is quite clear there is not the slightest pretence for the claim set up that the Dominion are entitled only to alternate sections in British Columbia, which would not give them nearly the amount of land to which they would be entitled. Under these circumstances the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be reversed and the contention of the crown on behalf of the Dominion Government should prevail.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The title of the crown depends upon section 2 of the British Columbia Act 47 Vic. ch. 14 passed on the 19th December, 1883, which is as follows:\u2014\n2. Section 1 of the act of the legislature of British Columbia, No. 11, 1880, intituled: An act to authorize the grant of certain public lands on the mainland of British Columbia to the government of the Dominion of Canada, for Canadian Pacific Railway purposes, is hereby amended so as to read as follows:\u2014\nFrom and after the passing of this act there shall be, and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government for the purpose of constructing and to aid in the construction of the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the mainland of British Columbia, in trust, to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands (along the line of the railway) before mentioned, wherever it may be finally located to a width of twenty miles on each side of the said line, as provided in the order in council, section 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into confederation; but nothing in this section contained shall prejudice the right of the province to receive and be paid by the Dominion Government the sum of $100,000 per annum, in half yearly payments in advance in consideration of the lands so conveyed as provided in section 11, of the terms of union; provided always that the line of railway before referred to shall be one continuous line of railway only, connecting the sea-board of British Columbia with the Canadian Pacific Railway, now under construction on the east of the Rocky Mountains.\nThe land which the crown by this information seeks to recover is within the belt of twenty miles on each side of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as that line of railway was finally located and constructed.\nThe respondent claims title by virtue of a grant by the crown under the great seal of British Columbia made upon the 16th January, 1885. I am of opinion that the objection that the statute required a grant or some subsequent instrument to carry it into execution wholly fails. It was clearly self executing and operated immediately and conclusively so soon as the event on which it was limited to take effect happened, that is as soon as the \"line of railway was finally located.\" Whether upon that event occurring it operated by relation from the date of its enactment so as to avoid intermediate grants by the Province of British Columbia is an inquiry which the facts of the present case do not require us to enter upon for the respondent acquired no title to this land until after the line of railway was finally located.\nThe objection that the statute is void and inoperative (for it amounts to that) because the grant made by the statute is to the \"Dominion Government\" instead of to the Queen her heirs and successors is equally untenable. This statute is not to be construed according to technical rules applicable to deeds, but according to the general rules of statutory construction one of which is that it must be so construed as to be effective, and it shall not be held to fail for want of certainty unless it is impossible to put a sensible meaning upon the language in which it is expressed. The expression \"Dominion Government\" used in making the grant which the statute was intended to effect is, it is true, a colloquial and not a technical designation for the crown in the right of the Dominion to whom the grant was doubtless intended to be made, but it is not so devoid of meaning as to warrant us in holding the statute ineffectual because of its use; it must on the contrary be read as symbolising the proper technical words which might have been used, and for which it was meant to be an equivalent, viz.: \"there is hereby \"granted to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in \"right of, and for the use of her Dominion of Canada,\" and if these terms had been actually used in the act, no force of ingenuity would have been able to raise a doubt as to their conclusive effect in vesting the property in the lands in question in the crown in right of the Dominion.\nAs regards the words \"final location of the railway\" I am unable to see that any difficulty can arise as to the meaning to be attached to them. It was of course a necessary preliminary to the making of the railway that the line on which it was to be made should be finally ascertained, surveyed and marked out, and it was the final completion of this preliminary work which is clearly meant and most appropriately and correctly designated in the statute as the final location of the line of railway. The word location is one of common use in this country as a term to designate the selection of a line of railway or a line of road, or the ascertainment of a parcel of wild land for the purpose of settlement, and used as we find it here it can possibly mean nothing else than the final selection of the line upon which the railway was afterwards to be laid down. To give it the only other meaning which has been suggested, namely, that it is used as convertible with \"construction or completion\" so far from being a just interpretation would be doing nothing less than wresting it from the well known and understood meaning which usage has attached to it.\nThat the line was finally located in the sense just adverted to at a date anterior to the 15th January, 1885, the earliest date to which the respondent's title can be ascribed, is a fact of common notoriety, and I do not consider that any objection was raised to a defect of formal proof on this head. Should any such objection be insisted upon, this court may, as having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment which the Exchequer Court ought to have given, order that the crown may be at liberty to establish the fact by the affidavit of the Chief Engineer of the Pacific Railway pursuant to the general orders of the Exchequer Court.\nAs regards the respondent's title that, as I have said, cannot be referred to any earlier date than the 15th January 1885, the day before the grant to him was made when the defendant's survey was delivered to the Commissioner of lands in British Columbia, (if indeed any title pre-emptive or otherwise vested in him prior to the date of the letters patent), and the line of railway had been finally located long before that date. The respondent clearly got no title under what he pretends was his original location of 115,000 acres by his letter to the Commissioner of the 20th October, 1883. No statutory provision can be referred to as conferring any title or right of pre-emption as a consequence of that letter. At most the handing in of the survey of a particular parcel of land on the 15th January, 1885, gave the respondent a claim of right for the first time though that too is not free from doubt and question which, however, it is not worth while to consider as the grant passed the next day. Section 76 of the British Columbia Land Act, 1884, does not help the respondent, it only saves rights of pre-emption previously acquired; and none had been acquired as regards the 1175 acres now in question.\nThe result is that when the letters patent under the great seal of British Columbia, issued on the 16th January, 1885, assuming to grant this land to the respondent, the province had no title to the land, and consequently nothing to grant, an absolute title thereto, having previously vested in the Dominion under the statute, 47 Vic., ch 14, upon the final location and ascertainment of the line of railway.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court must therefore, on the affidavit mentioned being filed if the respondent requires it, be reversed and judgment entered for the crown with costs in both courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014In this case I am in favor of allowing the appeal. In the case of Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada[4]; which was decided by this court yesterday, I had occasion to express my opinion upon the question of the ownership of the precious metals in these railway lands, but as regards the construction to be put upon the statute granting provincial lands in aid of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, I think the expressions used are quite sufficient to convey the lands to the Dominion, and therefore Farwell's title from the Government of British Columbia is void; but I come to this conclusion, with the reserve I made in the other case, that the conveyance does not cover the gold and silver mines.\nHENRY J\u2014My judgment has already been given in this case. I adhere to the same views as I entertained when I delivered the judgment in the Exchequer Court, and I refer to it and think the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J\u2014I concur with the majority of this court that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons sufficiently stated in the case of Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada (1); the title of Canada is referable to the treaty alone, and the acts of Parliament which were passed to carry out the provisions of that treaty.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitors for respondent: McIntyre, Lewis & Code.\n[1] 93 U.

Is such an assignment within the provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Act of Ontario, R.S.O. c. 119?\nWhere such an assignment was made, and the property was formally handed over by the directors to the trustees, who took possession and subsequently advertised and sold the property under the deed of assignment.\nHeld, that if the assignment did come within the terms of the act its provisions were fully complied with, the deed being duly registered and there being an actual and continued change of possession as required by section 5.\nIn such deed of assignment the property was described as \u201call the real estate, lands, tenements and hereditaments of the said debtors (company) whatsoever and wheresoever, of or to which they are now seized or entitled, or of or to which they may have any estate, right or interest of any kind or description, with the appurtenances, the particulars of which are more particularly set out in the schedule hereto, and all and singular the personal estate and effects, stock in trade, goods, chattels, * * * and all other the personal estate, and effects whatsoever and wheresoever, whether upon the premises where the debtors\u2019 business is carried on or elsewhere, and which the said debtors are possessed of or entitled to in any way whatever.\nThe schedule annexed specifically designated the real estate and included the foundry, erections and buildings thereon erected, and all articles such as engines, &c., in or upon said premises:\nHeld, that this was a sufficient description of the property intended to be conveyed to satisfy section 23 of R.S.O. ch. 119. McCall v. Wolff[1] approved and distinguished.\nBut see now 48 Vic. ch. 26 sec. 12 passed since this case was decided.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] reversing the judgment of Ferguson J. in the Chancery Division[3] in favor of the appellants.\nThe facts of the case are as follows: The \u201cFarm and Dairy Utensil Manufacturing Company\u201d was incorporated by letters patent, dated the 27th July, 1881, under the Canada Joint Stock Companies\u2019 Act, 1877.\nThe company being unable to meet their liabilities a meeting of the board of directors was held on the 14th August, 1884. At this meeting a resolution was passed that the company should make an assignment of all their estate and effects, and that the president and secretary should execute such assignment to the respondents, which they did on the 15th August, 1884.\nThe assignment was executed by the president and the secretary of the company, by the trustees, and by a creditor, and was registered in the registry office for the county of Brant and in the office of the clerk of the county court of the same county on the 16th August, 1884. It purports to convey all the real estate of the debtors as set forth in the schedule annexed thereto, and also their personal estate and effects, goods and chattels, which were described as follows: \u201cThe personal estate and effects, stock in trade, goods\u2019 chattels, rights and credits, fixtures, book debts\u2019 notes, accounts, books of account, choses in action, and all other personal estate and effects whatsoever and wheresoever, whether upon the premises where the debtors\u2019 business is carried on or elsewhere, and which the said debtors are possessed of or entitled to in any way whatever.\u201d\nThe trusts of the deed were for the conversion of the property into money if required, payment of debts, and payment over of any surplus to the company.\nThere was no by-law, or any assent of the shareholders, or any authority from the shareholders, at a meeting of the shareholders duly called or otherwise, to the said assignment.\nThe appellants, execution creditors of the company, caused the property comprised in said deed to be seized to satisfy their several executions, and an interpleader order was obtained to test the validity of the deed and ascertain the title to such property. The interpleader issue was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson who gave judgment in favor of the execution creditors, holding that the description of the property in the deed was insufficient within the meaning of sec. 23 of R.S.O ch. 119, and inasmuch as there was no immediate delivery to the trustees, followed by an actual and continued change of possession, the assignment was invalid. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, and held that although the description of the property was not sufficient, there had been such an actual and continued change of possession as would vest the property in the trustees. The Court of Appeal also held that the directors had power to make the assignment. The execution creditors appealed from the last mentioned judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe questions argued before the Court of Appeal, and submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada are:\u2014\n1. That the said judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson, delivered on the 17th day of February, 1885, being an interlocutory judgment, no appeal lay therefrom to the Court of Appeal.\n2. That the directors of a manufacturing and trading company, such as the \u201cFarm and Dairy Utensil Manufacturing Company\u201d was, had no power or capacity, without the assent and authority of the shareholders, duly evidenced by by-law at a meeting called for that purpose or otherwise, to authorise the execution of an assignment of the company\u2019s estate and effects for the benefit of creditors.\n3. That the assignment for the benefit of creditors was within the act relating to chattel mortgages and bills of sale relating to personal property (R.S.O., ch. 119.)\n4 That the description of the property assigned by the said deed of assignment, bearing date the 15th day of August, 1884, was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of sec. 23 of R.S.O., ch. 119.\n5. That the sale of the goods and chattels purported to be conveyed by the said deed of assignment was not accompanied by an immediate delivery and followed by actual and continued change of possession as is required by sec. 5 R.S.O., ch. 119.\nRobinson Q.C. and Hall for the appellants.\nAs to the right of the plaintiff to appeal from the judgment of Ferguson J. see McAndrew v. Barker,[4]; King v. Simmonds,[5].\nThe directors could not make this assignment without the consent of the shareholders, as each shareholder has a right to have a voice in the disposal of the property of the company. See Donly v Holmwood,[6]; Beaston v. Farmers\u2019 Bank of Delaware,[7]; McNeil v. Reliance Ins. Co.[8].\nThe description of the property was insufficient according to the decision of this court in McCall v. Wolff[9] and Kinloch v. Scribntr[10].\nThe authorities cited on the hearing before Mr. Justice Ferguson[11] were also relied on.\nDr. McMichael Q.C. and S.H. Blake Q.C. (Wilson Q.C. with them) for the respondents.\nThe question raised as to the right of appeal is not open to the parties here, but if it is it is untenable. See Dawson v. Fox[12].; Robinson v. Tucker[13].\nThat the assignment is not beyond the powers of the directors is clear from the authorities Eppright v. Nickerson[14]; White Water Canal Co. v. Vallette[15]. Brice on Ultra Vires[16].\nOn the other points raised for argument the learned counsel relied on the authorities cited in the report of the case in the Chancery Division[17].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case I think the appeal to the court below was rightly taken, and with reference to the first proposition, that the directors had no right to assign the property to trustees for the payment of their debts, I am clearly of opinion that they not only had the right to do it, but that, whenever they found the company were unable to meet their engagements and were in an unquestionably insolvent condition, and that individual creditors were seeking to obtain\njudgments by which they might sweep away from the body of the creditors, for their individual benefit, the assets of the company, they not only had the right, but it was their bounden duty, in honesty and justice, to take such steps in their management of the affairs of the company entrusted to them by law as would preserve the property for the general benefit of all the creditors without priority or distinction, and this with out any special statutory provision, upon general principles of justice and equity, and without the formal sanction of the whole body of shareholders. The board of directors, in my opinion, has unlimited powers over the property of the corporation so to deal with it as to pay the just debts of the corporation.\nAs to the question whether the statute applies to an assignment such as this for the general benefit, I do not think it necessary to enter upon a discussion of this question upon which there seems to be some diversity of opinion among the judiciary of the province of Ontario, because it is not necessary, in my opinion, for the determination of this case, for, assuming for the purposes of this case that such an instrument does come within the terms of the Ontario act, I am of opinion that there was a sufficient description of property. I have nothing to add to what I said in the case of McCall v. Wolff[18], and I said nothing in that case which interferes with the judgment of the court below in the present case, there having been, in this case, sufficient material on the face of the mortgage to indicate how the property might be identified after proper inquiries were instituted. I am also of opinion that the statute has been, in other respects, complied with The instrument appears to have been duly registered, and there was evidence of an actual and continued change of possession before the issuing of the execution in this case. I therefore think this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal by the learned Chief Justice of that court so far as the same relates to powers of the directors; and I particularly agree in that passage of his judgment in support of which he cites the observations of Blackburn J. in the case of Taylor v. Chichester Ry. Co.[19] Further, I agree in the judgment of Patterson and Osler JJ. as to the evidence being ample to show that there was a taking of possession sufficient to meet the requirements of the statute.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFournier J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal in this case should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I entirely agree with my brother Strong in the opinions which he has expressed on every point in this case, as to the possession, the actual and continued change of possession, and the sufficiency of the description of the property as required by the act, even if it was necessary to comply with its provisions; and I am of opinion that a sale or transfer by the directors of a company, as in this case giving everything up to secure to their creditors, share and share alike, all the property of the company, was an act which the directors had full authority to do, and that their affixing the seal of the corporation to the document, which I am of opinion they likewise had authority to do, made it the act of the corporation.\nI am also of opinion that such a document as that is not one which requires to be registered, nor do. I find that in such a case in Ontario there has been any decision to the contrary. It has been held that where an assignment giving a preference has been made registration is necessary, but not for such a deed as the one in the case before us.\nSo that on all the points in the case I think the judgment of the court below was correct, and am in favor of affirming it and dismissing the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing a judgment of the High Court of Justice of Ontario on an interpleader issue tried by Ferguson J\u00bb without a jury. The interpleader issue was between the above respondents as plaintiffs claiming, as assignees in trust for the benefit of all the creditors of a certain company called The Farm and Dairy Utensil Manufacturing Company, limited, certain goods and chattels seized and taken in execution, as the property of the said company, at the respective suits of the above named four appellants, who were made the defendants in the said interpleader issue. The learned judge before whom the issue was tried without a jury rendered judgment upon the issue in favor of the defendants, the execution creditors, finding the assignment to the plaintiffs in trust for creditors to be invalid as against the defendants under ch 119 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario The grounds of appeal stated are:[20]\nAs to the first of the above grounds, by the 28th section of the Judicature Act it is enacted that every action and proceeding in the High Court of Justice and all business arising out of the same should, so far as practicable, be heard, determined and disposed of before a single judge, and that a judge sitting elsewhere than in a Divisional Court is to decide all questions coming properly before him, and is not to reserve any case or any point in any case for the consideration of a Divisional Court, and that in all such cases any judge sitting in court should be deemed to constitute a court.\nThe judgment therefore which is appealed from is a judgment pronounced by the High Court of Justice upon the matters in question in the interpleader issue, and in its terms it is a \u201cjudgment in favor of the defendants in the issue, the execution creditors, with costs.\u201d\nNow by order 1 in the schedule to the Judicature Act, it is provided that with respect to interpleader the procedure and practice then used by the courts of common law under the Interpleader Act, ch. 54 of the revised statutes of Ontario, should apply to all actions and to all divisions of the High Court of Justice, and that the application by a defendant should be made at any time after being served with a writ or summons and before delivering a defence.\nThe application for an interpleader issue in the present case not being by a defendant, but by the sheriff on account of a claim made by the above respondents to goods and chattels seized by the sheriff as the property of the Farm and Dairy Utensil Manufacturing Company under executions issued upon judgments recovered against them at the suit of divers persons, proceedings were taken under the provisions of the 10th section of the Interpleader Act, for the relief of sheriffs, and a feigned issue was ordered at the suit of the claimants (the above respondents) as plaintiffs against the execution creditors (the above appellants) as defendants to try whether the property seized by the sheriff under the executions was in fact the property of the claimants or not as against the rights acquired by the execution creditors in virtue of their judgments and executions Now the finding and judgment having been in favor of execution creditors that judgment was a judicial determination by the High Court of Justice upon the merits of the matter in contestation, as much as a like judgment upon matters in contestation between plaintiffs and defendants in an action originating in a writ of summons would be; and the judgment might have been entered of record under the provisions of the 19th section of the Interpleader Act, and execution might have been issued thereon for the costs adjudged to the defendants if not paid within the time prescribed in the 20th section. As to the actions at the suit of the defendants against the Farm and Dairy Utensil Manufacturing Company, in which actions the judgment on the interpleader issue is contended to be an interlocutory judgment, they had already been reduced to final judgment and nothing more remained to be done in them except to obtain the fruits of the judgments under the executions; \u2018 an order it is true might be required to be made, consequential upon the adjudication on the merits of the matter in contestation in the interpleader issue being absolute, for the payment out of court of such monies as may have been, if any had been, realised by the sheriff by sale of the property seized and paid into court to await the determination of the interpleader issue; but such an order could have no effect whatever of the nature of making the adjudication upon the merits of the question tried on the interpleader issue a whit more final than it already was by the judgment of the court rendered in favor of the execution creditors, and if no such monies had been realised and paid into court no such order would be required and nothing would remain to be done but to enter the judgment of record and for the sheriff to proceed to realise the amounts ordered to be levied by the executions in his hands. The judgment of the court upon an interpleader issue tried on the application of a sheriff for protection from claims made to property seized in execution, affirming the validity of the seizure in execution and determining conclusively, until reversed by some court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the execution creditors to the fruits of the seizure as against the claimants, is, in my opinion, of a different character from a judgment on an interpleader issue ordered in the progress of a suit for the purpose of determining a point necessary, in the opinion of the court, to be determined before judgment should be pronounced on the matters in contestation in the suit, during the progress of which the interpleader had been ordered. Such was the case of McAndrew v. Barker[21]; the order there was purely interlocutory and the subject of it was deemed necessary to be determined preliminary to rendering judgment on the merits in the two cases then pending in the court in the progress of which the interpleader issue had been ordered and tried; and there the question was not whether or not there was an appeal from an interlocutory order, but whether it had been brought in time. The case of Cummins v. Herron[22] was a similar case. Now, what the 35th section of the Judicature Act enacts is, that there shall be no appeal to the Court of Appeal from an interlocutory order in case before the passing of that act there would have been no relief from a like order by appeal to the Court of Appeal. The contention is that the judgment of the court presided over by Mr. Justice Ferguson on the trial of the above interpleader issue is an \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d within the meaning of the above section, and it is said that before the passing of the Judicature Act there would have been no appeal from a like order to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Now, as the judgment of Mr Justice Ferguson on this interpleader issue is, by the Ontario Judicature Act, a judgment of the High Court of Justice, and not merely in the nature of a finding of a jury or of a judge sitting alone without a jury under the provisions of the Administration of Justice Act of 1873, to find a like order, on an interpleader issue before the passing of the Judicature Act, to that contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson in the present case we must look for a judgment of one of the Superior Courts as formerly constituted upon the matter in contestation on a like interpleader issue. Such a case was Wilson v. Kerr[23]. There an interpleader issue ordered at the instance of a sheriff, as in the present case, came on to be tried before a jury, the only tribunal then recognised for trial of issues of fact in the courts of common law. At the trial before the late Sir John Robinson, then Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Upper Canada, it was agreed, upon the evidence being taken, that the matter in issue should be left to the court to determine upon the evidence as taken, the court being at liberty to draw such inferences as they might think a jury should. The court rendered their judgment for the defendants the execution creditors just as Mr. Justice Ferguson has in the present case rendered the judgment of the High Court of Justice for Ontario. From that judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Error and Appeal and the objection was taken that the judg- ment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench on the interpleader issue being only interlocutory there was no appeal from such judgment to the Court of Appeal but the court held that there was, and they heard the appeal, upon the authority of Withers vs. Parker[24]. There the Court of Exchequer held that the English Common Law Procedure Act of 1854 gave an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decisions of the courts of law upon interpleader issues equally as in all other cases, it being considered that the mischief to be remedied being as great in an interpleader issue as in any other the Legislature intended that there should be an appeal in the one case equally as in the other. This was a decision under the provisions of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854 incorporated into the Upper Canada Common Law Procedure Act of 1856. \u201cWe find then that under the Common Law Procedure Act of Upper Canada there was an appeal from the judgment of a court of common law upon the matters in contestation on the trial of an interpleader issue. Then in 1877 the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, by sec. 18 of ch. 38 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, enacted that an appeal should lie to the Court of Appeal from every judgment of any of the Superior Courts, or of a judge sitting alone as and for any of such courts, in a cause or matter depending in any of the said courts or under any of the powers given by the Administration of Justice Act. Now the words in this section\u2014\u201cJudgment in a cause or matter depending, &c.,\u201d\u2014are abundantly sufficient to include and must be construed to include an interpleader issue and the matter in contestation therein.\nIt follows, therefore, that the judgment of the High Court of Justice of Ontario pronounced by Mr. Justice Ferguson on the interpleader issue under consideration here, which judgment conclusively determined the rights of the parties to the matter in contestation in such interpleader issue unless and until reversed by some court of competent, that is to say, appellate, jurisdiction, is either not an \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d within the meaning of that expression in the 35th section of the Ontario Judicature Act, or if it be that it is such an order as was appealable to the Court of Appeal for Ontario prior to the passing of the Judicature Act, and in either of such cases it is appealable now. It would be singular if it should be otherwise, for the Ontario Interpleader Act gives an appeal expressly to the Court of Appeal from any decision of a county court or a county judge upon any question of law or fact arising on an interpleader issue.\nThe second of the above objections calls in question the validity of the assignment upon the contention that the directors of the company had no power or capacity to affix the corporate seal to the instrument without the assent and authority of the shareholders first obtained at a meeting of the shareholders duly convened for the purpose of authorising the execution of the assignment. If the execution of the assignment was absolutely illegal and void for want of such prior authority of the shareholders it is no doubt competent for the defendants in the interpleader issue to avail themselves of such invalidity, but if the assignment was voidable merely and not absolutely void for want of such prior authority it could only be avoided at the instance of some shareholder who should consider his interest prejudiced by such unauthorized, if it was an unauthorized, act of the directors, and until so avoided it would be valid and binding upon the company and could not be impeached by strangers, \u201cfor every shareholder may waive any right which is given to him for his own protection only; and if he has either expressly or tacitly done so, he can no longer object; and neither a stranger nor the body corporate itself can raise such an objection to a contract made by the corporation if no shareholder chooses to raise it for himself.\u201d This is the language of Blackburne J. concurred in by Willes J. in Taylor v. Chichester and Midhurst Railway Company[25].\nIn connection with this point it has been urged that the assignment was not executed bon\u00e2 fide because, at the time of its having been executed, the directors contemplated endeavouring to procure all the creditors of the company to execute a deed of composition upon their being paid 50 cents in the dollar on their claims. I confess that I am unable to appreciate the force of the argument upon which this imputation of mala fides is rested; the deed was prepared for execution and was executed at the instance of, and in pursuance of a resolution of a majority of, the creditors of the company convened on the 14th of August, 1884, for the purpose of considering the condition of the affairs of the company; it is, in its terms, an absolute assignment of all the estate real and personal of the company to trustees upon trust to sell and to apply the proceeds in payment of all the creditors of the company without preference or priority, except such as had legal right to priority, ratably and in proportion to the amounts due to them respectively, and after payment in full of all the debts of the company and of the costs and charges attending the execution of the trusts of the deed upon trust to pay over any balance, if there should be any, to the company.\nThis deed executed under the corporate seal of the company was immediately after its execution registered in the registry office of the County of Brant, in which county the lands conveyed by the deed were situate, and in the office of the clerk of the county court of the County of Brant, with the affidavits required by ch. 119 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario for the registration of bills of sale of chattels coming within the operation of that statute. The utmost publicity which registration could give was thus given. The instrument was executed not only with the knowledge of, but in pursuance of a resolution of a majority of, the creditors of the company and, as pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in his judgment, with the knowledge and consent also of the holders of shares in the company to the amount of $40,000 out of a total capital of $47,500. On the 18th of August a deed of composition was prepared for execution and was subsequently executed by a large majority of the creditors agreeing to accept in satisfaction 50 cents on the dollar on their claims conditional upon all the creditors accepting the like terms, which deed became inoperative by reason of a few of the creditors refusing to accept the composition. Now how can the fact that, at the time of the execution of the deed of assignment in trust for creditors, the directors may have entertained the hope that all the creditors would accept terms of composition which a majority of them were willing to accept affect with the taint of mala fides a deed of trust absolute in its terms providing for all creditors alike and prepared and executed at the instance of a majority of the creditors? The fair and reasonable construction of the whole matter, in my opinion, is that in the interest of the creditors of the company the deed of assignment was executed at the request of the majority of them as an absolute instrument and bon\u00e2 fide for the trust purposes declared therein, and that a number of the creditors having expressed their willingness to accept a composition of 50 cents on the dollar a deed of composition was prepared with intent of operating only, as it only could operate, in the event of all the creditors giving their consent, which consent when given would operate in the interest of the stockholders. Now who are the persons who, under these circumstances, could with any propriety be heard to say that the trust deed of assignment was tainted with mala fides I fail to see; it surely cannot be in the power of a creditor who is provided for by the deed equally with all the other creditors to make such a charge in order that he may sweep away, it may be for his own benefit, all the property appropriated by the deed for the equal benefit of all.\nAssuming then the trust assignment to be, as I think it is, free from any just imputation of want of bona fides, the case in so far as the point now under consideration is concerned is, since the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Taylor v. The Chichester and Midhurst Railway Company has been overruled by the House of Lords, governed by the dissentient judgment of Blackburn and Wells JJ., in that case in the Exchequer Chamber and the cases relied upon by Blackburn J.[26]; and the rule to be collected from those cases which is applicable to the present may I think be thus stated\u2014All deeds executed under the corporate seal of an incorporated company which is regularly affixed are binding on the company unless it appear by the express provisions of some statute creating or affecting the company, or by necessary or reasonable inference from the enactments of such statute, that the legislature meant that such deed should not be executed; and the directors of the company have authority to affix the seal of the company to all such deeds not so, as above, forbidden by the legislature to be executed, unless they are by the express provisions of, or by necessary or reasonable inference from, the enactments of such statute forbidden to affix the seal of the company to the particular deed for the time being under consideration without compliance with some condition precedent prescribed as being essential to the validity of such deed, and which condition precedent has not been complied with.\nIt is not contended that the deed in question is illegal in the sense of the company being forbidden by any statute to execute such a deed, but it is contended that it is illegal and void by reason of the directors not having, as is contended, any power or capacity to affix the corporate seal to such a deed without a resolution of the company being first passed at a meeting of shareholders authorising the directors to execute the deed, or in other words, that the deed is illegal and void although the corporate seal has been affixed to it by resolution of the directors having charge of the seal and although the deed is signed by the proper persons to sign deeds which are binding on the company, because, as is contended, a statutory enactment either in express terms or by necessary implication forbids the directors to affix the corporate seal to a deed of the nature of that under consideration without the authority of such a resolution of the shareholders first passed as a condition precedent necessary to be complied with. The only statutory enactments in relation to the matter are contained in the 26th and 32nd sections of the Dominion statute, 40 Vic. ch. 43, respecting the incorporation of joint stock companies by letters patent, the former of which sections enacts that: The affairs of the company shall be managed by a board of not less than three nor more than fifteen directors.\nAnd the latter:\u2014\nThat the directors of the company shall have full power in all things to administer the affairs of the company and to make or cause to be made for the company any description of contract which the company may by law enter into.\nNow, it is contended that a deed purporting to transfer all the estate, real and personal, of an incorporated company for the benefit of the creditors of the company, it being in a state of insolvency, is, in effect, terminating the existence of and amounts to a winding up of the company instead of administering its affairs, which words, it is contended, necessarily imply that the power of the directors is confined to the management of the affairs of the company as \u00e0 going concern and, consequently, to the period during which the company continues to be solvent.\nNow, not to omit, although it is unnecessary to dwell upon, a plain answer to this contention, it by no means must necessarily follow that a deed conveying all the property of a company in trust for payment of its creditors amounts to a winding up of the affairs of the company and the termination of its existence, for although the creditors of the company have a just claim upon the company to have all the property of the company secured, so that it shall be appropriated in payment of the creditors equally, still it may be found that a sale of part only will prove sufficient and that a balance will remain which would enable the company to renew its operations. But assuming a company to be so insolvent that the whole assets of the company conveyed in trust for the payment of the debts of the company should be insufficient to pay those debts in full, and that nothing should remain to be paid over to the company, and so that the necessary result should be the winding up of the affairs of the company, still the making provision for payment o the debts by the trust deed was no less part of the affairs of the company because of its insolvent condition. It cannot be said that the affairs of a company cease to require the management and administration of those to whom is specially intrusted the management of its affairs when it becomes unable to pay its debts in full. The insolvency, as it appears to me, makes it to be the first duty of those having intrusted to them the management and administration of the whole of the affairs of the company to take prompt measures to secure the assets of the company for distribution among all the creditors proportionably and equally without preference or priority, and the balance, if there be any, after payment of all the debts in full, for the shareholders. When the company is in insolvent circumstances the greatest care, as it appears to me, is necessary and the best management is required to prevent the assets of the company being wasted in litigation or lost by sacrifice at forced sales under execution, in order to preserve equal distribution among the creditors and if possible something out of the wreck for the shareholders of whose affairs the directors are given the management and administration. The statute, in my opinion, warrants no such limitation of the power of the directors, for it is the management of all the affairs of the company and power to make any description of contract which the company may legally make which is vested in the directors. If then the company could legally by a vote and resolution of its shareholders make a contract the effect of which would be to appropriate its assets in payment of its creditors equally and ratably without preference,or priority, the statute in express terms declares that the directors may make for the company such a contract, and if such contract in order to be perfect requires the seal of the company to be affixed to it, the directors must have authority to affix it. However, the language of Willes J. in Wilson v. Miers[27] is strangely misinterpreted and misapplied for the purpose of supporting the contention that directors have no power to affix the seal of the company to such a deed without special authority by vote of the shareholders first given to them; the language so relied upon, separating it from its context, is as follows[28]:\u2014\nThen I apprehend there is another principle of law which applies and which makes the transaction valid, that the court is not to assume that parties propose to carry their intentions into effect by illegal means if their intention can be carried into effect by legal means. There is no presumption that the directors did in this case intend of their own heads and without consulting the company to effect a winding up. The court ought rather to presume that the directors would have been well advised and would have acted according to their duty; and on obtaining the \u00a360,000 instead of proceeding forthwith to make a winding up of their own authority, they would have held a meeting and taken the opinion of the shareholders as they were bound to do on the subject.\nThis language has been referred to as if in using it the learned judge was laying down a general principle of law applicable to all cases making it illegal for directors in the management of the affairs of a company to take any steps, however insolvent the company might be, to have the assets of the company appropriated to distribution among the creditors of the company without first calling a meeting of the shareholders and obtaining from them special authority to make such appropriation of the company\u2019s assets, whereas the languages is applied to the circumstances of the particular case then in judgment and to the duty imposed upon the directors of the particular company in question there by the articles of association of the company, the 161st clause of which provides:\u2014\nThat an absolute dissolution of the company shall be made under the following circumstances, that is to say, if a resolution for that purpose shall be reduced into writing and shall be twice read and put to the vote, and shall be carried each time by a majority of at least two thirds in number of the shareholders present personally or by proxy holding among them at least two-thirds of the shares of the company at an extraordinary general meeting, and if such resolution shall be confirmed by a like majority at a subsequent extraordinary general meeting to be held after the expiration of fourteen days but before the expiration of fourteen days next after the general meeting at which such first resolution shall have been passed, then the company shall be dissolved and it is hereby declared to be dissolved accordingly from the date of such second general meeting, except for the purposes mentioned in the next following article and without prejudice thereto.\nThis subsequent or 162nd article made provision for winding up the affairs of the company upon such dissolution being resolved upon. That it is to these clauses that the language of Willes J. applies is apparent on the face of the judgment itself, for in a previous part speaking of the directors and their powers he says:\u2014\nThey have power in terms, by Art. 5, to sell the vessels belonging to the company. They then have in the same clause of the regulations, powers given not affecting that authority; and then they have powers conferred on them in the most sweeping terms to deal with all other matters in which the company are interested. Now there could be no doubt that the sale (which was in effect of all the assets of the company) was prima facie within the authority of the directors; but it is said that that authority is taken away by the effect of the 161st and 162nd clauses of the regulations, which provide for the case of a dissolution of the company; and it is said that those provisions require, as they unquestionably do, the dissolution of the company to take place with the assent of a certain proportion in number and value of the shareholders, and that the assent of that proportion of the shareholders had not been obtained.\nThe whole judgment, in fact, is a strong argument in support of the validity of the deed in question here, in so far as the point now under consideration is concerned, for by statute the directors have been given in most sweeping terms power to manage and administer the affairs of the company in all things and make any description of contract which the company might legally make, and there is no clause in qualification of this power, as there was in Wilson v. Miers, to which the language of Willes J. applies. A case of Donly v. Holmwood[29] was cited in which the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that a joint stock company incorporated under the joint stock companies letters patent act could not, without being specially authorized by the shareholders, make an assignment in insolvency under the 14th section of the Insolvent Act of 1875. In so far as this judgment is rested upon an implied prohibition to make such an assignment, if any there be, contained in the 15th sub\u2011section of section 147 of the Insolvent Act, we are not called upon in the present case to express any opinion upon that judgment, but in so far as it is rested upon any supposed general principle of law applicable to all cases, or upon the language of Willes J. in Wilson v. Miers, in the absence of some statutory prohibition express or implied it cannot, in my opinion, be sustained.\nLastly, it was contended that as the Dominion statute 45 Vic. ch. 23 makes provision for the winding up of insolvent incorporated trading companies, such as the company in question here is, the proper procedure to have been taken was that authorized by this act. Well, that act enables a creditor for the sum of $200 to take proceedings under the act to bring a company become insolvent under its operation, and it is still quite competent for any such creditor, who thinks the dilatory and more expensive mode of procedure authorized by the act more beneficial to the creditors than carrying into effect the trust assignment which has been executed at their request, to petition the courts as they may be advised under the act. But the fact that it was competent for the creditors to have availed themselves of the provisions of that statute cannot make another proceeding, adopted in their interest and at their request for the purpose of obtaining payment of their claims against the company in a less expensive manner, to be illegal. The deed therefore cannot, in my opinion, be assailed by the respondents upon the objection made as to the power of the directors to affix the seal of the company to it.\nThe 8rd and 4th grounds of appeal are that the trust deed of assignment in question is a deed of sale of goods and chattels within ch. 119 of the revised statutes of Ontario and that it is void under that statute as against the defendants in the interpleader issue, the above named execution creditors of the company executing the assignment, by reason of insufficiency in the description of the chattel property thereby assigned.\nWith respect to this ground of appeal, which brings in review for the first time before a Court of Appeal certain decisions of the Superior courts of common law before the passing of the Judicature Act of Ontario with which the unanimous judgment of the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the High Court of Justice in a recent case of Robertson v. Thomas[30] is said to be in conflict, before entering upon a consideration of the points involved in those several cases it may be premised that the case before us appears to be defective in this, that there is nothing to show what were the goods and chattels seized by the sheriff under the executions in his hands, the title to which alone was what was in question in the interpleader issue and which is now in question before us, and this is not an immaterial defect for from the language of the deed o assignment it may be that the assignees in trust for creditors have by the terms and operation of the deed, assuming it to be within the provisions of the above statute, perfect title to some of the goods and chattels assigned although not to others, that is to say, that some of the goods and chattels assigned by the deed may be sufficiently described within the provisions of the statute although others may not be, and upon the question to which class, namely, to the sufficiently or to the insufficiently described goods the things seized under the executions belong may depend the question whether our judgment should be for the plaintiffs or the defendants in the interpleader issue. The consideration of this point which comes within the 4th ground of appeal I shall for the present defer until I shall have dealt with the point involved in the third ground of appeal which raises the question\u2014Whether a deed executed bon\u00e2 fide, assigning all the estate real and personal of a debtor to trustees in trust for sale and an equal distribution of the proceeds amongst the creditors ratably and proportionably to the amounts due to them respectively without any preference or priority save such as the law may have established and given, and without any qualification, condition or provision for the release of the debtor, or for any benefit to him whatever until all his creditors should be paid in full, is a deed of sale within ch. 119 of the revised statutes of Ontario.\nBy a statute of the legislature of Canada, passed in the year 1849, 12 Vic. ch. 74, in its first section it was enacted that every mortgage or conveyance, intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels, made in Upper Canada after the passing of the act which should not be accompanied by an immediate delivery and be followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged should be absolutely void as against the creditors of the mortgagor and as against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith unless the mortgage or conveyance, or a true copy thereof, together with an affidavit of a witness thereto sworn before a commissioner of the Queen\u2019s Bench of the due execution of the mortgage or conveyance, or of the due execution of the mortgage or conveyance of which the copy to be filed purports to be a copy, shall be filed as directed in the 2nd clause of the act. It is to be observed that this act only related to mortgages, or \u201cconveyances intended to operate as mortgages of goods and chattels.\u201d Now an instrument absolute on its face as a sale and conveyance of chattels might be intended to operate as a mortgage, the agreement for defeasance being contained in another instrument or being verbal, and by reason of the difficulty of proving, in the event of a claim being made by the bargainee in the bill of sale to the goods when seized in execution against the bargainor that the conveyance absolute on its face was intended to operate as a mortgage, the beneficial object of the act might be defeated. Whether this was or not the reason for passing the act 13-14 Vic. ch. 62 we cannot tell, but in 1850 that act was passed under the title of\nAn act to alter and amend the act requiring mortgages of personal property in Upper Canada to be filed.\nAnd after reciting that the law in force in Upper Canada requiring mortgages of personal property to be filed requires amendment, so as to require that every sale of goods and chattels which should not be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and be followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things sold, shall be in writing, it was enacted that the first section of\nAn act requiring mortgages of personal property in Upper Canada to be filed,\nShould be amended by adding at the end thereof as follows:\u2014\nAnd that every sale of goods and chattels which shall not be accompanied by an immediate delivery and followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the goods and chattels sold shall be in writing, and such writing shall be a conveyance under the provisions of the said act.\nIn 1857 these acts were amended by 20 Vic. ch. 3, by which forms of affidavit were prescribed applicable (to the cases of a mortgage and of a sale respectively, and providing that mortgages might be executed to secure future advances in certain cases, and enacting that all instruments mentioned in the act, whether for the sale or mortgage of goods and chattels, should contain such sufficient and full description thereof that the same may be thereby readily and easily known and distinguished. The clause as to the sale of chattels was as follows:\u2014\nEvery sale of goods and chattels which shall not be accompanied by an imediate delivery and followed by an actual and continued \u2022 change of possession of the goods and chattels sold shall be in writing, and such writing shall be a conveyance under the provisions of this act, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit of a witness thereto of the due execution thereof, and the affidavit of the bargainee or his agent duly authorized in writing to take such conveyance, a copy of which authority shall be attached to such conveyance that the sale is bon\u00e2 fide and for good consideration as set forth in the said conveyance, and not for the purpose of holding or enabling the bargainee to hold the goods mentioned therein against the creditors of the bargainor, and shall be registered as hereinafter provided within five days from the execution thereof, otherwise such sale shall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the bargainor and as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith.\nThe act contained other clauses not material to the point under consideration.\nIn 1858 it was enacted by 19th sec. of 22 Vic. ch. 96\nthat:\u2014\nIf any person being at the time in insolvent circumstances or unable to pay his debts in full or knowing himself to be on the eve of insolvency shall make or cause to be made any gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer of any of his goods, chattels or effects or deliver or make over or cause to be delivered or made over any bills, bonds, notes or other securities or property with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of such person or with intent of giving one or more of the creditors of such person a preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of such creditors, every such gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery shall be deemed and taken to be absolutely null and void as against the creditors of such person. Provided always that nothing herein contained shall be held or construed to invalidate or make void any deed of assignment made and executed by any debtor for the purpose of paying and satisfying ratably and proportionably and without preference or priority all the creditors of such debtor their just debts.\nThe deeds of assignment made void by this clause are only made so as against the creditors of the debtor. That is to say, they are the only persons who could impeach and invalidate the deeds, and they only because of the deeds having been made either with intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the person executing the deed as a class or with intent of giving one or more of the creditors of such person a preference over his other creditors. Now a deed of assignment of all the property of an insolvent made in good faith and effectually executed so as to be irrevocable in trust for the purpose of paying and satisfying ratably and proportionably all the creditors of such persons their just debts without preference or priority never could, although the proviso never had been inserted in this clause, have been construed to be a deed impeachable by the creditors of the insolvent as a deed made either With intent to defeat or delay the creditors of the insolvent or with intent of giving one or more of his creditors a preference over others. The proviso therefore was not necessary for the purpose of protecting and maintaining the validity of a deed which but for the proviso would, by the previous terms of the clause, have been made void as against creditors. It is however a legislative declaration that such a deed made for the benefit of all creditors without preference or priority could not be invalidated by the creditors of the person executing it.\nThe act 20 Vic. ch. 3 was incorporated in the consolidated statutes of Upper Canada, ch. 45, and is now incorporated in the revised statutes of Ontario, ch. 119, and the above 19th sec. of 22 Vic. ch. 96 was incorporated in the 26th chapter of the consolidated statutes of Upper Canada, and is now the 2nd section of ch. 118 of the revised statutes of Ontario.\nIn Taylor v. Whittemore[31] which came before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Upper Canada in 1853, the case was that one Mountjoy being largely indebted to divers persons in the sum of \u00a35,864 made an assignment of his estate and effects upon trust to pay several preferred creditors several specified sums amounting in the whole to \u00a31,750, and after payment of those preferred debts then on trust for the payment ratably and proportionably of the several debts mentioned in a schedule annexed to the deed provided the creditor should execute the deed within two months and thereby release Mountjoy. The deed provided that if the trustees should think it advisable, and the creditors who might sign the deed or a majority of them in value should assent thereto, they might carry on the business for the benefit of the creditors who should come into the assignment, and they might employ Mountjoy in carrying on the business for the trustees and the benefit of the creditors and, from time to time, out of the proceeds realised from the sale of the stock and merchandise assigned, might add to the said stock as the trustees might think it advisable until the same should be exhausted and disposed of, and then to wind up the said business and to collect and get in all the debts due and payable to Mountjoy, so assigned, arid all debts which might grow due in the carrying on of the said business as soon as the trustees conveniently could, and at all events within two years from the date of the deed, unless the debts mentioned in the schedule should be sooner paid, satisfied and discharged. The deed contained a release from the creditors of Mountjoy to him in full of their respective demands, also a provision that the trustees might permit Mountjoy to have use and occupy so much and such portions of his then household furniture and for such time and upon such terms as the trustees might think proper. This provision, however, did not in any way vest the property or title in such property or any portion of it in said Mountjoy. This transaction was assailed by creditors who refused to come into the assignment upon the contention that the assignment was fraudulent vand void within the statute of 13 Elizabeth ch. 5, on the grounds following: \u201c1st. For providing for the employment of Mountjoy in carrying on the business; 2nd. For providing that he might be allowed to retain possession of the furniture; 3rd. Because it contained provisions for carrying on the business; and 4th. As providing for the payment of certain debts in full instead of putting all on an equal footing.\u201d It was held that the deed was not impeachable within the statute of Elizabeth. The only point which was raised under 12 Vic. ch. 74, as amended by 13\u201114 Vic. ch. 62, was that inasmuch as it appeared that Mountjoy\u2019s household furniture was never delivered to the trustees it was contended that the deed was void as to those things which had been delivered, the deed not having been filed as required by those statutes; but it was held that the non-delivery could only affect the goods not delivered, leaving the deed good as to those which had been received into the actual possession of the trustees, and as the goods taken in execution were some of those which had been taken into their actual possession the trustees were held entitled to recover on the interpleader issue, it being held that the effect of the acts was to avoid the deed quoad the subject matter of the suit, and as the household furniture had not been taken in execution the title as to it was not before the court, so that the objection as to the non-deliyery of the household furniture into the actual possession of the trustees had no effect upon the matter in issue in the interpleader; it was assumed and not disputed that the deed in question there came within the operation of the act, 12 Vic. ch. 74, as amended by 13-14 Vic. ch. 62, but it must be observed that the deed before the court there was not a deed in trust for the payment of all the creditors of the debtor equally without preference or priority; on the contrary it was only for the benefit of such as should be content to take what should remain after payment of the preferred creditors the amounts to be first paid to them in full satisfaction of their debts, and this should release the debtor from all further claim.\nIn Heward v. Mitchell et al.[32] decided in the same term as was Taylor v. Whittemore, the point appears to have been taken that the trust deed there did not come within the statute, 12 Vic. ch. 74, as amended by 13-14 Vic. ch. 62, and the court held that it did. The deed of assignment there provided for the payment, in the first place, of certain notes which the trustees had endorsed for the benefit of the debtors who made the assignment, and then for the payment in full of the debts owing by the debtors to such creditors as should sign the deed; and although the deed contained no clause of release of the debtors by the creditors signing the deed it did contain a covenant by the signing creditors not to sue the debtors during a period of three years during which the trustees were to be at liberty in their discretion to add to the stock and carry on the business. The assignment, therefore, was for the benefit only of the preferred creditors and such others as should be willing to take the benefit of the assignment subject to the condition of executing such a covenant. That was not an assignment for the benefit of all creditors alike without preference or priority, and subject to no conditions imposed in the interest of the debtor.\nIn Olmstead v. Smith[33] which was before the same court in 1857 the terms of the trust assignment are not set out and it does not appear whether or not it made provision for payment first of preferred creditors, or whether its benefits were or not limited to such creditors only as should signify their assent to the terms of the deed by signing it within any prescribed time, nor whether it was clogged with a condition releasing the debtor from all further claim whether the property assigned should or not pay all debts in full. It was assumed there, no doubt upon the authority of Taylor v. Whittemore and Heward v. Mitchell, that the deed came within the provisions of the statute 13-14 Vic. ch. 62, and the affidavit was held to be defective within the provisions of that statute; however, McLean J. though feeling bound by the prior decisions makes use of the following language showing grave doubt to exist in his mind as to the application of the statute to trust deeds executed for the benefit of creditors. \u2018\nI do not see (he says) how the affidavit required by the statute can be taken by assignees in the position of the plaintiffs who take a conveyance of goods in trust for the benefit of creditors, the very object of the conveyance being to hold them against all creditors though with a view of distributing the proceeds ultimately among them or such as may choose to become parties to an assignment. It can scarcely be said that the plaintiffs are not to hold the goods of Trevor against his creditors because they were authorised to sell them and make specific payments. The creditors could not touch the goods if the assignment is legal. The plaintiffs now are holding Trevor\u2019s goods against the defendants, his creditors, and how could they swear that they did not receive them for that express purpose.\nThe defect in the affidavit was that instead of saying in the words of the statute that, the assignment was not made for the purpose of holding or enabling the assignees to hold the goods therein mentioned against the creditors of Trevor, the assignor, it said that the assignment was not made for the purpose of holding or of enabling Trevor to hold the goods therein mentioned against his creditors. The language of McLean J., (although susceptible of an answer when applied to cases of trust assignments such as were those in Taylor v. Whittemore and Heward v. Mitchell upon the assumed application of the authority of which cases, by which the learned judge and the court of which he was a member were bound, to Olmstead v. Smith, the latter case proceeded,) seems to me to be unanswerable when applied to the case of a trust assignment for the equal benefit of all creditors alike without preference or priority save such as the law has given; for if the affidavit which is required by the statute in the case of every deed to which the statute applies cannot with truth be made in the case of such a deed, it must of necessity follow that such a deed cannot be within the intent and operation of the statute, a point which was decided by the same court in Baldwin v. Benjamin[34] in which it was held, however, that the affidavit could be made in the particular circumstances of that case which have no application to the point now under consideration.\nHarris v. the Commercial Bank[35] was a case no doubt of the same description as Taylor v. Whittemore and Heward v. Mitchell, that is to say, that the trust deed made provision for the payment first of certain preferred creditors and that only such as should become parties to the deed should participate in its benefits, and that it contained a clause providing for the carrying on of the business by the trustees in their discretion and for release of the debtor from all further claims, for while the report does set forth a clause providing that such creditors only as should become parties to the deed within 90 days from notice of its execution, given to them or sent to them by mail, should participate in the benefits of the deed to the conclusion of all others, the non-insertion of the terms and conditions of the deed in the report is thus excused:\nAs the objections to its provisions independently of the statute were not pressed on the argument, only the description of the goods assigned is material to be given here.\nAnd moreover Robinson C.J. in giving judgment says:\u2014\nI see nothing in the arrangements made by the deed which would warrant us in holding it void. They are such I think as MacDonell (the debtor) was then at liberty to make.\nindicating by this language that the trust provisions were not simply for the benefit of all creditors alike without preference or priority, but that the assignment contained provisions which were objected to but not pressed as making the deed void under the statute of Elizabeth, as had been contended in Taylor v. Whittemore. He also says:\u2014\nI have doubts, which I believe, however, are not entertained by my brother judges generally, whether assignments of this description, namely, to trustees for the benefit of creditors, come within the provisions of our statute, 20 Vic. ch. 3.\nThen referring to the language of the statute which speaks of \u201cthe sale of goods,\u201d as distinguished from mortgages, and speaks also of the \u201cbargainor and bargainee,\u201d and of the sale being made bon\u00e2 fide and for \u201cgood consideration as set forth in the conveyance,\u201d he says:\u2014 It is true that in respect to real property trusts are created by deeds of bargain and sale\u2014I mean by a description of conveyance technically so called\u2014although the grantor is not selling the estate nor the trustee buying it, and though no bargain in the common sense of the term is made between the parties; and it is true also that in the language of the courts all persons acquiring lands by deed or will or otherwise than by inheritance are said to hold as purchasers; but we have to deal here with goods and chattels, and it has not seemed to me that the Legislature has used the words \u201cevery sale of goods and chattels\u201d in these statutes in any other sense than their common acceptation as applied to goods, that is, when the absolute beneficial interest passes from a seller to a buyer.\nA more comprehensive construction, however, has been given to them by our courts, and they are held to comprehend assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors like that before us.\nIt is clear, to my mind, that the case in which this language is used was one similar to that in Taylor v. Whittemore and in Heward v. Mitchell, where the application of the statute to deeds like that before the court in Harris v. Commercial Bank was decided by the court, and by which judgments the Chief Justice, although differing from them, deemed himself to be bound. Assuming then the deed in question there to be within the statute 20 Vic. ch. 3, the point decided by the judgment was that a description of the goods assigned as \u201call the goods, &c.,\u201d of the assignor being in and about his warehouse on T. street and all his furniture in and about his dwelling house on W. street, and all bonds bills and securities for money loans, stock, notes, &c., &c. whatsoever and wheresoever belonging, due or owing to him was sufficient to satisfy the statute.\nIn Wilson v. Kerr[36] the assignment was of All and singular the stock in trade of the assignor situate on Ontario street in said town of Stratford, and also all his other goods, chattels, furniture, household effects, horses and cattle, and also all bonds, bills, notes, debts, choses in action, terms of years leases and securities for money,\nin trust for such creditors as should execute the deed within forty days. The deed contained a clause of release, by creditors executing, of all claim beyond what the dividends might produce, and the surplus, after paying out the proceeds ratably to the creditors who should execute, was by the terms of the trust to be paid over to the assignor. The deed also contained a clause empowering the assignee to return to the assignor the household furniture not exceeding \u00a3100 in value if he should see fit, which was done.\nRobinson C.J. held the deed to be fraudulent and void against creditors, upon the ground:\u2014\n1st. That it was fraudulent for the assignor to assign only on the understanding that he should be allowed to keep possession of his household furniture which he did keep and enjoy as before.\n2nd. That it was fraudulent by reason of the stipulation contained in the assignment that no creditor should share in the proceeds except such as should execute the assignment within forty days which assignment contained a release by the creditors who should execute of all the debts in full, on condition of their getting the dividend out of what the effects might produce, and a provision that after the executing creditors should be paid their dividend any surplus that there might be should go to the assignor; \u201cit is he said an attempt to coerce the creditors to come under a disadvantageous condition on the peril of getting nothing,\u201d and he held\n3rd. Assuming the deed to be within the intent of 20 Vic. ch. 3, the description of the goods intended to be assigned was insufficient.\nBurns J. saying that the only point he had considered was this last, also held the description to be insufficient; the report says that McLean J. concurred, but whether or not with the whole of the judgment of the Chief Justice or only with that part which Burns J. had considered and in which he concurred is not stated. The report of what took place in appeal in this case[37] is still more unsatisfactory for, notwithstanding the doubts which had been expressed by the Chief Justice and by McLean J. as to trust deeds for the benefit of creditors being within the statute, and as to the deed in Wilson v. Kerr being fraudulent and void for the reasons given by the Chief Justice, neither of these points appears to have been mooted or referred to in the case in appeal, the Court of Appeal resting their judgment affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench upon the point merely of the insufficiency of the description of the goods, assuming the deed to be within the operation of the statute, and this is the more remarkable because the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in the same term in which it had given judgment in Wilson v. Kerr, gave judgment in Maulson v. Topping[38] wherein it was held by the unanimous judgment of the court that a deed in trust for the benefit of such creditors as should execute the deed within a stated time, and which enacted a release in full from those who should execute it, was fraudulent and void against non-executing creditors, notwithstanding that the requirements of 20 Vic. ch 3 should be complied with.\nIn Maulson et al v. Peck et al[39] the deed in trust for creditors contained a provision:\u2014\nFor payment in full of certain preferred creditors, and to pay, distribute and divide all the balance of monies arising from the property assigned ratably among the other creditors, according to the several amounts of their respective debts, in full satisfaction and discharge thereof, subject, however, to this proviso: that if any of the creditors of the assignors should refuse to come in and become parties to the deed of assignment or to accede thereto within two months after the date thereof, or such further time not exceeding four months as the trustees might extend to them, then that the dividends on such debts respectively should be paid to the assignors as part of their personal estate, and in order that the goods might be disposed of to the best advantage power is given to the assignees to purchase from time to time other stock to assort and sell with the assigned goods for the benefit of the estate.\nIt seems to raise a nice question to determine wherein a deed like this, which contained a clause that only the parties executing it, other than the preferred creditors, should participate in the balance remaining after payment of the preferred creditors, and which contained also a clause that those executing should accept whatever dividends the assigned property would give to each ratably to the respective amounts due to every creditor of the debtors after such payment in full satisfaction and discharge of their debts, and that the dividends attributable to the debts due to those who should not execute the deed should be paid over to the debtors, differs from the deed in Maulson v. Topping, which was declared to be fraudulent and void for exacting a release of the debtors by those who should execute the deed; however, no such point was taken in the case, and the only point which was taken and decided was upon a question whether or not, as was contended, the power given to the assignees to purchase additional stock from time to time made the executing creditors partners in the business, and whether the insertion of that clause did or not make the deed void, which question were decided in the negative.\nIn Hutchinson v. Roberts[40], the only point decided was that the statute 20 Vic. ch. 3 did not apply to that case, because the trust deed for creditors was accompanied by an immediate and actual and continued change of possession.\nIn Maulson et al. v. Joseph[41] the terms of the deed which was an assignment for the benefit of creditors do not appear in the report. They probably were the same as those contained in the deed in Maulson v. Peck which was before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench at the same time. The report does say that after the deed was executed the assignees carried on the business which was continued for some months. The case cannot, I think, be regarded in any stronger light than a confirmation of the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench in Taylor v. Whittemore and Heward v. Mitchell notwithstanding the doubts of Sir John Robinson as to the statute 20 Vic. ch. 3 having any application to trust deeds in favor of creditors.\nIn Arnold v. Robertson[42] the trusts of the deed were declared in an instrument referred to in the deed of assignment, and they were, to sell the goods, chattels and effects specified in the bill of sale and to apply the proceeds in payment of all necessary and incidental expenses and then in payment of certain preferred claims in full, and to apply the residue towards the payment of the debts in schedule A. due to such of the creditors as should execute the assignment ratably, and to pay the surplus to the debtor, who was to be discharged from all further liability to the creditors who should execute the assignment. This case was expressly rested upon the authority of Heward v. Mitchell. Draper C.J. in giving the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas then says\u2014\nSince the case of Heward v. Mitchell which has been followed in this court it is not a question open to argument that sales or assignments of goods for the benefit of creditors in trust to dispose of the proceeds thereof in payment of the creditors of the assignor are not within the statute.\nThis judgment simply affirms the anthority of Heward v. Mitchell, saying that it has been followed, so that this case does not nor, indeed, do any of the reported cases go further than to recognise the judg- ments in the early cases of Taylor v. Whittemore, Heward v. Mitchell and Harris v. The Commercial Bank as binding authorities unless and until reversed in a court of appeal.\nIt was contended that as the decisions in Taylor v. Whittemore and Heward v. Mitchell have been followed for a period of thirty years, a court of appeal even should not now reverse those judgments. That would be, I confess, in my opinion, a very strong argument if the decisions so followed for such a length of time had involved the construction of a statute in relation to real estate so as to maintain in their integrity the rights belonging to a fee simple estate, or if upon the faith of the decisions so followed large sums of money had been expended by the owners of land in fee in the improvement of their property, and if the reversal of the decisions would deprive such owners in fee, without giving them any compensation whatever, of the full enjoyment of their property, and of all benefit from the large sums of money so expended by them on its improvements; but even in such a case as I have described the judicial committee of Her Majesty\u2019s Privy Council of England, in the recent case of Maclaren v. Caldwell[43], seems to have felt no difficulty in reversing the unanimous judgment of this court which upheld the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for Upper Canada, pronounced about twenty years previously and upon different occasions followed, putting a construction upon an act of the Provincial Legislature in a matter having relation to the condition of the province, with which the judges of the courts of the province at the time of the passing of the act, having had intimate knowledge, may be said to have had peculiar qualifications eminently fitting them to put a sound construction upon the act, and the effect of whose construction was to maintain the fee simple proprietors of land in the full enjoyment of their property and of the benefit of all such sums as should be expended by them on its improvement, and the effect of the reversal of such their construction being to deprive such owners without any compensation whatever of the benefit of the outlay of immense sums of money expended by them upon the faith of the judgment pronounced shortly after the passing of the act, and followed without any doubt having been expressed as to its soundness during a period of about twenty years. But a judgment now putting upon the statute under consideration a different construction from that which was put upon it by the judgments in Taylor v. Whittemore, Heward v. Mitchell, and the other cases decided upon their authority would have no such effect; in fact no rights or interests whatever, whether acquired upon the strength of the former decisions or otherwise, would be effected injuriously or at all by their reversal. However, in none of the cases to which we have been referred, and in none of the reported cases that I have seen prior to Robertson v. Thomas[44], does any question appear to have arisen as to the application of the statutes under consideration to the case of a trust deed for the payment of all the creditors of the assignor ratably and proportionably to the amounts due to them respectively without any preference or priority and without any release of the debtor or any other benefit whatever reserved in the interest of the assignor. The deed in Dolan v. Donelly[45] may possibly have been such a deed, but if it was it is not made to appear so in the report; the only question there was as the sufficiency of the description of the goods, upon the assumption that upon the authority of Taylor v. Whittemore and Heward v. Mitchell, and the other cases follow- ing them the deed was one to which the statute applied. In Robertson v. Thomas the question does appear to have arisen and for the first time, so far as I have been able to find. There the divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench unanimously decided that an assignment in trust made for the bond fide purpose of paying and satisfying ratably and proportionably without preference or priority all the creditors of a debtor their just debts was not within the statute ch. 119 R.S.O.\nThis decision can, in my judgment, well stand without its being necessary to question the application of the statute to trust assignments drawn in such terms as were those in Taylor v. Whittemore, Heward v. Mitchell and Harris v. The Commercial Bank, and such like cases, for there is a vast distinction between a trust assignment made for the benefit of all creditors alike without preference or priority, not requiring the creditors to execute any release of the debtor, and an assignment in trust first for the payment in full of certain preferred creditors, and then for such only as should within a limited time prescribed by the debtor signify their acceptance of the terms of the trust assignment by signing it containing a release of the debtor, whether the property assigned should or not realize sufficient for payment of such creditors in full.\nAlthough preference of one creditor over another be not in itself unlawful, unless the debtor making such preference be in insolvent circumstances and unable to pay all his debts in full, still the preferring one to another is, an act injurious to all other creditors; and as the object of the statute under consideration was, in my opinion, to prevent the committal of fraud upon creditors by a debtor and to guard against pretended sales or secret incumbrances made and executed to the prejudice of the creditors of the assignor as a class, every creditor has an interest in knowing and a right to know what disposition, if any, a debtor has made of property originally his own and still remaining in his actual possession and to all appearance his own, whether such disposition be made to a stranger or to, or in trust for, a preferred creditor. In such deeds of assignment therefore the statute may well be held to apply for the benefit of all non-preferred creditors who, as persons prejudiced by the trust assignment, refuse to accept the terms inserted in it in relation to their claims. But where a debtor makes an irrevocable assignment of property in trust for the benefit of all his creditors alike, without preference or priority, no creditor has any just right to complain of his being prejudiced by the terms of such a trust assignment. The statute does not avoid all conveyances by way of mortgage or sale of chattels as to which the terms of the statute are not complied with, but only avoids them in the interest of and at the suit of the creditors of the debtor making the assignment. But an individual creditor who, repudiating a trust assignment made in his favor equally with all the other creditors of the debtor, proceeds to judgment and execution, as he can not be said to have been prejudiced by the terms of the trust assignment he cannot in justice invoke the terms of the statute to aid him in obtaining a preference over all the other creditors who by the trust assignment were placed on precisely the same footing with himself. If the statute should be construed so as to aid an individual creditor in such an attempt it would be made to operate to the prejudice of the creditors whom, as a class, the statute was passed to protect. To hold that a trust assignment, such as that before us, made by an insolvent debtor at the request of the body of the creditors of the insolvent, for the benefit of all such creditors alike without preference or priority, and which therefore makes the precise disposition, not only which the body of creditors desired but which in the case of insolvency was the disposition made by the Insolvent Act when in force, could be defeated by an individual creditor hurrying to judgment and execution upon the suggestion that in some particular the terms of chapter 119 of the R.S.O. had not been fully complied with in relation to the deed in question, and so upon such suggestion to aid an individual creditor to obtain a preference over all the other creditors whom, as a class, the statute was passed to protect, would be, in my opinion, at variance with the intent and object of the statute, as converting an act intended to protect creditors from acts of their debtor into an instrament by which one creditor placed honestly by his debtor upon an equal footing with all his other creditors, might perpetrate a fraud upon all such others; and by which one of several cestuis que trustent under the same deed might defraud the others, In my opinion the statute does not apply to such a trust assignment\nThere is in the fourth of the above grounds of appeal a question involved upon which, as there seems to be some variety of opinion on a point of importance and as the question has been raised in a court of appeal, it should, I think, be disposed of. The question is as to the sufficiency of the description in the trust assignment before us, assuming it to be an instrument within the operation of the statute, of the goods seized. The question turns upon the construction of the 23 sec. of ch. 119 R.S.O. That section enacts that \u201c all instruments mentioned in the act, whether for the sale or mortgage of goods and chattels, shall contain such sufficient and full description thereof that the same may be thereby readily known and distinguished.\u201d\nBy the deed of assignment, read in connection with the schedule annexed thereto and made part thereof, the debtors, describing themselves as \u201cThe Farm and Dairy Utensil Manufacturing Company,\u201d carrying on their business as manufacturers at the city of Brantford and declaring themselves to be in insolvent circumstances, granted, bargained, sold, assigned, &c., to trustees named:\u2014\nAll and singular these certain parcels or tracts of land and premises situate lying and being in the city of Brantford in the county of Brant, being composed of town lots numbers 14, 15 and 16 on the east side of Waterloo street, and lots numbers two and three on the west side of Duke street running half-way through to Wadsworth street, in the said city of Brantford, with the appurtenances to the said lands belonging or in any wise appertaining and used or enjoyed therewith, and the foundry erections and buildings thereon erected and being, including all articles such as engine, boiler, cupola, machinery, and shaftings in and upon said premises. And all and singular the personal estate and effects, stock in trade, goods, chattels, rights and credits, fixtures, book debts, notes, accounts, books of account, choses in action, and all other the personal estate and effects whatsoever and wheresoever and whether upon the premises where said debtors business is carried on or elsewhere, and which the said debtors are possessed of or entitled to in any way whatever, on trust for sale and distribution of the proceeds among all the creditors of the debtors without preference or priority.\nNow, from this deed it is, I think, abundantly apparent that the place where the debtors carried on their business as farm and dairy utensil manufacturers was on the lands described in the deed, which with the erections and buildings thereon and all articles such as engine, boiler, cupola, machinery and shafting in and upon the premises were conveyed by the deed. These latter articles, although conveyed with the land and buildings thereon, either passed to the trustees as part of the realty upon the authority of Holland v. Hodgson[46], or if they be regarded as pure chattels it cannot be doubted that they are sufficiently described so as to be readily and easily known and distinguished. In so far then as these articles are concerned, if they were seized by the sheriff under the executions in his hands, the execution creditors could have no claim to them founded upon any insufficiency in their description. Then again as to all and singular the stock in trade, goods, chattels, &c., upon the premises where the said debtors\u2019 business is carried on, or which the said debtors are possessed of or entitled to in any way whatever, there can, I think, be no doubt that the locality of that place of business is sufficiently designated, assuming a statement of locality to be in such case necessary, whatever uncertainty of insufficiency the introduction of the words \u201cwheresoever\u201d or \u201celsewhere,\u201d in the connection in which they are used in the clause enumerating the several particulars of the personal estate and effects intended to be conveyed, may create in distinguishing what goods and chattels, personal estate and effects, are intended under the description of being situated elsewhere than on the premises where the debtors\u2019 business is carried on. There is no uncertainty as to the locality of those described as being on the premises where that business is carried on, these premises being plainly enough designated in the deed.\nThe question, therefore, as to the goods, &c., is, as it appears to me\u2014Whether or not a conveyance by a debtor in the terms following, namely, all and singular the stock in trade, goods, chattels, fixtures, &c., upon the premises where the debtors\u2019 business is carried on, and which the debtors are possessed of or entitled to (such premises being plainly enough design ated in the deed so as to remove all doubt as to their locality) is an insufficient description within the 23rd section of the statute to cover all or any \u201cstock in trade,\u201d goods, chattels, fixtures, &c., situate on their premises and belonging to the debtors at the time of execution of the conveyance.\nIn Ross v. Conger[47], A.D. 1857, it was held that:\u2014 All the stock of dry goods, hardware, crockery, groceries, and other goods, wares and merchandise in the store and premises occupied by the mortgagor, etc.\nwas a sufficient description within the statute to cover all such articles as were in the store at the time of the execution of the mortgage.\nIn Harris v. The Commercial Bank[48] it was held that a description of the goods assigned as:\u2014\nAll the goods, &c., of the assignor being in and about his warehouse on T. Street, and all his furniture in and about his dwelling house on W. Street, and all bonds, bills and securities for money loans, stocks, notes, &c., whatsoever and wheresoever belonging, due or owing to him.\nwas sufficient within 20 Vic. ch. 3 s. 4. In Rose v. Scott[49] the goods in a chattel mortgage were described as:\u2014\nSeven horses, three lumber wagons, one carriage, one pleasure sleigh, all the household furniture in possession of the assignor and being in his dwelling house, all the lumber and logs in and about the sawmill and premises of said assignor, and all the blacksmith\u2019s tools of said party of the first part, six cows and four stoves.\nAnd it was held that the description was sufficient to cover the household furniture, lumber and logs, but that it was insufficient as to the other goods.\nIn Fraser v. Bank of Toronto[50] the goods were referred to in a chattel mortgage as set forth in schedules annexed; two schedules were annexed, designated C. and D. The former was headed \u201cHousehold furniture in J.E.W\u2019s. residence\u201d and then followed an enumeration of articles, but no locality was stated for the residence of J.E.W. Schedule D was headed: \u201cHousehold furniture and property of J.R. McD,\u201d one of the assignors, and then followed an enumeration of articles; it was held that the headings on both schedules sufficiently described the locality of the goods, for as to schedule C., J.E.W.\u2019s. residence was readily ascertainable, and as to schedule D that the terms \u201cHousehold furniture and property of J.R. McD,\u201d sufficient- ly showed that J.R. McD\u2019s. dwelling house was their locality, which was readily ascertainable.\nIn Powell v. the Bank of Upper Canada[51], the property covered by a chattel mortgage was described as:\u2014\nThe goods, chattels, furniture and household stuff expressed in the schedule hereunto annexed.\nWhich schedule was headed:\u2014\nAn inventory of goods and chattels in the possession of J.R.\non a certain day, the locality of the house in which the goods were not being mentioned, and it was held a sufficient description of the goods intended to be covered by the mortgage in compliance with the statute.\nIn Mills v. King[52] the description of goods mortgaged was given in the mortgage as follows:\u2014\nAll and singular the goods and chattels, furniture and household stuff, and articles particularly mentioned and expressed in the schedule hereunto annexed, and which are now in the warehouse of James Reid, in the City of Hamilton, and are about to be placed in the building known as the Burlington Hotel.\nThe schedule mentioned then a long list of articles as situate in several rooms of the hotel, designating the rooms as parlor \u201cC,\u201d parlor \u201cH,\u201d &c. In some of the rooms there were goods as described in the schedule, in others there were no goods, and some of the goods described in the schedule were still in possession of Reid, who was the manufacturer of them; and it was held that all the goods in the schedule which were said to be in certain rooms in the hotel in which rooms there were such goods were sufficiently described, but that goods described in the schedule as being in certain rooms which were not in these rooms did not pass; and that all goods of the mortgagor that were in Reid\u2019s warehouse did pass as sufficiently described.\nIn Sutherland v. Nixon[53] the goods mortgaged were specified as\u2014\nThe goods, chattels, furniture and household stuffs particularly mentioned and described in the schedule thereunto annexed marked .\nIn this schedule the chattels were put down without any other description than\nOne buggy, one cutter, one cart, one bread sleigh, two sets of harness, one horse, one chaff cutter, and the following household furniture, namely, in the small parlor, one stove, &c.,\nand then the various articles of furniture were enumerated in the several rooms in the mortgagor\u2019s dwelling house, but where the dwelling house was situate did not appear. This description was held sufficient as to the furniture, but insufficient as to the other articles.\nIn Mathers v. Lynch[54] goods in a chattel mortgage were described as\u2014\nThe following goods and articles being in the store of the party of the first part, on the corner of Queen and Main Streets, in the said town of Brampton, that is to say, 85 gallons of vinegar, &c., giving a long list, and also the following goods, being of the stock in trade of the party of the first part, taken in the month of April last, that is to say, 16 pieces of tweed, &c.\nIn this case the court had no difficulty in holding that the goods described as \u201cbeing of the stock in trade, &c.,\u201d of the mortgagor were situate in the store previously mentioned, and that the goods enumerated as \u201cthe stock in trade\u201d of the mortgagor were therefore sufficiently described.\nNow as to the correctness of all those judgments, as to the sufficiency of the several descriptions which were held to be sufficient, there can not in my opinion be entertained a doubt; but the reasoning upon which the description in Wilson v. Kerr[55], was held to be insufficient appears to me to be hypercritical and to proceed upon what I think was a misconception of the object and intent of the statute.\nThe trust assignment in question there was executed by a trader who had become insolvent, and the person assailing it was an execution creditor of such trader. Now a creditor of the assignor was the only person who could assail the mortgage and there can be little doubt that he well knew in what building on Ontario Street, in Stratford, the person who had become his debtor carried on his business, and if he knew the place where his debtor carried on his business and where his stock in trade was he could not have been prejudiced by reason of the mortgage not having more precisely stated a fact which may have been well known to him and all the creditors of the assignor and they were the persons, and not the court, for whose information the statute required the description of the goods assigned to be inserted in the assignment. In that case the goods were described as\u2014\nAll and singular the stock in trade of the said R.D.W. (the assignor) situate on Ontario street in said town of Stratford, and also all his other goods, chattels, furniture, household effects, horses, cattle and also all bonds, bills, notes, debts, choses in action, &c., &c.\nNow the enactment in question was not based upon the assumption that persons dealing with a trader and becoming his creditors might be ignorant of the nature of the trade in which he was engaged, or the place where such trade was carried on, and that to protect them from any prejudice arising from such ignorance it was necessary that any mortgage made by a debtor of goods and chattels under the designation of \u201c all the \u201c stock in trade \u201c of the mortgagor should be void as against creditors unless the nature of the debtor\u2019s trade should be stated in the mortgage and the place where such stock in trade was situate should be stated with greater preciseness than naming the street and town where it was.\nIt is, in my opinion, quite a mistake to hold that the statute is to be construed as meaning that by reading the instrument itself or a schedule annexed thereto such a description should be obtained as would convey to every reader and to the court, whenever a question should arise, without the aid of any oral evidence of surrounding circumstances or otherwise, what were the particular articles which constituted \u201call the stock in trade\u201d of the mortgagor, or that in a mortgage of goods and chattels under such designation it is indispensable that an inventory should be made or stock taken and that the nature, quantity, quality and value of the several items constituting the stock in trade should be set out in the mortgage or in a schedule annexed thereto.\nSuch an inventory, perfect though it should be, would be of no use whatever in many cases; if, for example, the debtor, after executing a mortgage of all his stock in trade in his shop at a named place designating every item of such stock in an inventory annexed by its quantity, quality and value, and after selling one-third of such stock in the course of his trade should replenish his shop with other goods of the like description, quality and value but in much greater quantities so that the goods remaining of the stock in trade mortgaged should, when a question should arise, constitute but a part of the mortgagor\u2019s stock in trade in his shop of the like articles as those mortaged consisted of, in such a case it would be impossible by reading the mortgage alone without any oral evidence to distinguish the mortgaged goods from those of the like description which had been subsequently purchased, but with oral evidence the goods mortaged could be readily and easily known and distinguished from the others.\nSo again, if the mortgage should be of a part only of the mortgagor\u2019s stock in trade in his shop and there should be an inventory annexed specifying the goods intended to be conveyed by their quantity, quality and value as for example:\u2014\n5 pieces of black silk for ladies dresses of the value of $2 per yard, ten pieces of black satin for ladies dresses at $2.25 per yard, twenty pieces of grey cotton goods at twenty cents per yard, ten bales of Brussels carpet, containing each 100 yards, of the value of $2 per yard, twenty bales of tapestry carpet, containing each 100 yards, of the value of $1 per yard, and five bales of Kidderminster carpet of 100 yards, each of the value of $1.25 per yard, all of which goods were described as being in the mortgagor\u2019s shop, the precise site of which is stated\u2014such a description would be utterly insufficient to enable a person who knew no more than the inventory annexed to the mortgage stated to distinguish the goods intended to be mortgaged from others of the like description, quantities, quality and value in the mortgagor\u2019s shop at the time of the execution of the mortgage. This is what I understand the judgment of this court in McCall v. Wolff[56], in substance to decide. I was not a party to that judgment, but the majority of the court appear to have been of opinion that the goods as described in the mortgage constituted part only of the goods in the mortgagor\u2019s shop at the time of the execution of the mortgage, and it is plain I think, from the language of His Lordship the Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of the majority, that if the goods had been stated in the mortgage to have been all the goods in the mortgagor\u2019s shop, or even if oral evidence had established that the goods were, in point of fact, all the goods that were in the mortgagor\u2019s shop when the mortgage was executed, it would have been sufficient.\nThe naming a locality where the goods intended to be covered by the mortgage or bill of sale are at the time of its execution seems to me to be the least efficient mode possible of describing the goods intended to be assigned and in many cases utterly useless, for when the question arises whether the goods intended to be covered by the assignment can be readily and easily known so as to be distinguished from other goods of the assignor the locality in which the goods were at the time of the mortgage may be wholly changed. Thus if the mortgagor described the property intended to be mortgaged as\nOne black gelding, one bay mare, one Alderney cow, one Jersey heifer, one Durham bull, and five South Down ewes, the property of the mortgagor, all of which cattle are now in the care of A. B. and grazing upon his farm, situate upon lot No. 1, in the 2nd Concession of the Township of Nepean,\nof what use would the statement of locality be if A. B. should himself have property of his own or of some other person of like description on the farm named when the question as to the sufficiency of the description should arise? And yet, independently of the locality stated, the interested parties, namely, the mortgagor\u2019s creditors, might have no difficulty whatever in distinguishing which were the property of the mortgagor, and so which were covered by the mortgage. When the execution creditors who assailed the mortgage in Wilson v. Kerr, in order to obtain satisfaction of their execution seized a portion of the stock in trade of the mortgagor they had no difficulty in finding the goods seized where they were on Ontario Street, in the town of Stratford, so that they could not have been prejudiced by any supposed insufficiency of the statement in the mortgage of a building on Ontario Street in which the mortgagor\u2019s stock in trade was. Whether or not a description is sufficient to enable the goods mortgaged to be distinguished within the meaning of the statute, is always a question of fact and not of law. In the above case the question was limited to the sufficiency of the statement of the locality where the mortgaged stock in trade was and was whether the description given conveyed such information to the parties interested, namely, the creditors of the mortgagor, as to have enabled them to find the goods; and the tribunal to determine such fact could not reasonably exclude from consideration any evidence of knowledge bearing upon such fact which the creditors possessed through their dealings with their debtors. Again, if a mortgage should describe the property mortgaged as\nOne Alderney cow, one Jersey cow, one bay mare, one Durham bull, one plough, one threshing machine, two harrows, all of which cattle, goods and chattels are now upon the farm of the mortgagor, being the S. 1\/2 of lot No. 2, in the 2nd Concession of the Township of Gloucester,\nof what use would this statement of locality of the cattle, goods and chattels mortgaged be if, when the question should arise, the mortgagor had already removed to another farm in another township to which the cattle and chattels mortgaged had been removed? And yet oral testimony of the most undoubted veracity might without difficulty shew\u2014and perhaps out of the lips of the creditors assailing the mortgage\u2014that at the time of the execution of the mortgage the mortgagor owned and had in his possession no cattle, goods or chattels of the description stated in the mortgage other than the precise number there stated, and that they were, at the time of the question arising, on the farm to which he had removed. Innumerable instances might be given of the insufficiency of a statement of the locality of the goods intended to be covered by a mortgage as a mode of distinguishing the goods intended to be covered by the mortgage from other goods of the mortgagor. But when all a man\u2019s stock in trade is assigned no occasion for distinguishing assigned from non-assigned goods can arise unless it be to distinguish what a man had at the time of the execution of the mortgage from articles of a like description, if any there be, in his possession which he had subsequently acquired, and that is a thing which no description in the mortgage might be able to effect but which could readily and easily be done by parol evidence.\nSo where a man assigns all his bonds, bills, notes and securities for money, there can be no doubt that such a description was intended to cover every bond, bill, note and security for money of which the mortgagor was, at the time of the execution of the mortgage, the owner and entitled to receive the proceeds, whatever might be the names of the obligors of the bonds or of the makers of the notes or of the acceptors of the bills, and whether the mortgagee was obligee or assignee of the bonds or payee or endorser of the notes, and whatever might be the amount secured by each respectively, and whether they were in the possession of the mortgagor\u2019s bankers for safe keeping, or in a strong box or safe in his own custody, which places of safe keeping might, if stated in the mortgage, be changed after its execution and before the occasion for distinguishing what was intended to pass should arise; and as that occasion never could arise except at the suit of some creditor assailing the mortgage, and in respect of some particular bond, bill, note, or security for money claimed to be the property of the mortgagor, and as such applicable to payment of the debt due to the creditor or creditors assailing the mortgage, and as the mortgage plainly shows that all the bonds, bills, notes and securities fur money which the mortgagor possessed at the time of the execution of the mortgage were covered by it, the only question would be, whether the particular security or securities which the assailing creditor or creditors claimed to be applicable to satisfaction of their debts was or were the property of the mortgagor at the time of the execution of the mortgage or had been acquired by him since; and for this purpose I cannot see upon what principle oral evidence should be excluded. The statute never intended, in my opinion, to exclude oral evidence of circumstances surrounding the execution of the mortgage and throwing light upon the question of fact to be determined or to cancel the maxim certum est quod certum reddi potest.\nThe object and intent of the statute, in my opinion, was to prevent creditors being defrauded by means of secret mortgages or bills of sale being executed by the debtor of property still remaining in his possession and to all appearance his own property, and to afford facilities for unsecured creditors to distinguish between the goods of their debtor which are encumbered from those which are as yet unencumbered, and to protect persons dealing with him and giving him credit upon the faith of the property of which he was in open possession being, as it appeared to be, his own property. The clause in the statute which requires such a description of the goods intended to be covered by the instrument that the same may be thereby readily and easily known and distinguished was not, in my opinion, enacted either for the purpose of enabling the mortgagee or assignee to know and distinguish the goods upon which he had agreed to accept the security taken, nor to enable a stranger to the transaction or the court upon a question arising by merely looking at the description in the mortgage to distinguish what goods were covered by the mortgage from other goods of the mortgagors, but to enable unsecured creditors of a debtor and persons having dealings with him or contemplating becoming his creditors to ascertain what pari; if any of the goods and chattels being in his possession and apparently his own is to any, and if to any to what, extent encumbered by assignment to a stranger or to a preferred creditor so as to be removed wholly or in part from liability to unsecured creditors; in short, to distinguish the encumbered from the unencumbered goods so as to enable them to determine how they shall govern themselves in their dealings with him, namely, whether to continue dealing with him, and trusting him, and giving him credit, or to call in question the assignment, if any, as not being executed in good faith. When all the goods and chattels of a debtor are assigned the occasion for distinguishing that which is assigned from that which is not assigned does not arise, and when such assignment is put on registry in the manner and with the affidavits required by the statute the object and intent of the statute is attained, and the only question open to the unsecured creditors, as it appears to me, is as to the bona fides of the instrument.\nIn the case before us, assuming the deed to be within the operation of the statute and to be open to attack at the suit of the particular creditors assailing it to the prejudice of all other creditors, who equally with the assailing creditors are all alike cestui que trustent of the trust assignment, and as the only objection taken to the sufficiency of the description is as to its sufficiency to protect from seizure the goods taken in execution, none of which are suggested not to have been on the premises where the debtors\u2019 business was carried on at the time of the execution of the trust assignment, all that is necessary to determine is that as to all such goods the description given in the trust assignment is abundantly sufficient upon a true construction of the statute, and I am of opinion that it is. \u2018 And assuming locality of the assigned goods to be necessary to have been stated in the trust assignment, that locality does sufficiently appear by the deed to have been in the particular lots of land conveyed by the deed, where the debtor\u2019s business was carried on and where the goods were when seized and taken out of the possession of the trustees of the deed, and, therefore, upon the authority of the great weight of the decisions in the Ontario courts, and of what was said in this court when holding the description in McCall v. Wolf[57] to have been insufficient, the statute has been sufficiently complied with in the present case, and the plaintiffs in the interpleader issue were upon this point also entitled to judgment, as well as upon the ground that the statute does not apply to such a trust deed for the benefit of all creditors of the as signor alike ratably to the amount due to each without preference or priority.\nThe appeal must for the above reasons, in my judgment, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: William M.

Hately and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1886: November 25, 26; 1887: March 14.\nPresent: Sir W.J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCarriers\u2014Contract by one for several\u2014Bills of lading\u2014Terms of contract\u2014Custody of goods\u2014Delivery\u2014Negligence.\nThe M.D.T. Co. through one B. contracted with H. to carry a quantity of butter from London. Ontario, to England, and bills of lading were signed by B., describing himself as agent severally but not jointly, for the G.W. Ry. Co., the M.D.T. Co. and the G.W.S.S. Co. named as carriers therein.\nThe G.W. Ry. Co. were to carry the goods from London to the Suspension Bridge, the M.D.T. Co. from the Suspension Bridge to New York, and it was then to be delivered to the S.S. Co. for carriage to England. It was provided by one clause in the bill of lading that if damage was caused to the goods during transit the sole liability was to be on the company having the custody thereof at the time of such damage occurring.\nThe butter was carried to New York where it was taken from the car and placed in lighters owned by the M.D.T. Co to be conveyed to the steamer \u201c Dorset\u201d belonging to the S.S. Co. On arriving at the pier where the steamer lay the lighter could not get near enough to unload and the stevedore in charge of the steamer had it towed across the river with instructions for it to remain until sent for. The \u201cDorset\u201c sailed without the butter which was sent by another steamer of the S.S. Co. some live days later. The butter was damaged by the heat while in the lighter.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the M.D.T. Co. having made a through contract for the carriage of the goods they were liable to H. for the damage, and even under the bill of lading were not relieved from liability as the butter was never delivered to, and received by, the S.S. Co. but was in the custody of the M.D.T. Co. when the damage occurred.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case as far as they affect the appeal to the Supreme Court may be stated as follows.\nThe plaintiff, Hately, was an extensive shipper of butter and cheese from London, Ont. to England, and in August, 1881, he applied by telegram to the agent of the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Co. for the carriage of three hundred packages of butter to England. The following telegrams passed between Hately and the agent:\u2014\n\u201cTORONTO, August 22, 1881.\n\u201cTo JOHN BARR:\n\u201cWill give you car butter, London\u2014300 packages for London\u2014one for Bristol\u2014one for Cardiff. Will ship Tuesday for Saturday\u2019s steamer at 63 cents. Say quick if you accept, and if you can get it through.\n\u201cW.C. HATELY.\u201d\n\u201cAugust 22, 1881.\n\u201cTo W.C. HATELY:\n\u201cSixty-four best can do\u2014steamers 27th\u2014if they will take it. Answer, and will wire New York to place.\n\u201cJOHN BARR.\u201d\n\u201cAugust 22, 1881.\n\u201cTo JOHN BAKR:\n\u201cYour list says steamers Bristol and Cardiff Saturday. Will ship butter to-morrow for them at rate you name.\n\u201cW.C. HATELY. \u201cAugust 22, 1881.\n\u201cTo W.C. HATELY:\n\u201cShip your London butter via Great Western; You can get refrigerators there. I have advised Western.\n\u201cJOHN BARR.\u201d\nThe Despatch Company had traffic arrangements with the Great Western \u201cRailway Co. and the Great Western S.S. Co., and Barr was their general agent at Toronto.\nThe agent notified the Great Western Railway Co. of the arrangement with Hately and the butter was shipped by the Great Western on August 23. Bills of lading were signed as follows:\u2014\n\u201cFOREIGN BILL OF LADING.\n\u201cGREAT WESTERN RAILWAY,\n\u201cMerchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company, and the Great Western Line of Steamships from New York. From London, Ont., to Bristol, England.\n\u201cShipped in apparent good order, by W.C. Hately, the packages, property or articles marked, numbered, and specified as below. Contents, gauge, value, and condition of contents unknown. Weights subject to correction.\n\u201cTo be delivered in like good order and condition unto order, or to his assigns, he or they paying freight, in cash, immediately on landing the goods, without any allowance of credit or discount, at the rate of gross weight delivered, with average accustomed (at $4.80 to the pound sterling), under the following terms and conditions, viz.:\u2014* * *\n\u201cThrough rate 64c. gold per 100 lbs. Gross weight 9639 lbs.\n\u201cThe property covered by this bill of lading is subject to all the conditions expressed in the customary forms of bills of lading in use by said steamships or steamship company at time of shipment. MARKS AND NUMBERS.\nMERCHANDISE.\nOne hundred and fifty (150).\nP. 2 Top.\nP. Side.\nCar 2872, M.D.T\nPackages of butter.\nIceing to be charged forward.\n\u201c3. It is further agreed, that the said Great Western Railway, and its connections, shall not be held accountable for any damage or deficiency in packages after the same have been receipted for in good order by consignees, or their agents, at or by the next carrier beyond the point to which this bill of lading contracts. Consignees are to pay freight and charges upon the goods or merchandise in lots or parts as they may be delivered to them.\n\u201c4. It is further stipulated and agreed, that in case of any loss, detriment, or damage done to or sustained by any of the property herein receipted for during such transportation, whereby any legal liability or responsibility shall or may be incurred, that company alone shall be held answerable therefor in whose actual custody the same may be at the time of the happening of such loss, detriment, or damage, and the carrier so liable shall have the full benefit of any insurance that may have been effected upon or on account of said goods.\n\u201c6. It is further agreed, that the said Great Western Railway, and its connections, have liberty to forward the goods or property to port of destination by any other steamer or steamship company than that named herein; and this contract is executed and accomplished, and the liability of the Great Western Railway, and its connections, as common carriers thereunder, terminates on the delivery of the goods or property to the steamer or steamship company\u2019s pier at New York, when the responsibility of the steamship company commences, and not before.\u201d\nThe bills of lading were signed by \u201cWilliam Brown, agent severally but not jointly,\u201d and endorsed by Hately and the consignees.\nThe Great Western Railway Company were to forward the butter to the Suspension Bridge and the Dispatch Company thence to New York, where it was to be delivered on board a steamer of the S.S. Co., who were to carry it to England. This arrangement was carried out, but when the butter was taken from the cars as New York and placed in lighters to be put on board the steamer Dorset then in dock, a delay occurred. The lighter could not get near enough to place the butter either on the steamer or the pier at which she lay, and the stevedore in charge of the steamer caused the lighter to be towed across the river to Brooklyn, directing the lighterman to remain there until he sent a tug to bring it back. The Dorset sailed on September 3rd without the butter, and it was finally sent by the \u201cBristol\u201d another steamer of the S.S. Co. on September 7th. On arrival in England the butter was found to be injured by the heat.\nHately brought an action against all three companies and on the first trial he was non-suited on the ground that the action should have been brought by the consignee who had paid him for the butter. The Divisional Court set aside the non-suit, and allowed the consignee to be joined as plaintiff in the action. That decision is reported in 2 O.R. 385. The action was tried again and Hately obtained a verdict against all the defendants. The Despatch Company appealed from the judgment at the trial directly to the Court of Appeal, and the other defendants to the Divisional Court. The latter court sustained the verdict against the S.S. Co., who then appealed to the Court of Appeal which reversed the decision of the Divisional Court and affirmed that of the judge at the trial, as to the Despatch Company, leaving the plaintiff with his verdict against that company. The latter company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. and Millar for the appellants, cited the following cases:\u2014\nCollins v. Bristol and Exeter Railway Co.,[3]; Wilby v. West Cornwall Ry. Co.[4]; Strong v. Natally[5]; Pratt v. Ry. Co.[6]; London & North Western Ry. Co. v. Bartlett[7]; Hutchinson on Carriers[8].\nMoss Q.C. for the respondent referred to Muschamp v. Lancaster & Preston Junction Ry. Co.[9]; Nashua Lock Co. v. Worcester and Nashua Railway Co.[10]; Kent v. Midland Ry. Co.[11]; Hyde v. Navigation Co.[12]; Angell on Carriers[13]; Lawson on Carriers[14].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It appears to me that the only question in this case is: Was the butter delivered in good condition to the steamer or steamship company\u2019s piers at New York, as the defendants undertook to do, and if it was not was the butter damaged while in charge of the Transportation Company in accordance with the terms of the condition contained in the bill of lading? It is abundantly clear that under the bill of lading placing the butter on board the barge at New York was not a delivery to the steamship company. It seems to me that the fact of sending the goods away from the pier was a refusal to receive them and I cannot see that the transportation company, as against the plaintiff, while the goods were on board the barge had any right to leave the pier with them and remain away for so long a time as to destroy the butter. They should, in my opinion, have insisted on the acceptance of the goods at the pier; if the steamship wrongfully neglected or refused to accept the goods I cannot see that this is any answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, though it may, between the transportation and the steamship company, be a matter for controversy. The transportation company assumed the responsibility of seeing that the goods were delivered on the pier in such manner that they could be shipped by the first steamer, which it is quite clear they might have been on board the \u201cDorset,\u201d which sailed on the 3rd of September. It is said that the barge or lighter could not get to the pier; in my opinion whether it could or not get to the pier should have been first ascertained, and a perishable article such as butter should not have been sent away under such a heated atmosphere until it was ascertained that it would reach the pier without unreasonable delay, which was obviously not possible in this case by reason of other lighters engaged in unloading the \u201cDorset,\u201d and the lighter with the butter was sent away because it was blocking the way showing very clearly that the butter was sent too soon and should not have been removed from the ice car until a proper delivery in the terms of the bill of lading could have been effected.\nIn this case I can see no reason why, if the barge could not reach the pier, instead of sending the barge away, as was done, the butter was not immediately returned to the ice car from which it had been taken, and kept there until the delivery at the pier could be effected. If the butter was improperly moved at the instigation of the steamship company before it could be received at the pier that might possibly form a very good subject for a claim by the transportation company against the steamship company, but \u00cf entirely fail to see how it is an answer to the unfortunate owner of the butter who had a right to look to the transportation company to see that his property was delivered at the pier in a position to be then and there shipped from the pier.\nTherefore I think there was no delivery to the steamship company or the steamship company\u2019s pier until after the damage to the butter occurred, which took place while in the possession of the transportation company and for which they are responsible, in my opinion, to the plaintiffs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the Court of Appeal I am of opinion that the judgment appealed against ought to be affirmed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appellant company were the original contractors to carry the butter from the place where it was delivered to them to England, and that the bill of lading only settles the liability between the different carriers. There was no privity of contract between the shipper and the steamer.\nThe transportation company were guilty of gross negligence in taking the butter out of the ice car in the hot weather of New York and exposing it to the sun in a lighter. They should not have moved it in the heat of the sun until it was in a position to be placed on board the steamer, and when the steamer authorities declined to take immediate delivery of the butter it was the duty of the transportation company, who owned the lighters, to place it in a position where it would be preserved until it could be received by the steamer. The company were guilty of express negligence, and for these reasons I think the judgment of the Court of Appeal was right and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice, and for the reasons given by him I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company are, in my opinion, clearly liable for the loss of the butter in question as the parties who contracted with the plaintiff Hately to convey the butter to England, whatever may be their rights over against the Great Western Railway Company or the New York Central and Hudson River Railway Company or the Steamship Company with whom they contracted for the actual carriage of the butter. The plaintiff Hately in delivering the butter to the Great Western Railway Company at London, was acting merely in pursuance of the instructions given to him by the Despatch Transportation Company and for the purpose of enabling that company to fulfil their contract with him, and they cannot now be heard to claim exemption from liability under their contract by appealing to the bill of lading which, in pursuance of the arrangements existing between the Despatch Company and the railway companies through whom the former company carry on their business, the Great Western Railway Company issued to Hately. The difficulty which this case presented in the courts below appears to have arisen wholly from the mode in which the Merchants\u2019 Despatch Transportation Company transact their business\u2014a mode designed apparently for the purpose of mystifying the persons with whom they enter into contracts and of throwing difficulties in the the way of their recovering compensation for undoubted injuries, by attempts to shift their own responsibility to some or one of the carriers with whom, to enable them to carry on their business as a Despatch Transportation Company, they find it to be their interest to enter into special arrangements. There is no such difficulty in the case before us as the Despatch Transportation Company are the only defendants who are par- ties to this appeal, and as to their liability there can, I think, be no doubt.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Morphy & Millar.\nSolicitors for respondents: Fitch & Brewster.\n[1] 12 Ont.

White ([1]) approved.\nThe judgment of the court below affirmed, Gwynne J. dissenting on the ground that the finding of the jury on the question submitted to them was against evidence, and further that the acts done by the defendant were not mere isolated acts of trespass, but acts done in assertion of ownership during a period exceeding 35 years, and the evidence of such acts should have been submitted to the jury and the jury told that if they believed this evidence they should find for the defendant.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a new trial.\nThe action was brought in the court below by the respondent against the appellant for an alleged tres- pass, and the declaration contained a count for trespass to land and a count in trover for trees cut upon the locus, which is a piece of unfenced land lying between two roads and in the declaration is described as bounded \"on the north by Palmer's road.\" The appellant, as to the trespass, pleaded not guilty, and that the land upon which it was committed was not the respondent's land.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice Hensley it appeared that in the year 1820 a road was run through a portion of the township on which the locus is situated, and in its course passed between the farms at present in possession of appellant and respondent; that since the year 1851 two roads exist, and that between these two roads is a piece of land upon which the respondent charges that the trespass was committed, she alleging that the road, to the north of the locus is the Palmer road, and that inasmuch as this road is her northern boundary the locus is included in her farm.\nThe appellant admitted having cut the wood on the locus, (the alleged trespass) but claimed that the Palmer road ran south of the locus, which, if so, would include it in his farm or exclude it from respondent's.\nEvidence was given on the trial of wood and timber being cut on the locus by the appellant and those through whom he claims for a number of years previous to the action, and the defendant attempted to set up a title by possession to the locus, even if it was embraced within plaintiff's leases, and asked the judge to charge the jury that such evidence was sufficient, if they believed it, to constitute a title in him by possession.\nThe judge refused so to charge, holding that if the plaintiff's contention as to the situation of the Palmer road was correct, ,and that was for the jury to say, the evidence of cutting given by defendant amounted merely to isolated acts of trespass and were not of such an actual, continuous and visible nature as the law required to confer a title by possession.\nThe jury found that the north road claimed by respondent was the Palmer road, and gave her a verdict accordingly.\nThe defendant moved for a new trial on the ground of misdirection by the learned judge in refusing to charge the jury as requested on the trial. The rule nisi for a new trial was discharged and the defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHodgson Q.C. for the appellant. The judge was not justified in withdrawing from the jury evidence of defendant's possession. See Ewing's Lessee v. Burnet ([2]); Prudential Assurance Company v. Edmonds ([3]).\nThe defendant used the land in the only way it could be used and such user will give him a title under the statute of limitations. Davis v. Henderson ([4]); Mulholland v. Conklin ([5]); Norton y. London & North Western Ry. Co. ([6]).\nDavies Q.C. for the respondent. The judge has to exercise a discretion in determining what evidence shall be left to the jury. Metropolitan Ry Co. v. Jackson ([7]). And the discretion was rightly exercised by refusing to leave to the jury this evidence of possession when the location of the Palmer Road would settle the rights of the parties. Jones v. Chapman ([8]).\nIt was necessary for the defendant to show an open, visible, continuous possession of the locus in order to establish a title under the statute of limitations and the evidence was entirely insufficient for that purpose. Proprietors of Kennebeck v. Call ([9]); Proprietors of Kennebeck v. Springer ([10]).\nSir W. J. RITCHE C.J.\u2014The great controversy at the trial of this case appears to have been as to which of the two roads, the one to the north and the other to the south of the disputed locus and adjoining each other at the eastern and western ends of the locus, or near the eastern and western ends, was the old Palmer road run in 1820, the plaintiff contending that that road was to the north of the locus, and the defendant that the south is the old Palmer road. There can be no doubt that the old Palmer road was the division line between the Sherren and Pearson farms; in fact, I understood such to be the contestation of both parties, and that the question at the trial was : Where was the Palmer road ? This question the learned judge left squarely to the jury, instructing them that if they found that the north road was on the line of the road run in 1820 by Palmer to find for the plaintiff, otherwise to find for the defendant. The jury found for the plaintiff, and thereby established that the north road was the old Palmer road, which finding it cannot be said, I think, that there was no evidence to justify, and therefore the finding of the jury, and its confirmation by the court, ought not to be disturbed. But, independently of this, the defendant does not complain of, and has not appealed against, this finding of the jury, but has limited the question to be raised on this appeal to the alleged misdirection of the learned judge in withdrawing from the consideration of the jury certain acts which he claims were acts of possession sufficient to give him a title under the statute of limitations. The case submitted to this court, states that the question intended to be raised on this appeal is: Was the learned judge right in directing the jury that the sole question for their consideration was, where was the old Palmer road originally established? Or should he not, instead of withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury, also have left to them, as requested by the defendant's counsel, the question of possession and the evidence of the defendant's claim to the possession, and whether the plaintiff's title was barred by the statute of limitations? and with this the factums of both the appellant and the respondent agree. And the learned counsel for the appellant frankly admitted on the argument that on this appeal it was not open to him to attack the finding of the jury on the question submitted as to the Palmer Road, and complains only, as his factum does, of the ruling of the learned judge in reference to the question of possession, that is to say, in not leaving to the jury to say whether or not the defendant had such a possession of the locus for twenty years as barred the plaintiff's title under the statute of limitations.\nAssuming then this finding to be correct, the defendant contended at the trial, and before the court below and in this court, that the evidence showed the plaintiff was out of possession of the locus and the defendant in possession, and assuming the north road to be the Palmer Road the plaintiff's title was barred by the statute of limitations, or at any rate, there was evidence which the judge should have submitted to the jury and he was not warranted in telling them that there was no evidence from which they could find that plaintiff was out of possession or her title barred.\nTo enable the defendant to recover he must show an actual possession, an occupation exclusive, continuous, open or visible and notorious for twenty years. It must not be equivocal, occasional or for a special or temporary purpose.\nI cannot discover anything in this case to indicate that the defendant or those under whom he claims at any time made an entry on the land with a view of taking possession of it under a claim of right or color of title, or with a view of dispossessing the actual owner, such as running the lines around it, spotting the trees, or acts of this character, assuming such would have been sufficient against the true owner, or by any other open, visible, continuous acts, and there is no evidence whatever to show that the acts relied on were done with the knowledge of the owner, The acts relied on were nothing more, as against the true owner, than isolated acts of trespass having no connection one with the other. The mere acts of going on wilderness land from time to time in the absence of the owner, and cutting logs or poles, are not such acts, in themselves, as would deprive the owner of his possession. Such acts are merely trespasses on the land against the true owner, whoever he may be, which any other intruder might commit. There was no occupation of the lot by the defendant; there was nothing sufficiently notorious and open to give the true owner notice of the hostile possession begun. An entry and cutting a load of poles or a lot of wood, being itself a mere act of trespass, cannot be extended beyond the limit of the act done, and a naked possession cannot be extended by construction beyond the limits of the actual occupation, that is to say, a wrongdoer can claim nothing in relation to his possession by construction.\nAssuming then that the old Palmer road, as found by the jury, was unquestionably the true dividing line between the Pearson and Sherren lots, the possession would follow the title unless displaced by evidence of an exclusive, continuous and uninterrupted possession of twenty years by the defendant. As was said in Doe d. DesBarres v. White ([11]), the presumption is that the owner remains in possession of that which is not actually in possession of others until proof be given of acts of possession by the defendant. It is sufficient for the plaintiff, as owner of the fee, to show the land continued in its natural state, and uninclosed, within twenty years before action. In the case just referred to, Doe d. DesBarres v. White, which was decided as far back as 1842, Parker J., afterwards Chief Justice, says ([12]):\u2014\nIt has already been repeatedly decided, that a twenty years' adverse possession to a part of a lot of land, by a person coming in without color of title, will not enure as a possession of the remainder, but this is the first time that I am aware of, that the question has been distinctly been brought up in this court as to what will constitute adverse possession of wilderness land. In the absence of any English case to direct our judgment, which of course could not be looked for in any of the English courts at Westminister, it is satisfactory to find that the question has frequently been discussed in the courts of the United States, and that in various independent tribunals in different States, some of which hold to the statute of James 1st. as the existing law, and others have local statutes framed after the model of the English statute, there has been a great unanimity on the subject, and a general opinion of the impropriety and inexpediency of giving any constructive effect to acts which do not of themselves clearly demonstrate the intention of the party to dispossess the owner. I shall proceed to cite several of those cases, not as binding authority, but, as was said by Justice patteson, 6 A. & E. 837, intrinsically entitled to the highest respect; they are important to us, inasmuch as the same principles of law are applied to a state of things similar to our own, by judges of high character, learning and experience; some, indeed, of very deserved celebrity. 1 cite from the notes to Tillinghast's Ejectment.\n[The learned judge then proceeds to cite at length a great number of American authorities, and concludes thus:\u2014]\nIt is impossible not to perceive the different manner in which the rights of owner of wilderness land are affected by a person entering, enclosing and actually cultivating, who stands there in fact openly and notoriously excluding the owner from the possession, and against whom, as it was ably argued, he may immediately proceed to a legal adjudication of his title ; and by another who enters, cuts down the trees here and there, taking them off the land for the purpose of using them, and often without the knowledge at the time of the owner, who may indeed remain in ignorance of the person by whom these acts are committed, and who cannot well be prepared to meet evidence of such acts, when they are brought forward as proofs of an adverse possession. If every intendment is to be made in favor of the lawful owner, in order to protect right and suppress wrong, Why should the act of cutting down the trees, and taking it away, be intended as an act of possession of land? The intent to occupy the land is not indicated by that act ;in general, no such intent accompanies it, it is the commission of a wrong, not he exercise of a right \u2018 and on what principle would you extend benefit to the wrongdoer , beyond the necessary consequence of the act? He may continue such acts for years, and yet never think of possessing himself of the land; and who can say when the intent was first formed? The act indeed may be concealed until the right to maintain an notion of trespass is barred by the statue of limitations, when it may be set up with impunity as a proof of possession. If however the repeated acts of cutting and taking away trees openly, notoriously and exclusively commited by one person, with the knowledge of the owner, or under such circumstances as that he cannot be presumed to be ignorant of them and without interruption on his part, will ripen into actual possession of the soil , one of two things would seem further required , namely, that the land over which the claim extends shall be defined, either by marks and bounds upon the land itself, or by some deed or instrument under colour of which the party has entered ; there must have been sufficient acts of this sort commited before the commencement of that period , and not merely while it was running on . It is also material to show distinctly that all the acts of cutting relied on have been done by the party himself or by others under his directions, or that there be at least the same degree of certainty on this point as would be required to make him answerable in an action of trespass\nAnd Carter J. afterwards Chief Justice says:\u2014 ([13]).\nWe then have to consider what are the acts of the defendant, by which he says he has proved that he has been in the possession of this land for more than twenty years. It appeared that the land in dispute is a tract of wilderness in the rear of a piece of cultivated land, of which the defendant has been in the occupation for more than thirty years ; that on several occasions, and probably whenever he had need of such things, he went to the back of his cleared land to cut firewood and poles. It is obvious and natural that in so doing he would at first merely go on the part nearest to his cleared land, and gradually extend his acts of trespass (for such undoubtedly they were at first) further and further back. Now in the absence of any other evidence, what inference is to be drawn from the mere fact of a person going on the land of another, and cutting down a few trees, and carrying them away for firewood? Surely not that he intends to take possession of the land on which the trees grew, but that he intends merely to get the wood for his own purposes. Suppose he does this repeatedly, and that he ultimately cuts down all the trees, when is it that he can be said to manifest an intention to take possession of the land itself? Granting however that repeated acts of trespass of such a nature on land may constitute a possession of the land, still it is obvious that such possession cannot be said to commence until after the last act of trespass has been committed, which will make up the amount necessary to constitute such possession. In the case of land under cultivation, suppose a person who has no title takes possession by fencing; that he begins by erecting a small part of the fence, and does not completely fence the whole in until some years have passed; his possession of the\nwhole could hardly be said to commence until the whole of his fence was completed. Assuming that these acts of the defendant could give him a possession of the land, there is nothing in the evidence to show that such acts had extended over the whole of this tract more than twenty years before this action was commenced, or to what particular portion of the land they had extended at that time and therefore the defendant failed in proving a possession, of twenty years to the whole or any part of the land in question.\nChief Justice Chipman and Mr. Justice Botsford took no part in this judgment on account of having been engaged in the suit while at the bar, but both expressed their full concurrence with their brethren upon the general principles of adverse possession.\nI have cited this case at greater length than I otherwise should have done, because it has ever since been regarded and acted on as enunciating the correct principles in reference to the possession of wilderness lands. To interfere in any way with this case, or to cast any doubt on it, after having been accepted and acted on as good law for forty-two years, would be to unsettle the jurisprudence of New Brunswick and, as I understand, of the other Maritime Provinces, on this subject and lead to litigation and confusion.\nThe evidence as to the acts of possession is the very opposite of showing an adverse possession for twenty years of this lot, as the following extracts from the evidence of the defendant's witnesses will show.\nJos. McDonald says:\u2014\nI chopped wood on the disputed piece for Mr. Coughlan south of the Northern road. I chopped that wood 42 years ago. Richard Boyle:\u2014\nI know the disputed piece of land. I cut off the disputed piece of land 16 or 17 years ago. I got leave from Mrs. Sherren the grandmother of the defendant.\nGreorge Oakes:\u2014\nLive at Crapaud; aged 46; lived within 16 chains of the place; I never remember a stick being cut off on the disputed land when I first went to school.\nJames Hall:\u2014\nI saw young James Sherren and John McDonald and old Mr. Jas-Sherren cut down off the disputed land. I saw Sherren cut when Mr. Pearson was alive. Can't name the year. I saw George Trowsdale cutting. Might be 10 or 15 years ago.\nJohn McDonald:\u2014\nI know the piece of land in dispute. I cut poles off it. 200 or 300 poles in 1870. In 1871 cut about 500 to 600 too. I did it for Mrs. Sherren the defendant's grandmother.\nThe evidence of John Sherren, uncle of defendant is much relied on. He says:\u2014\nMy father cut wood on the disputed land in 1851. I went in 1852 and cut down a good bit of staff oft it, about 20, 30 or 50 trees. I suppose there never was a year in the 35 years but what I, or some of the Sherrens, cut some wood off it, except last year.\nJohn Malone:\u2014\nLived three and a half miles from disputed land. I never saw any cutting or trees cut on the disputed land.\nJames Trowsdale Sherren:\u2014\nFather of defendant James and owner of the land. Brother (that is John Sherren whose evidence is referred to above) has nothing to do with it. Went into possession in 1850 or 1851. I cut on this disputed piece of land. Commenced cutting on it 13 or 14 years ago. Before that I saw mother's servants and several men and my brother cutting poles. McDonald cut in 1870 and 1871. I saw my brother George who is dead cut on it 13 or 14 years ago. Nothing more than taking a tree now and again on it or my boy by my orders sometimes. I would take a sill, sometimes a beam off it and some hundred longers. I and my son and brother cut off it during the last 15 years.\nOn cross-examination he says:\u2014\n1 think I cut some saw logs on this land some five years ago. I was in last fall to see this place. I think I was cutting 10 or 11 years myself more or less during that time. I saw some sticks lying there last fall. Theft this witness who went into possession in 1850 on 1851, says:\u2014\nFive different winters I cut on that place or three winters I will say to two different winters. I didn\u2019t cut any poles last winter that I mind of. Some poles were cut three winters ago north of the south road off the disputed piece.\nJames Sherren:\u2014\nI cut the wood; am 31 next May; I remember 20 years back (1866); know this piece of land; cut on it 13 or 14 years since father got it; wanted it for fence poles and saw logs; first about 14 years ago made use of it for boards and scantling; cut mostly every year; six or seven years ago I cut 600 longers off this very piece.\nin this case, then, there is nothing to indicate that the party at any time made an entry on the land with a view of taking possession of it under a claim of title or any open visible acts. There is no evidence of anything but isolated acts of trespass having no connection one with the other, no evidence of any open, visible, continuous possession for twenty years, known, or which might have been known, to the owner, but simply cutting without any open and exclusive possession.\nSTRONG J: \u2014The appellant himself tells us that the only question intended to be raised here is, whether the judge who presided at the trial should not have left the occasional acts of ownership exercised by the defendant to the jury as evidence of possession under the statute of limitations. As I am clearly of opinion, for the reasons already stated by the Chief Justice and which I need not therefore repeat, that these trespasses were no evidence of possession there is, in my opinion, no alternative but to dismiss the appeal.\nFOURNIER J:\u2014I concur in the reasons given by His Lordship the Chief Justice for dismissing this appeal.\nHENRY J.\u2014I also am of the opinion that the appeal in this case should be dismissed with costs. At the argument it was clearly intimated to us that the only question for our decision was as to the propriety of the proceeding of the learned judge at the trial who withdrew from the jury the question of the defendant's possession of the locus. I have come to the conclusion that the learned judge was perfectly right in adopting that course and he was not only right, but it was his duty to do what he did. In all the provinces the law is well settled that acts of trespass cannot amount to what the law requires to give title under the statute of limitations, that is, the ouster of the true owner. An act of trespass in going on the property amounts to a disseisin for a time, but it is not an ouster; what the law requires is an ouster of the owner for twenty years. Numerous acts of trespass only amount to so many acts of disseisin; when a man trespasses on the land the true owner ceases to have full possession for the time being; but the moment the trespass is at an end the trespasser's disseisin is at an end and the complete possession is again in the actual owner. It is therefore required that the party should not only take possession, not only disseise the owner, but that he should continue that dissiesin so as to amount to an ouster, and that ouster maintained for the statutory period. That can only be done by some act of possession not merely by a temporary disseisin, and it must be over every inch of the land of which the party claims possession.\nIn this case the defendant got on the land. By the decision of the jury the title is in the plaintiff. That is not to be attacked; the finding of the jury is to be taken as correct. In that view of it I have come to the conclusion that there has been no ouster of the plaintiff.\nI approve generally of the decision of the late Chief Justice of New Brunswick in Doe d. DesBarres v. White ([14]). He argues the case very fully and, to my mind, very satisfactorily. But when he talks about the intention of the party who goes upon the land of another and commits a trespass, I should remark that the intention of the party has nothing to do with it. If he does not do what the law says will amount to an ouster it is immaterial what his intention is. The thing necessary for him to prove is a possession for twenty years.\nThis is not a case of adverse possesion. That does not arise here. It is only a question as to whether or not the owner was out of possession for twenty years.\nIn this case the statute, so far as the evidence goes, has never, in my opinion, commenced to run. The plaintiff was never out of possession and, therefore, I think the judgment of the court below was right, and the judge was right in withdrawing from the jury a question which could only be decided in the one way. This was the only question to be determined by the jury, and it would be useless, in my opinion, for the court to send the case back for the decision of another jury on a question which, in law, could not operate to give the defendant a title to the land in dispute.\nTaschereau J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. Where was this Palmer Road was the main question at the trial. The jury found that the north road as claimed by the respondent was the Palmer road, and returned a verdict in his favor, which verdict was subsequently sustained by the full court. Now against this verdict the appellant has nothing to say. He limits his appeal as follows:\nWas the learned judge justified in directing the jury that the sole question for their consideration was,\u2014Where was the old Palmer Road originally established? or should he not instead of withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury also have left to the jury the question of possession, and the evidence of the defendant's claim to the possession, and whether the plaintiff's title was barred by the statute of limitations, as requested by the defendant's counsel? I am of opinion that, as held by the judge at the trial, the location of this Palmer road determined the ownership of the locus in contestation. This part was all wilderness. The appellant had cleared south to the Palmer road as fixed by the jury, and had fenced his land along that road from his west boundary line eastwardly some chains past where the south road, claimed by him as Palmer's, branched off from the now established Palmer road. By this open, notorious, continuous and visible act ho had declared to the world the extent of his claim. Occasional acts of cutting beyond this fence and across the road, committed too without respondent's knowledge, were mere repeated acts of trespass.\nIt is clear law that if a man owns a farm by a good legal title the front part of which he occupies and cultivates and the rear of which he reserves in a wilderness state for firewood or other purposes, a series of independent acts of trespass committed on the rear of the land, by a wrongdoer or person laying illegal claims thereto each of them unconnected with preceding or subsequent acts, would not operate to oust the title of the legal owner. By virtue of his title he was as much in possession, in the eye of the law, of the woodland in the rear as of the cultivated land in front. To deprive him of that possession the wrongdoer entering must show dispossession of the true owner by actual, constant, visible possession for twenty years in himself.\nThe fact that the wrongdoer or trespasser supposes he has a claim or title to the land does not alter the character of his acts. His unfounded belief cannot diminish or destroy the legal claims of the true owners or deprive them of their right to treat him as a wrongdoer in entering on their land. The effect to be given to repeated entries upon the land, or acts of user or possession, depend largely upon the nature of the property. What might be sufficient evidence in the case of cultivated lands to go to a jury would not constitute any evidence in those of wilderness lands. If the property is of a nature that cannot easily be protected against intrusions, mere acts of user by trespassers will not establish a right.\nOwners of wilderness or wooded lands lying alongside or in the rear of other cultivated fields are not bound to fence them or to hire men to protect them from spoliation. The spoiler, however, does not, by managing without discovery even for successive years to carry away valuable timber, necessarily acquire, in addition, title to the land. The law does not so reward spoliation.\nAs to Mr. Justice Hensley's charge to the jury, I do not see that the appellant's contentions can be maintained. The judge told the jury that if they found the north road to be the Palmer road the plaintiff\", respondent, had constructive possession of the locus in litigation, and that the acts of cutting given in evidence by the defendant (now appellant) admitting them all as well and duly found, could not operate as a disseizin of the respondent, and a bar to his title. I do not see anything illegal in that charge. On the contrary, if the judge had charged the jury as the appellant contends he ought to have done, that is to say, if he had left the question of possession to them, and they had found, on that point, in favor of the present appellant, with this evidence on record that verdict, in ray opinion, could not have been sustained.\nGwyNne J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the rule nisi issued in the court below for a new trial should be ordered to be made absolute. The action is one of trespass quare clausum fregit. The plaintiff in her declaration alleges that the defendant broke and entered certain land of the plaintiff described as follows:\u2014\" On the south by \"land in possession of John Stordy, on the west by \"the Westmoreland river, on the north by Palmer's \"road, and on the east by a stream situate on township number 29 in Queen's County,\" in the Province of Prince Edward Island and cut down and carried away a large number of trees growing thereon, &c.\nIn pursuance of an order of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island the following particulars were given of the years and months and days as near as could be upon which the trespasses complained of were committed, namely: In the months of February, March, April and May, 1884, and between the 1st of February, 1885 and 1st of April, 1885, and also between the months of August and December, 1883.\nTo this declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty, and that the land was not the plaintiff's as alleged.\nAt the trial the plaintiff produced and put in evidence an indenture of lease, dated the 1st of June, A.D., 1818, and made between the Right Honourable John Earl of Westmoreland and the Right Honourable Eobert Lord Viscount Melville of the one part and John Pearson of the other part, whereby the piece of land next therein after described was demised to John Pearson, that is to say, all that tract, piece or parcel of land situate lying and being in the Parish of Hillsborough in Prince Edward Island, which is bounded as follows:\u2014\nCommencing at a square stake fixed in the north-east bank of the north-west branch of Westmoreland or Crapaud River, the same being the north-western boundary of William Hodson's farm, and from thence running by a line north sixty degrees east until it strikes the north-east branch of said Westmoreland river and following the course thereof northward to a certain road lately opened, leading from the lower or new road to the upper or old road from Charlotte-town to Tryon, and from thence following the course of the said first mentioned road, until it meets the said new road from Charlotte town to Tryon aforesaid, and from the centre thereof running by a line south 60 degrees west into Westmoreland river aforesaid and following the courses thereof to the place of beginning, making a front of ten chains by a base line upon the said river and containing 90 acres of land a little more or less agreeable to a plan thereof hereunto annexed, and is part and parcel of lot or township number 29 in the said Island. Habendum, for 999 years.\nThe plan above referred to was not annexed to the lease nor was it produced, nor was any attempt made to shew that the locus in quo was within the metes and bounds stated in the lease, for in 1859 this lease became surrendered by a new lease which the tenant then took for a term of 900 years from the 1st November,1859, from Lady Cecily Jane Georgina Fane, who is admitted to have then been the heir to the Earl of Westmoreland, the lessor in the lease of 1818 mentioned, and to have been then seised in fee of the lands described in the lease executed by her on the 1st of November, 1859. In that lease the land thereby demised is described as follows:\u2014\nAll that tract, piece or parcel of land situate in the western moiety of township number twenty-nine, and bounded as follows that is to say:\u2014Commencing at a stake fixed on the east wide of the Westmoreland river at the southeast corner of land leased to Henry Newson, thence along Henry Newson's line to Palmer road, thence along Palmer road to the stream, thence southerly along the stream until it obtains a breadth of nine chains and twenty-four links, thence south fifty-five degrees thirty minutes west to the river, thence along the river to the place of commencement, containing by estimation ninety acres of land be the same a little more or less.\nThe plaintiff claimed title through the will of her husband, who died in the year 1867, and who was the lessee named in the above leases. The first question involved in the case was the site of the Palmer road as the locus in quo\u2014that road being the north boundary of the land described in the lease of the 1st November, 1859, under which the plaintiff claimed title; and secondly a question arose whether (whatever might be the site of the Palmer road) the defendant and those through whom he claimed were not in possession of the locus in quo for more than twenty years before the commencement of the action. This Palmer road was not in existence when the lease of 1818 was executed; it was run first in 1820 by a person of the name of Palmer, but under the authority it would seem of the owners in fee of the land on which it was run and of their tenants; for a witness named Turnbull, aged 83, who was employed in running it under the Mr. Palmer from whom the road derives its name, says: \"That the road commenced at a road called Stordy's road and ran north-east by east on the line between Newson and Pearson. It went\" he says \"a little more in on Pearson that on Newson. Starting from Stordy's line it ran at first straight, but when approaching a gulch it was canted in to the east on to Pearson's land. Newson's land \"he says\" did not run out to the old Town road; somewhere near Newson's corner (that is his eastern corner or boundary), the road\" he says\" took a sheer to the right to clear the gulch. This sheer to the right would \"he said\" be no distance at all from Newson's corner. The road then came to a brook and from thence out to the old Town road. The object of the divergence was to clear the gulch.\" This running of the road on to Pearson's land was no doubt with his knowledge and consent and would seem to account for the new lease given to and accepted by Pearson in November, 1859, for the Palmer road which by that indenture is made the northern boundary of the land leased to Pearson was in August, 1841, made the southern boundary of land then demised by the Earl of Westmoreland to one Coughlan through which demise the present defendant claims title, On the 27th August, 1841, by an indenture of that date the Earl of Westmoreland demised to John Coughlan his executors, administrators and assigns, habendum for 999 years, a portion of the said township, number 29, described as follows : \u2014\nCommencing at a stake fixed on the west side of a road called Palmer or the old town road at the east boundary of Samuel Newson's farm, and running back on said lino 23 chains and 50 links or until it meets the eastern boundary line of James Collbeck's farm, and thence running along said line north, 31 degrees, 30 minutes east, 16 chains, 25 links, thence in a direction south 58 degrees 30 minutes east 34 chains 50 links, or until it meets the road a foresaid, thence along the west side of said road in a direction south-west to the said state or place of commencement, containing 60 acres more or less.\nNow the first question as I have said is as to the site of the Palmer road at the locus in quo. The locus in quo is a piece of land which lies on the north side of and abutting on a road which diverges to the right from a point near Newson's Corner and which after crossing a brook approaches Stordy's mill stream. Such a road, it may be here observed, accurately corresponds with the description given by Turnbull of the course which the Palmer road, as run in 1820, took, when he says that the \" road somewhere near Newson's Corner,\" and he says again \" this would be no distance at all from Newson's Corner,\" took a sheer to the right to clear a gulch.\nNow at the time of the execution of the indenture of lease of August, 1841, which appears to have been the first which made the Palmer road a boundary of land demised, it is not pretended that there were two roads on the ground at the locus in quo\u2014there were not two roads diverging to the right from the straight line which starting at Stordy's road was run as the Palmer road\u2014there was but one such point of divergence and but one road then known as the Palmer road at the locus in quo, which diyerging to the right from a straight line led to Stordy's mill stream. The material question therefore between the parties is\u2014 Where was that diverging road situate at the time of the execution of the indenture of demise of August, 1841, under which the defendant claims ? for the land to the north of that road as it was then opened and travelled on was demised to Coughlan by that indenture, and that same road must be taken to be the boundary of the land demised to Pearson by the indenture of lease of November, 1859. Whatever was known and used and travelled upon the ground as the Palmer road in 1841, when the lease to Coughlan was executed, must be the road up to which the land demised to him reached, and must be held to be thenceforth the road coming under the designation of the Palmer road at the locus in quo, and to be the road referred to as the Palmer road in the description of the land demised to Pearson by the indenture of November 1859.\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the road as claimed by the defendant is the only road which was in existence and known as the Palmer road at the locus in quo in 1841, when the lease to Coughlan under which the defendant claimed was executed.\n(His lordship then reviewed the evidence at length and proceeded as follows :)\nThis being the evidence, the learned judge who tried the case directed the jury that if they should find that the north road as on the ground was on the lines of road run in 1820 they should find for the plaintiff\u2014if otherwise to find for defendant. Counsel for the defendant objected to the charge and asked the learned judge to charge the jury that even if they should find that the north road was laid out in 1820 they should still consider the evidence as to possession and find whether the defendant's father and those through Whom he claimed were not in possession of the piece of land in dispute, and the plaintiff and those through whom she claimed out of possession of it for more than twenty years before the commencement of the action. This the learned judge refused to do and he charged the jury that there was no evidence from which they could find that the plaintiff was out of possession, or that her title was barred, or that the defendant or those through whom he claimed had possession of or had any title to the locus in quo and that the sole question for their consideration was: Where was the line of the Palmer road run in 1820? The jury upon this charge by a majority of five to two rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. A rule was obtained in the supreme court of the Island calling upon the plaintiff to show cause why this verdict should not be set aside and a new trial granted upon the following grounds: That the verdict was against the weight of and contrary to evidence\u2014and that the judge who tried the case charged the jury that there was no evidence from which they might find that the defendant or those through whom he claimed had obtained a title to the land in dispute.\nThis rule was discharged by the court and it is from the rule which discharged the rule nisi that this appeal is taken.\nIt is, I think, impossible to understand how the jury could have rendered the verdict they did if they had understood the judge's charge in the sense in which, no doubt, he intended it to be understood by them, namely, that if they should find the north road to have been the road laid out and opened in 1820 and since travelled upon as the Palmer road, from thence up to and in 1841 when the lease to Coughlan was executed, to find for the plaintiff, for this was the material question in issue. The word \"run\" in 1820 as used by the learned judge was not the most appropriate term to have used; there was no evidence, or suggestion that there was a road \"run\" in 1820 different from the road which was opened and travelled as the Palmer road. All the evidence was to the effect that what was run in 1820 was the road which was then opened and thenceforth travelled upon and known as the Palmer road. So that perhaps the jury did understand the learned judge's charge as they should have understood it and that the majority intended to find by their verdict that the north road was the road which was opened in 1820 and was thenceforth travelled upon and known as the Palmer road until and in 1841, when the lease to Coughlan was executed. Such a verdict, if that be what the jury meant, was utterly unsupportable upon the evidence, for it was proved beyond question that no road was ever opened on that line until 1851, and moreover the great mass of the evidence leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the south road is the true old Palmer road and which has always been known and travelled upon as such. But it is said that although the rule nisi for a new trial in the court below asked that the verdict might be set aside as against the evidence, no question now arises before us upon this point because the learned counsel for the appellant, resting, as I understood him, upon his objection to the judge's charge on the question of possession as sufficient for his purpose abstained from pressing his objection to the verdict upon the single point which was submitted to the jury on the ground of its being wholly against the evidence. But the fact that the learned counsel for the appellant having two points, both of which he deemed equally good and which he took and made the grounds upon which his rule nisi was granted, rested in his argument before us upon one of them as being in his judgment abundantly sufficient to entitle the appellant to a new trial, cannot deprive him of the right to insist upon all the evidence bearing upon that point, although it bears equally upon the point not pressed. The whole of the evidence in point of fact bears upon the question of possession, and therefore must be referred to in the question now before us just as if it had been the only one in contestation throughout. The objection under consideration is simply one of misdirection, namely, whether or not it was misdirection in the learned judge to have told the jury that there was no evidence before them upon which they could find that the plaintiff had been out of possession\u2014or that the defendant and those through whom he claimed ever had possession of the locus in quo and that the sole question for their consideration was where was the line of the Palmer road run in 1820, and that if they should find that the north road as on the ground, that is to say the road which the evidence showed was never opened or made until 1851, was on the line run in 1820, they should find for the plaintiff. Can any doubt be entertained for a moment that the charge opens before us the whole of the evidence as bearing upon the question whether Coughlan and his assignees had or not possession up to the south road now on the ground as the boundary between the lands in the possession of Coughlan and his assignees on the one side and the land in the possession of the plaintiff's husband in his lifetime and of the plaintiff since his death on the other? Reading this evidence I must say, with the greatest deference for those with whom it is my misfortune to differ in this case, that the learned judge's charge cannot in my opinion be supported, and that it is clearly open to the defect of misdirection and if, when given, it was misdirection it is obvious that the subsequent finding of the jury upon the single point so erroneously submitted to them, whether such finding be right or wrong upon that point, cannot remove the defect of misdirection and the error committed in witholding from them the other question which should have been submitted to them, and in not drawing their attention to the evidence bearing upon that question.\nSo far as the question of actual possession was concerned it was obviously a matter of no importance whether or not a line had been run in 1820 in the place where the road made in 1851 was made if during all the period from Coughlan's entry under his lease in 1841 until his assignment of it in 1851 he was in possession up to what is now called the southern road on the ground as his southern boundary at the locus in quo. Whether Coughlan did or did not enter upon the locus in quo in 1841, claiming it under his lease, and whether there was then on the ground any road separating the locus in quo and the land leased to Coughlan from that in the possession of Pearson other than the road now called the southern road on the ground, and whether Coughlan did or not thenceforth continually until he assigned to Sherren in 1851 exercise acts of ownership over the locus in quo, claiming it as his own property to the exclusion of all others, and without any claim to it by Pearson or any other person, were facts for the jury and the jury alone to decide and which could not be affected in their determination by any opinion which in 1885 a jury might entertain upon the question whether a line had or had not been run in 1820 at any place different from that claimed by Coughlan to be a boundary between his possession and that of Pearson from 1841 to 1851 and enjoyed by him as such. Again, whether Sherren, the assignee of Coughlan. did or not in 1851 enter upon and retain possession of the locus in quo in the same manner, claiming it as his own, and whether he and those claiming under him did or not exercise acts of ownership over it, claiming it as their own property continuously from the time of the assignment by Coughlan of his lease, were likewise questions for the jury to decide, and which in their determination could not be affected by any opinion the jury might entertain upon the question whether the road claimed as the boundary between the lands in the possession of the plaintiff and defendant respectively was or not on a line run in 1820. All these were essentially questions for the jury alone to pass upon, and to say that there was no evidence to leave to them upon the question of title by possession with defendant was to ignore almost the Whole of the evidence. The authorities upon this point are numerous and uniform.\nWhere persons are in possession of adjoining lands whose visible dividing line is a fence or a road or a river (it matters not which), and exercise acts of ownership up to such dividing line, each is deemed to be in possession of the land on his side of and up to such dividing line, although upon a survey it might be found that a piece of land of which he was seized in fee by his paper title extended across and into the land on the other side of the fence or road or river from that on which the residue of his land lies and possession up to and according to the visible dividing line will perfect a title under the statute of limitations. Dennison v. Chew ([15]); Doe Dunlop v. Serbos ([16]) ; Doe Quinsey v. Caniffe ([17]) ; Doe Taylor v. Sexton ([18]).\nIn the present case the jury should have been told that if they believed the evidence as to the acts, of ownership and possession exercised by the Sherren's on the locus in quo (and as to which there was no contradictory evidence) they should find for the defendant. Doe Shepherd v. Bayley ([19]) is an authority to this effect.\nIn Dundas v. Johnston ([20]) Draper C.J.says:.\nI have always thought that as against the real owner squatters acquire title by twenty years occupation, of no more land than they actually have occupied or, at least, over which they have exercised continuous and open notorious acts of ownership, and Hot mere desultory acts of trespass in respect of which the true owner could not maintain ejectment.\nAnd he adds:\u2014\nWe agree with the learned judge who tried this case that it must depend upon the circumstances of each case whether the jury may not, as against the person having legal title, properly infer the possession of the whole land covered by such title in favor of an actual occupant, although his occupation by open acts of ownership, such as clearing, fencing and cultivating has been limited to a portion less than the whole.\nIn Hunter v. Farr ([21]) the same learned judge says:\nIf without title one enters on a lot which is in a state of nature, clearing and fencing a few acres only, leaving the rest open and unimproved, the actual possession of the part will not alone in my opinion draw to it the possession of the other part. I do not say what may be the effect of continuous acts of ownership over the residue though unenclosed and uncleared, but here there is no such evidence to rest upon.\nIn Heyland v. Scott ([22]) Hagarty C.J. says:\nWe are not prepared to hold that unenclosed woodland in this country can never be the subject of twenty years possession; if fencing and cultivation can alone constitute a possession then title to open woodland can never be acquired against the true owner.. To put an extreme case\u2014if a man posted caretakers or sentries every day to patrol the bounds of an unfenced lot, rigidly driving off all trespassers and thus preserving the whole for the exclusive use of their employer, could it still be said that twenty years of such proceedings would not bar the true owner. If this can confer a possessory title then the question becomes one only of degree.\nIn Davis v. Henderson ([23]) citing Erle J. in Stevenson v. Newnham ([24]) Wilson J. delivering the judgment of the court says: The term \"possession\" has no definite meaning.\nAnd he proceeds to discuss the question\u2014\nWhat is there to be done to constitute possession of wild land? If the rightful owner enter upon any part of it he enters in law upon the whole of it. If after such entry another forcibly turns him off and keeps him off for twenty years and during all that time the wrongdoer lives on the land and cultivates as much of it as he requires, but leaves the half of it in a state of nature, is not this extrinsic evidence without more of a disseisin of the whole lot? So if another believing he is rightful owner enters on a lot, claiming to be the owner of it all\u2014lives there for 20 years and clears a part of the land, leaving the rest of it as wild land, is not this without more evidence of possession of the whole lot the wild as well as the cleared land ? So if a squatter who is generally under stood to be a person without right or color of right, enters on land claiming the whole lot, and occupies it for 20 years cultivating part and leaving uncultivated the rest of the lot, taking his firewood and farm timber from it as he requires it, and using it in all respects just as the owner himself would if he were there, and just as all owners usually do use their wild land, is not this evidence of possession of the whole lot wild land and all? The instances above mentioned of the various kinds of possession show that all that is required in order to constitute possession of land is that such a seisin, enjoyment, occupation or benefit be had of the property, which the property is capable of according to its nature or character. Now how is wild land to be possessed? ft is settled that it need not be enclosed what better test can there be of its possession than the person whose possession is questioned should have used it just the same as any other owner uses his wild land\u2014by asserting title to it, by giving licenses to cut timber from it or to pass over it\u2014by excluding others from cutting on it or travelling over it at his pleasure\u2014by preserving the timber upon it though he has never cut a stick himself, or by any other acts or evidence from which it may fairly be presumed he has taken the possession of the woodland as well as of the cleared. To require more or greater possession than this will be to defect the beneficial object of the statute of limitations, which was to secure peace and to put an end to litigation bv extinguishing these dilatory claims.\nHe concludes by expressing his opinion upon the question in such cases to be submitted to a jury:\u2014\nIn my Opinion when any person enters on a lot or half lot or any defined piece of land, wild, or partly cleared and partly wild under color of right or otherwise, and holds possession for the statutable period the question for the jury should always be as to the wild land whether the person whose possession is in question has claimed or held the wild land as owner, and has used it in like manner as, the owners of land who have uncleared and unenclosed portions on the lots they occupy usually use their wild lands by such acts of ownership as owners are accustomed to exercise, or whether the acts of the person in question have been the acts of a mere trespasser not done and not intended to have been done in the assertion of right, title or ownership.\nIn Mulholland v. Conklin ([25]) the Court of Common Pleas for Ontario entirely adopted the views as expressed in the above judgment.\nNow in the case before us the evidence is that in the month of August, 1841, by the indenture of lease of the 27th of that month, Coughlan became possessed for a term of 999 years of a portion of Township 29 in Queen's County, in Prince Edward Island, the southern boundary of which portion was a road opened, travelled on and known as the Palmer road. There is a mass of evidence that the only road known as the Palmer in 1841 was that which is the southern road on the ground at the locus in quo and that Coughlan entered upon and held the land demised to him up to that southern road as his boundary, and that he continued to exercise acts of ownership upon the small piece now in dispute equally as upon the residue of the land by cutting timber thereon and using it as an owner of woodland would do until 1851 when he assigned the residue of his term and the land possessed by him in virtue thereof to one Sherren who entered upon and possessed and held the land as Coughlan had up to this same south road, claiming it to be the southern boundary of the land demised by the lease to Coughlan, and that Sherren and his assigns thence forth during every year for thirty-five years exercised acts of ownership upon the small piece now in dispute equally as on the residue of the land by cutting timber thereon, and using and claiming right to use it as part of the land of which they were possessed under the demise to Coughlan and that during all that time neither the plaintiff's husband, under whom the plaintiff claims, nor the plaintiff herself, nor any person interfered with the exercise of such acts of ownership by Coughlan or his assignees the Sherrens or claimed to have any interest in the locus in quo adverse to them. The evidence also shows that in 1851, before the assignment to Sherren, a new road was made on the land in possession of a tenant of Coughlan, but such new road which is now the north road on the ground could not alter the character of the possession of Coughlan up to the time of its being made, nor of his assignees after it was made up to the south road as and being the boundary as claimed by them of the land in their possession. It is impossible to say that this was not evidence to be submitted to the jury or that it was not sufficient if believed by the jury to have entitled the defendant to a verdict in his favor upon the question of possession conferring title under the statute of limitations. Indeed, Mrs. Hall who was the only witness to the acts which are relied upon as acts of trespass admits that those acts were done by the Sherrens in assertion of ownership, that is to say, animo domini. But for a judge to pronounce acts done every year during a period exceeding 35 years in assertion of ownership to be mere isolated, desultory acts of trespass and not to be matter to be submitted to a jury as evidencing possession of the land upon which the acts in assertion of ownership were so done, is such a usurpation of the province of the jury as entitles the defendant ex debito justitice to a new trial. Prudential Assurance Co. v. Edmonds ([26]).\nThe case of McConaghy v. Denmark ([27]), was cited on behalf of the plaintiff, but that case has no application whatever to the present. The action was brought in 1878 and the defendants pleaded liberum tenementum in themselves. They had no paper title and could therefore only prove their plea by shewing possession for twenty years, to the exclusion of the rightful owner under the statute of limitations, which statute in the province of Ontario where the land lay enacted that in case lands granted by the crown of which the grantee, his heirs or assigns had not taken actual possession by residing upon or cultivating some portion thereof, should when in a state of nature be taken possession of by some person not claiming under the grantee of the crown, the statute should not begin to run against the grantee of the crown his heirs or assigns, unless it should be shown that such grantee, &c., while entitled to the lands had knowledge of the same being in the actual possession of such other person, but should only begin to run from the time that such knowledge was obtained. The defendant, Francis McConaghy, having been examined as a witness admitted that he had never lived upon the land (he lived in fact in an adjoining township), and that he had never entered on the laud until within the last few years, since 1835, except occasionally to cut some timber suitable for use in his trade as a cooper; and it appeared that even for this purpose he had not entered on the land since 1840. There was evidence to show that other persons with whom the defendants did not claim privity had been in possession of part of the land but none of these appeared to have ever seen or to have been aware of McConaghy's entrance upon the land for the purpose of cutting and of his cutting the timber upon the occasions spoken of by him\u2014the possession which the parties who had been in possession of the land prior to 1845 lacked the essential condition to the statute of limitations beginning to run against the grantee of the crown, for it did not appear that such grantee or any person claiming under him had entered upon the land by residing thereon or cultivating any portion thereof or had any knowledge of any other person having taken possession thereof In 1845 an entry was made upon the land by one acting for the grantee of the crown, and from that time down to the commencement of the action the possession was that of persons claiming under the persons through whom also the plaintiff claimed. The learned judge who tried the case alone as a jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, holding that upon the above evidence the defendants had not acquired title to the land under the statute of limitations, and this court was of opinion that he could not with propriety have rendered any other verdict. It is obvious that a judgment rendered upon such a state of facts as appeared in that case can have no application in the present case. The entries of Francis McConaghy upon the land in that case to cut the timber which he said he did cut had more the appearance of acts done animo furandi than animo domini.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Edward J.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nFire Insurance\u2014Condition in policy\u2014Not to carry on hazardous or extra hazardous business\u2014Violation of condition\u2014No increase of risk.\nA policy on a building described in the application for insurance as a spool factory contained the following conditions:\u2014\n\"That in case the above described premises shall at any time during \"the continuance of this insurance, be appropriated or \"applied to or used for the purpose of carrying on or exercising \"therein any trade, business or vocation denominated hazardous \"or extra hazardous or for the purpose of storing, using or \"vending therein any of the goods, articles or merchandise \"denominated hazardous or extra hazardous unless otherwise \"specially provided for, or hereafter agreed to by the defendant \"company in writing or added to or endorsed on this policy, \"then this policy shall become void.\n\"Any change material to the risk, and within the control or knowledge \"of the assured, shall void the policy as to that part \"affected thereby, unless the change is promptly notified in \"writing to the company or its local agent.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the introduction, without notice to the company, of the manufacture of excelsior into the insured premises, in addition to the manufacture of spools, avoided the policy under these conditions, the evidence establishing clearly and there being no evidence to the contrary, that such manufacture in itself was a hazardous, if not an extra hazardous business, notwithstanding that on the trial of the action on the policy the jury found, in answer to questions submitted to them, that such additional manufacture was less hazardous than that of spools and did not increase the risk on the premises insured. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] refusing to set aside a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs (respondents),\nThis is an action on a policy of insurance bearing date 19th November, 1880, issued by defendant company to William C. Moir and James W. Moir, insuring \"the machinery in spool factory, situate at Bedford Basin,\" in the sum of $3,000. The policy was renewed for one year from the 27th of October, 1881.\nIn the application for insurance, which, by its terms, is made a part of the policy, the building containing the machinery insured is thus described:\n\"g. For what purpose is building used? As a spool factory.\n\"A. What kind of goods are made and of what material? Spools made of hardwood.\n\"3. a. How occupied\u2014Grive full description under heading referring to class of property sought to be covered? Spool factory.\"\nThe policy contained the following, among other, conditions:\n\"And it is agreed and declared to be the true intent and meaning of the parties hereto, that in case the above described premises shall at any time during the continuance of this insurance be appropriated, or applied to, or used, for the purpose of carrying on or exercising therein any trade, business or vocation denominated hazardous or extra-hazardous; or for the purpose of storing, using or vending therein any of the goods, articles or merchandize denominated hazardous or extra-hazardous, unless otherwise specially provided for, or hereafter agreed to by this company in writing, or added to or endorsed on this policy, then this policy shall become void.\n\"2. Any change material to the risk, and within the control or knowledge of the assured, shall avoid the policy as to that part affected thereby, unless the change is promptly notified in writing to the company or its local agent; and the company when so notified may return the premium for the unexpired period and cancel the policy or may demand in writing an additional premium, which the insured shall, if he desire the continuance of the policy, forthwith pay to the company, and if he neglect to make such payment forthwith after receiving such demand, the policy shall be no longer in force.\"\nAfter the issue of the policy the insured, in addition to the manufacture of spools, manufactured on the said premises excelsior, made from wood cut by machinery into shreds and used for upholstering, and also stored such excelsior, after it had been pressed into bales, on the premises.\nThe machinery insured having been destroyed by fire the company refused payment of the policy on the ground that the manufacture of excelsior in the said building was a breach of the above conditions and rendered the policy void. On the trial of an action for the insurance in which the defence relied wholly on the ground just stated, evidence was offered as to the manufacture of excelsior as an insurance risk, and the relative risk between its manufacture and that of spools. Certain questions were submitted to the jury, and among them were the following:\u2014\n\"Q. Which is the more hazardous risk, if any, the manufacture of spools or the manufacture of excelsior? A. The manufacture of spools.\n\"Q. Is the risk increased by adding the manufacture of excelsior to that of spools in the same building? A. No.\"\nA verdict was found for the plaintiffs for the amount insured by the policy and interest, which verdict was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHenry Q.C. for the appellants.\nIf there is a breach of the condition in the policy it is void even if the risk is not thereby increased.\nExcelsior is a particularly hazardous article, and its manufacture is a clear breach of the condition. Lee v. Howard Insurance Co.[2].\nBorden for the respondent.\nThere is no evidence that excelsior is hazardous and the verdict could only be interfered with on that ground by sending the case to another jury.\nBut there is no necessity for a new trial as the jury have found that the risk was not increased by the change and the company, therefore, are not prejudiced.\nRefers to Wood on Insurance, sec. 233 Stokes v. Cox[3].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Where there is a condition like this annexed to a policy I think that, independent of the representations, it forms a stipulation in the policy itself, and it seems to me that the question to be determined is: What was the condition?\nThe respondent agreed that he would not allow the insured premises to be used for carrying on any business denominated hazardous or extra-hazardous, or for storing any goods or articles so denominated. Then the question is: Did he allow the premises to be so used?\nHe placed in the building in question, in addition to the spool factory which, by the express terms of the application for insurance and the policy, was what was insured, facilities for the manufacture of excelsior, and the evidence seems to me clear that that was a hazardous business, and being such there was a breach of the conditions of the warranty. It seems to me clear that the evidence shows this beyond all reasonable doubt, and there is no evidence to the contrary. And there is further evidence of the hazardous character of the business in the rate of premium which is charged for insuring premises in which it is carried on. The condition of warranty was not complied with, and therefore, by well known principles of insurance, the defendants were relieved.\nThe plaintiff offered no evidence, either in his own case or in reply, to show that the evidence given by defendants as to the character of this business was in any way incorrect, and that it was not a hazardous, or extra-hazardous business.\nFor these reasons I think it is our duty to give the judgment which should have been given by the court below and allow the appeal.\nStrong J.\u2014Concurred.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think this is a very clear case of a breach of the warranty in the policy, and the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014The contract that these parties entered into was clearly to insure a building used for the manufacture of spools, and the policy contained a warranty that no material change from that manufacture, calculated to increase the risk, should be made, otherwise the policy was to be void.\nThe only question to be put to the jury was, whether the manufacture of excelsior was hazardous or not. I would almost go further, and say that it was the duty of the judge, after that question was answered, to have found, not a verdict for the plaintiff, but a verdict for the defendants. The contract, as appears from the application, was that the company should insure a building used for the manufacture of spools.\nI think the evidence was quite strong enough to enable the jury to arrive at the conclusion that the risk was increased. The question simply was: Was the new business hazardous? Not: Was it more hazardous than the other? If that question had been submitted to the jury, and the evidence admitted of a doubt, the jury could have exercised the judgment upon it.\nI think this court must give the judgment that should have been given in the court below, and I therefore concur in allowing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The 14th plea expressly raises a question which determines the case. If manufacturing excelsior or keeping it on the premises is a risk denominated hazardous or extra-hazardous the policy is by its express terms avoided unless the company be notified, and an increased premium be paid, and the evidence does establish the manufacture to be extra-hazardous. I concur therefore in allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henry, Ritchie & Weston.\nSolicitors for respondents: Graham, Tupper, Borden & Parker.\n[1] 6 Russ. v.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nSale of goods\u2014Delivery\u2014Non-acceptance by vendee\u2014Return of goods to vendor\u2014Rescission of contract\u2014Re-sale. H. doing business at Halifax, N.S., was accustomed to sell hides to J. L. of Pictou. Their usual course of business was for H. to ship a lot of goods consigned to J. L., and send a note for the price according to his own estimate of weight, &c., which was subject to a future rebate if there was found to be any deficiency.\nOn July 14, 1884, a shipment was made by H. in the usual course and a note was given by J. L., which H. caused to be discounted. The goods came to Pictou Landing and remained there until August 5th, when J. L. sent his lighterman for some other goods and he finding the goods shipped by H. brought them up in his lighter. The next day J. L. was informed of their arrival and he caused them to be stored in the warehouse of D. L. where he had other goods, with instructions to keep them for the parties who had sent them. The same day he sent a telegram to H. as follows: \"In trouble. Have stored hides. Appoint some one to take care of them.\" H. immediately came to Pictou and having learned what was done, expressed himself satisfied. He asked if he would take the goods away, but was assured by J. L. that they were all right and left them in the warehouse.\nOn August 6th a levy was made, under an execution of the Pictou Bank against J. L., on all his property that the sheriff could find but the goods in question were not included in the levy. On August 12th J. L. gave to the bank a bill of sale of all his hides in the warehouse of D. L., and the bank indemnified D. L. and took possession under such bill of sale of the hides so shipped by H. and stored in said warehouse. In a suit by H. against the bank and D. L. for the wrongful detention of said goods:\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the court below, that the contract of sale between J. L. and H. was rescinded by the action of J.L. in refusing to take possession of the goods when they arrived at his place of business and handing them over to D. L. with direction to hold them for the consignor, and in notifying the consignor who acquiesced and adopted the act of J. L., whereby the property in and possession of the goods became re-vested in H.; and there was, consequently, no title to the goods in J. L. on August 12th when the bill of sale was made to the bank.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sustaining a verdict for the plaintiff.\nThis was an action commenced in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at Pictou, for the conversion of 162 hides and for damages for the detention of the same. The defendants appeared and denied the conversion and detention. They also denied the title of the plaintiff to the property and alleged title in the Pictou Bank, one of the defendants.\nThe plaintiff prior to the transaction out of which this action arose did business in Halifax, and was in the habit of shipping hides to one John Logan, a tanner, near the town of Pictou. The course of business seems to have been for the plaintiff to ship whatever hides he had for sale to Logan, and as soon as the shipment was made to forward an invoice and note for the amount named in it; on receipt of the invoice and note, Logan signed the latter and returned it to the plaintiff by mail. It also appears that by arrangement between Logan and the plaintiff, the hides should be accepted, and whatever was wanting in weight and quality should be the subject of a rebate to be made to Logan by Harvey.\nOn the 14th July, 1884, the plaintiff forwarded from Halifax, addressed to \"John Logan, Pictou,\" 162 hides, the bill of lading, given by the agent of the Intercolonial railway, providing that they were to be carried to Pictou station. The hides were put off at the land terminus of the railway at Pictou Landing, on the south side of the harbour from Pictou station, and remained there until the 5th of August, 1884. On that day Logan's lighterman, John Cameron, was sent by Logan with the lighter to Pictou landing for a carload of vitriol. He was not told to bring anything else but finding the hides there he took them in his lighter. Logan did not see them until the next day, the 6th, when the tannery stopped work: and in the morning he sent for the lighterman and told him he \"was in \"trouble and that he had better pnt the hides in separate \"lots just as he got them from the railway and put \"them in Dougald Logan's store \"which was done. The same day, August 6th, he sent the following telegram to Harvey: \"In trouble, have stored hides, \"appoint some one to take charge of them.\" Harvey came to Pictou, the hides were stored for him, and he expressed himself as satisfied. He asked if he had not better take them away but was told that they were all right, and he returned to Halifax, and left them there.\nThe hides were landed from the lighter and stored between seven and nine o'clock, a.m., on Aug. 6th On the same day the deputy sheriff with an execution on a judgment by confession in the suit of Pictou Bank v. John Logan, levied on all the property of John Logan, but did not levy on the hides. He applied to Dougald Logan for permission to enter the warehouse and get the hides but was refused. On the 7th an agreement was entered into between the bank and Logan by which he was to give a deed of assignment of all his property which he had under his possession or control and embracing all his personal property now held bound by the said execution, and agreed to deliver into possession of the Pictou bank or its agents all the personal estate, property and effects to be transferred by such deed. Logan became the bank's agent or servant under the terms of the agreement and superintended the business thenceforth for the bank. On the 12th of August Logan executed and gave to the Pictou bank an assignment of his property to pay the bank the amount due. It contained a schedule and there is a general clause ending as follows:\u2014\"Also all the hides and sole leather owned by the said John Logan, or stored by him in any buildings, warehouse or storeroom of Dougald Logan, or in his keeping.\"\n\"All the personal property assigned by the foregoing deed poll or bill of sale and schedule, has been this day delivered into the actual possession of William B. O. Meynell, as agent for the Pictou bank, and it is now in his possession in the tannery and on lands and premises owned by the bank.\"\nThe particular hides in question had not been that day delivered into the actual possession of Meynell or the bank and were not delivered at all until over a month afterwards viz., the 25th of September when Dougald Logan gave them up to the Pictou bank upon receiving a bond of indemnity. They were manufactured by the Pictou bank.\nHarvey brought an action and recovered a verdict, which was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nThe defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nSedgewick Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe property had vested in Logan and there must be a formal re-sale to Harvey to give him a title. Being Logan's property they passed to the bank under the bill of sale. The following authorities were cited: Bushel v. Wheeler[1]; Bentall v. Burn[2]; Benjamin on Sales[3].\nBorden for the respondent cited Sturtevant v. Orser[4]; Grout v. Hill[5]; Benjamin on Sales[6].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think there was a clear re-sale in this case; in fact, I think as strong a case of re-sale as could be made. These goods were shipped from Halifax and came to Pictou Landing, but were not taken from thence, or received by the consignee or taken away by his orders. The consignee sent over to obtain delivery of other property, and the goods in question were brought with the property so sent for. They arrived at their place of destination in Pictou on the evening of the 5th of August. The consignee was not aware that they had arrived until the next morning. When informed he immediately, then and there repudiated the receipt of the goods and gave directions that they should, with other goods belonging to other parties under similar circumstances, be deposited in the warehouse of his brother, with whom he does not appear to have had any business connection, with instruction to be kept there for the benefit of the parties who had shipped them from Halifax. His brother put a lock on the door of the warehouse and the consignee Logan says those goods were never in his possession, and that on the 12th of August, when the bill of sale was executed, they were not, and never had been, in his possession. He immediately communicated with Harvey in Halifax informing him that he had stored the goods and asking him to appoint some person to take charge of them, whereupon Harvey came to Pictou and was informed by Logan that the hides had come up in the lighter on the day previous, and that he (Logan) had stored them in Dougald's store for him (Harvey). Logan says:\u2014\nThe hides reached my place on the 5th August, 1884, between five and six in the evening. I did not see them that evening nor next day. On the morning of the 6th, early, I sent for John Cameron, who brought them there. I told him I was in trouble, and that he had better get the boys and put the hids in separate lots just as he got them from the railway, and put them in Dougald Logan's store. I said they belonged to different parties and I wanted them returned to them. I never saw these hides sent by Harvey, or took any possession of them. I told my brother Dougald to keep them for the parties who had sent them. I told him who the parties were. He agreed to take possession of them for the parties and did so, and he locked the building. He got a lock and put it on the door. Never had after that the hides in my possession, or under my control. I wired the different parties next morning.\nHarvey asked if he should take the goods away and Logan assured him that they were all right. He clearly assented to what Logan had done, and it is equally clear that the goods were held by Dougald Logan for Harvey whereby the contract was to all intents and purposes, rescinded.\nUnder these circumstances, inasmuch as the defendants in this case claim under a bill of sale executed on the 12th of August, I think that at that time there was no property in these goods in John Logan which he could transfer under the bill of sale.\nThe plaintiff has made out his title to the goods and I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and HENRY JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It appears to be undisputed that the moment the consignee had notice of the arrival of the goods, which it is to be observed he had not ordered, he intending that the goods should get back to the plaintiff repudiated their receipt and placed them in a warehouse for the plaintiff and as his property and notified him thereof by telegram, and the warehouseman received them as the property of and for the plaintiff, and the same day the plaintiff and the consignee came together when the plaintiff assented to and adopted the act of the consignee. Under these circumstances I am of opinion that the possession of the warehouseman was the possession of the plaintiff who became repossessed of the goods as his own property prior to the 12th of August, and as the defendants only claim goods which were the property of Logan the consignee of the goods in question, at the time of the execution by him to the bank of the deed of the 12th of August under which alone the defendants claim, the plaintiff is entitled to prevail.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Sedgewick, Ross & Sedgewick.\nSolicitors for respondent: Graham, Tupper, Borden & Parker.\n[1] 15 Q.

(Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1886: November 23; 1887: March 14.\nPresent: Sir W.J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCompany\u2014Winding up order\u2014Notice to creditors, &c.\u201445 V. c. 23 s. 24.\nIt is a substantial objection to a winding up order appointing a liquidator to the estate of an insolvent company under 45 Vic. ch. 23, that such order has been made without notice to the creditors, contributories, shareholders or members of the company as required by sec. 24 of said act[1], and an order so made was set aside, and the petition therefor referred back to the judge to be dealt with anew.\nPer Grwynne J. dissenting, that such an objection is purely technical and unsubstantial, and should not be allowed to form the subject of an appeal to this court.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division[3], whereby the petition of William Shoolbred was dismissed.\nIn 1881 proceedings were instituted for the purpose of winding-up under the provisions of 45 Vic. ch. 23 as amended by 47 Vic., ch. 39 (the winding-up acts) the Union Fire Insurance Company which was already insolvent, and in the hands of a receiver under ch. 160 R.S.O., and in January, 1885, a winding-up order was granted by Mr. Justice Proudfoot which contained the following among other provisions:\u2014\n\u201c1. This court doth declare that the said the Union Fire Insurance Company is an insurance company within the meaning of the said act and is insolvent under the provisions, thereof, and doth order and adjudge that the business of the said company shall be wound up by this court under the provisions of the said act and the amendments thereto.\n\u201c2. And this court further order and adjudge that William Badenach, of the City of Toronto, Esquire, accountant, the receiver heretofore appointed in the said case of Clarke v. The Union Fire Insurance Company, be and he is hereby appointed interim liquidator of the estate and effects of the said company.\n\u201c3. And this court doth further order that it be referred to the master in ordinary of the Supreme Court of Judicature to appoint a liquidator of the estate and effects of the said company, and to fix and allow the security to be given by the said liquidator and the remuneration payable to him and the said interim liquidator.\n\u201c4. And this court doth further order that it be referred to the said master to settle the list of contributories, take all necessary accounts and make all necessary enquiries and reports for the winding up of the affairs of the said company under the provisions of the said act and amending acts.\u201d\nShoolbred, a shareholder and creditor of the said company, filed a petition in the Chancery Division, praying to have the said winding up order set aside, principally on the grounds that the court must appoint the liquidator and cannot delegate the authority of appointment to the master, and that a notice of the petition for such order was not given to the creditors, contributories and shareholders of the company as required by 45 Vic. ch. 23, sec. 24.\nThe petition was heard before Mr. Justice Proudfoot who ordered it to be dismissed, and on appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of Proudfoot J. was affirmed, the court being equally divided. The petitioner then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, having applied to Mr. Justice Strong in chambers for leave to appeal, which was granted.\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Walker for the appellant, cited Thring on Joint Stock Companies[4]; In re Agriculturist Cattle Ins. Co.[5]\nBain Q.C. for the respondents referred to In re General Financial Bank[6]; Buckley on Joint Stock Companies[7].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I cannot see my way clear to ignore what appears to me to be the plain meaning of section 24 of this statute which declares that:\nThe court in making the winding up order must appoint a liquidator, or more than one liquidator, of the estate and effects of the company, but no such liquidator shall be appointed unless previous notice be given to the creditors, contributories, shareholders and members in the manner and form prescribed by the court.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Osler that we should attribute to these words their natural and ordinary meaning, and that which can be given to them without doing violence to any other section of the act.\nIn agreeing generally with what Mr. Justice Osler says on this point, I must except his observations as to the purely technical and unmeritorious character of the objection. It appears to me that the want of notice contemplated by sec 24 is a very substantial matter.\nI think the winding up order must be set aside and the petition referred back to the learned judge to be dealt with as he may think right.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I agree with the judgments delivered by Burton and Osler JJ. in the Court of Appeal, though I am unable to agree that the objection is of a mere technical character; on the contrary I think it a very substantial one.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice.\nHENRY J.\u2014I have arrived at the same conclusion. I entirely agree with the learned Chief Justice and my brother Strong that the judgment of Burton and Osler JJ. ought to be the judgment of this court with the exception of that part which refers to the objection as being one of an unsubstantial and technical character. I consider that the statute has some meaning and was intended to have some effect and, without going into the reasons why the parties were to be benefitted by it, I think it is enough for us to find that the statute was to confer a benefit and, I think, we are bound to presume that it was so intended.\nUnder the circumstances I think the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler, with the exception I have mentioned, should be adopted by this court.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal. The objections assigned by the appellant against the order of the 27th of January, 1885, are far from being technical and unmeritorious. If the respondent\u2019s contentions were maintained proceedings of the most important nature might be taken without notice to the shareholders or creditors of a company, who would thus be deprived of the most important safeguards that the legislature has enacted for their protection.\nThe order complained of cannot be supported either under the act of 1882 or that of 1884. It could not be made without appointing a liquidator, and as no liquidator could be appointed without notice to the creditors, contributories, shareholders, and members of the company, the order itself could not be made without such notice.\nI am of opinion that the prayer of the petition of Shoolbred should be granted and that the order in question should be vacated and discharged. The appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts against the respondents, including those in the court of appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The main ground of appeal taken by the appellant is one relating to procedure only, and is so purely technical that I doubt the propriety of an appeal in respect of it being entertained at all. The point is one which raises merely the question\u2014What is the proper time for serving notice upon the creditors, contributories and shareholders of an insolvent trading company of an application for the appointment of a liquidator of the company in liquidation under the Dom. Stat. 45 Vic. ch. 23, as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 39? And what is the proper manner of making the appointment? Must the notice for the appointment of a liquidator be given before the company is put into liquidation and must the appointment be made in the order for winding up the company? or may the notice be given upon the order which puts the company into liquidation being made,\u2019 and may the liquidator be appointed by a separate order according to the ordinary procedure of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in Ontario in a similar case as in the appointment of a receiver, &c.? The appeal if it should be allowed will decide nothing but a point of practice and the costs of the appeal, for immediately upon the appeal being allowed notice may be given and the appointment may be made in the manner this court should direct, and the same end will be attained as that which has already been attained, in the manner adopted by the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, in Ontario. The entertaining an appeal in a question of this nature seems to me to tend rather to the obstruction, than to the advancement, of justice; and there is, in my opinion, no foundation for the contention that the point appealed comes within the provisions of the 78th section of the act of 1882, which prescribes the only cases in which an appeal is by the statute allowed. However if the point were appealable and had to be entertained I concur in the construction put upon the 24th section of 45 Vic. ch. 23, as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 39, by Mr. Justice Proudfoot in the Divisional Court, and by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal. But apart wholly from that section the winding up order is, in my opinion, a perfectly good order within the 2nd and 3rd sections of 47 Vic. ch. 30, which sections and not the 13th, 14th and 24th sections of the act of 1882, as amended by the act of 1884 are the only sections applicable to the present case. The 13th, 14th and 24th sections apply to the case of an insolvent company about to be put into liquidation originally, under the act of 1882, while the 2nd and 3rd sections of the act of 1884 apply to the case of a company already in liquidation or in process of being wound up at the time of the passing of the act of 1882, which the company here was, being brought within and under the provisions of that act.\nNow upon this point the act of 1884 enacts that when, at the date of the passing of the said act of 1882, a company was in liquidation or in process of being wound up any shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company might apply by petition to the court, asking that the company be brought within and under the provisions of the said act, and the court may make such order, and that in making such order the court may direct that the assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company, if one has been appointed, shall become the liquidator of the company under the said act, or may appoint some other person to be liquidator of the company. This was the proceeding taken in the present case. Two creditors of the company presented a petition to the court, setting forth an action brought, and pending in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice at the suit of one Clarke a creditor on behalf of himself and all other creditors of the Union Fire Insurance Company plaintiffs, against the Union Fire Insurance Company defendants, and that a judgment was rendered in the said suit on the 7th January, 1882, ordering the winding up of the affairs of the said company, and that one William Badenach had been appointed receiver of the estate and affairs of the said company under the said judgment. Upon that petition the order now under consideration was made whereby among other things the court did:\u2014\nOrder and adjudge that William Badenach of the city of Toronto, Esquire, accountant, the receiver heretofore appointed in the said case of Clarke v. The Union Fire Insurance Company be and he is hereby appointed interim liquidator of the estate and effects of the said company.\nAnd the court did further:\nOrder that it be referred to the Master in Ordinary of the Supreme Court of Judicature to appoint a liquidator of the estate and effects of the said company, and to fix and allow the security to be given by the said liquidator and the remuneration payable to him and to the said interim liquidator.\nAnd the court did further:\nOrder that the accounts and enquiries heretofore made under the judgments and references to the said Master in the said suit of Clarke v. The Union Fire Insurance Company including the proceedings to ascertain who are the shareholders in the said company, and the evidence taken in connection with the said proceedings do stand and be incorporated with and used in the said winding up proceedings under this order in so far as the same can properly be made appliable by the said Master in the proceedings before him in the mat- ters of the winding up of the affairs of said company, and that the parties who have contested their liability to be settled on the list of stockholders by the said Master shall be at liberty to apply to the court after the settlement of the list of contributories in this matter for payment of such costs in the said suit of Clarke v. Union Fire Insurance Company as they may deem themselves entitled to.\nNow this order not having been made under the 13th and 14th sections of the act of 1882 but under the 2nd and 3rd sections of the act of 1884 all question, in so far as the order is concerned, as to the proper time for giving the notice referred to in the 24th section of the act of 1882, as amended by the act of 1884, is removed from the case and the objection to the order assumes a new shape. It is admitted that the order as made would be good under the 2nd and 3rd sections of the act of 1884 if the word \u201cinterim\u201d had not been inserted in it, and it is contended that the insertion of this word in the order avoids it, that is to say, that if the order had made Badenach \u201cliquidator\u201d instead of \u201cinterim liquidator\u201d it would have been free from objection. This objection appears to me to be even more purely technical than the other, and to be utterly insufficient to warrant us to pronounce the order void. An interim liquidator is a liquidator and he must continue as such until removed or another should be appointed in his place in due course of law. The clause of the order, therefore, which appoints the person already filling the office of receiver in Clarke v Union Fire Insurance Company to be \u201cinterim\u201d liquidator under the order is equivalent to making him liquidator until he should be removed or until another should be appointed in his place in due course of law.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention, moreover, is that the reference to the master to appoint a liquidator is a proceeding not authorized by the statute and is therefore void; well if it be, nothing effectual can be done under it and therefore Badenach cannot be removed, from his office as liquidator by anything to be done under it, and if the reference to the master to appoint a liquidator be authorized by the statute, Badenach may be the person so appointed, or if not the person so appointed will still be legally appointed, so that in the interim Badenach is to all intents liquidator, clothed with all the powers attached to such office until he shall be removed in due course of law; and as he can be removed only by a proceeding taken in due course of law there is no one who can have cause of complaint and his appointment as made in the order is warranted by the statute.

They offered for sale at auction a lot described as sixty acres (more or less) section 78, Loch End Farm, Victoria District, and giving the boundaries on three sides. The lot was unsurveyed and was offered for sale by the acre, an upset price of $35 being fixed. By the conditions of sale a survey was to be made after the sale at the joint expense of vendors and purchaser.\nS. purchased the lot for $36 per acre and on being surveyed it was found to contain 117 acres. The executors refused to convey that quantity alleging that only some $2,000\u2014was required to pay the debts of the estate, and refused to execute a deed of the 117 acres tendered by S. In a suit by S. for specific performance of the contract for sale of the whole lot :\u2014\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below and restoring that of the judge on the hearing, Gwynne J. dissenting, that S. was entitled to a conveyance of the 117 acres, and that the executors would not be guilty of a breach of trust in conveying that quantity.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing the judgment of the Chief Justice at the hearing[1] in favor of the plaintiff and decreeing the specific performance of a contract for sale of land.\nThe defendants were executors of the will of one Robert Anderson, of Victoria District, Vancouver Island, and by the terms of the will were to hold the real and personal estate of the testator in trust for the use of his wife during her life and after her death to sell the same and out of the proceeds pay the debts of the estate and certain specified legacies and divide the residue among the testator's children. The following codicil was annexed to the will :\u2014\n\"I hereby authorize and empower Alexander McLean and James Stewart the trustees and executors of my said will, to sell and dispose of by public auction or private sale and convey such portion of my real estate as they in their discretion shall think necessary for the purpose of raising money to pay off the existing mortgage upon my said real estate and such of my just debts as my personal estate may be insufficient to discharge. In all other respects I confirm my said will.\"\nUnder the authority given to them by this codicil the executors proceeded to sell a portion of the testator's real estate and caused the same to be advertised for sale, as follows :\u2014\n\"ADVERTISEMENT OF SALE.\n\"AUCTION SALE\u2014REAL ESTATE.\n\"I have received instructions from Alexander McLean and James Stewart, Esquires, the executors of the late Mr. Robert Anderson, to sell at the salesroom, Yates street, on Friday, the 30th inst., at I2 o'clock, noon, some sixty acres, (more or less), Section 78, Loch End Farm, Victoria District.\n\"The property to be sold adjoins Mr. Matthias Rowland's land, and has a frontage on the Burnside Road and also on the road commonly known as ' Carey's Road.'\n\"Deeds at purchaser's expense.\n\"Terms, cash.\n\"W. R. CLARKE,\n\"Auctioneer.\nThe sale was made subject to certain conditions, among which were the following :\u2014\n\" 6. The property is believed and shall be taken to be correctly described as to quantity and otherwise, and is sold subject to any easements which may be subsisting thereon, and if any error be discovered the same shall not annul the same, nor shall any compensation be allowed by the vendors or purchaser in respect thereof.\n\"8. The vendors will bear half the expense of surveying the property sold.\"\nA plan was produced at the sale showing the land intended to be sold colored pink, and giving the boundaries as described in the advertisement.\nThe land was offered for sale by the acre, an upset price of $35 per acre being fixed, and the plaintiff Sea being the highest bidder it was knocked down to him at $36 per acre. A survey was subsequently made according to the plan and the lot was found to contain 117 acres. The plaintiff caused a conveyance to be prepared of that quantity and tendered it, together with the purchase money, to the executors who refused to execute the conveyance, alleging that they only required some $2,000 to carry out the directions in the codicil to the will, and that they only intended to sell about sixty acres to realize that amount. Sea then brought a suit for specific performance of the contract, and on the hearing before the Chief Justice specific performance was decreed. The Supreme Court of British Columbia reversed the judgment of the Chief Justice on the ground that it would be a breach of trust in the executors to sell more than they required to carry out the instructions of the testator as contained in the codicil to his will. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. and Eberts for the appellant cited the following cases:\u2014 Whitfield v. Langdale[2]; Newman v. Johnson[3]; Barker v. Barker[4]; Thomas v. Town\u2014send[5].\nNo counsel appeared for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014On the appeal the contract of sale seems to have been admitted to have been for the whole lot, and the only ground on which the full court reversed the decision of the Chief Justice was that the sale of the whole lot was a breach of trust on the part of the trustees and that such being the case the court would not decree specific performance.\nNo doubt, generally speaking, a Court of Equity will not enforce, on behalf of a purchaser, a contract by trustees which amounts to a breach of trust, and of which the beneficiaries have a right to complain as a breach of trust. But in this case no question as to a breach of trust was raised by the pleadings or at the trial and, had any such question been raised, I can discover no evidence whatever to sustain any such contention.\nBy his will the testator appointed McLean and Stewart as follows :\u2014\nI appoint Alexander McLean, of the City of Victoria, British Columbia merchant, and James Stewart, of the same place, merchant's clerk, hereinafter called my trustees to be the executors and trustees of this my will.\nI give devise and bequeath unto my trustees all my real and personal estate upon the following trusts, namely, after my decease to permit and allow my wife Jessie Anderson, to hold, manage and enjoy the same during the term of her natural life, and at her death to sell and dispose of the same and convert into money and out of the proceeds of such sale and conversion of my said real and personal estate, pay my debts, and the following legacies that is to say :\nAnd by a codicil he authorized McLean and Stewart as follows\u2014\nI, Robert Anderson, of Lake District, Vancouver Island, farmer, declare this to be a first codicil to my last will dated the 24th day of April, A. D., 1883.\nI hereby authorize and empower Alexander McLean and James Stewart the trustees and executors of my said will, to sell and dispose of by public auction or private sale and convey such portion of my real estate as they in their discretion shall think necessary for the purpose of raising money to pay off the existing mortgage upon my said real estate and such of my just debts as my personal estate may be insufficient to discharge. In all other respects I confirm my said will.\nIn witness whereof I have to this my first codicil to my said will set my hand this 5th day of June, A. D., 1883.\nIn Lord Rendlesham v. Meux [6]in which the words of the will were\nAnd in case it should be considered necessary by the trustees or trustee for the time being of this my will to sell any part of my estate for the purpose of raising money to discharge any of the incumbrances thereon,\u2014\nAnd it was contended that the trustees had sold the whole of the estate and that the purchase money greatly exceeded the amount of the incumbrances, the Vice-Chancellor said :\nThe general language of the testator has made it plain that the power of sale depends upon the opinion of the trustees that a sale is necessary.\nIn this case, then, I think the sale was, as found by the Chief Justice and the jury, of the whole lot between the two roads ; that in making such sale there was no breach of trust ; that the power given by the codicil was well exercised by the sale of the lot in question ; that the agreement as found is sufficiently free from uncertainty and ambiguity to be enforced ; and I think that all reasonable diligence was used to obtain the best price and prevent the property being sacrificed by fixing what would seem to have been a fair upset price, and I do not think the price obtained can reasonably be considered inadequate. In fact the Chief Justice says the contract was entered into at the fair, and even the best, price of the day.\nIf this sale took place under circumstances which amounted to a breach of trust I am free to admit that the court should not decree a specific performance of the contract. If the block of land had been sold for a lump sum then it might fairly be said they should have ascertained the quantity to have enabled them to form an adequate idea of its value ; but as they sold by the acre, and as they fixed the upset price per acre as the fair value to be obtained, the necessity for an actual ascertainment of the quantity would appear to become the less necessary, and it may be that they may have thought it more expedient, and more in the interest of the estate, to sell the whole block rather than the exact quantity that would produce $2,000, supposing that was the amount required which, however, is by no means clearly established, for the Chief Justice says in his judgment on appeal to the full court :\nBut is it a breach of trust to complete this contract? The defendants now propose to read the will as if it said the trustees were to have no power to sell more than so much of the land as should be necessary to pay debts. But these are not the words of the will. The trustees, here, were certainly acting within the words of their power, viz., to sell \" such portion of the testator's land as they may think necessary \" to raise money to pay off debts. They found the testator's land divided into two portions. One portion would apparently not produce enough money for their purpose. They therefore thought it necessary to sell the other portion, and contracted to sell it accordingly. They now suggest that the purchase money has provided more cash than was necessary, (viz.) nearly $4,000 dollars net ; and that they only calculated a little more than $2,000 to be necessary ; that if they had known the land offered would have produced so much they would have auctioned only half the quantity, or some 60 acres. But there is no proof of all this. The debts may, for all that appears, be $4,000 or upwards. But suppose they had offered only 60 acres and the bidding had risen to $60 or $70 per acre, so that the money raised would again have been twice as much as the demands on the estate. so far as then known, rendered necessary, would the trustees in such a case be deemed to have exceeded their powers, so as that this court would not permit them to carry out the sale ?\nIn view of all which I think the judgment of the Chief Justice should not have been disturbed and should now be restored.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER JJ. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I also am in favor of allowing the appeal and concur in the views expressed by His Lordship the Chief Justice. I can see no grounds for the allegation that the trustees could not sell all the land, or that they were guilty of a breach of trust in doing so. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the 10th July, 1884, restored for the reasons given by Sir. M. W. Begbie at nisi prius and in full court.\nThat the defendants offered for sale, and that the plaintiff bought, without either of them knowing its acreage, the whole of the Loch End farm lying between Carey's road and Burnside road, at $36 per acre, seems to be clearly established, and, in fact, if I do not misunderstand them, Mr. Justice Crease and Mr. Justice Walkem do not materially differ from the Chief Justice on that part of the case. But their conclusions were adverse to the plaintiff on the ground that the defendants, in selling more than was necessary to pay the testator's debts, were guilty of a breach of trust which the courts are bound to restrain. I cannot view the case in that light. The defendants were empowered to sell all of the real estate which they, in their discretion, should think necessary. They exercised their discretion and sold this farm. There is no fraud proved nor even alleged. There is no evidence that their discretion was improperly exercised, and no breach of trust has been shown. Having exercised their discretion, their power to sell was complete and unconditional as regards bonu\u00e2 fide purchasers, whatever liabilities they might have incurred towards their cestuis que trustent if they had wrongfully acted towards them.\nThe courts cannot say that a trustee has not the discretion which the testator has given him, nor refuse to recognize contracts openly entered into at the fair and, according to the evidence in this case, the extreme price that could be had. Such are the conclusions of the Chief Justice and in them I concur.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in his statement of claim in the court below alleges that the defendants caused to be put up for sale by public auction \" a messuage \" and land situate in Victoria, District of British Col- \" umbia, being all that portion of section 78 in said \" district lying between the Burnside road on the south \" and the Carey road on the north ;\" that at such auction sale the plaintiff was the highest bidder for the same and purchased the said premises from the defendants and the defendants sold the same to the plaintiff for $36 per acre ; that it was agreed by and between plaintiff and defendants that one Peter Leech, land surveyor, should proceed to ascertain the acreage of said part of said section and that on the completion of the said survey the plaintiff was to pay the balance of purchase money on the acreage as ascertained by said Peter Leech, and that the vendors should then execute a conveyance of said premises to the purchaser at the purchaser's expense ; that the plaintiff paid the defendants a deposit of $540 as part payment of the purchase money immediately after said sale and was always ready, willing, and still is, to pay the remainder ; that Peter Leech proceeded to survey the said tract so put up for sale and ascertained that the acerage of the same was 117 35\/100 acres; that plaintiff tendered to the defendants for execution a deed for the conveyance by the defendants as trustees of the will of Robert Anderson, deceased, to the plaintif\u00e6 in fee in consideration of the sum of $4224.60, all and singular that certain parcel or tract of land situate, lying and being in Victoria district aforesaid, which may be more particularly described as all that portion of section seventy-eight, lying between the Burnside road on the south, and the Carey road on the north, containing in the whole one hundred and seventeen acres and thirty-five hundreths of an acre, and that the defendants refused to execute such conveyance and the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants as such trustees as aforesaid might be decreed specifically to perform said agreement and for other relief.\nThe defendants in their answer, in so far as it is material to set it out, deny that they caused to be put up for sale by public auction the portion of the section 78 specified in the first paragraph of the plaintiff's statement of claim, but they say that they did as trustees under the will and codicil of Robert Anderson deceased, cause to be put up for sale by auction a portion of the said section containing 60 acres more or less, adjoining the land of Matthias Rowland, and lying between the Burnside road and Carey's road ; that the land put up for sale had not been surveyed, and was not marked out on any plan, but that a sketch plan of the whole of the said section lying to the north of the Burnside road was exhibited at the sale ; that the conditions of sale did not stipulate that the highest bidder per acre should be the purchaser, but the auctioneer stated that the bidding would be per acre, and did not stipulate that the expense of the title deeds should be borne by the purchaser ; that it was never agreed between plaintiff and defendants that on completion of any survey of the land purchased the plaintiff was to pay the balance of the purchase money on the acreage as ascertained by Peter Leech or any one else ; that it was verbally agreed between the plaintiff and the defendant McLean that Peter Leech should survey the property purchased by the plaintiff which the defendants contended was 60 acres more or less of the said piece of said section seventy-eight.\nThe plaintiff in support of the case as made by him in his statement of claim produced in evidence :\n1. The advertisement of the sale which is as follows :\u2014\nAUCTION SALE\u2014REAL ESTATE.\nI have received instructions from Alexander McLean and James Stewart, Esquires, the Executors of the late Mr. Robert Anderson, to sell, at the sales-room, Yates Street, on Friday the 30th instant, at Twelve o'clock, noon, some Sixty acres, (more or less) Section 78, Loch End Farm, Victoria District.\nThe property to be sold adjoins Mr. Matthias Rowland's land and has a frontage on the Burnside Road and also on the road commonly known as Carey's Road.\nDeeds at purchaser's expense.\nTerms\u2014Cash.\nWM. R. CLARKE,\nAuctioneer, &c.\n2. The conditions of sale which contained among others the following :\n\"a. No person shall, at any bidding advance a less sum than shall be named by the auctioneer, and no bidding shall be retracted. The highest bidder shall be the purchaser and if any dispute arise respecting a bidding the lot shall be put up again and re-sold.\n\"b. Every purchaser shall immediately after the sale of a lot sign the underwritten agreement, and pay into the hands of the auctioneers a deposit of 25 per cent of his purchase money, and shall at the expiration of fourteen days pay to Mr. Hett, the vendor's solicitor, the balance of his purchase money.\n\" c. The property is believed and shall be taken to be correctly described as to quantity and otherwise, and is sold subject to any easements which may be subsisting thereon, and if any error be discovered the same shall not annul the sale nor shall any compensation be allowed by the vendors or purchaser in respect thereof.\n\"d. The vendors will bear half the expense of surveying the property sold.\"\nAt the foot of the conditions of sale is the contract of sale, of which the plaintiff is claiming specific performance, as follows:\u2014\nI, Samuel Sea, hereby acknowledge that on the sale by auction, this 30th day of November, 1883, of Sixty acres, (more or less,) part of Section 78, Victoria District, I was the highest bidder and was declared the purchaser thereof, subject to the conditions, at the price of thirty six dollars per acre, and that I have paid the sum of five hundred and forty dollars by way of deposit and in part payment of the said purchase money, to the auctioneers, and hereby agree to pay the remainder of the said purchase money and complete the said purchase according to the said conditions.\n(Signed) SAMUEL SEA.\nAs agent for the vendors I ratify this sale and acknowledge the receipt of the said deposit.\n(Signed) W. R. CLARKE,\nAuctioneer.\nThe vendors as trustees under the will of Robert Anderson had power to sell only for the purpose of paying debts if the personalty should be insufficient for that purpose, and their object in selling was merely to raise the sum of $2000, the total sum which would be required for the above purpose. The notice of the intended sale contained in the advertisement that the auctioneer had received instructions from the trustees to offer for sale \" some 60 acres (more or less,\") section \" 78 Loch End Farm, Victoria District,\" may be fairly construed as conveying an intention of offering for sale about 60 acres, it might be more or it might be less, according as the trustees should find to be necessary to raise the required sum ; the words \" more or less \" as there used are quite appropriate having regard to the position in which the trustees stood, for by the time the sale should take place they might find that the price the land would be likely to fetch per acre would enable them to realise the required sum of $2000 by the sale of only forty or it might be of thirty acres, in which case, quite in accordance with the statement in the advertisement, they might offer for sale and sell forty or thirty acres as the case may be ; but having resolved upon not taking less than $35 per acre the sale of sixty acres would be sufficient for their purpose ; and their duty to their cestuis qui trustent under the will required that they should sell no more than was necessary for that purpose. The notice in the advertisement of what would be offered for sale did not say that the whole of that part of section 78 lying between Burnside road and Carey's road would be offered for sale, but that some sixty acres, it might be more or might be less of section 78, adjoining Rowlands, and having a frontage on Burnside's road and Carey's road would be offered for sale.\nNow as to what took place at the auction. The auctioneer says he sold according to advertisement. He thought, but very mistakenly as now appears, that there might be about sixty or sixty-five acres in the whole piece lying between the two roads, but being asked whether what he offered for sale was not the whole of that piece he answered : \" Sixty acres of it ;\" that the intention was to sell the rough, uncultivated part. The defendant McLean's evidence is that he intended to sell sixty acres going from Rowland's fence west and abutting on each road. Rowland who was present at the auction says that what he understood to have been offered for sale was sixty acres next to his fence. The plaintiff having bid $36 per acre for what he was buying signed the above contract of sale at the foot of the conditions and paid $540 as the 25 per cent. on his purchase required by the conditions to be paid at the time of sale. Now, the plaintiff's contention is, that this contract, so signed by him and the auctioneer, is a contract for the sale to, and purchase by, the plaintiff of the whole of that part of section 78 which lies between the two above named roads whatever its contents in acres might be and that there being found to be 117 85\/100 acres in the piece he is entitled in virtue of the above contract so signed to demand and have a conveyance of the said 117 85\/100 acres executed to him he paying $36 per acre for every acre in excess of 60 acres. If the plaintiff is right in this contention then not only would he be entitled to compel the defendants to execute to him a conveyance of 500 acres or any greater quantity if such should be found to be the quantity of section 78, between the two roads, but he could also, at the suit of the defendants, be compelled to accept a conveyance of such 500 acres or any greater quantity, and to pay therefor at the rate of $36 per acre, although he should deny that he had ever bid for, or intended to purchase any greater quantity than sixty acres, and in support of such contention should refer to this contract and the mention of sixty acres therein and should insist upon his having, in accordance with the conditions of sale, paid $540 as and for the sum of 25 per cent upon his whole purchase money of $2160 for such 60 acres That the defendants could not under the terms of the contract as signed by the plaintiff compel him to take the whole 117 85\/100 acres is to my mind too clear to admit of a doubt.\nNow as to the intention of the trustees we can not I think attribute to them, contrary to the sworn evidence of the only one of them who was examined, and contrary to their duty, an intention of selling the whole of the section between the two roads whatever the contents might prove to be when the sale of sixty acres would be sufficient to supply the purpose for which alone they had power to sell. If they had intended to sell the whole of the piece they surely would have had, as they should have had, the piece surveyed before being offered for sale for, according to the conditions of sale, the deposit of 25 per cent of the whole purchase money to be paid at the time of the sale would vary in proportion to the quantity of land sold, and they could not have in their contract of sale acknowledged, as they had done, the receipt of $540 as such deposit and part payment of the said purchase money, that is to say, the purchase money for sixty acres at $36 per acre. That, in truth, the trustees did not intend to sell the whole of the section lying between the two roads I am, for my part, satisfied and that, under the circumstances of the sale of sixty acres producing sufficient for the purpose for which alone they had a power of sale they should not have sold the whole cannot admit of a doubt ; this therefore is not, in my opinion, a case in which we should compel specific performance although the contract should in express terms be for the sale of the whole of such piece, as it would be unjust to enforce against trustees to the great prejudice it may be of the interests of their cestuis que trustent a contract different from what the trustees intended to enter into, and which was therefore improvidently entered into by them. But it is, to my mind quite clear that the contract which the plaintiff has produced and relies upon is not a contract to sell the whole of that part of section 78, lying between the two roads, whatever the quantity might upon survey prove to be, namely, whether 500 acres or 117 acres, or any other quantity, as the plaintiff now contends, but that if it be not avoided for uncertainty by the senseless and inappropriate introduction of the words (\" more or less \") after the stated quantity of 60 acres, it is in its terms simply a contract to sell sixty acres of part of section 78, lying between the two roads at $36 per acre, upon which contract in accordance with the terms of the conditions of sale the purchaser has paid and the vendors have received the sum of $540 as and for the 25 per cent upon the whole purchase money made payable by the conditions at the time of the sale. There is not a word in the contract about a survey being necessary in order to determine what was the quantity of land sold and what should be the amount of the purchase money the plaintiff should have to pay, and there is no principle upon which any such variation in quantity of land and in the amount of purchase money can be imported into the contract. The plaintiff has not in the contract as signed by him undertaken to pay to the defendant one cent more than the amount of purchase money calculated upon sixty acres at $35 per acre, and of which sum the amount of $540 paid at the time of sale constitutes 25 per cent or one fourth part ; in other words the total amount he has contracted to pay, and which the trustees could ever compel him to pay under this contract, is the unpaid balance of the sum of $2,160.\nIt must be admitted that there has been great carelessness in the preparation of this contract, for in the conditions of sale, at the foot of which is the contract and which conditions are referred to in and made part of the contract, is one which declares that the property offered for sale is believed to be and shall be taken to be correctly described as to quantity, and that if any error should be discovered the same should not annul the sale nor should any compensation be allowed either by vendor or purchaser in respect thereof, that is to say whether the contents should prove to be greater or less than the quantity stated. Now there is no description of the property offered for sale other than \" Sixty acres (more or less) part of Section 78, Victoria District.\" So that if the plaintiff's contention be correct that what was offered for sale was \" the whole of that portion of section 78, lying \" between Burnside Road and Carey's road \" if the above condition is to apply, we must, to complete the description as to quantity, add here the words \" containing 60 acres (more or less).\" So that the result would be that under this condition the plaintiff would be entitled to a conveyance of the 117 85\/100 acres for $2,160, or the sum ascertained to be the price of sixty acres at $36 per acre, a contention which the plaintiff has not been bold enough to make ; the whole difficulty in the case arises from what I call the senseless introduction of the words \" more or less \" in the contract after the words \" 60 acres.\"\nThe plaintiff in the signed contract acknowledges that on a sale by auction of 60 acres, more or less, part of section 78, he was the highest bidder, and was declared the purchaser thereof subject to the conditions, which are part of the contract, at the price of $36 per acre. Now in this sentence to what does the word \" thereof \" apply\u2014of what does the plaintiff acknowledge himself to be the purchaser ? Is it of the sixty acres which is expressed or is it of some greater or less quantity ? and if greater of what quantity ? The contract certainly does not say that the plaintiff had purchased the whole of that portion of section 78, lying between the two roads, whatever might be the quantity at $36 per acre, and that he had paid $540 on account, and would pay the remainder as soon as the amount should be ascertained upon measurement of the contents of the piece of land sold ; and how we are to say that this was the plaintiff's contract, as he now contends, from what is said in the formal signed instrument I fail to see. There he says that the $540 paid was paid by way of deposit and according to the conditions of sale forming part of the contract, which shews that this sum was paid and accepted as 25 per cent on the whole of the purchase money called for by the contract, or the precise price of 60 acres at $36 per acre, and he undertook to pay the balance of his said purchase money, that is an ascertained sum, not a sum yet to be ascertained, and as yet quite undeterminate, at the expiration of 14 days. It might perhaps be contended that these words \" more or less \" so introduced into the contract make it so vague and uncertain that it cannot be enforced at all, although when the conditions of sale are referred to, which are part of the contract and require the purchaser at the time of sale to pay a deposit of 25 per cent. of his whole purchase money, I cannot say that I think they are. In my opinion the plaintiff under this contract has no claim whatever for any greater quantity than sixty acres measured west from Rowland's fence, and extending from Burnside Road to Carey's Road. If he is unwilling to accept a deed for that quantity the most favorable judgment that he could have would be for the return of his deposit with interest but without costs, and in my opinion the case should be remitted to the court below to enable the plaintiff to elect whether he will accept a conveyance of sixty acres as above named or that the contract be annulled and his deposit restored to him. In the former event the decree should be for a conveyance to him of such sixty acres upon payment of the balance of the purchase money with interest, but in that case the plaintiff should pay the costs of the court below, for the litigation has been caused by his demand for more than he was entitled to under his contract, and in case he elect to annul the contract and to have his deposit returned by reason of uncertainty in the contract as to the land actually sold, neither party should have costs in the court below. But the plaintiff's appeal to this court should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : D. M. Eberts.\nSolicitor for respondents : J. Roland Hett.\n[1] 2 B. C.

Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[3] sustaining the order of the Chief Justice for winding up the affairs of the Bank of Liverpool and appointing the Bank of Nova Scotia liquidator.\nThe Bank of Liverpool had been placed in insolvency under the provisions of \"The Insolvent Act of 1875 \"and amending acts\" and the Bank of Nova Scotia was the assignee. In 1884 the Bank of Nova Scotia filed a petition under the winding up act of 1882, praying that the said Bank of Liverpool be wound up thereunder. After hearing arguments for and against the petition the Chief Justice made the following order under sections 2 and 3 of 45 Vic. ch. 23, the winding up act of 1882, as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 39, he having decided that said sections governed the proceedings in this case.\n\"It is ordered that the prayer of the said petition be granted and that the said Bank of Liverpool and the estate thereof be brought within and under the provisions of the said act, intituled, 'An act respecting 'insolvent banks, insurance companies, loan companies, 'building societies, and trading corporations,' passed by the Parliament of Canada, being forty-fifth Vic. ch. 23, and of the said act, passed by said Parliament of Canada, being 47 Vic. ch. 39, intituled, 'An 'act further to amend the act 45 Vic. ch. 23, entitled 'An act. respecting insolvent banks, insurance companies, 'loan companies, building societies and 'trading corporations,' and that the liquidation and winding up of the said Bank of Liverpool be carried on and completed under the said last named acts, and that the said Bank of Liverpool and the estate thereon be wound up by this court under the provisions of the said last named acts.\n\"It is further ordered that the said bank of Nova Scotia be, and it is hereby appointed, the liquidator of the said Bank of Liverpool under the provisions of the said last named acts.\n\"It is further ordered that the said Bank of Nova Scotia shall give security under the provisions of said act 45 Vic. ch. 23, and amending act, and under sec. 28 thereof by bond in a penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars to the satisfaction of and to be approved by a judge of this Honourable Court conditioned for the due and faithful performance of the duties of the said Bank of Nova Scotia as such liquidator.\n\"It is further ordered that the said petitioner's costs of and relating to the said petition and application be allowed and paid out of the assets of the said Bank of Liverpool such costs to be taxed, and that the costs of the contestants abide the order of the appellate court to be made in the premises.\n\"Dated at Halifax this 16th day of January, A. D., 1885.\" Application was made to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to have the order of the Chief Justice set aside, chiefly on the ground that the proceedings prescribed by sections 99 to 102 inclusive of the act of 1882 as amended by the act of 1884 should have been followed and the bank wound up as if the previous proceedings under the Insolvent Act had not taken place. The court divided equally on the application and the order was sustained. The dissatisfied shareholders then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHenry Q.C. for the appellants.\nSedgewick Q.C. for the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the decision of the Chief Justice, ordering the Bank of Liverpool to be brought within the provisions of 45 Vic. cap. 23., \"An Act respecting Insolvent Banks, Insurance Companies, Loan Companies, Building Societies and Trading Corporations.\"\nSection 147 of 38 Vic. cap. 16, (the Insolvent Act of 1875), and 39 Vic. cap. 31, contain the provisions for putting insolvent companies into insolvency.\nUnder these statutes the Bank of Liverpool was placed in insolvency in 1879.\n17th October, 1879, the attachment under the Insolvent Act of 1875 was issued against the Bank of Liverpool. The official assignee took possession of the estate. At the first meeting of creditors the Bank of Nova Scotia was appointed assignee.\n13th September, 1884, the Bank of Nova Scotia, assignee, filed a petition praying that the Bank of Liverpool and its estate should be brought under the provisions of 45 Vic. c. 23., and 47 Vic. ch. 39., and that liquidation and winding up be carried on under said acts, and that the Bank of Nova Scotia might be appointed liquidator.\n13th September, 1884, the Chief Justice made an order directing a hearing on the 28th October, 1884, and in the meantime that notice should be given to creditors by publication in the Canada Gazette and other papers for thirty days, such publication to be sufficient notice.\nNotice was duly published and petition heard when counsel for the shareholders and contributories appeared. The Chief Justice allowed the prayer of the petition and granted an order as follows[4]:\u2014\n45 Vic. ch. 23, provides for the winding up of incorporated banks and other companies. The principal sections bearing on the questions involved in the present appeal are as follows:\n1. This act applies to incorporated banks (including savings banks), incorporated insurance companies, loan companies having borrowing powers, building societies, having a capital stock which are insolvent or in process of being wound up, either under a general or special act, and which, on petition as in this act set forth, by its shareholders or creditors, assignees or liquidators, ask to be brought within and under the provisions of this act.\n(a) This act does not apply to railway or telegraph companies or to building societies that have not a capital stock.\n2. The provisions of sections thirteen to ninety eight inclusive of this act are, in the case of a bank, (not including a saving's bank) subject to the provisions, changes and modifications contained in sections ninety nine to one hundred and five inclusive.\n6. \"Company\" includes any corporation subject to the provisions of this act.\nCh. 39 of 47 Vic. amends the act 45 Vic. ch. 23, as follows:\u2014\nI. The first section of the act passed in the forty-fifth year of Her Majesty's reign, chaptered twenty three, and entitled, \"an act respecting insolvent banks, insurance companies, loan companies, building societies and trading corporations is hereby repealed, and the following section is enacted in lieu thereof:\nI. This act applies to incorporated banks (including savings banks) incorporated insurance companies, loan companies having borrowing powers, building societies having a capital stock, and incorporated trading companies, which are doing business in Canada, no matter where incorporated, and which are insolvent or in process of being wound up and on petition as in this act set forth by their shareholders or creditors, assignees or liquidators ask to be brought within and under the provisions of this act.\n(a) this act does not apply to railway companies or to building societies that have not a capital stock.\n2. When at the date of the passing of the said act, a company was in liquidation or in process of being wound up, any shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company, may apply by petition to the court, asking that the company be brought within and under the provisions of the said act, and the court may make such order, and the winding up of such company shall thereafter be carried on under the said act, and the expression \"winding up order,\" in the said act, shall include the order in this section mentioned.\n3. The court in making such an order, may direct that the assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company, if one has been appointed, shall become the liquidator of the company under the said act, or may appoint some other person to be liquidator of the company.\n4. The 24th section of the said act is amended by inserting before the words \"the winding up order\" in the first line, the words, \"the court in making.\"\n7. Sections 99, 100, 101 and 102 of the said act are hereby repealed, and the following sections are enacted in lieu thereof:\u2014\n99. In the case of a bank the application for a winding up order must be made by a creditor for the sum of not less than $1,000 and the court must before making the order, direct a meeting of the shareholders of the bank, and a meeting of the creditors of the bank to be summoned, held and conducted as the court directs, for the purpose of ascertaining their respective wishes as to the appointment of liquidators.\n100. The court may appoint a person to act as chairman of the meeting of shareholders, and in default of such appointment the president of the bank, or other person who usually presides at a meeting of the shareholders, shall preside. The court may also appoint a person to act as chairman of the meeting of creditors, and in default of such appointment the creditors shall appoint a chairman.\n101. In taking a vote at such a meeting of shareholders, regard is to be had to the number of votes conferred by law or by the regulations of the bank of each shareholder present or represented at such meeting; and in the case of creditors, regard is to be had to the amount of the debt due to each creditor. 102. The chairman of each meeting must report the result thereof to the court, and if a winding up order is made the court shall ap point three liquidators, to be selected in its discretion, after such hearing of the parties as it may deem expedient from among the persons nominated by the majorities and minorities of the shareholders and creditors at such meetings respectively.\nI cannot conceive that sec. 3 of the amending act was intended to apply to banks with reference to which the sections 99, 100, 101 and 102 of the original act and the sections of the amending act in lieu thereof have made very special provisions. I think the amending act must be read as if it formed part of the original act, and such a reasonable construction put on it as will give effect to all its provisions. In other words I am at a loss to conceive how section three can be construed to exclude this case from the provisions of sections 99 to 102 when the legislature by express words have declared in the case of a bank they shall apply; certainly it should not be so read as to give to section three the effect of repealing all those special provisions in reference to banks enacted in the same act. To whatever companies section three may apply, it appears to me beyond all reasonable doubt that it does not apply to banks. So far from there being any indication of an intent on the part of the legislature to dispense with all or any of the preliminaries of the original act the legislature seems to me, emphatically, in unmistakable language, by the sections enacted in lieu of sections 99, 100, 101 and 102, to have re-affirmed the necessity of such preliminaries being observed.\nAs. regards the complaint as to the discretion exercised by the learned Chief Justice: Had such discretion, as applicable to this case been conferred on him by the statute 47 Vic. ch. 39 sec. 2, (a judicial discretion it is true over which this court no doubt has complete jurisdiction but a discretion the exercise of which is not lightly to be interfered with) if no case of miscarriage had been shown, and if the learned Chief Justice had not been shown to have gone wrong in his law, no mistake of fact being shown nor that he ordered anything so utterly unreasonable that the court would be obliged to say that there had not been a reasonable exercise of his discretion, I should not have thought it the duty of this court to interfere.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment in this case should be affirmed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia in his judgment in the court below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing the appeal. It is very clear that the 103rd section of the act was not complied with. It requires that three liquidators should be appointed and here there was only one.\nHENRY J.\u2014The respondent bank became in 1879 the assignee in insolvency of the Bank of Liverpool, and on the 12th of September, 1884, made application by petition to a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for an order to bring the insolvent estate within and under the provisions of the acts of Canada of 1882, chap. 23, and of 1884, chap. 39, and asking to be appointed liquidator of the estate.\nThe matter came before His Lordship the Chief Justice of that court who, after hearing the parties, made an order granting the prayer of the respondent's petition.\nThe appellants appealed to the whole court. At the hearing the court was composed of four members, one joining the Chief Justice in sustaining his order and the others deciding against the validity of the order. One of the latter, however, subsequently changed his judgment formally so tha an appeal to this court might be had.\nPreviously to the act of 1882, chap. 23, incorporated banks could not be brought into liquidation.\nBy the first section of that act it was provided, amongst other things, that incorporated banks which were insolvent or in process of being wound up might be brought within its provisions.\nBy section two the provisions of sections thirteen to ninety eight inclusive of that act were, in the case of a bank, (not including a savings bank)\u2014\nMade subject to the provisions, changes and modifications contained in sections ninety nine to one hundred and five inclusive.\nSec. 24 provides that:\u2014\nThe winding up order must appoint a liquidator or more than one liquidator of the estate and effects of the company; but no such liquidator shall be appointed unless previous notice be given to the creditors, contributories, shareholders or members in the manner prescribed by the court.\nThat section clearly prohibits the passing of a winding up order unless notice be given in the manner prescribed by the court. In this case the court did not make, nor was it asked to make, any order prescribing how the notice was to be given. The only notice given was one in the newspapers as provided by sec. 105, but the provision in that section does not apply to such a notice, but only is sufficient as to the holders of bank notes in circulation. The reason why that provision was made is that it would be impossible to serve such a notice personally as the holders could not be discovered. No such reason existed in this case and therefore the petitioners were required to obtain the direction of the court. Without such notice being given the court had no power to appoint a liquidator in any case, and for that reason alone the appointment was void for the want of jurisdiction.\nBy section 7 of the act of 1884, secs. 99, 100, 101 and 102 of the act of 1882, were repealed and other provisions substituted as I shall hereafter show. The 1st sec. of the act of 1884 applies its provisions to incorporated banks, savings banks, incorporated insurance companies, loan companies having borrowing powers, building societies having a capital stock and incorporated trading companies.\nSec. 2 provides that:\nWhen at the date of the passing of this act (19th April, 1884) a company was in liquidation or in process of being wound up, any shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company may apply by petition to the court, asking that the company be brought within the provisions of the said act, and the court may make such order, &c.\n3. The court in making such order may direct that the assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company if one has been appointed, shall become the liquidator of the company under the said act or may appoint some other person to be liquidator of the said company.\nIt will be seen that neither incorporated banks nor savings banks are mentioned in the section just recited, although mentioned specifically in sec. 1, Are we to conclude that the word \"company\" in sec. 2 was intended to include and has included incorporated banks and savings banks? Incorporated banks may be called companies; but a distinction between banking and other companies is clearly shown to have been drawn in sec. 1, and if it was intended that incorporated banks should be affected by the provisions of sec. 2 it is not unreasonable to expect to find \"incorporated \"banks\" or \"an incorporated bank \"inserted in sec. 2, and when we consider how essentially banks differ from insurance companies I would feel forced to the conclusion that the provisions of sec. 2 were not intended to apply to incorporated banks.\nIf section two, for the reasons I have given or shall hereafter give, does not apply to banks then the provisions of section three are equally inapplicable, but why is it at all necessary to speculate as to section two, which as I have before said does not mention banks, when we find ample and full provision as to them in section seven taken with some modifications from the act of 1882.\nThe first one of the imported sections is in section seven of the act of 1884 and is as follows:\nIn the case of a bank the application for a winding up order must be made by a creditor for a sum not less than a thousand dollars, and the court must before making the order direct a meeting of the shareholders of the bank and a meeting of the creditors of the bank to be summoned, held and conducted as the court directs, for the purpose of ascertaining their respective wishes as to the appointment of liquidators.\nThe next in order of the imported sections provides that the court may appoint chairmen of the meetings, &c.\nThe next provides for the mode of taking the votes at the meetings and the last provides that\nThe chairman of each meeting must report the result thereof to the court, and if a winding up order is made the court shall appoint three liquidators to be selected in its discretion after such hearing of the parties as it may deem expedient from among the persons nominated by the majorities and the minorities of the shareholders and creditors at such meeting respectively.\nIt will thus be seen how carefully the rights and interests of all parties connected with banks were provided to be guarded. Between section two and the first of the imported sections there is this important difference. Under the former the application for a winding up order may be made by any shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver or liquidator of a company but under the latter (in the case of banks) the application\nMust be made by a creditor for a sum not less than one thousand dollars.\nA shareholder, creditor for less than a thousand dollars, receiver or liquidator could not apply for a winding up order under that provision.\nUnder sec. 2 there is no provision for any preliminary meeting of shareholders or creditors, but under the first of the imported sections the court has no power to appoint liquidators until meetings are held and the result of them reported to the court. Under secs. 2 and 3 one liquidator may be appointed, but under the provisions of the first and last of the imported sections liquidators must be appointed, and under the latter section the member is fixed at three.\nThe act plainly says that in the case of a company other than a banking company sec. 2 shall apply, but it as plainly says that as to a bank the four imported sections shall apply. If not, why should there be any such special provisions in the case of a bank? Did the legislature make them to become ineffectual for the objects evidently intended by them, to be over-ridden by the provisions of sections 2 and 3? The first section provides that the petition for a winding up order must be \"as in this act set forth.\" Section two provides for an application for an order to wind up an insolvent company, but when we would ascertain how such an application should be made in the case of a bank \"as in this act set forth\" we must refer to the first of the imported sections and be guided by it and the three following sections. In the case of a company one mode is provided and in the other an essentially different course is required to be taken. Section 103 of the act of 1882 provides for the appointment in the case of a bank of three liquidators.\nIf no one has been so nominated (at the preliminary meeting) the three liquidators must be chosen by the court\u2014if less than three have been nominated the requisite additional liquidator or liquidators must be chosen by the court.\nThat section was in force when the act of 1884 was passed and was left untouched and unrepealed by the latter act. If it was intended to apply the provisions of section two to the case of a bank such a counter provision would have been repealed. Sections 99, 100, 101 and 102 are re-enacted by the act of 1884 and section 103 completes the provisions for the appointment of three liquidators; and its having been left untouched by the subsequent act is conclusive evidence of the intention of the legislature to place banks, in regard to a winding up order, in a totally different position from that of companies. The petition in this case was made by the respondent bank as assignee of the insolvent bank, and although it alleges that the petitioners were creditors of the insolvent bank for an amount more than a thousand dollars a question might be raised as to the validity of the application as they did not petition as a creditor; but in the view I hold of the law it is unnecessary to refer to that objection.\nNo meeting was held by direction of the court as prescribed by the statutes and therefore, in my opinion, the court had no power to appoint liquidators and in any event, the appointment of one only was void.\nI am, for the reasons given, of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the appointment of the respondent as liquidator annulled with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In my opinion the 2nd and 3rd sections of 47 Vic. ch. 39 applies to banks as well as to all other companies mentioned in the first section, and the object of the sections, as it appears to me, is to make provision in respect of companies which already at the time of the passing of the act were in process of liquidation in insolvency, different from the provision made in the case of companies which although in a state of insolvency had not yet been brought into liquidation by process of law, or which after the passing of the act should become insolvent. In the case of companies already in process of liquidation, and having an assignee or liquidator already appointed, the proceedings directed by the act to be taken for the appointaient of an assignee or liquidator of a company about to be but not yet brought into liquidation might reasonably be dispensed with, and therefore in the case of a petition under the 2nd sec. of 47 Vic. ch. 39, the court is authorized to appoint the assignee or liquidator already appointed to be the assignee or liquidator to continue the proceedings in a winding up to be thereafter taken under the statute, 45 Vic ch. 23, while section 99 and the subsequent sections apply only to the case of a bank in insolvent circumstances, but not yet brought into liquidation in insolvency. In the latter case a creditor of the bank sought to be brought into liquidation by process of law is the only person authorized to make the application, while in the case of an application under sec. 2 of 47 Vic. ch. 39 to have proceedings already commenced to wind up an insolvent company brought under the operation of 45 Vic. ch. 23, a shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver, or liquidator may be the applicant, shewing that the legislature was making provision for a case different from the case of a bank which although in insolvent circumstances had not yet been brought under process of liquidation. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and that the order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia should stand.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Otto. S. Weeks.\nSolicitors for respondents: Graham, Tupper, Borden & Parker.\n[1] Sections 2 and 3 of 47 Vic. ch. 39, amending 45 Vic. ch. 23, read as follows:\n2. When at the date of the passing of the said act, a company was in liquidation or in process of being wound up, any shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company may apply by petition to the court, asking that the company be brought within and under the provisions of the said act, and the court may make such order; and the winding up of such company shall thereafter be carried on under the said act, and the expression \"winding up order,\" in the said act shall include the order in this section mentioned.\n3. The court, in making such an order, may direct that the assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company if one has been appointed, shall become the liquidator of the company under the said act, or may appoint some other person to be liquidator of the company.\n[2] 45 Vic. ch. 23, sec. 99 to 102 as amended:\n99. In case of a bank the application for a winding up order must be made by a creditor for a sum of not less than one thousand dollars, and the court must, before making the order, direct a meeting of the shareholders of the bank, and a meeting of the creditors of the bank to be summoned, held and conducted as the court directs, for the purpose of ascertaining their respective wishes as to the appointment of liquidators.\n100. The court may appoint a person to act as chairman of the meeting of shareholders, and in default of such appointment, the president of the bank, or other person who usually presides at a meeting of the shareholders, shall preside. The court may also appoint a person to act as chairman of the meeting of creditors, and in default of such appointment the creditors shall appoint a chairman.\n101. In taking a vote at such a meeting of shareholders, regard## ##is to be had to the number of votes conferred by law or by the regulations of the bank on each shareholder present or represented at such meeting, and in case of the creditors, regard is to be had to the amount of the debt due to each creditor.\n102. The chairman of each meeting must report the result thereof to the court, and if a winding up order is made, the court shall appoint three liquidators, to be selected in its discretion, after such hearing of the parties as it may deem expedient from among the persons nominated by the majorities and minorities of the shareholders and creditors at such meetings respectively.\n[3] 6 Russ. v.

The names, alphabetically arranged, of all persons who are or have been shareholders Schedule A.\nPublic notice is hereby given, that under the Joint Stock Companies Incorporation Act, letters patent have been issued under the great seal of the Province of Quebec, bearing date of the day of incorporating (here state names, address and calling, of each corporator named in the letters patent,) for the purpose of (here state undertaking of the company, as set forth in the letters patent,) by the name of (here state name of the company, as in the letters patent,) with a total capital stock of dollars divided into shares of\nDated at the office of the Secretary of the Province of Quebec this day of\nA. B.\nSecretary.\nThe suit was brought to recover from the defendant a sum of ten thousand dollars, the amount due for one hundred shares of $100 each in the capital stock of the company.\nThe defence raised several objections.\n1. That the defendant had subscribed the shares only upon the fraudulent representations which had been made to him by the promoters of the company;\n2. That the defendant had never subscribed to the capital stock of the company (plaintiff, but had merely undertaken to subscribe for shares to the amount of $100000.00 in a company to be incorporated at a future period and that the company, which was the plaintiff in the suit, was not the company to which he had so undertaken to subscribe;\n3. That the name of the defendant did not appear amongst those of the persons who asked for the incorporation, and that no share was ever allotted by the plaintiff to the defendant.\nAt the trial the following facts were proved:\u2014\nIn September, 1882, the respondent at the solicitation of one William Hobbs, signed a subscription list, headed as follows:\u2014\nThe undersigned hereby respectively agree to take the number of shares of one hundred dollars each in the capital stock of a company to be formed under the name of the Magog Textile and Print Company, herein below set after our names respectively, and to pay the amount of all class thereon, at the office of the company in Montreal, at such times as the provisional directors or the directors of the company when incorporated may direct.\nIn January following, Mr. Hobbs and eight others, of whom the respondent is not one, gave notice in the Quebec Official Grazetee that they were about to apply for letters patent, under the seal of the province, constituting them and such other persons as might become associated with them, a corporation under the name of the Magog Textile and Print Company. And on the 13th April 1883 letters patent issued under the Quebec Act 31 Vic. ch. 25, as amended by 44-45 Vic. ch. 11, constituting the applicants and such other persons as \" may become shareholders, a body corporate\" under the proposed name.\nNo allotment of stock was ever made but subsequently calls were made for the full amount due on the company\u2019s stock.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court, while refusing to admit the allegation of fraud which was not proved, maintained the plea on the other points.\nThe judgment is in the following words:\u2014\nConsidering that the plaintiffs have not proved the material allegations of their declaration, and more particularly that the defendant is a shareholder in the Magog Textile and Print Company, liable to pay calls:\nConsidering that the defendant did not petition for letters patent of incorporation for said Company, such as issued for the same under the provisions of the Act 31 Vic. chap. 25, and hence is not constituted thereby a shareholder, and that he has not, since said incorporation, subscribed for any stock in the said company;\nConsidering that the defendant hath proved that, although he offered to take one hundred shares in the stock of said company before the same was incorporated or had applied for incorporation. and that after incorporation the plaintiffs wholly failed to make any allotment of shares to him, the defendant as provided by said act, and that, in the absence of such allotment, the defendant was not and is not a shareholder in said company as frequently held by the courts of this country; Considering that the said patent of incorporation of the said plaintiffs constitutes the petitioners for said patent byname and all persons that may become shareholders thereafter, a body corporate and politic under the said name of the \" Magog Textile and Print Company and that the defendant is neither a petitioner nor a subscriber to the stock of the same since the issue of said patent.\nOn the appeal which was taken from this judgment to the Queen's Bench, appeal side, it was confirmed for the reasons given by the Superior Court.\nBoss\u00e9 Q. C. for the appellants The contract entered into by the subscription for stock was absolutely complete and binding upon the defendants from the moment it was made, but supposing that not to be the case, but that the subscription was only to take shares at a future time from a company to be incorporated, that was also a complete contract.\nThe shares were allotted and several calls were made. The statute requires 10 per cent. to be paid before incorporation; if the 10 per cent was improperly called the defendants are still liable for the 90 per cent, called afterwards.\nThe plea of the defendants alleging fraud has been set aside by both courses below.\nBe\u00efque follows. Under the Joint Stock Company's Act no company can be formed without the petition of at least five persons nor until a certain amount of stock has been subscribed. 31 Vic ch 25; 41 Vic ch 22.\nThring on Joint Stock Companies ([2]); Buckley ([3]); Abbott's National Dig. ([4]), title \"Subscription.\" These acts and authorities show that the contract contained in the memorandum of shares is binding on the signer when the company is formed. See also Angell & Ames on Corporations ([5]).\nI distinguish the cases of Union Navigation Co: v. Couillard ([6]) and Rascony v. Union Navigation Co. ([7]).\nThe defendanss are estopped from claiming want of notice of calls. Bigelow on Estoppel ([8]).\nIrvine Q.C. for the respondents.\nUnder the Quebec act relating to incorporation of companies it cannot be said that these defendants are incorporators of this company. The company was to consist of the petitioners and others who should afterwards become shareholders, and the policy of the statute clearly was that all who wanted to become shareholders were to sign the petition.\nThen there is the act 44-45 Vic. ch. 11.\nThe proposition of Price was never accepted so as to make it binding.\nIn no way was the offer of the defendants accepted, except by asking them to pay.\nNo notice of allotment was given.\nWith regard to the question of fraud. We can still urge that question before this court, and we claim that there has been legal fraud which will relieve subscribers. The promoters purchased the stock of the old company, The Magog Manufacturing Co., and got Shanly to make a valuation of the property which was subsequently bought in. The prospectus was never seen by the respondents nor was it issued until the subscriptions were made. The owner of the property received from the company his price and made 100 per cent, by it. Respondents were never notified of this position.\nAnother ground of fraud is that Hobbs subscribed for 100 shares on the understanding that he was not to be liable therefor but was to be indemified by the other shareholders. This was in order to realize the necessary amount of stock to obtain letters patent. Stuart foflows citing Gouillard v. Union Navigation Go. ([9]); Lewin on Trusts ([10]); Pellott's Case ([11]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The plaintiffs in their declaration allege t that said hundred shares were duly allotted, assigned and made over to the defendant and entered as such on the books of the company, and the defendant then and there became and was and still is a shareholder in the said company of said hundred shares of the denomination of one hundred dollars $100 each, amounting in all to the sum of $10000, \" when in fact no allotment of stock was ever made defendants name was never even entered in any book of the company until November or December, 1883, in fact until that time no stock had ever existed though three calls had been made, and as to this entry in the books it does not appear to have been the act of the company. The account Money gives of it is this:\u2014\nI am a clerk in the office of Grant, the witness just examined in this cause.\nI opened under his instructions the stock ledger book exhibited by him a moment ago, to wit. the stock ledger of the company plaintiff. It was opened about the end of eighteen hundred and eighty-three (1883).\nQ. Before the expiration of the year eighteen hundred and eighty-three (1883)? A. Yes.\nQ. In what month? A. I could not say the month exactly, it was either in November or December.\nQ. When were these entries made that have reference to the defendant? A. The entries in reference to the defendant in the said stock ledger were made at the same time as the other entries were made to wit, sometime about November or December eighteen \u2022 hundred and eighty-three (1883).\nIt does not appear that after the organization of the company the subscriptions made previous to the incorporation were adopted by the company or that they were entered as stockholders upon the stock ledger of the company, or that the company in any way recognized the individual subscriptions as valid suscriptions, nor were they recognized and ratified by these subscribers by payments thereon or in any other manner. If after the corporation was formed it had accepted the subscription and recognized the defendant as a stockholder and he had recognized himself as a stockholder and ratified and confirmed his subscription the case would have been very different, but the fact is he never took any part in the application or steps for the incorporation of the company or the issuing of the letters patent or in any way assented to the organization of the company nor to any acts done under it and it is even curious to notice in view of the present claim what Mr. Hobbs in his examination says:\u2014\nI am the originator of the company plaintiff.\nI was president of the company for some time and I am now vice-president of the company.\nI know the defendant and I witnessed his signature to the stock of the company for ten thousand dollars (10,000). His signature to the said amount of stock was signed in my presence in the stock subscription book which is now shown to me having been exhibited by the witness already examined, Grant.\nQ. Will you say about what date that subscription was made? A. He signed the subscription in September of eighteen hundred and eighty-two (1882) for ten thousand dollars ($10,000).\nQ. At the time the defendant subscribed as mentioned, above, or at any other time since, was there any company in process of organization or in question by the name of the Magog Textile and Print Company? A. No, there was not.\nThe general principle of law applicable to contracts must be recognised and adopted and must govern the present case and I can discover nothing whatever that created the relation of stockholder and company as between defendant and the corporation to enable the plaintiff to say that defendant was a shareholder in the company, and that there was a contract by and between him as shareholder and the company to pay the calls as now claimed.\nThe letters patent do not incorporate those who may have associated themselves together by subscribing the memo. with a view to the formation of a company but constituted those only specifically named in the letters patent as the corporators and not such as may have subscribed the memo. but only those named and such other persons who may become shareholders in said company (of whom the defendant is not one) a body corporate and politic by the name of \" The Magog Textile and Print Company,\" nor can I discover any obligation on the part of the company to give the defendant the stock should he have required it.\nThe question is not before us as to how far there was a contract by the individuals who signed the memo. as between themselves, or if there was, how it could be enforced by this corporation. It is very obvious the breach of such an agreement and the damages incident thereto are very different from a claim for calls by the company on defendant as a shareholder, in which capacity alone he can be liable and called on to pay calls. Morawitz on Corporations ([12]) says\nIt is important to distinguish between the contract of membership actually existing between the shareholders or members of a company and a contract to become a shareholder at a future time.\nA contract to become a shareholder or to subscribe for shares in a company at a future day does not give the contracting party the status of shareholder until after the contract has been fully executed by taking the shares or actually subscribing upon the books, and upon a failure to perform the contract the corporation would be entitled to recover only the damages suffered, that is, the difference between the amount which the defendant agreed to pay, or contribute on account of the shares and the value of an equal number of shares in the market.\"\nThe single question therefore in this case, in my opinion is was defendant at the time the calls were made a shareholder in the Magog Textile Print Company and as such liable to the payment of calls? And as to this the statute in empress and unequivocal terms declares who are corporators\u2014they are the petitioners and those who may from time to time after the organization is perfected become holders of the capital stock of the company. It is from such stockholders the directors can require payment of calls. The case would have been very different if the words and authority of the act and the wording of the letters patent issued under it had provided as was done in the act in question in Kidwelly Canal Co, v. Baby ([13]) where the words of the act were \" those who have subscribed or shall hereafter subscribe \" and in describing the persons liable to calls as e every person or persons who hath or have already subscribed,\" \"or shall hereafter subscribe \" under which it was held that a party who had subscribed and had done no act to discharge himself from the effects of his subscription by reason of his being within the terms of the act, would have been entitled to a share of the profits of the undertaking as a proprietor and must therefore be considered liable as such to losses.\nI entirely agree with the courses below that defendant was not a shareholder in the Magog Textile and Print Company and consequently not liable to pay to the company the calls sued for in this action. This conclusion is in accord with the unanimous decision of the Court of Queen's Bench in Quebec, 1878, in the case of Joseph Rascony v. La Compagnie de Navigation Union, ([14]) in which it was adjudged:\u2014\n\"Que lee actionnaires incorpor\u00e9es par lettres patentes sont ceux qui v sonts nomm\u00e9es ainsi que ceux qui souscrivent apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes. Touee personee non mention\u00e9e aux lettres patentes qui aurait souscrit des parts ou actions avant telle \u00e9mission no peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme actionnaire.\"\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSPRONG J. was of opinion the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed, adhering to the reasons there given.\nFOURNIER. J.\u2014En septembre 1881 li intim\u00e9 sigma \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de William Hobbs, une liste de souscription ainsi con\u00e7ue:-\u2014\nThe undersigned hereby respectively agree to take the number of shares of one hundred dollars each in the capital stock of a company to be formed under the name of the Magog Textile and Print Company, herein below set after our names respectively, and to pay the amount of all calls thereon, at the office of the company in Montreal, at such times as the provisional directors or the directors of the company when incorporated may direct.\nPlus tard Hobbs, conjointement avec huit autres signataires, donna avis dans la Gazette Officielle de Qu\u00e9bec, d'une demande de lettres patentes sous le grand sceau de la province, les incorporant avec telles autres personnes qui se joindraient \u00e0 eux sous le nom de \" Magog Textile and Print Company.\" Cet avis u' avant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par li intim\u00e9 et son nom ne fut pas non plus ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans les lettres patentes \u00e9mises le 13 avril 1883 en vertu des statuts de Qu\u00e9bec comme l'un de ceux qui devaient former la dite corporation.\nIl n'y eut pas de r\u00e9partition du stock souscrit, mais des demandes de versements furent faites pour le total souscrit, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement la pr\u00e9sente action fut port\u00e9e contre li intim\u00e9 sur le principe que la souscription l'avait rendu responsable. Ii nia sa qualit\u00e9 d'actionnaire, et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure par son jugement, confirm\u00e9 en appel par la cour du Banc de la Reine, renvoya cette action.\nL'intim\u00e9 n'est pas un membre originaire de cette corporation, car il n'est pas un de ceux qui ont donn\u00e9 avis de la demande de lettres patentes, ni un des signataires de la p\u00e9tition \u00e0 cet effet. Ii n'y a que ces personnes qui d'apr\u00e8s l'amendement de 44-45 Vict., ch. 11, qui peuvent avoir cette qualit\u00e9 La ss. 2, de la sec, l\u00e8re le dit clairement:\nThe Lieutenant Governor may grant a charter to any member or person who shall petition therefor. Such charter shall constitute the petitioners, and all others who may become shareholders in the company thereby created, a body politic and corporate.\nEn vertu de cet acte et des lettres patentes les p\u00e9titionnaires seuls sont membres originaires de la corporation. Ils peuvent, ii est vrai, apr\u00e8s la constitution de la corporation, en vertu des mots du statut\u2014\nPetitioners and all others who may become shareholders,\ns'adjoindre des actionnaires. Mais l'appelante ne pr\u00e9tend nullement que depuis l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes li intim\u00e9 ait fait aucune d\u00e9marche pour devenir actionnaire. S'il a fait preuve par sa signature en septembre 1882, d'une intention de le devenir, la compagnie en donnant avis et en p\u00e9titionnant sans son concours pour l'organisation de la corporation a aussi de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 fait preuve qu'elle n'avait pas accept\u00e9 cette souscription. Pour le faire consid\u00e9rer comme actionnaire, il faudrait prouver contre li intim\u00e9 un engagement depuis l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes Ii n'y en a point. Aucune action n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par l'appelante pour donner effet \u00e0 la signature de septembre 1882 elle ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e que comme d\u00e9montrant une intention de devenir actionnaire qui est demeur\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de projet ou que la compagnie a refus\u00e9e.\nLes autorit\u00e9s suivantes confirment la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9:\nThe Union Navigation Company v. Gouillard ([15]); Rascony v. The Union Navigation Company ([16]); Arless v. The Belmtnt Manufacturing Co. ([17]); Nasmith v. Manning ([18]).\nEtant d'opinion que l'intim\u00e9 n'est aucunement responsable, je ne crois pas devoir m'occuper des circonstances dans lesquelles la signature de li intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue. L'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014I concur in the reasons given for dismissing the appeal. No one, not a member of a company, can be made answerable for calls. The appellant in this case, before the company was started, joined in the undertaking, but he afterwards declined to sign the petition for incorporation and never afterwards had any connection with the company. He was, therefore, not a member of it and no board of directors could impose any liability by making calls on him.\nTASDHEREAU J.\u2014The respondents action was limited exclusively to signing the subscription list in September, 1882, and the question in the case is: What legal responsibility if any, does that act involve?\nIt is plain that the respondent is not an original corporator. He was not one of those who gave notice of applying for letters patent, who petitioned for them or were incorporated by them when obtained. The statute on this point is clear. \"The Lieutenant-Governor may grant a charter to any number of persons \"who shall petition therefor. Such charter shall con-\" statute the petitioners and all others who may become \" shareholders, in the company thereby created, a body \" politic and corporate\" (44-45 Vic. ch. 11, s. 1) and both under this act and the letters patent the nine petitioners were the sole original corporators. Now while it is not pretended that the respondent became a shareholder subsequent to the charter, it is supposed that the subscription in some way or other created a liability, without allotment of shares as distinctly required by section 25 of 31 Vic. ch. 25, and without acceptance of them after allotment in any form\nBut there is no ground for that contention. The respondent did, not contract with any one to take these shares and furthermore, the very words of the subscription list he signed constitute nothing but an undertaking to take shares later, that is when the company would be formed, which he never did, nor was ever asked to do. The cases of The Union Navigation Company v. Couillard ([19]); Rascony v. The Union Navigation Company (1); Arless v. The Belmont Manufacturing Company (2); appear to me in point and against the appellant's contentions.\nThis appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nGwynne J. concurred with Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Joseph G.

(P.Q.) ch. 43 sec. 7 sub-secs. 3 and 5.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Taschereau J. dissenting, that a riparian owner on a navigable river is entitled to damages against a railway company, although no land is taken from him, for the obstruction and interrupted access between his property and the navigable wastes of the river, viz., for the injury and diminution in value thereby occasioned to his property.\n2. That the railway company in the present case not having complied with the provisions of 43-44 Vic. (P. Q.) ch. 43, sec. 7, sub. secs. 3 and 5 the appellants' remedy by action at law was admissible.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) (3) reversing a\n(1) 24 L. C. J. 133. (2) M. L. R. 1 Q. B. 346,\n(3) 12 Q. L. R. 205, judgment of the Superior Court by which the appellant's action was maintained.\nThe appellants sued the respondents jointly with the Quebec Harbor Commissioners in damages for $50,000. In the Superior Court the respondents were condemned to pay them $5.500.\nThe material allegations of the declaration and the pleadings and evidence are fully stated in the 12 volume of the Quebec Law Reports p. 205 and in the judgments hereinafter given. The action was dismissed as far as the Harbor Commissioners were concerned because appellants could not prove that they had permitted the respondents to do the works complained of.\nLangelier Q.C. for appellants.\nAre the respondents legally responsible for the damages is the main point in the case, and the only one on which the judgment of the court of appeal has turned. This involves two questions : 1. Has the riparian proprietor of a navigable river a right of access to such river? 2. If he has, had the respondents legal authority to deprive him of the same? The first of those questions is purely a question of law : the second is a question of law and of fact; it is a question of law to know what authority is required to deprive a proprietor of such supposed right, and it is a question of fact to ascertain whether such authority has been obtained by the respondents.\nAs to the question of law whether the riparian proprietor has a right of access to a navigable river, I submit that he has, 1st. under the common law of the province of Quebec, 2nd, under a special statute of that province concerning water courses.\nAccording to the old French law which is the common law of Quebec on that point, navigable water courses are in the nature of public highways, they are, according to Pascal's celebrated saying : des chemins qui marchent. Again a party whose property borders such, a highway, cannot be deprived of free access, of ingress to it and egress from it, without a special warrant of law. i See Bell v. Corporation of Quebec (1); Major of Montreal V. Drummond (2); Brown v. Gugy (3); Renaud v. Corporation of Quebec (4). Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, ch. 50;\nIf, as we contend, the respondents could not, without special authority, deprive the appellants of their right of access to the river, what is the nature of the authority that was required?\nThe only authority was a statute, not only expressly giving them the power to do what they have done, but further expressly enacting that they could exercise such power without paying any damages. See Bell V. Corporation of Quebec cited above.\nNow what is the special law invoked by the respondents as their authority for what they have done? 1st. The statute of Quebec, 44-45 Vict. ch. 20 which, they say, gives them power to pass their line where it has been located. 2d. The statute of Quebec, 43-44 Vict., ch. 43 sect. 11, which authorizes any railway company whose line is legally located on any beach to use it without indemnity to the crown.\nNeither of these statutes gives the respondents the authority which they required.\nThe evidence shows that the appellants have been deprived by the respondents of the access which they had to the river St-Charles; that they have suffered thereby heavy damages, and if the law of the province of Quebec is as I have contended for, the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the judgment of the superior court restored.\nIrvine Q. C. and Duhamel Q. C. for respondents contended:\u2014\n1st. That they never invaded, nor encroached upon,\n5 App. Cas. 84. (3) 2 Moo. P.C. (N.S.) 341,\n1 App. Cas. 384, . (4) 8 Q. L. R. 102. the appellants property and therefore, never in any way expropriated them, in the legal sense of the word.\n2nd. Any damage sustained by the appellants, in consequence of works lawfully carried out under the authority of a statute can only amount to a damnum absque injuria.\n3rd. That the Quebec Consolidated Railway Act, 1880. neither contemplates, nor provides for, compensation for damages of this nature.\n4th. That at common law (i. e. under the Civil Code of Quebec) the appellants have no claim against the respondents, by reason of the facts set forth in their declaration.\n5th. That the English decisions relied on by the Superior Court have no bearing on the case inasmuch as they all deal with the interpretation to be given to an Imperial Statute, \"The Lands clauses consolidation \" Act, 1845,\" (8-9 Vic. cap. XVIII, sec. 68) which forms no part of our law.\n6th. That the only remedy the appellants had was by arbitration, under the statute, and not by action.\n7th. That no proof has been made in the cause which would entitle the appellants to indemnity, even under the Imperial Act (8-9 Vic. Ch. 18) as construed in the numerous cases determined under it; and they cited and relied on to the following authorities :\u2014\nThe Quebec Consolidated Railway Act, 1880, sections 6, 7,9; 22 Vic. ch. 32.secs. 1 and 2; 25 Vict., ch. 46, sec. 1; 36 Vic. ch. 62. secs. 15 and 16; Civil Code, articles 4 5, 407, 503 and 1589; Code Napoleon, articles 545,644.\nLaurent, Droit Civil (1); The Caledonian Railway Co. v.

Dans ce but ils firent l'acquisition du terrain qu\u2019ils occupent actuellement sur les bords de la rivi\u00e8re St. Charles dans le quartier St. Roch de Qu\u00e9bec, et y \u00e9rig\u00e8rent \u00e0 grands frais une b\u00e2tisse consid\u00e9rable pour y exercer leur industrie. Une des principales raisons qui les engagea \u00e0 faire le choix de cet endroit \u00e9tait, ainsi qu'ils l'all\u00e8guent dans leur action celle d'utiliser la rivi\u00e8re St. Charles pour layer les peaux et les laines; pour s'approvisionner d'eau \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la manufacture et pour recevoir le bois, le charbon et les approvisionnements, ainsi que les mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leur manufacture et pour \u00e9couler les produits de leur manufacture.\nEn 1883, la compagnie intim\u00e9e en cette cause construisit pour le passage de son chemin de fer dans la dite rivi\u00e8re. St. Charles, en face de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des appelants, un quai d'une hauteur d'environ quinze pieds, fermant compl\u00e8tement aux appelants l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la dite rivi\u00e8re et rendant l'exploitation de leur manufacture plus difficile et plus dispendieuse. En cons\u00e9quence ils out demand\u00e9 par leur action la d\u00e9molition du quai en question et une condamnation \u00e0 des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nL'intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette action par d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait seulement.\nLes faits de cetee cause soul\u00e8vent les questions suivantes : 1\u00b0 Le quai construit par l'intim\u00e9e pour le passage de son chemin de fer a-t-il priv\u00e9 les appelants de leur acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re? 2\u00b0 En est-il r\u00e9sult\u00e9 des dommages et \u00e0 quel montant? 30 L intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait-elle autoris\u00e9e a faire cette construction sans payer one indemnit\u00e9 aux appelants pour les dommages qu'elle leur causait?\nSur le premier point, il est incontestable que la construction du quai a eu l'effet de priver les appelants d'un acc\u00e8s direct de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re et vite versa. La preuve ne laisse aucun doute \u00e0 ce sujet. Ce fait \u00e9tant \u00e9tabli, on ne peut mettre en doute, je crois, que l'intim\u00e9e s'est rendue coupable de violation du droit appartenant \u00e0 tout propri\u00e9taire riverain de communiquer directement par son fonds avec la rivi\u0141re qui le borde.\nPour \u00e9tablir ce droit du riverain il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, je crois, de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 d'autres autorit\u00e9s qu'\u00e0 celle de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans laceuse de Bell v. Corporation of Quebec, (1) o\u00f9 ce droit d'acc\u00e8s du riverain sur la m\u00eame rivi\u00e8re (St. Charles) a fait le sujet d'un examen approfondi.\nApr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue la d\u00e9cision dans la cause du Maire de Montr\u00e9al v. Drummond (2), o\u00f9 il s'agissait des droits d'acc\u00e8s et de sortie appartenant au propri\u00e9taire d'une maison situ\u00e9e sur une rue, le jugement d\u00e9clare :\nThese principles appear to be applicable to the position of riparian proprietors upon a navigable river. There may be \" droit d'acc\u00e8s et de sortie \" belonging to riparian land, which, if interfered with, would at once give the proprietor a right of action, but this right appears to be confined to what it is expressed to be a acc\u00e8s\" or the power of getting from the water way to and upon the land (and the converse) in a free and uninterrupted manner,\nCe droit d'acc\u00e8s, comme on le voit, est admis sans restriction; mais leurs Seigneuries \u00e9tant d'avis que le droit de Bell n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 et que la construction du pont dont il se plaignait ne lui avait cause aucun dommage, rejet\u00e8rent sa demande, tout en admettant le droit du riverain.\nDans le cas actuel, les appelants ne se plaignent que de l'obstacle mis \u00e0 leur droit d'acc\u00e8s et non pas d'obstruction \u00e0 la navigation. Au contraire de Bell, ils ont fait une preuve claire et positive des dommages r\u00e9sultant de la privation de leur droit d'acc\u00e8s.\nQuant au montant des dommages, fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $5,000, par l'hon. juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette cause en premi\u00e8re instance, il est amplement justifi\u00e9 par la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite\n(1)5 App. Cas. P. 98, (2) 1 App. Cas. 384. et dolt \u00eatre confirm\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que l'intim\u00e9e ne fasse voir que par une exemption sp\u00e9ciale sa faveur, les principes maintenus par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 ne lui sont pas applicables. C\u2019est sa pr\u00e9tention et pour ainsi dire son seul moyen de d\u00e9fense. Au soutien de cette pr\u00e9tention l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque les statuts de Qu\u00e9bec 45 Vic. ch. 20 et 43 et 44 Vic., ch. 43 comme l'autorisant \u00e0 se servir de la gr\u00e8ve de la dite rivi\u00e8re pour le passage de son chemin de fer sans payer d'indemnit\u00e9.\nLa 17e section de l'acte 45 Vic., ch. 20, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'Acte des chemins de fer de Qu\u00e9bec de 1880 applicable \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e. Parmi les pouvoirs donn\u00e9s par ce dernier acte aux compagnies de chemins de fer, \u00e0 la sec. T. ss. 3 et 5, on trouve qu'elles sont autoris\u00e9es avec le consentement du. lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil \u00e0 se servir de\nTelle partie do la gr\u00e8ve publique ou du terrain couvet par los eaux de tous lac, rivi\u00e8re, cours d'eau ou canal, ou de leurs lits respectifs qui sera n\u00e9cessaire pour faire, compl\u00e9ter et exploiter les dits chemins do for et travaux, sujet toutefois \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 et au contr\u00f4le du parlement du Canada en cc qui concerne la navigation et los b\u00e2timents ou navires.\nLa ss. 5 donne le pouvoir de construire, entretenir et faire fonctionner le chemin de fer, \u00e0 travers, le long ou sur toute rivi\u00e8re, cours d\u2019eau, canal, grand chemin on chemin de fer qu'il croisera ou touchera; mais la rivi\u00e8re, cours d'eau, grand chemin, canal on chemin de fer ainsi crois\u00e9 ou touch\u00e9 sera remis par la compagnie en son premier \u00e9tat, on en un \u00e9tat tel que son utilit\u00e9 n'en soit pas amoindrie, etc.\nLes termes de ces deux sous-sections ne s'\u00e9tendent pas \u00e9videmment an del\u00e0 d'une permission donn\u00e9e aux compagnies de se servir des gr\u00e8ves publiques sans enfreindre les droits de la conson\u00e9e \u00e0. cet \u00e9gard. Il n'y est fait aucune mention des droits incontestables des particuliers sur ces m\u00eames graves, et on ne peul pas pr\u00e9tende que la permission donn\u00e9e par le gouvernement en ce qui le concerne sp\u00e9cialement peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme an\u00e9antissant les droits des part-culiers sur ces m\u00eames gr\u00e8ves. Le texte de cc statut ne va pas aussi loin que li intim\u00e9e le pr\u00e9tend; il ne fait nullement allusion aux particuliers dont les droits sont rest\u00e9s intacts. De plus cette permission n'est accord\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 la condition que l'utilit\u00e9 de ces rivi\u00e8res cours d'eau etc., etc., n'en sera pas amoindrie. Cette derni\u00e8re condition de ne pas diminuer l'utilit\u00e9 des rivi\u00e8res et cours d'eau n'est-elle pas une restriction suffisante pour la protection des droits des particuliers et ne fait-elle pas voir que c'est l'intention de la loi qu'ils ne puissent \u00eatre viol\u00e9s sans indemnit\u00e9. Toutefois, je crois que la loi n'avait pas pour but de les atteindre parce qu'il aurait fallu pour cela une d\u00e9claration formelle et positive qui n'existe pas.\nEn supposant m\u00eame que cette loi affecte les droits des particuliers, il faut remarquer qu'elle n'a pas accord\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re absolue la facult\u00e9 dont ii s'agit. Au contraire elle a mis \u00e0 son exercice une co\u00e9dition importante qu'il faut pr\u00e9alablement remplir et sans l'accomplissement de laquelle la loi est sans effet. Ainsi il faut avant de se mettre en possession des gr\u00e8ves en obtenir la permission du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil en vertu de la loi de Qu\u00e9bec\nLa l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est identique avec celle de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. L'acte consolid\u00e9 des chemins de fer de 1879 42 Vic., ch. 9, contient la clause suivante ss. 3 de la section ire des pouvoirs :\nNo railway company shall take possession of, use or occupy any land vested in Her Majesty without the consent of the Governor in council, but with such consent any such company may take and appropriate for the use of their railway and works but not alienate so much of the wild lands of the crown lying on the route of the railway as have not been granted for such railway, as also so much of the public beahh or of the land covered with the waters of any lake, river, stream or canal, or of their respective beds as is necessary for making and completing and using their said railway and works, subject, however, to the exemptions contained in the next following sub-section. Il est \u00e9vident que la loi exige comme condition pr\u00e9alable de l'exercice de la facult\u00e9 accord\u00e9e aux compagnies de chemins de fer de faire usage des or\u00e9es l'obtention d'une permission sp\u00e9ciale du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et du .gouverneur en conseil de la Puissance. Dans la pr\u00e9e sente cause l'intim\u00e9e n'ayant ni all\u00e8gue ni prouv\u00e9 qu'elle avait obtenu cette permission soit du lieutenant-gouverneur de Qu\u00e9bec soit du gouverneur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil, comment peut-elle se pr\u00e9valoir du privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 par ces lois sans avoir accompli la condition \u00e0 laquelle il est accord\u00e9? N'est-elle pas dans ce cas clairement coupable d'avoir viol\u00e9 sans justification quelconque les droits des appelants comme propri\u00e9taires riverains? La loi \u00e9tant ainsi les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es pour \u00e9tablir que l'ouverture de voies nouvelles sur le domaine public ne peut donner aux parties l\u00e9s\u00e9es le droit de r\u00e9clamer des indemnit\u00e9s, n'ont aucune application aux faits de cette cause puisque les droits du riverain ne peuvent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s tu\u00e2t que le gouvernement n'a pas donn\u00e9 de consentement. Dans le cas m\u00eame o\u00f9 le consentement requis aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, je ne serais pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 admettre qu'il n'y aurait pas lieu \u00e0 indemnit\u00e9 par\u00e9e que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Bell v. La Corporation de Qu\u00e9bec me parl\u00e2t avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire. Quoi qu'il en soit, cette question ne peut s'\u00e9lever ici car la pr\u00e9tendue autorisation invoqu\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\nLe fait que les appelants ont pris une action ordinaire au lieu de recourir \u00e0 l'arbitrage d'apr\u00e8s l'acte des chemins de fer leur est oppose comme une admission qu'ils n'ont aucun recouses en vertu des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales de l'acte des chemins de fer. Je crois que l'hon. juge Casault a r\u00e9pondu d'une mani\u00e8re tout \u00e0 fait concluante \u00e0 cette objection. Dans ses notes sur cette cause apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue les principales d\u00e9cisions des cours d'Angleterre an sujet des indemnit\u00e9s en cas d'expropriation, il termine par les remarquas suivantes :\nLes juges en Angleterre, et la chambre desirrds, comme tribunal en dernier ressort, ont maintenu, dans Ies Iroise causes sus-mention n\u00e9es et dans plusieurs autres qui y sons cit\u00e9es, que les termes injuriously affected, dans les lois suscit\u00e9es, comprenaient tous les cas o\u00f9, sans l'autorisation accord\u00e9e par le parlement, les ouvrages faits eussent donn\u00e9 une action. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0, en les rapportant, d\u00e9montr\u00e9 Que ces termes des statuts imp\u00e9riaux ont leurs correspondants dans l'acte des chemins de fer de cette province, et que tout dommage caqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par les compagnies de chemin de fer, dans l'exercice des pouvoirs Que leur conf\u00e8re la loi, doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s par elles. Le statut provincial (N\u00b0 13 et suivants do la sect. 9) d\u00e9termine le mode a suivre pour \u00e9tablir les compensations que les compagnies doivent payer; mais, dans le cas o\u00f9 elles ne l'ont pas adopt\u00e9 ou suivi, il ne prive pas les propri\u00e9taires des recours que leur donne le droit commun (N\u00b0 37 m\u00eame section).\nLa section de l'acte des chemins de fer r\u00e9servant aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s le recouses aux tribunaux ordinaires me para\u00eet tellement implorante que je crois d\u00e9vorer la citer en entier (1) :\nSi la compagnie a pris possession d'un terrain ou y fait des travaux ou en a enlev\u00e9 des mat\u00e9riaux sans que le montant de la compensation nit \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu ou d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par arbitrage le propri\u00e9taire du terrain ou son repr\u00e9sentant pourra proc\u00e9der lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 faire faire l'estimation du terrain ou des mat\u00e9riaux pris, et ce, sans pr\u00e9judice des autres recours en loi, si la presse de possession a eu lieu sans son consentement.\nIi est \u00e9vident que cette section donnait droit aux appelants d'adopter la proc\u00e9dure qu'ils ont suivie et que leur action est bien port\u00e9e.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 je Suis d'avis en me fondant sur la d\u00e9cision dn Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Bell v. La Corporation de Qu\u00e9bec que les appelants comme propri\u00e9taires riverains ont incontestablement droit \u00e0 une action pour la violation de leur droit d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Ia rivi\u00e8re St. Charles bordant leur terrain; que l'autorisation invoqu\u00e9e par la compagnie n'existe pas, et que sans la preuve de l'autorisation des gouvernements de Qu\u00e9bec et de la Puissance, de se servir de la (1) 43 et 44 Vic. ch. 43 sec. 9 ss. 37. gr\u00e8ve, les lois \u00e0 ce sujet n'ont pas d'application et ne peuvent justifier la violation des droits de particuliers; qu'enfin que les dommages sont prouv\u00e9s et que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J. concurred with FOURNIER J.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Under 22 Vic. ch. 32 (1858) as amended by 25 Vic. ch. 46 (1862) that part of the river St-Charles where the tide ebbs and flows and consequently the locality in question in the present case is within the limits of the Harbor of Quebec.\nConsequently under the authority of Holman v. Green (1), by which, I presume, we are bound in this court, the ownership of the beach opposite the appellants' property is vested in the federal government.\nThis being so there is no statute either federal or provincial applicable to this case, under which an Order in Council could issue for the purpose of authorizing this company to construct their railway on that beach, for the Quebec Railway Act of 1880, clearly does not and could not authorize a railway company to take possession of the property of the Dominion, and the Dominion Railway Act of 1879 does not and could not apply to a provincial railway, of which character the North Shore Company was when they took possession of the beach in question (39 Vic. ch. 2) and up to the 23rd May 1883 (46 Vic. ch 24 D.) neither could the Quebec act of 1882 (45 Vic. ch. 20) authorize the company to take possession of this beach. It is obvious that the Quebec Legislature could not dispose of the property of the Dominion.\nThe question of an order in council, either federal or provincial does not therefore arise.\nIt, moreover, was not open to the appellants under the terms of their declaration, and, even if open in the Superior Court, is not open to them on this appeal\n6 Can. S. C. R. 707. from the terms of the formal judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, which declares that the appellants have not in that court contested the company's right to have their railway on the beach in question.\nIn the view I take of the case, however, this is quite immaterial The appellants must fail, whether the company is a trespasser on this beach or not, if they do not show a title, or a right to use it\u2014for the purposes of their trade. They have no locus standi to complain of an encroachment of the company on their neighbors\u2019 property, if the company by their works have not deprived them of any of their rights. So that the only question to be determined is : What are the appellants' rights to that beach for the purposes of their trade, whether the company is lawfully in possession of it or not? This question has, in this case, to be determined upon the civil law of the Province of Quebec.\nThe appellants base their action on a right of servitude which, as they allege, the law gives them on the beach opposite their property. They claim that they have a special, and necessarily an exclusive, right as riparian owner to use that beach for the purposes of their trade.\nThe Quebec Court of Appeal has decided that they have no such right, and in that decision I unhesitatingly concur.\nIt is by sufferance only that the appellants have been using that beach for the purposes of their trade up to the time of the building of this railway. They had no more rights there than the public had. If when they established their factory they had obtained from the crown a grant of that beach lot, they would not have been exposed, without full compensation, to the damage they now suffer. But they now claim with-out a title the same rights they would have had with a title. According to their contention it would be perfectly unnecessary for a riparian owner to obtain a rrant of the beach lot opposite his property. Their position as riparian owners, they claim, gives them on that beach all the rights appetent from the crown would. This contention is, in my opinion, utterly unfounded. The riparian owners on navigable rivers have no special rights either on the beach or on the rivers. Laurent (1). The wharf that the appellants had built in front of their property, below the high water mark, without a grant or license from the crown, was an encroachment on the public domain, which the crown could have put a stop to at any time.\nLes propri\u00e9taires refrains des cours d'eau d\u00e9pendant du domaine public ne peuvent y exercer aucune enterprise.\nsays Demolombe (2). The riparian owner, in the Province of Quebec, has no exclusive right to the grant by the crown of the beach lots opposite his property. This was determined long ago in Beg. v. Baird (3), and never has been doubted since, that I am aware of. I draw particular attention to the remarks in that case of Meredith C. J. than whom no higher authority on the law of the Province of Quebec can be quoted.\nThe crown could therefore have conceded this beach lot opposite the appellants property to any third party who would have been at liberty to erect on it a wharf, or a dock, or an elevator or any building whatever, and the appellants would have had no claim for compensation for their severance from the river.\nIn the United States, where from the case of Stevens V. Paterson and Newark RR. Co. (4), 1 gather that the law is precisely the same as in the Province of Quebec on the subject, this doctrine was, in that case, directly applied. The facts of that case were exactly as they are here, that is to say, a railway company had built\nVol. 7 No. 254 et. seq. (3) 4 L. C. E. 325.\nVol. XI. No. 124. (4) 3 Am. R. 269. its road along the bank of a navigable river, below high water mark, thus cutting off the riparian owners from the benefits incident to their property from its contiguity to the water. The question was whether they were entitled to compensation. The court held that they were not; that the titles of owness of lands bordering on tide waters ends at high water mark, that below the ordinary high water mark, the title to the soil is in the state; and that the riparian owner has no rights beyond high water mark, as against the staee or its grantees. The Chief Justice, in his remarks, said :\nIndeed I think it is safe to say that no English lawyer, speaking either from the bench or from the bar, has ever assented that the owner of the land along the shore of navigable water has any particular right, by reason of such property, to the use of the water or of the shore.\nSuch is the law of the Province of Quebec. It is precisely what was also declared to be the law of England by the Court of Appeal in Chancery in Lyon v. Fishmonger's Co. (1), where the court held that they had been unable to find any authority for holding that a riparian proprietor where the tide flows and reflows has any rights or natural easements vested in him similar to those which have been held in numerous cases to belong to a riparian proprietor on the banks of a natural stream above the flow of the tide\nThis holding, it is true, was reversed in the House of Lords (2); but this merely shows the difference between the law of England and the law of the Province of Quebec on this subject, a difference which the Privy Council in Bell v. The Corporation of Quebec (3); in reviewing that case of Lyon v. Fishmonger's Co. seemed to recognize.\nThe Ontario case of The Queen v. The Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Co (4) is no authority; it is not\n10 Ch. App. 679. (3) 5 App. Cas. 84.\n1 App. Cas. 662. (4) 23 U. C. Q. B. 208. law here. A judgment of the highest tribunal of France in 1865, in re Joanne Rousseray (1) on a case in point leaves no doubt on the subject.\u2014There the claimant had bought for the special purpose of having the use of the river (a navigable one) a lot bordering on that river. The State constructed on the river immediately opposite the claimant's riparian lot public works, by which the claimant was deprived of all access to the river from his lot. He therefore claimed damages. The court of first instance dismissed his claim, and on appeal to the conseil d'\u00e9tat, this judgment was confirmed. \" Considering, says the judgment dismissing the appeal, that by the construction of public works on navigable rivers, the State owes an indemnity but to those of whom a right of ownership has been affected by the works : Considering that the works in question have not affected any inherent right of the claimant as riparian owner, &c.\" The doctrine that a riparian owner on a navigable river has not an inherent right of access to the river could not receive a more decisive sanction. In that case it is true the claimant had still access to the river, not from his lot, but some way down the river. But in the present case also, the plaintiffs have still complete access to the river.\nThey have not been deprived of their droit d'acc\u00e8s et de sortie referred to in Montreal v. Drummond (2), and In Bell V. Corporation of Quebec above cited.\nThey still have access to the river. Besides the tunnel which the company has opened in the embankment of their road for their special use, there is a public high-way running alongside their property leading to the river, and through this, they have, with the public, all that the public have, that is to say, all that they can claim as of right. All the damage they suffer from\nS. V 65, 2, 246. (2) 1 App. Cas. 384. the construction of the road is that the access to the river is rendered thereby for them longer or more difficult Now the cases under the French law are clear, that, under these circumstances, the appellants have no locus standi.\nI refer to the cases of Re Dauee (1); Re Darnis (2); Re Crispon (3); Re Hubie (4).\nIn Re Daube the court held that works which cause inconveniences to a property do not give a claim for indemnity to the owner.\nRe Darnis and Re Hubie are in the same sense as the decision of the Privy Council in Drummond v Montreal\nIn Re Crispon, the railway had been built between a quarry where the claimant got his limestone and his limekiln. The claimant claimed damages from the fact that by the railway works the road from his quarry to his lime-kiln was lengthened, and because he would have to cross the railway to communicate from one to the other. Damages refused.\nI also refer to the case of Ville de Paris (5).\nAnd Sourdat (6) says :\u2014\nMaintenant, quand y aura-t-il dommage indirect, insusceptible do server de base \u00e0 une demand\u00e9e en indemnit\u00e9?\nC'est, d'abord, dit-il, quand ii n'y aura d'atteinte port\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 de pures facult\u00e9s ouvertes \u00e0 tous d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence des droits proprement dits que la loi \u00e9tablit, reconnait et garantit. Les premi\u00e8res no sont garanties positivement a personne, tel est l'usage des voies publiques : tu\u00e2t qu'elles subsistent, chacun a le droit d'en jouir, d'en tirer tout l'avantage que cet usage, conforme aux lois et aux r\u00e8glements, peut procurer. Leur abandon, leur suppression no peut donner lieu \u00e0 des r\u00e9clamations fond\u00e9es\nThe appellants have referred us to that class of cases, as Brown v. Gugy and Bell v. The Corporation of Quebec where it has been held that an action lies for a public nuisance at the instance of any private individual who has suffered special damages thereby. Not mere\n(1) S.

But these cases have clearly no application here.\nWe have also been referred to the class of cases in the Province of Quebec, where the rights of riparian proprietors on a navigable, but non-tidal, river have been discussed. These also are obviously quite distinguishable. On such rivers there are no beach lots belonging to the crown.\nThe cases also on non-navigable rivers, such as Miner v. Gilmour (1), are also distinguishable. On these rivers, the riparian owner is proprietor of the bed of the river ad filum aquce, subject to the restrictions imposed by the law on the use of these waters. Boswell v. Denis (2).\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal by which it was held that the appellants have no right of action should be affirmed.\nBut even if the appellants would have had their action at common law they cannot succeed, because under the statute their right to a compensation and of action has been taken away 1st because the only damages they claim are damages to their track and business, for which, under the statute, they are not en-titled to compensation and 2nd, because, even if they had a right to compensation, their only recourse under the statute is by arbitration and not by action.\nOn the first of these propositions I cite Lord Black-burn in Caledonian Ry. Co. v. Walker's trustees, (3).\nIt is not open for discussion that no action can be maintained for anything which is done under the authority of the legislature, though the act is one which, if unauthorized by the legislature, would be injurious and actionable. The remedy of the party who suffers the loss is confined to recovering such compensation as the legislature has thought fit to give him.\nAnd it must now be considered settled that or the construction of these access compensation is confined to damage arising from that\n(1) 12 Moo. P. C. 131. (2) 10 L. C. R. 294,\n(3) 7. App. Cas. 293. which would, if done without authority from the legislature, have given rise to a cause of action.\nAnd it must, I think, also be now considered as settled that the construction of these statutes is confined to giving compensation for an injury to land or an interest inland; that it is not enough to show that an action would have lain for what was done if unauthorized but it must also be shown that it would have lain in respect of an injury to the land or an interest in land.\nNow, that by their action the damages claimed by the appellants here are merely those to their trade and business is clear. Their declaration, after alleging their title to their property, and that they purchased it because of its advantageous situation for the purposes of their trade, the price paid being one thousand dollars as appears by the deed of sale fyled with their declaration, goes on to say that they have built thereon at a cost of $30,000 a large factory for the purposes of their trade, and that the railway company have since illegally built their road between their property and the river, so as to render their access to the river impossible. They then allege that in consequence of the said railway works :\u2014\nLes demandeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d'avoir acc\u00e8s de leur dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite rivi\u00e8re; quo la navigation sur celle-ci, vis-\u00e0-vis de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obstru\u00e9e et rendue impossible : quo lexploitation do la manufacture des demandeurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue beau. coup plus difficile et beaucoup plus dispendieuse, et quo tant pour los causes susdites quo pour d'autres causes connexes et en r\u00e9sultant los demandeurs ont souffert et continueront do souffrir des dommages et que les dommages d\u00e9j\u00e0 soufferts sont au montant de cinquante mille piastres, laquelle somme les d\u00e9fendeurs refusent do payer aux demandeurs bien quo d\u00fbment requis de ce faire, les d\u00e9fendeurs refusant aussi do faire disparaitre le dit quai et la dite obstruction dans la dite rivi\u00e8re St-Charles.\nAnd they pray for $50,000 damages.\nNot a word that their property has been injuriously affected, that it has decreased in value, in consequence of the works. Nothing but personal damage, damages for personal inconvenience and to their business which as they allege, up to the date of their declaration amounted to $50000 but which they will continue to suffer in the future. The sum claimed alone, coupled with these allegations, leaves no doubt as to the nature of their claim. For the proposition that for such damages no right to a compensation lies, and that the subject of compensation, where no part of the claimant's land has been taken, must not be of a personal character but must be damage or injury to the land itself, considered independently of any particular trade, I refer to the following additional cases : Caledonian Railway Co. v. Ogilvy (1); Reg. v. Metropolitan (2); Hammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand (3) : City of Glasgow Union Railway v. Hunter (4); Ricktt v. The Metropolitan (5); Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy (6).\nIn Reg. v. The Merropolitan Board of Works (7) compensation was refused, though the execution of the works prevented access to the river for the purpose of drawing water; and in Rex v. Bristol Dock Co. (8), though the river was dammed back by the execution of the works, and the water was thereby made less pure brewers who had been in the habit of using the water were refused compensation.\nI refer also to Rex v. London Dock Company (9) and Benjamin v. Storr (10).\nIn France, also, the same principle prevails\u2014In re Le Balle (11), held, that the damages caused to the claimant in the course of his business do not entitle him to an indemnity. To entitle him to an indemnity, the works must injure his property directly and materially.\nThe case of the Duke of Buccleuch v. The Metropolitan\n(1) 2 Macq. H. 1. Cas. 229. (6) L. R. 7 H.

Board of Works (1) is distinguishable on various grounds besides the difference between the English law and the French law on the subject - First, the case was determined on special clauses of imperial acts of a much wider import than the corresponding ones in the Quebcc railway act of 1880, or not to be found at all in the latter. The meaning of the word \"land \" itself, in the Thames Embankment Act under which the claim was there made is of a much wider import than that of the same word in the Quebec Act.\nSecondly, in that case, a part of the claimant's property had been expropriated, whilst here not an inch of the appellants' property has been taken or touched by the company. And the cases show what an important difference this constitutes.\nThirdly, the damages awarded to the claimant were for damages to his property, not for personal damages, or damages to any road.\nFourthly.\u2014The damages awarded for a severance of the claimant's property from the river had arisen from the construction of works necessary, exclusively I might perhaps say, under an Imperial Statuee relating to works on water fronts, and providing for compensation for damages resulting to the riparian owner from severance from the water.\nUpon these authorities the appellants are not, in my opinion entitled to compensation for the damages they claim in the present action.\nI now pass to my second proposition on this part of the case that is, even if the appellants were entitled to compensation their action does not lie, and their only remedy was by arbitration under the statute.\nThat this railway has been built under the statute is unquestionable. And it has been built under the statute as well for the 30 or 40 feet opposite the ap-(1) L. R. 5 H. L. 418. appellant\u2019s property, as for the rest of the 170 miles between Quebec and Montreal, even if for that part of beach it had not ab initio the express consent of its owner the crown.\nAs long as its owner allows the company to have and maintain their road there, the appellants cannot question their title. As regards anyone else but the crown, the company is lawfully in possession, and for that reason, no doubt, the Superior Court, though awarding some compensation to the appellants, dismissed that part of their conclusion by which they asked for the removal of the railroad from the premises.\nNow, that the only remedy under the statute is by arbitration admits of no doubt. In all the cases I have cited, this proposition is incessantly repeated. I refer also to Lloyd on Compensation, (1); also to two cases in the Privy Council from the Province of Quebec directly in point, Jones v. Stanstead (2) and Drummond v. Montreal (3), cases which clearly are binding upon this court, though, as would appear by Mr. Justice Bamsay's remarks in this case, not considered by the Court of Appeal, to be. binding upon them.\nTo resume, I say that in my opinion :\u2014\n1st. The appellants had no right to compensation at common law;\n2nd. That, even if they had such right at common law, they are not, under the statute, entitled to any compensation for the damage to their trade and business as claimed;\n3rd. That, even if they were entitled to such compensation, their action must fail, as their only recourse was by arbitration under the statute.\nGWYNNE J.\u20141 am of opinion that the appellants\n(1) P. 109 et seq. (2) L. R. 4 P. C. 98.\n(3) 1 App. Cas. 384. under the provisions of the railway act, in virtue of which alone the respondents could legally have constructed the work in question, are entitled to recover in some form of proceeding for such damage as their property situate on the banks of the river St-Charles can be shewn to have suffered, by reason of free access between the appellants' property and the navigable waters of the river being obstructed by the work in question.\nThe point has been so decided in the courses of the late province of Upper Canada at Toronto, in 1864, in Regina ex rel. Widder v. the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Co (1) and the principle upon which the appellants' claim for compensation rests appears to me to have been affirmed, incidentally only it is true, by the judgment of the Privy Council, in Bell v. The Corporation of Quebec (2); although, in that case, the court held that in point of fact the plaintiff's right had not been violated.\nIt has been contended that the plaintiffs' declaration in the present case is not framed as a claim for such damage but only for damage done to the plaintiffs trade and that it was only for damages for injury to plaintiffs' trade that judgment was given by the learned judge of the superior court by whom the case was tried I have been unable to see the foundation upon which this contention is based for the plaintiffs in their declaration expressly allege :\u2014\nQue dans le cours du printemps ou de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier les d\u00e9fendeurs, les Commissaires du Havre de Quebec, ont ill\u00e9galement permis au d\u00e9fendeurs la Compagnie do chemin de fer du Nord d'obstruer la dite reverie St. Charles, vis-\u00e0-vis la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 leur en rendre l'acc\u00e8s impossible.\nQue la dite Compagnie de chemin de fer du Nord profitant de la Permission a construit dans la dite rivi\u00e8re du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des demandeurs un quai haut d'environ quinze pieds qui ferme compl\u00e8tement aux demandeurs l'acc\u00e8s de la dite rivi\u00e8re.\n(1) 23 U. C. Q. B. 208, (2) 5 App. Cas. 98. Que par suite de la dite permission ainsi accord\u00e9e par les Commissaires du Havre de Qu\u00e9bec et de l'usage qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait comme susdit par la Compagnie du chemin du Nord, les demandeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d'avoir acc\u00e8s de leur dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la dite rivi\u00e8re; que la navigation sur celle-ci vis-\u00e0-vis de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obstru\u00e9e et rendue impossible.\nThen the learned judge of the Superior Court in pronouncing judgment uses language which, as it appears to me, very clearly shows that it is for damage to the plaintiffs' property by reason of such access being obstructed and not for injury to the plaintiffs' trade that he has given judgment in their favor. He says :\nConsid\u00e9rant que la dite d\u00e9fenderesse n'a pris pour son chemin aucune partie du terrain des demandeurs ni aucuns mat\u00e9riaux sur icelui mais que pour construire son dit chemin. de fer elle a \u00e9rig\u00e9 sur la gr\u00e8ve de la rivi\u00e8re St. Charles qui borne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs au nord, et qui \u00e0 cet endort est navigable un quai et un terrassement qui \u00f4tent \u00e0 la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ladite rivi\u00e8re et leur enl\u00e8vent une des voies de communication qu\u2019ils avaient auparavant.\nConsid\u00e9rant que la privation de cette voie fait subir \u00e0. la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des dits demandeurs une d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration et une diminution de valeur permanentes et pour lesquelles ils ont droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 qui d'apr\u00e8s la preuve parait se monter \u00e0 cinq mille cinq cents piastres, condamne la dite d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer aux dits demandeurs la dite somme.\nWhether the sum awarded be or not open to the imputation of being excessive it is, I think, clear from the above language that it was for the obstruction of free and uninterrupted access between the property and the navigable waters of the river, and injury and diminution in value thereby occasioned to the property that the damages were awarded and not for injury to plaintiffs' trade, and the learned judges notes which accompany his judgment are expanded largely to the same effect.\nThe defendants in the Superior Court appear to have placed their defense at the trial in argument, though not upon the record, upon the contention that the land upon which the structure complained of has been erected was the property of the commissioners of the Harbor of Quebec and that the defendants constructed their railway on such property by the authority of the said commissioners, although they seem to have failed in establishing the latter proposition. The learned judge in his notes accompanying his formal judgment says upon this point : \u2014\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse a invoqu\u00e9 les statuts constituant la commission du Havre comme donnant \u00e0 cette corporation le terrain sur lequel la voie est construite, et enlevant, par l\u00e0 aux demandeurs le droit do se plaindre d'ouvrages que la commission d'aspes leurs all\u00e9gations aurait autoris\u00e9s. La Commission du Havre n'exerce qu'\u00e0 titre de fid\u00e9icommis, les pouvoirs que lui a d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s le Parlement relativement aux gr\u00e8ves du St. Laurent et des rivi\u00e8res navigables comprises dans ses attributions; elle no peut pas plus y autoriser tacitement des constructions que ne le pourrait, sans un statut le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame. De plus elle no peut sur le lit ou los rives des rivi\u00e8res sous son contr\u00f4le, rien permettre qui nuise \u00e0 la navigation, \u00e0 moins que celle-ci n'y trouve plus qu'une compensation et quo les travaux autoris\u00e9s n'aient pour objet de Plaider et de la faciliter, ce qui est loin d'\u00eatre le but du terrassement que la d\u00e9fenderesse a construit sur la rive entre le lit de la rivi\u00e8re et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs\nMais supposant m\u00eame que la commission du Havre e\u00fbt eu le pouvoir do permettre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse do mettre sur la rive do la rivi\u00e8re St Charles \u00e0 laquelle touche Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs, le terrassement pour y passer sa voie ferr\u00e9e \u00e9lie ne l'aurait pu toutefois qu'\u00e0 la condition que les autorit\u00e9s provinciales eussent elle-m\u00eame autoris\u00e9 cette construction; or ces derni\u00e8res n'ont pas donn\u00e9 d'austro autorisation quo celle que comporte \" l'acte refondu des chemins do fer de Qu\u00e9bec, 1880,\" qui \u00e0 la section et aux sous-sections suscit\u00e9es, met \u00e0 l'exercice des droits qu'il conf\u00e8re la condition di indemniser les propri\u00e9taires des terrains qui en souffriraient des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations ou des dommages. La sec. 9 No. 11, n'oblige pas seulement los compagnies \u00e0 payer les terrains des particuliers et les mat\u00e9riaux quo la loi los autorise do s'approprier, mais aussi les dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres terrains par l'exercise do quelqu'un des pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux chemins de for. La d\u00e9fenderesse n'a ni invoqu\u00e9 ni \u00e9\u00e9tabli le consentement du Lieutenant Gouverneur en Conseil requis parle statut pour l'occupation par elle d'une partie du rivage pour ses terrassements; mais l\u00e0 n'est pas la question principale en cette cause. Car, si les demandeurs avaient un droit sp\u00e9cial d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re, ce consentement no leur \u00f4terait pas celui d'obtenir une indemnit\u00e9; et si la construction do ia jet\u00e9e quo la d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9rig\u00e9e entre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs et la rivi\u00e8re ne lee a priv\u00e9 de l'exercise d'aucun droit appartenant \u00e0 leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ils sont sans motifs de plaintes et sans recours en indemnit\u00e9.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs bornai \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re qui y donnait une voie naturelle de communication. Ils y avaient par cons\u00e9quent un droit d'acc\u00e8s, une esp\u00e8ce de servitude analogie \u00e0 celle de tout propri\u00e9taire riverain sur la vole publique. C'\u00e9tait-l\u00e0 pour les propri\u00e9taires un droit sp\u00e9cial, particulier et distinct de celui qu'ont tous les citoyens dans les rivi\u00e8res navigables. En les en privant par ses constructions, la d\u00e9fenderesse a diminu\u00e9 la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des demandeurs. Elle leur doit, par cons\u00e9quent, compensation pour la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration qu'elle a ainsi fait subir a leur terrain.\nThe learned judge having thus with great clearness pointed out that the statute gave to the defendants no authority to erect the structure complained of, unless upon the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council first obtained, which consent, as he says, was never invoked or established and that the structure was therefore erected without any authority I cannot I confess understand how the first consid\u00e9rant in the formal judgment came to be inserted, namely :\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que la loi permettait \u00e0 Ia compagnie du chemin de fer du Nord un des d\u00e9fendeurs en cette cause, de construire sa vole ferr\u00e9e sur la gr\u00e8ve de la rivi\u00e8re Saint Charles dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nIf this be not a misprint in the printed case brought before us it is clearly shown by the notes of the learned judge that the law authorized no such thing; and it is moreover to be observed that nothing in the rest of the adjudication in the case is predicated upon any-thing stated in this consid\u00e9rant as it is in the printed case.\nThe circumstances of the present case and of Regina ex rel. Widder v. The Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. and the acts upon which the question in both cases turned, and the reasoning of the learned judges in both cases are very similar.\nDraper C.J. delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in that case referring to the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act of Canada, which subjected railway companies to the obligation of giving com pensation to owners of land taken, or injuriously affected. by the construction of the railway, says :\u2014\nBy the 9th section of that act, sub-sec. 3, any railway company with the consent of the Governor in Council may among other things, take and appropriate for the use of their railway and works so much of the public beach or of the land covered with the waters of any lake, river, stream or canal, or of their respective beds. as is necessary for making, completing, and raising their said railway and works.\nBy the 37 section of the defendant's act of incorporation they are authorized to purchase and, the Canada Company are authorized to sell to them the harbor of Goderich and so much of the islands on the river Maitland and the shore adjoining that river as may be agreed between them.\nIn 1835 the Crown leased to the Canada Company for a term of 21 years a space along the shore of Lake Huron extending north and south a distance of a mile and five hundred yards more or less out into deep water, and along the water's edge of the lake to the river Maitland and up that river on one side nearly two miles to a certain point, and then across the river and thence down on the other side saving and excepting to the Crown the free use of the land and premises and of any wharf, &c., that might be erected thereon, and on condition that the lassees within five years build a wharf and pier and remove a certain portion of the bar at the entrance of the river and lake there for the free navigation of vessels of seventy tons burthen,\nThe statute of Upper Canada, 7 W. 4 c. 50 authorised the Canada company to improve the harbor of Goderich and to levy tolls, with a proviso for the purchase thereof by the province upon certain conditions. After a purchase made by the defendants under the 37th sec. of their act of incorporation it was by the same section made lawful for them to straighten and improve the river Maitland and deepen cleanse and improve and alter the navigation thereof &c., &c , and to construct basins, docks, piers, wharfs, warehouses, &c., &c., and also appropriate the mud and shore of the river Maitland and the bed and soil thereof, and to do all such other acts as they might deem necessary or proper for improving Goderich Harbor and the navigation of the river, and the bed and shores thereof and the land adjacent thereto.\nOn the 14th of June, 1859, the Canada Company assigned to the defendants their rights, powers and privileges under their lease.\nThe statute 23 Vic. ch. 2. sec. 35 is also to be noted : \"Whereas doubts have been entertained as to the power vested in the Crown to dispose of and grant water lots in the harbors, rivers and other navigable waters in Upper Canada and it is desirable to set at rest any question which might arise in reference thereto, it is declared and enacted that it has been heretofore and that it shall be hereafter lawful for the governor in Council to authorize sales or appropriations of such water lots under such conditions as it has been or may be deemed necessary to impose.\"\nIt appears to us that we should treat the powers given by the legislature and the rights thereunder for the purposes of the railway, as distinct from the powers granted for the purpose of the navigation of the river Maitland and the use of the Goderich harbor, and that an act done which expressly comes within the former class of powers leaves the rights of third parties as to compensation just where they were before the latter powers were conferred or acquired. The two sets of powers are for distinct purposes and it is abundantly clear to us that the powers to improve the navigation of the river do not and were not intended to enable the possessor of them to cover the bed of the river with railway works, or to interfere with or prevent free access to the river and harbor for the purposes of navigation. The case of the Queen v. Betts (1) though not similar in many respects tends in others to confirm the opinion that the powers conferred for the improvement of the navigation are to be exercised for that purpose solely and not as auxiliary to and extending those conferred on the defendants by their charter as a Railway Company. Adopting this conclusion it will be obvious that the defendants cannot uphold their refusal to submit to arbitration the prosecutors claim for compensation for the injuriously affecting his land by the construction of the railway on the ground of the rights they have derived from the Canada Company.\nAnd upon the authority of Chamberlain v. The West London Sr Crystal Palace Railway Co. (2), and an Irish case of The Queen ex rel. Jowan v. Rynd (3), the court granted a peremptory mandamus commanding the defendants to take the necessary proceedings to enable an arbitration to be entered into under the Railway Act, to indemnify the applicant for the injury done to his property although no land was taken from him.\nThis case was decided in 1864; since then the cases of Beckett v. midland Railway Co. (4) and Metropolitan Board of. Works v. McCarthy (5) have been decided. Upon the authority of these cases it was decided in\n16 Q. B. 1022. (3) 9 L. T. N. S. 27.\n2 B. & S. 605. (4) L. R. 3 C. P. 82.\nL. R. 7. H. L. 243\n[Page 705].\nYeomans v. The County of Wellington (1) that a county councll in Ontario could, not under a statute containing a similar clause of indemnity in respect of land injuriously affected raise one of their own roads, so as to obstruct the access between land adjoining the road and the road without rendering compensation to the owner of the land, and since the judgment of the House of Lords in the Caledonian Railway Jo, v. Walker's Trustees (2), in which all the previous cases have been reviewed, it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that the obstruction of access between a public highway and adjoining land, whether such highway be on dry land or on navigable waters, is an infringement of a right attached to land for which an action lies at the suit of the owner of the land access with which is so obstructed unless the obstruction can be justified, and that if the justification be that the work causing the obstruction was done under the authority of a statute containing a clause of indemnity similar to that in the statute now under consideration, although the owner of the land is thereby deprived of his remedy by action at common law, he is entitled to compensation to be ascertained by arbitration under the statute.\nNow between Regina v. The Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. and the present case, the only difference is in the form of the proceeding. In that case the work complained of as injuriously affecting Mr. Widder's land was treated by him as having been done by the defendants under the authority of the acts authorizing the construction of their railway, and upon that assumption he applied to the court for and obtained a mandamus nisi, calling upon the railway to initiate the proceedings necessary under the statute to have compensation awarded to him by an arbitration entered\n(1) 43 U.C.Q.B.522; 4 Ont. App.301. (2) 7 App.Cas.259. into in accordance with the provisions of the statute, and it was upon the return to that mandamus that the question arose. The defendants did not in that return. raise any question as to the propriety of the mode of procedure adopted by Mr. \"Widder\u2014they did not con- tend that his remedy, if any he had, was by action and not by arbitration; that is to say, they did not set up that they were not acting under their statutory powers at all in the construction of the work complained of but they insisted that they had power under their act to erect the construction without giving any indemnity to the applicant because the work was not constructed upon any land of the applicant, but upon land of which, as the defendants contended, they were themselves possessed by title derived from the crown; namely, the bed of the river Maitland in the navigable waters of the harbor of Goderich.\nIn the present case, on the contrary, the substance of the plaintiffs' claim in their action is that the defend-ants have illegally constructed a work on the navigable waters of the river St. Charles in front of the property which cuts off all access between their property and the navigable waters of the river. If this allegation be true the cases conclusively decide that the charge involves am infringement of a right of privilege incident to land which is an actionable wrong. The defend-ants if the work complained of was erected by them in point of fact could not exempt themselves from liability to the plaintiffs for such damages as they could establish upon a declaration containing such a cause of action otherwise than by a special plea of justification shewing the construction of the work not to have been illegal, and under the circumstances appearing in the ease such a plea to constitute a good defense must have stated all the facts necessary to shew that under the provisions of the statute under consideration the defendants had authority to erect the structure which they have erected in the bed of the river St Charles. In case such a plea should be sustained in evidence the , effect would be to defeat the present action it is true but to give to the plaintiffs a remedy by arbitration which could have been enforced as in Regina v. the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Company by mandamus But the defendants have pleaded no such plea\u2014they have contented themselves with pleading simply the general issue\u2014they offer no defence, but a simple denial of the facts alleged in the declaration which in the evidence were not disputed the defendants' defence on the trial being simply that the land on which the work was erected by the defendants not being the land of the plaintiffs, no actionable injury had been done to them. The Court of Appeal in the Province of Quebec have adopted this view and on appeal from the judgment of that court the defendants' contention before us was that if the plaintiffs are en-titled to any compensation upon the facts as alleged and proved such compensation cannot be recovered in an action like the present but can be recovered only by proceedings in arbitration under the statute, a defence not set up by plea upon the record, and which if it had been the defendants failed to establish as has been pointed out in the notes of the learned judge of the Superior Court and which has never been questioned by the defendants, even if without a plea it could have been, namely that they never either invoked or established the consent in Council of the Lieutenant Governor to their building their railway on the bed of the river St-Charles with-out which consent first obtained they could not invoke the statute as a protection or justification for their conduct; the defendants were therefore placed in the position of being mere wrong doers, having no justification for doing the act causing the injury to the plaintiffs of which they have complained, and which act not having been justified as, and shewn to be, legal is actionable. I cannot see upon what principle the defendants should now be heard to insist that the plaintiffs' remedy is not by action but by arbitration. It was the duty of the defendants if they relied upon their statutory powers as authorising the construction of the work complained of to have initiated the proceedings for an arbitration. Not having justified under the statute they were liable as wrong doers and subject to an action for damages, and they cannot now be permitted to deprive the plaintiffs of the benefit of proceedings which the defendants' own neglect to brins themselves within the protection of their statute has occasioned, and at this late stage to appeal to their liability in arbitration as relieving them from liability in this action while they have not taken or so far as appears do not propose to take, any proceedings to bring about such arbitration. The courses below have never had presented to them any issue upon the point now urged that proceedings by arbitration and not by action constitute the plaintiffs' sole remedy. The judgment appealed from proceeds upon no such question. The Court of Appeals have decided that as the defendants have not constructed the work complained of on the plaintiffs' land but on the bed of a navigable river the plaintiffs are not injured and have no ground of complaint any more than all other Her Majestyss subjects\u2014and that therefore their action should be dismissed. This judgment being erroneous the appeal should be allowed with costs and as no complaint has been made that the amount allowed to the plaintiffs by the judgment of the superior court is excessive (assuming the amount to have been assessed upon sound principles) as it appears, to have been, that the judgment should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

Whitney and Morton on or about the seventh day of July, eighteen hundred and seventy-five; a sum of seven hundred and twenty dollars and seventy censes paid to him also in his said capacity by the same parties; by one F. H. Lalonde the sum of two hundred and forty-nine dollars and twenty-five cents : by one Francis Villeneuve fifty-four dollars and five cents; by Antoine Mercier two hundred and fifty six dollars and forty cents; by one Robertson Burch one hundred and fifty one dollars and eighty-two censes.\nThat the said defendant has never put in the hands of the said plaintiff or of his agent, legally qualified to demand the same, the correspondence, deeds, vouchers and other records belonging to the said plaintiff in his said capacity, and entered into, made and recorded in the boos kept by him as received from the debtors of the said estate to enable the said plaintiff to properly audit the accounts of the said defendant.\nThat it is only since the said defendant has ceased to act as the said plaintiff's said agent under the said power of attorney, and since other persons have become in a measure acquainted with the various sums had and received by the said defendant in his said capacity that the said plaintiff has become- aware or has held Easton to believe that the various accounts rendered heretofore by the said defendant of his said gestion were incorrect, incomplete and misleading.\nThat the plaintiff hath frequently requested the said defendant. to revise his said accounts and to render him a new. complete and truthful account of his said trust, but the said defendant hath failed so to do and now doth refuse the same.\nThat the plaintiff is entitled to have a full account of the gestion of the said defendant in his said capacity, with the vouches in support thereof, and the possession of all letters, agreements, contracts, deeds accounts and other documents relative to the same rendered under oath and in due course of law.\nWherefore the said plaintiff, in his said capacity, prays that any and all pretended accounts rendered by defendant to plaintiff be declared null and void and of no effect that the said defendant be ordered to render an account, under oath, of his gestion from the date whereon he entered upon the said duties to wit from and after the twenty-sixth day of January, eighteen hundred and sixty-four in due form of law and to submit therewith for inspection and examination all correspondence had by him with the various debtors of the estate, as well as all accounts kept by him during the said period in connection with the said estate, and all vouchers, documents. contracts, agreements or deeds in his possession respecting the same and that after such accounts have been rendered and inspection allowed, the plaintiff be allowed a reasonable time to examine the same ' and to accept or contest the same as may be found right and proper; the whole within such delay as may be ordered by this court, unless defendant prefer to pay plaintiff the sum of ten thousand dollars; the whole with costs against the said defendant, including costs of exhibits should he contest the said plaintiff's demande, the said plaintiff reserving to himself his right to take such further and other conclusions in the premises as to law justice and the practice of this court appertain, even again the whole with costs.\nThe respondent pleaded to the action admitting that he had acted as agent for a number of years but alleged that he had always rendered accounts of moneys received by him from time to time, which accounts were verified and accepted by the appellant That about five years previous to the institution of this action, the respondent gave up the agency and retired from business that the accounts rendered by him to appellant had been by appellant submitted to a professional accountant in London, who examined and verified the same, and that the appellant by a letter of the 5th February, 1879, declared his satisfaction with all said accounts; that said respondent having retired from business, and having no further occasion for his books and documents (the accumulation of years) destroyed the most of them, and that it was impossible for him to render anew to the appellant any account of his administration of the agency, owing to the absence of said books, documents, and papers; that on production of all accounts by respondent rendered to appellant he was willing to re-examine the same and to give all information in connection therewith; that although the respondent had requested the said accounts from appellant, they have not been produced; that with reference to the items specially referred to in appellants declaration, it was impossible for him (respondent to say whether he had received the said moneys in the absence of said accounts but if he had received the same, they were remitted by him to the appellant; that under the circumstances the respondent was not legally bound to render any such account as called for by the appellants declaration : that the appellant's action was frivolous and vexatious.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court was in favor of the plaintiff The judgment of Court of Queen's Bench is as follows :\u2014\nConsidering that the respondent, who has received and accepted the accounts to the number of fifty-five, which the appellant has rendered of his administration of the property of the respondent from the time he was appointed his agent and attorney in 1865, till the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, when he ceased to be such agent and attorney, and that, without any objection as to the form in which the said accounts were rendered has no right to ask, as he has done by his declaration, that the said accounts be declared null and set aside, and that the appel- lant be ordered en justice to render another and complete account of the whose of his administration.\nAnd considering that the respondent, upon his allegation that he has discovered errors and omissions in the said accounts, is only entitled to demand that such errs and omissions, which he may establish by sufficient evidence, be corrected and the accounts reformed as regards such errors and omissions, and that the appellant be condemned to pay such sums of money as may be found due by him to the respondent after the correction and reformation of such accounts.\nThe court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the respondent's action, reserving however to respondent his recourse against appellant for all sums not accounted for and for all balances due after reformation of accounts.\nFleming Q C. and Nicolls for the appellant referred to Troplong ([2]);

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This being rather matter of procedure than otherwise in view of the plaintiffs letter to the defendant deed 5th February, 1879, in which he says :--\nI have recently had a thorough audit of the accounts of my late fathers estate and I am glad to say they come out very satisfactorily.\nThe audit has been by an official accountant, and therefore has been a complete scrutiny. In going over the voluminous accounts from your side it has been satisfactory to us to find them on the whole so correct : there is. however, an error in the account as rendered by you in 1871, commencing in February and ending in May of same year : if you will refer to the entry under date of the 29th May, '71, on the credit side you will observe that you take credit for remittance of $3,989.61 in bill of exchange for \u00a3560 6s. 9d, whereas $3,989.61 presents at 10 per cent. premium of exchange. \u00a3813 5s. 7d.;\u2014will you look into this and explain.\nYours faithfully,\nROBT. GILLESPEE.\nR. H. Stephens, Esq , Montreal.\nit appears to me that the decision of the Court of Appeal is much more consistent with the justice of the case, and the dealings of the parties, in reference to the rendering and settlement of accounts from time to time by the parties than the judgment of the court of first instance, which :\u2014\nCondamn\u00e9e le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 rendre compte au demandeur de sa gestion et administration depuis le ving-six de janvier mul huib cent soixante et quatre jusqu'au premier dejuillet mul huit cent quatre vingt-un, sous serment, avec pi\u00e8ces justificatives \u00e0 l'appui et \u00e0 remettre au demandeur tous contrats, actes, comptes, livres de comptes, correspondances et autres documents concernant la die gestion et administration qu'il a ou peut avoir en sa possession, sous un moss de Ia signification qui lui sera faite du pr\u00e9sent judgment \u00e0 moins que le d\u00e9fendeur n'aime mieux payer au demandeur la somme de dix mule piastres, ce qu'il sera tenu d'opter dans le dit d\u00e9lai, le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre le d\u00e9fendeur qui a contest\u00e9 la dite action desquels d\u00e9pens distraction est accord\u00e9e aux avocats du demandeur, M\u00e8tres. Church, Chapleau, Hall & Atwater, avocats du demandeur \u00e9s qualit\u00e9.\nThe judgment and reservation of the Appeal Court gives to the plaintiff, in my opinion, all he is entitled to ask for and therefore I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER JJ. concurred in the judgment of Taschereau J. in dismissing the appeal.\nHENRY J.I am of the same opinion. The appellants by the accounts rendered to him from time to time got all the information it was ever intended should be given by an agent to his principal. The accounts rendered are alleged to contain one or two errors. He (the appellant) knew what the errors were, and al-though he might have an action to recover the money which such errors show him to be entitled to he has no right to force the respondent to give another account. I think therefore the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. By the judgment appealed from it is held that if a mandator and a mandatary, laboring under no legal disability, come to an amicable settlement about the rendering of account due by the mandatary, without vouchers or any formality what-so ever, such a rendering of account is perfectly legal, and that if, subsequently, the mandator discovers any error or omissions in this account, his recourse against his mandatary is by an action en redressement de compte, and not by an action asking another complete account. The cases cited by the respondent establish clearly that the jurisprudence in Quebec is in that sense Art 21 ch. 29 of the ordonnance of 1667 has always been extended to comptes rendus \u00e0 lamiabie. In France also the course refuse in such a case the action to account; re Dephelines in the Orleans Court ([9]); re Pellain, Court of Cassation ([10]). In this last case it was held that even for an account rendered verbally it was the action en redressement only that the mandator should have recourse to. I refer also to 2 Boitard Proc. Civ. page 164 and the cases there cited. Title 29 of the Ordonn. of 1667 evidently bears only on accounts rendered in justice, with the exception of art. 23 which expressly enacts that accounts may be rendered \u00e0 l'amiable. Stricter rules are followed by the course when the account is between a tutor and his pupil which is not the case here.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Church, Chapleau, Hall & Nicolls.\nSolicitors for respondent : Kerr, Carter & Goldstein.\n[1] M.L.R.3 Q.B.167.\n[2] Vol. 18 p. 234. 2 p. 423.\n[3] 7 L.

The action in each case was on a bond given by the said Murray as principal, and the respective defendants as sureties, such bond containing the following condition:\u2014\n\u201cNow the condition of the above written bond or obligation is such that if I, the said Charles Robert Murray, do and shall from time to time, and at all times hereafter, so long as I shall continue in the service or employ of the said Exchange Bank of Canada (hereinafter called the bank) in the capacity aforesaid, or in any other capacity at the said branch or agency, or at any other branch or agency of the bank, or at the chief seat of business of the bank, honorably, diligently and faithfully demean and conduct myself in such service or employ, and use my utmost endeavors for the benefit and advantage of the bank, and willingly obey all the lawful commands of the bank touching my duties therein, and shall in all instances, as well whilst in the service or employ of the bank, as after 1 shall be discharged therefrom, retain and keep secret, except from the President and Directors of the bank and such officers and other employees thereof as shall be entitled to the knowledge, all such transactions and matters relative to the affairs of business of the bank as in the course of such service or employ shall be entrusted to me, or shall either directly or indirectly come to my knowledge; and shall also duly, truly and regularly render and deliver to the bank or to such person or persons as the bank shall from time to time appoint for that purpose, a just, true and faithful account in writing of all such moneys, securities for money, bills, notes, bonds, deeds, writings, books, securities, goods, chattels, effects, matters and things whatsoever, as have, or shall from time to time come to my hands, custody or charge of or belonging to the bank or to the correspondents or depositors thereof or therein, or to any other person or persons whomsoever wherewith the bank shall or may be chargeable.\u201d\nThe bond also contained a covenant by the obligors to make good all losses occasioned by the misconduct of the said Murray, and provision for ascertaining the amount of any such loss by means of an account taken from the books of the bank. It was also agreed that such account should bear interest from the time it was delivered.\nThe cashier having absconded the bank claimed that he had appropriated their funds to the extent of some $30,000 and brought these actions to recover from the sureties the amounts of the penalties of their respective bonds, namely, $5,000 dollars each.\nThe defence set up in these actions was that the contract was made with the bank in the belief that Murray, the cashier, would only be employed in ordinary and legitimate banking business, and that he was not so employed but was employed in speculating in, and buying and selling, on margin and otherwise, large amounts of the stock of the bank and other stock, in the course of which improper business his defalcations occurred, and that the sureties were relieved from the obligations of their bonds by reason of the facilities for misconducting himself thus afforded by the bank to Murray.\nThe evidence showed that the bank had become possessed of a quantity of Montreal Telegraph stock on the security of which advances had been made. To avoid loss on this stock the usual means of affecting the market were employed, and an account was opened in the books of the bank called the \u201cC.R. Murray trust account\u201d in which these stock transactions were entered. Murray drew cheques upon this account some of which he deposited to the credit of his private account and afterwards withdrew for his private speculations. And it was by this method of dealing with the trust account that nearly all his defalcations occurred.\nOn the trial before Ferguson J. judgment was given in each action in favor of the bank for the full amount of the penalty and interest on the account delivered according to the agreement in the bond. The Court of Appeal varied the judgment by deducting the amount of such interest, holding that no more than the penalty of the bonds could be recovered. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. and Malone for the appellants cited following authorities: Phillips v. Foxall[3]; Watts v. Shuttleworth[4]; Mansfield Union v. Wright[5]; Sanderson v. Aston[6]; Pearce v. Foster[7]; The Queen v. Pringle[8]; Morse on Banking[9]; Corporation of Adjala v. McElroy[10].\nBain Q.C. for the respondents referred to Jones v. Imperial Bank of Canada[11]; Thomson on Liability of Officers of Corporations[12]; Morse on Banking[13]; De Colyar on Guarantees[14].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The breach of duty complained of has no connection with the dealing of the bank with the stocks taken in payment of debts with a view to saving themselves from loss, but the breach of duty complained of is based upon the alleged misapplication of the money of the bank placed in charge, and under the control, of Murray the cashier.\nI think there is clear proof, in this case, that Murray drew cheques for his private purposes and thereby appropriated the funds of the bank to his own use to an amount greater than the penalties of the two bonds, and such appropriation was in no way authorized or sanctioned by the directors. I therefore agree with the learned Chief Justice, that the defaults of the cashier are sufficiently proved, and that no legal grounds have been shown to exonerate the sureties; and therefore the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court below.\nFOURNIE.R J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I entertained some doubts on the argument, and still have doubt on the matter, but under all the circumstances of the case I am inclined to agree with the rest of the court that the sureties are not relieved from liability and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is unnecessary for us to express an opinion whether or not, assuming that the evidence of Mr. Murray could be implicitly relied upon, his sureties would be released from all liability under their bonds, for I entirely concur in the opinion of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that little weight can be attached to that evidence, and apart from it there can be no doubt of the liability of the sureties. If Mr. Murray\u2019s statements are indeed true, it is unfortunate for himself and for his sureties that he should not have procured at least some evidence corroborative of his own evidence of the irregular and in some res- pects illegal transactions which he accuses himself as having been engaged in at the instance of the directors of the bank whose trusted cashier he was, so as to bring home against the instigators of these transactions a conviction of the truth of the charges which, after having deserted his post and absconded from the country, he now makes against them.\nAs to the point raised by the defendant Barnes that the death of his testator terminated his contract of suretyship it is also unnecessary to express an opinion for two reasons, namely, 1st. No such point is raised upon the pleadings, on the contrary, in the only answer of the defendant Barnes which is in the case laid before us he speaks of himself as the person who and not his testator had become Murray\u2019s security, and\n2nd. Because by the evidence of the inspector (which is not disputed) it appears that Mr. Murray at the time of George Barnes\u2019s death which now appears to have been on the 30th June, 1877, was a defaulter to an amount in excess of the amount recoverable under the bond; for these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeals in both cases should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Martin & Malone.\nSolicitors for respondents: Bain, Laidlaw & Co.\n[1] 13 Ont.

B had been authorized by her husband to acceptor transfer said policy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada, appeal side ([1]) affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, which dismissed appellant's action.\nThe Company respondent, on the 27th September 1876 issued a policy on the life of William A Charlebois, of Montreal, for the sum of $3,000, payable to his executors, administrators or assigns ninety days after proof of his death.\nOn the 27th of October, 1876, Charlebois, for value, assigned the policy to one Mrs. Lefebvre, and she on the 9th of September, 1882, assigned it for value to plaintiff who was the holder of it on the 17th of September 1882, when Charlebois died.\nIn an action on the policy, the appellant's declaration set up that Charlebois' interest in the said policy was on the 27th October, 1876, transferred \" to Dame \" Marie Eliza Helmina Belle wife of Charles Hamilton \" Lefebvre, of Montreal, aforesaid, who became thereby \" the legal holder and owner thereof; that afterwards \" to wit, on the 9th day of September, 1882, said Dame \" Marie Eliza Helmina Belle by the ministration of her \" duly authorized agent and attorney, James Baxter of \" the city and district of Montreal aforesaid, broker, \" duly assigned and transferred all her right, title and \" interest in said policy for value received to said \" plaintiff, who became thereby the legal holder and \" owner thereof, the whole as appears from copies \" of said transfers, duly fyled. That the said transfers \" above mentioned were duly signified and notified to \" the company, defendants, who duly accepted the \" same previous to the 17th September, 1882, at the \" city of Montreal.\"\nThe defendants answered this action, by two pleas the first in effect denying the plaintiff's title averring that the assignment and transfer of Dame Belle's rights in said policy wore null and void; that Barter had no right nor authority whatsoever to make such assignment and transfer; that the plaintiff had not become in consequence of the said alleged transfer and assignment the legal holder and owner of the policy; that the company were never notified of this transfer, and that any assignment of the policy was not binding on the company; that the plaintiff was a mere pr\u00eate-nom of Baxter and had no interest in the policy and assignment; and concluding with a general denial.\nThe second plea was directed specially to the terms and conditions of the policy and was to the effect that the policy was null on account of false representations as to his sober habits made by Charlebois in his application therefore and further on account of his violation of the terms and conditions of the application and of the policy by increasing the risk on his life by the excessive use of spirituous intoxicating liquors.\nThe pleas were met by general answers.\nWith the exception of that part of the second plea which sets up false representations in the application as to the insured's sober habits at the time of making the application, both these pleas were maintained by the judgment of the Hon. Mr. Justice Mathieu in the Superior Court, and the action of plaintiff was dismissed accordingly, which judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The opinions delivered in the Court of Queen's Bench relate entirely to the defense made by the second plea. The evidence as to a change of his habits was that during the last year of his life the insured took to drink heavily but medical opinion was divided as to the cause of death two doctors holding that the insured died of dropsy produced by heart disease, and that intemperate habits did not increase the risk to an appreciable degree, while a third doctor, his regular medical attendant stated that he died of disease of the liver and that his intemperate habits materially increased the risk. Mac Laren for the appellant.\u2014A policy is a negotiable commercial instrument under the law of Lower Canada. and its assignees are not bound by collateral contracts. See Art. 2482, C.C. Daniels on Negotiable Instruments sec. 1. Arts. 2490-1 C. C. contain the law as to what are warranties and what conditions And see Crawley on Life Insurance ([2]).\nCreighton for the respondents.\u2014There was no authority in Dame Lefebvre to take an assignment of the policy or to assign it afterwards. Art. 183, CO. See Crevier v. Rocheleau ([3]).\nThe demand of separation on the record is not certified. If she had a right to the policy she forfeited it and lost it by the terms of this judgment. Cherrier v. Bender ([4]) is relied on by the other side, but there is a case of L' Heureux v. Boivin ([5]) decided by Chief Justice Meredith overruling it.\nThe following cases were also cited. Kence v. Mutual Life insuaance Co. ([6]); Towle v. National Guardian Assurance Society ([7]); Kimball v. \u00c6tna Insuranee Co. ([8]).\nMacLaren in reply referred to Art. 144 C C May on Insurance p.p. 182\u20143.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J. The application for insurance headed \" The questions to be answered by the party whose life is proposed for insurance and which \" formed the basis of the contract \" contained inter alia; \" Q. Are your habits sober and temperate?\" \"A. Yes.\" and at the end;\nIt is hereby agreed that this application shall form the basis of the contract of insurance herein applied for. and that the same shall form part of said contract as fully as if therein recited and that all answers and declarations contained in this application are and shall be taken to be strict warranties, and that should the applicant become as to habits so far different from the condition in which he is now represented to be as to increase the risk on the life insured, or neglect to pay the premium on or before the day it becomes due, the policy shall become null and void, and all payments made there on shall be forfeited. The contract of insurance here applied for. shall be completed only by the delivery of the policy and payment of the premium. It is also agreed and warranted that this application has been made, prepared and written by the applicant or by his own proper agent, and that the assurer is not to be taken to be responsible for the preparation, or for anything contained therein or omitted there from, and any untrue answers or representations or suppressions of any fact, shall void the contract.\nAnd in the policy itself it is provided\nThis policy is issued, and accepted by the assured, upon the following express conditions and agreements.\nFirst. If the said William A. Charlebois shall at any time during the continuance of this policy, without the consent of the said company previously obtained in writing, visit any part of the Western Hemisphere lying between the tropics, or of the Eastern Hemisphere between the 36th parallel north and the Tropic of Capricorn, or engage in the manufacture or transportation of gunpowder or fireworks, or in submarine operations, or in any military or naval service whatsoever, [the militia not in actual service excepted] or in case he shall die by the hands of justice; or in, or in consequence of a duel, or of the violation of the law of these States, or of the United States, or of any other country, which he may be permitted under this policy to visit, or reside in, or, if any of the declarations or statements made in the application of this policy, upon the faith of which this policy is issued, shall be found in any respect untrue, or in case any note given for the cash part of premium on this policy shall not be paid at maturity, or in case the interest is not paid annually in advance, or any notes which may be given for any portion of the premiums on this policy, then, and in such case this policy shall be null and void.\nThe policy and declaration are one and must be read together and so as to make one consistent whole and so reading them it is impossible, in my opinion, to escape the conclusion that should the applicant become as to habits so far different from the condition in which he was then represented to be as to increase the risk of the life insured or neglect to pay the premium on or before the day it became due, the policy therefore became null and. void, and all payments made thereon forfeited. Mr. Crawley on Life Insurance p. 35 thus states the law.\nThe first step towards effecting an insurance is for the person intending to effect it to fill in a form of proposal containing a searching number of questions as to his age, health, mode of life and habits, and to sign a declaration varying in form in the deferent companies, but generally to the effect that the answers are true, and that the declaration shall be the basis of the contract, and that any untrue statement, omission, or suppression shall avoid i t; and frequently providing in addition that the premiums paid shall in such a case be forfeited to the company.\nThe declaration is generally incorporated, in the policy by reference but whether this is so or not, when in this form it must be construed with the policy, and together they form the contract; Fowkes V Manchester, &c., Co. (1 ).\nAnd at p. 134 :\u2014\nAs we have seen, the almost universal practice of insurance companies is to require intending insurers to sign a declaration containing detailed answers to an elaborate series of searching questions, and stating that the declaration shall form the basis of the contract and is true, and that any untrue statements, omissions or suppressions shall avoid the policy :and in such cases the declaration is expressly or impliedly incorporated with the policy, and they must be construed together and together form the contract; Fowkes v. Manchester &c. Co, ([9]); and where this is the case truth becomes a condition precedent to liability, and any untrue representation whether material or not avoids the policy, for it is part of the contract that if a particular statement ss untrue the contract is at an end; Anderson v. Fitzgerald ([10]).\nAnd May on Insurance ([11]).\nWarranties are distinguished into two kinds; affirmative, or those which allege the existence at the time of. insurance of a particular fact, and avoid the contract if the allegation be untrue; and promissory, or those which require that something shall be done or omitted after the insurance takes effect and during its continuance, and avoid the contract if the thing to be done or. omitted be not done or omitted according to the terms of the warranty.\nSo that as regards this case it is resolved into a question of fact namely, the assured having represented that his habits were sober and temperate did he become as to habits so far different from the condition he then represented himself to be, as to increase the risk to his life? The court of first instance distinctly finds that such was the case; that habits of intemperance which he acquired in the immoderate use of intoxicating drinks was different from what he had represented to be his condition at the time of application and issuing of the policy and that such use considerably impaired his health and, that his addiction to intemperance and his habits of intemperance have augmented considerably the risk of insurance on his life \u2022 and Mr. Justice Cross who delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench confirming the judgment of the Superior Court after stating the terms of the application which I have read says :\u2014\nI have no hesitation in saying that a contract thus formed. was valid and became binding upon Charlebois and his assignees. It then becomes purely matter of evidence whether the alleged violation of the condition as to change of habits is proved, The learned judge of the Superior Court who rendered the judgment appealed from found it proved, and the majority of this court concur in the concussion he arrived at.\nThere was ample evidence to sustain these findings; in fact, on the evidence, I do not see how any other conclusion could have been arrived at than that a change in the habits of the insured took place which increased the risk on his life and thereby the policy by the terms of the contact became void.\nI do not think the doctrine of representation as distinguished from warranty is applicable to this case because the representation is included and forms part of the contract The appeal must therefore be dismissed\nSTRONG J. was of opinion that the judgment should he affirmed for the reasons given by the court below and by Mr. Justice Taschereau. FOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The evidence, I think, is not sufficient to warrant us in holding that the risk has been increased by the habits of the insured so as to avoid the policy.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of opinion in this case, reading the application and policy together, that the respondent is entitled to our judgment on the merits of the case.\nI do not think that it has been proved that the assured imperiled or shortened his life. It is in evidence that he suffered from heart disease and it was only a. Question as to how long his life could be saved. It was then thought that taking spirits even to an excess might or might not benefit him and, after a careful perusal of the evidence, I think there is not evidence sufficient to say that the policy was avoided by his so indulging in spirits. One of the doctor's examined said he died from the effects of liver complaint, whilst two other doctors put it on the ground of heart disease. The issue that his life was endangered by the use of spirits has not, in my opinion, been satisfactorily proved.\nOn the other point, whether or not the respondent was entitled to bring the suit, I am not so clear. However this court has power to amend and join the parties entitled to recover and as the merits of the case have been tried I am of opinion an amendment might be ordered and that the respondent in the case would be entitled to our judgment if such amendment were made.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014 I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The respondents plea that the appellant has no locus standi is sufficient to dismiss the plaintiff's action. GWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff has, in my opinion, failed to establish his title to the policy sued upon which title was distinctly put in issue by the pleadings on the record, and for this reason, without considering the other point raised, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : John L.

Hill, Esq.,\nCaptain No. 5 Company,\nCape Breton Militia.\nSir,\u2014We, in compliance with ch. 46 sec. 27, Dominion Acts of 1873, it having been represented to us that a disturbance having occurred and is still anticipated at Lingan beyond the power of the civil power to suppress, You are therefore hereby ordered to proceed with your militia company immediately to Lingan, with their arms and ammunition, to aid the civil power in protecting life and property and restoring peace and order, and to remain until further instructed.\nA. J. McDonald, Warden.\nR. McDonald, J.P.\nJ. McVarish, \"\nAngus McNeil, \" The statute also provides that the municipality shall pay the expenses of the service of the militia when so called out, and in case of refusal that an action may be brought by the officer commanding the corps, in his own name, to recover the amount of such expenses.\nHeld, Strong J. dissenting, that where the commanding officer died pending such action the proceedings could be continued by his personal representative.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering judgment to be entered for the defendant.\nThe facts upon which the appeal is founded are as follows:\u2014\nIn March, 1883, a riot and disturbance occurred at Lingan in the county of Cape Breton beyond the power of the civil authorities to suppress or deal with. Thereupon three justices of the peace for the said county, of whom one was the Warden, by writing under their hands required the senior officer of the active militia present in the county to call out the active militia for the purpose of preventing and suppressing said riot and disturbance. Captain Charles W. Hill, to whom the requisition was addressed and who was then such senior officer, thereupon proceeded with his company to Lingan, on the 23rd of March, 1883.\nThe requisition was in the following form:\u2014\n\"Charles W. Hill, Esq., Captain No 5 Company, Cape Breton Militia:\n\"Sir,\u2014We, in compliance with chapter 46, section 27, Dominion Acts of 1873, it having been represented to us that a disturbance having occurred, and is still anticipated at Lingan, beyond the power of the civil power to suppress. You are therefore hereby ordered to proceed with your militia company immediately to Lingan, with their arms and ammunition, to aid the civil power in protecting life and property, and restoring peace and order, and to remain until further instructed.\"\n(Signed by the Warden, &c.)\nSubsequently, by a second requisition, an additional portion of the militia was called into active service and the entire force remained sometime at Lingan for the purpose of aiding the civil power in preventing riots and breaches of the peace.\nThe municipality having refused to pay for the maintenance of the militia during the time occupied in suppressing these riots, an action was commenced on the 12th of June, 1883, by Charles Crewe-Read commanding officer of the corps. In March, 1884, Lieutenant Colonel Crewe-Read died. On the 4th of November, 1884, a judge's order was obtained under the provisions of order xvii rule 4 of the rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, 1884, ordering that the proceedings in this action be continued between Henrietta Crewe-Read, administratrix of the estate of the said Charles Crewe-Read, as plaintiff, and the said Municipality of the County of Cape Breton as defendant.\nThe action was tried in November, 1885, before Mr. Justice Weatherbe without a jury who found all the issues in favor of the plaintiff and gave judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $4,999.85.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, who reversed the decision of Mr. Justice Weatherbe on the ground that the requisition to the senior officer to call out the militia did not, in the opinion of the court, express on the face thereof the actual occurrence or anticipation of a riot or disturbance beyond the power of the civil authorities to suppress.\nThe plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBurbidge Q.C. and Borden for the appellant. The question is whether the directions in the statute are directory or imperative, and that depends on whether or not it was the duty of the magistrates to issue the requisition. If so, the statute is directory. See Maxwell on Statutes[2].\nAs to the sufficiency of the form of the requisition. See Halford v. Cameron's Coalbrook Steam Coal, &c., Ry. Co[3]; Edwards v. Cameron's Coalbrook Steam Coal, &c., Ry. Co.[4].\nDrysdale for the respondents.\nThere is nothing in the requisition to show that the emergency contemplated by the act has arisen. The act requires that the actual existence of a riot or disturbance should be set forth, and that has not been done.\nThen, what right has the administratix to continue the suit on the death of the commanding officer? The statute names the officer to bring the action, but he only sues in virtue of his position. If this money is paid to the administratrix all the creditors of the estate could claim to participate in its distribution.\nBurbidge Q.C. in reply, as to survivorship of the action cited Lewin on Trusts[5]; Williams on Executors[6]; Imperial Statutes[7]; Webb v. Taylor[8]; Barnewall v. Sutherland[9]; Atkins v. Gardner[10]; Howley v. Knight[11]; The King v. Chamberlayne[12].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the requisition in this case was quite sufficient. It is in these words:\u2014\nCharles W. Hill, Esq.,\nCaptain No. 5 Company,\nCape Breton Militia:\nSir,\u2014We, in compliance with ch. 46 sec. 27, Dominion Acts of 1873, it having been represented to us that a disturbance having occurred and is still anticipated at Lingan beyond the power of the civil power to suppress, You are therefore hereby ordered to proceed with your militia company immediately to Lingan, with their arms and ammunition, to aid the civil power in protecting life and property and restoring peace and order, and to remain until further instructed.\n(Signed,) A. J. McDonald, Warden.\nR. McDonald, J.P.\nJ. McVarish, \"\nAngus McNeil, \"\nThe right to call out the militia in aid of the civil power arises in any case in which a riot, disturbance of the peace or other emergency requiring such service occurs, or is, in the opinion of the civil authorities mentioned in the act, anticipated as likely to occur, and in either case to be beyond the power of the civil authorities to suppress, or to prevent or deal with.\nI do not think it is necessary either that the justices should have a personal knowledge of the riot or of the anticipation thereof, or that they should hold a judicial investigation to determine its existence, to require which would be practically to render, in many cases, the law entirely abortive. It is sufficient that the justices should be satisfied of the existence of a riot, or of the anticipation thereof. What is the fair reading of this order, but \"that it having been represented to us, that is, made apparent to us, brought before our minds, that a disturbance had occurred and was still anticipated.\"\nBy acting on the representations made as expressed in the order, it must be assumed that they believed, and had reason to believe, that these representations were well founded, that the disturbance had occurred, and, in their opinion, was still further anticipated as likely to occur, because, unless such was the case, they had no right to make the order. The learned judge who tried the case says, \"he had no difficulty as to the occurrence or anticipation of a riot,\" and, therefore, as to the necessity in this case of calling out the militia; and the Supreme Court could have had no difficulty on this point for the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court, commences the judgment by saying:\u2014\nIn March, 1883, a difficulty arose among the miners of Lingan which ended in a riot. Capt. Hill, of No. 5 Company, \"Argyle Highlanders,\" who was then the senior officer of the active militia present in the county, on the requisition of the Warden of the municipality and three Justices of the Peace, ordered out his company of militia, and on the 22nd of March proceeded with it to Lingan in aid of the civil power.\nThe evidence clearly establishes that there was at the time a most serious riot with which the civil power was wholly inadequate to cope, and which, as a matter of fact, necessitated more men being sent to suppress it than at first were supposed necessary.\nI think, it being established that a riot had actually occurred, and the evidence clearly showing that the aid of the militia was required for its suppression and for the preservation of the public peace, and the militia having been actually called out and having rendered the required aid in the interest of the municipality, it would be a very strained view of the law to say that the requisition, by reason of a mere technical informality, was illegal and of no effect and should not have been acted on by the militia authorities, and the municipality, though receiving the full benefit of the necessary aid thus afforded, should, by reason of such technical informality, be relieved from paying, and the burthen and consequences be cast either on the magistrates who issued the order, or the officer who called the men out, or the men who responded to the call.\nCould it even have been contemplated by the Legislature that the officer to whom the order was transmitted was to obey or disobey as he might think it technically right, or the men to obey or disobey if, in their opinion, the requisition was not strictly right, and in the meantime was the riot to go on, and the civil force be overpowered, while the commanding officer and his men were either disobeying the order or settling this knotty technical objection? I think not; there being beyond all doubt a riot going on with which the civil power could not cope the necessity for an order calling in the aid of the military power existed and it was the duty of the justices to issue such an order; the militia authorities responded, so that the disturbances, through their instrumentality, were suppressed and further disturbances prevented; order was restored and the public peace preserved. And is the municipality to escape payment for such services, because, forsooth, on a hypercritical technical construction of the order issued it may be argued that the requisition was defective in not expressing with sufficient certainty the actual occurrence of a \"riot, disturbance or emergency, or the antiticipation thereof,\" requiring such service?\nIn my opinion, the administratrix was properly allowed to continue the proceedings in this action.\nAs to actions for or against executors, the rule actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 has never been extended to such personal actions as are founded upon any obligation, contract, debt, covenant or any other duty to be performed, because all such actions survived; the maxim is peculiarly applicable to actions ex delicto.\nActions on a contract made with the deceased, or for a debt due to him, were always maintainable by the executors. This was a statutory obligation to pay money, a debt due by statute and therefore ex quasi contractu to which the rule of the common law, actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 does not apply, and such a liability is, in general, held to be in the nature of a debt by specialty within the statute of limitations. This must, I think, be treated as a statutory contract with the deceased, broken in his lifetime, a statutory chose in action which, on his death, became parcel of his personal estate in respect of which the administratrix representing the person of the intestate is, in law, the intestate's assignee, and so the rights and liabilities of the deceased passed, in respect to this right, to the administratrix by operation of law, and the amount, when recovered, would not be distributable as ordinary assets of the intestate's estate, but would be held and disposed of by the administratrix in precisely the same manner as it would have been by the intestate had it been recovered by him in his lifetime. I cannot distinguish this case, in principle, from Bafield v. Collard[13], which is thus stated in 1 Williams on Executors[14]:\u2014\nAn action will lie for an executor or administrator upon a promise made to the deceased for the exclusive benefit of a third party. Thus, where A promised to B that if B would pay \u00a350 to C. his son, who was married to D the daughter of A, that then he would pay \u00a3100 to D. his daughter at such a time. B. paid the \u00a350 to C. and A failed in the payment of the \u00a3100. B. died intestate. E. his executor brought an action upon the case upon assumpsit upon the promise made to B. the intestate, and it was adjudged that the action did well lie by the administrator although he should have no benefit from it if he did recover. Citing Bafield v. Collard (1).\nMr. Leake in his work on contracts[15] thus enunciates the same principle.\nWhere a contract was made between two parties that one of them should pay a sum of money to a third party, it was held that upon the death of the promisee his executor must sue, though for the benefit of the third party, who, being no party to the contract, was unable to sue in his own name. Bafield v. Collard (1).\nIt is very material to bear in mind in this case that if the present action is not maintainable, no other action could be sustained under the statute at the suit of any other person, for if the administratrix cannot maintain the action there would be no remedy, which the law will not suppose.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The concluding part of the enactment under which this action is brought (31 Vic. ch. 40 sec. 27 as amended by 36 Vic. ch. 46 and by 42 Vic. ch. 35) is as follows:\u2014\nProvided that the said pay and allowances of the force called out, together with the reasonable cost of the transport mentioned in section one of the Act passed in the 40th year of Her Majesty's reign and entitled: \"An Act to make further provision for the payment of the active militia when called out in certain cases in aid of the civil power,\" may, pending payment by the municipality, be advanced in the first instance by order of the Governor in Council out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, but such advance shall not interfere with the liability of the municipality and the commanding officer shall at once, in his own name, proceed against the municipality for the recovery of such pay, allowance and cost of transport, and shall on receipt thereof pay over the amount to Her Majesty.\nI am of opinion that this provision does not authorize an action by the personal representative of the commanding officer. It does not create any statutory liability in favour of the commanding officer, but merely authorizes that officer to maintain an action on behalf of the crown to whom the money to be recovered belongs. It is of course out of the question to say that any privity of contract exists between the municipality and the commanding officer, and the only question is whether the proper construction of the statute is to consider it as creating a liability to pay to the officer, or a liability to pay to the crown with authority to the officer to sue on behalf of the crown, and I am clearly of opinion that the latter is the proper interpretation. There can be no doubt but that the Attorney General could maintain an information on behalf of the crown, the usual common law remedy for the recovery of debts due to the crown, which shows that the liability is to pay to the crown, to whom, indeed, the statute declares that any money received by the commanding officer shall at once be paid over. It therefore follows, in my opinion, that the personal representative of the commanding officer cannot sue. The money received would not be assets even at law, and this is the usual test as to the right of the personal representative to maintain an action, and the statute does not confer any authority on the representative to sue on behalf of the crown. Therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing the appeal for the reasons given by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nHENRY J.\u2014I would also adopt the view of the learned Chief Justice. He refers to the objection to the requisition as being technical. I am of opinion that the order was quite sufficient. The facts are to be decided by three magistrates, and when they give their order the commander of the troops is bound to obey. The law also provides that the commanding officer shall bring the action which he did in this case. He died pending the action and the statute in Nova Scotia provides that in all cases the personal representative can continue the proceedings. I agree with the learned Chief Justice that the suit was properly continued in the name of the administratrix.\nI think it makes no difference where the money when recovered is to go. The effects of the estate are to be distributed according to law, and each person entitled to participate in the distribution has a right to ask the Court of Probate to award what is due to him. Under no circumstances could I imagine any difficulty in having the money applied to paying the men by the administratrix, and as the Government of the Dominion advanced the money the right to recover is, by the statute, transferred to it.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action was commenced and brought under the Dominion statute, 31st Vic. ch. 40 as amended by 36 Vic. ch. 46 and 42 Vic. ch. 35, by one Charles Crewe-Read in his life time, as having been the commanding officer of a body of active militia ordered out by the senior officer of militia in the neighbourhood to suppress a riot in the county of Cape Breton, in aid of the civil powers. The said Charles Crewe-Read having died pending the action, it has been continued by the present plaintiff as his personal representative under an order of the court in which the action was pending made for that purpose. Two objections have been taken to the plaintiff's right to recover in this action, neither of which is, in my judgment, entitled to prevail.\nThat a riot had taken place which was beyond the power of the civil authorities to suppress, and that the services of the militia were necessary in aid of the civil power in order to its suppression, and that a body of militia of which the original plaintiff was the commanding officer was ordered out by the senior officer of the active militia in the locality where the riot took place, are facts which are not now in dispute, but it is contended:\u2014\n1st. That the requisition in virtue of which the militia were so ordered out, although signed by the Warden and three Justices of the Peace of the county, did not in its form comply with the statute, and that, therefore, compensation for the services of the militia in suppressing the riot which could not otherwise have been suppressed cannot be recovered under the statute, and\u2014\n2nd. Assuming that the action could have been sustained by Charles Crewe-Read in his lifetime that it could not be continued by his personal representative, and that, therefore, for this reason the action cannot be sustained.\nAs to the first point, I am of opinion that the requisition was in its form sufficient to authorize the officer in command of the militia to order out a sufficient force to suppress the riot, and that for the services so rendered the militia employed were entitled to be paid under the provisions of the statute and to recover for such services in an action at the suit of the officer in command of the force employed.\nThe statute enacts that:\u2014\nWhen the active militia or any corps thereof are so called out in aid of the civil power the municipality in which their services are required shall pay them when so employed the rates authorised to be paid for actual service to officers, non-commissioned officers and men, and one dollar per diem for each horse actually and necessarily used by them, together with an allowance of one dollar to each officer, fifty cents to each non-commissioned officer and man per diem, in lieu of subsistence, and fifty cents per diem in lieu of forage for each horse, and in addition shall provide them with proper lodging and with stabling for their horses; and the said pay and allowances for subsistence and forage, as also the value of lodging and stabling, unless furnished in kind by the municipality, may be recovered from it by the officer commanding the corps in his own name, and when so recovered shall be paid over to the persons entitled thereto.\nNow it has long been settled that wherever a pecuniary benefit is given by a statute to an individual he may sue for it and recover[16].\nIn the old forms of action the suit might have been in assumpsit or in debt unless one or other form alone was specially given by the statute[17]; and in Chitty on Pleading several forms of declarations in assumpsit in such cases are given. Tilson v. Warwick Gas Light Co.[18]; Garden v. General Cemetery Co.[19]; Hopkins v. Mayor of Swansea[20]; Miles v. Bough[21]; were actions in debt\u2014and in Reg. v. Hull & Selby Railway Co.[22], it was held that as debt lay against the company for an amount to which they were made liable by a statute a mandamus should not be granted.\nNow upon the authority of the above cases an action would have lain against the defendants at the suit of the several persons in the militia force which was employed to recover the amount which by the statute is made payable to each, if the statute to avoid such multiplicity of suits had not given an action to the officer in command on behalf of all. In the action brought by him he was interested beneficially to the amount due to himself, and as to the remainder as a trustee for all the persons who were under his command on the occasion of the services being rendered. Under the old practice, the action, whether brought in assumpsit or in debt, was in its nature an action ex contractu; the statute created a contract between the municipality made liable to pay and the parties declared entitled to be paid. Of a like nature is the action still, although the forms of action have been done away with. The common law maxim therefore of actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e2 does not apply, and the statute certainly has not made that maxim applicable. I cannot, therefore, doubt that the action which was by the statute vested in Charles Crewe-Read, and which was brought by him for his own benefit as to the amount made by the statute due, and payable to himself, and as to the residue as a trustee for the others, was such a chose in action as, upon his death, passed to his personal representative just as would a cause of action for any other debt due and payable to testator or intestate. Indeed, if the amount which the statute has imposed as a debt due by the municipality and payable to the several persons who rendered the services in compensation of which the debt was imposed can not be recovered in the present action it cannot be recovered at all. It has been suggested that it might be recovered by mandamus, but a mandamus, if granted, could only command the municipality to pay the person who alone was entitled to receive the amount payable by the statute; and if that person could not be represented by his personal representative, so that the mandamus could order the payment to be made to such representative, no mandamus could be granted. The circumstance that the Dominion Government has advanced the amount and paid the militia makes no difference, for the statute expressly enacts that such advance shall not interfere with the liability of the municipality, and the commanding officer shall at once in his own name proceed against the municipality for the recovery of such pay, allowances and cost of transport, and shall on receipt thereof pay over the amount to Her Majesty. Neither the nature of the liability nor of the action is at all changed. The action is still to recover a debt due for services rendered by the intestate and others under his command, but when recovered it is, by reason of the advance, affected by the statutes with a trust for Her Majesty. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiff in the court below for the amount of the verdict with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Wallace Graham.\nSolicitor for respondent: Arthur Drysdale.\n[1] 19 N.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSale of land\u2014Subject to mortgage\u2014Absolute sale\u2014Sale of Equity of redemption\u2014Consideration in deed.\nB. sold to C. land mortgaged to a loan society. The consideration in the deed was $1,400 and the sum of $104 was paid to B. C. afterwards paid $1,081 and obtained a discharge of the mortgage. B. brought an action to recover the balance of the difference between the amount paid the society and said sum of $1,400, and on the trial he testified that he intended to sell the land for a fixed price; that he had been informed by W., father-in-law of C., that there would be about $300 coming to him; that he had demurred to the acceptance of the sum offered $104, but was informed by C., and the lawyer's clerk, who drew the deed, that they had figured it out and that was all that would be due him after paying the mortgage; that he was incapable of figuring it himself and accepted it on this representation. C. claimed that the transaction was only a purchase by him of the equity of redemption, and that B. had accepted $104 in full for the same.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that the weight of evidence was in favor of the claim made by B., that the transaction was an absolute sale of the land for $1,400; and independently of that, the deed itself would be sufficient evidence to support such claim in the absence of satisfactory proof of fraud or mistake.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court and restoring the verdict at the trial in favor of the defendant.\nThe plaintiff, Burgess, was the owner of a lot of land mortgaged to a Loan Society, and being in arrears with his payments he determined to sell it. He had been notified that the Society would accept $1,068 to discharge the mortgage, and he effected a sale to the defendant Conway. The parties went to a lawyer's office and a conveyance was drawn up in which $1,400 was declared to be the consideration for the sale. The sum of $104.50 was paid to the plaintiff, the defendant and the clerk who prepared the conveyance stating that this would be the balance coming to him, and the deed was executed. The defendant, a few months afterwards, paid off the mortgage for $1,081.\nBurgess afterwards assigned to one Deroche a claim against the defendant for a balance on this transaction, and a suit was brought by him and Deroche to recover it. On the trial he testified that it had been represented to him before the sale that there would be some $300 coming to him; that when the $104 was tendered to him he demurred about taking it, but the defendant stated that he and the clerk had figured it out and that was all that was coming, and that Whelan, defendant's father-in-law, who had told him he would get $300, had figured it wrongly; that he was incapable of figuring it himself and took the amount offered, supposing that it was the proper amount He claimed that the sale was for a fixed price, $1,400, for the land, and that he was entitled to the difference between that amount and the sum paid by the defendant to discharge the mortgage.\nThe defendant, on the other hand, claimed that there was no price fixed, but that the transaction was merely a sale by Burgess of his equity of redemption in the land, and that was sold for the sum accepted when the deed was executed, namely, $104.50.\nAt the trial a verdict was given for the defendant, the learned judge finding, as matters of fact, that there was a fixed price of $1,400 on the land, but that Burgess had accepted $104.50 in payment of the same. The Divisional Court reversed this verdict and gave judgment for the plaintiff for $215, with interest. The Court of Appeal restored the judgment of the judge at the trial. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMoss Q. C. for the appellant, referred to Gamble v. Gummerson[1]; Cameron v. Carier[2]; Sugden on Vendors[3]; Foakes v. Beer[4].\nRobinson Q. C. for the respondent cited Grasset v. Carter[5].\nSir W. J. Ritchie C. J. and Fournier J. concurred in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Henry and were of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an action to enforce a vendor's lien for an unpaid residue of the purchase money of a parcel of land sold by the appellant Burgess to the respondent. The other plaintiff Deroche is the assignee of Burgess. The learned judge who tried the action, Mr. Justice Rose, expressly finds that the sale was a sale not of the mere equity of redemption subject to a mortgage, but of the land, at the price of $1,400. The learned judge's own words are as follows:\u2014\nThe facts, as it appears to me, stand somewhat in the following order. It is admitted the plaintiff and defendant contracted that the sale of the property should be for $ 1,400, and that the plaintiff Burgess should have the difference between the amount of the mortgage upon the land and $1,400.\nThat this was the true character of the purchase is, also, demonstrated by the statement of the consideration money in the conveyance by which it was carried out. The price is there stated to have been $1,400, Further, two at least of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Patterson, agree in this view of the evidence. The learned Chief Justice says:\u2014\nThe judge considered, and I fully agree, that the contract was to sell the land at the price of $1,400.\nMr. Justice Patterson says:\u2014\nTwo facts are clear and both parties agree about them, the price agreed on was $1,400, and a sum to be paid as that which the defendant was to pay the plaintiff besides assuming the mortgage was agreed on and paid.\nHad the facts that the sale was one of the land itself for $1,400, and not a sale of the equity of redemption for $104, not been thus, according to all the findings of all the courts below, incontrovertibly established by the extrinsic evidence, the purchase deed would in itself, in the absence of any allegation in the defendant's pleading that by error and mistake it incorrectly stated terms of the sale, have been conclusive. The sale having been carried into execution by conveyance the terms of the deed by which it was so carried out must be considered as binding on the parties, until displaced upon some equitable grounds of mistake or fraud; none such having been alleged, and the evidence being insufficient to establish such a defence even if it had been pleaded, we must take the contract as it is stated to have been in the instrument by which the parties have completed the purchase. Then, the deed shows that the price was $1,400, and in the face of the absolute covenant against incumbrances contained in it, it is impossible to admit the respondent's pretension that the sale was one of the equity of redemption subject to the mortgage.\nThis being the state of the case as to the two facts upon which the decision of the case must turn, it appears to me that the appellant does not subject himself to the objection that he is asking the court to vary the findings of fact which have been arrived at by the court which saw and heard the witnesses, and so to resile from the rule laid down in the case of \"The Picton\"[6] and other cases. So far from doing this the very basis of the appellants' case is that the facts are as they have been expressly found by the three courts which have already had the case under their consideration. If the rule in question has any application to this appeal, it ought to be applied against the respondent who is seeking to alter the findings of all the courts which have passed upon the evidence by contending that the sale was one of the vendor's equity of redemption merely, for the price of $104.50 the payment of which was, therefore, a full discharge of the purchase money.\nStarting then from these facts that the sale was one of an estate in mortgage for the price of $1400 the rights of the parties are easily determinable by applying rules well settled and understood in the practice of conveyancing, rules not founded on any technical or arbitrary principles, but resting on grounds of practical convenience and justice. The vendor was clearly entitled to the benefit of the whole price at which he sold his land, but the purchaser was entitled so to apply his purchase money as to protect himself against the incumbrance of which he had notice at the time of his purchase. The strictly regular mode of doing this, according to the practice laid down in the English books, is to require that the mortgagee shall become a party to the conveyance if his mortgage is overdue, or if he is willing to receive his money. In either of these cases the purchaser is therefore entitled to apply so much of the purchase money as may be required to the discharge of the incumbrance. In case the mortgage money should not have become payable and the mortgagee should not be willing to anticipate the date fixed for payment the purchaser is entitled to retain in his own hands an amount equivalent to that which will be required to discharge the incumbrance at its maturity, and the sum so reserved must be invested for the benefit of the vendor so as to produce a reasonable rate of interest\u2014the rule being that whenever the purchaser gets into possession and receives rents and profits from that date the vendor is entitled to interest on unpaid purchase money. The amount to be paid for the incumbrance is a matter with which the purchaser has nothing whatever to do; the money so applied is considered as being applied for the benefit of the vendor, and he is at liberty to enter into any arrangement he may be able to effect with the mortgagee. If he can get the mortgagee to discharge his mortgage, trusting to personal security or taking other real security, or if he can procure the mortgagee to make an abatement in the amount of his debt, he is at liberty to do so, and any such arrangement enures for his benefit. The purchaser is bound to pay or account to the vendor for the whole price stipulated for, and all he can insist upon is his right so to pay it as to protect himself against the incumbrance. These are the strict rights of vendor and purchaser as administered by the court when a sale is carried out under a judgment for specific performance and also in completing the sale of an estate made under the decree or judgment of the court itself, and I am not aware that they are in any way different when the court has to determine them for any other purpose. In this country, where a mortgage can be more readily discharged by the registration of a statutory certificate of payment, it is not usual in completing a purchase to make the mortgagee a party to the conveyance, but the same purpose is more inexpensively and conveniently effected by discharging the incumbrance under the registry act. In all other respects it is the strict right of either vendor or purchaser to require that the practice, as laid down by the most esteemed writers on the law of vendor and purchaser, and as I have briefly stated it, should be followed.\nThe question in the present case is therefore reduced to this simple one: Has the $1400, which it is admitted on all hands was the price for which the appellant sold his land, been paid by the vendee? It is out of the question to say, and indeed it has not been suggested, that the bargain to buy and sell for $ 1400 dollars was superseded by any subsequent and different contract, and the only matter to be determined can therefore be: Has this admitted price been paid or satisfied?\nIt is matter of elementary law that an obligation for the payment of money arising upon a contract whether the money so to be paid is due under a contract for the sale of land, or by virtue of any other agreement, can only be discharged by release, accord and satisfaction, or the payment of the full amount which the creditor has stipulated for and not by the payment of any less sum though accepted expressly in discharge. Here there is no suggestion of any collateral accord and satisfaction nor is any release set up; therefore, before the debt can be held to have been discharged payment must be proved, according to the general rule applicable to all payments, of the full amount to which the creditor was originally entitled, When we arrive at this stage and see, as I think it must plainly be seen, that the question between the parties is in reality one, not as to the terms of a contract (for that question is concluded by findings which all the courts have acquiesced in), but one concerning only the payment of an admitted price, all difficulty vanishes for then it cannot, in the face of the recent decision in the House of Lords Foakes v. Beer[7], be pretended that the appellant was bound by his acceptance of $104.50 if more was actually due to him even though he accepted it absolutely as in satisfaction and discharge. Then it is not insisted that in addition to the $104.50 paid to the appellant on the 9th January, 1885, the respondent has paid more than $1081\u2014the amount of the draft for $1073, forwarded by Whelan on the 27th of February, 1885, and the $8 additional claimed by Mr. Cameron and sent by Whelan on the 5th of March 1885, making in all $1,081 paid to the mortgagees. The consequence is inevitable that the purchase money has not been paid in full. The aggregate amount of the two sums so paid to the appellant himself and to the mortgagees being deducted from the $1400 leaves a balance still due to the appellants of 214 50 on which they are entitled to interest from the 9th January, 1885, the date of the conveyance.\nI have thought it sufficient to rest my opinion on the ground that the $104.50 could not bo payment of the larger amount remaining due as the residue o the purchase money after deducting the amount paid to the mortgagees. But even if there had been an actual release, or if there had been some collateral satisfaction, I should have thought the error in calculation fatal to the respondent's contention.\nI need scarcely say that the debt was clearly a proper subject of assignment, and I am of opinion that the assignee and assignor were properly conjoined as plaintiffs; neither of these questions seem to have given rise to any doubt in the courts below and therefore call for no further observation,\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts.\nHENRY J.\u2014The appellants in their declaration claim to recover from the respondent a sum of about $215 and interest as the balance of the purchase money of a lot of land, and of the consideration of a deed of conveyance thereof made by Burgess to the respondent, which claim was assigned by Burgess to his co-appellant for the benefit of creditors with a resulting trust to himself. It is alleged by the appellants that the land was sold for $1,4.00, subject to a mortgage held by the Hamilton Provident and Loan Society upon which, at the time of the sale in question, there was due $1,068, and for which sum the society had communicated to the parties its readiness to release it.\nThe respondent denies by his pleading that the price of the land as agreed on was $1,400, and alleges:\nThat said Burgess offered to sell said equity of redemption to defendant for the price or sum of $104: 50. The defendant accepted said offer and paid said Burgess said last mentioned sum, and no further or other sum was due.\nUpon these counter allegations issue was joined and, to come to a proper conclusion it is necessary to consult the evidence on both sides.\nAbout the time of the sale of the land, and shortly previous thereto, Burgess, being in default for two instalments, was called upon by the society for payment. Being unable to pay the instalments due he determined to sell the land, which he did to a man named Wagar for $1,500. The sale was not perfected and he (Burgess) having met the respondent at the office of his father-in-law (Whelan) at Centreville, alleges that he offered the land to the respondent at $50 less than the amount he had bargained for with Wagar\u2014that after some figuring by the respondent a bargain was concluded for $1,400. This took place at Centreville, and it was agreed that the respondent and Burgess and the wife of the latter should go next morning (Friday) to Napanee to have the bargain consummated by the necessary conveyances for that purpose, to be made out by a solicitor. This is fully corroborated and sustained by a disinterested witness who was present. It is shown too that Burgess himself, although one of the appellants, has but a trifling, if any, interest in the result. It is further shown that it was the respondent who retained the professional services of the conveyancer, and gave him instructions as to the writing of the deed and that it was executed, as so written, by Burgess and his wife, and the evidence shows that it was written and signed before the alleged purchase by the respondent of what he alleges to be the right of the equity of redemption. The respondent in his evidence takes the position that no bargain or agreement had been made or entered into, except at the office of the conveyancer; and that that made there was for the equity of redemption for the sum of $104.50. The whole of the facts which are not disputed are, to my mind, conclusive against sustaining that position. In the first place it may be fairly asked why the parties went a distance of about fifteen miles away from their homes to negotiate a bargain? And why was the wife of Burgess taken there? And if no bargain had been previously made, how was it that the consideration of the deed was made, at the instance of the respondent, $1,400. No explanation of these facts is given by the respondent, and when he does not give any are they not, in connection with the testimony of the plaintiffs witnesses, conclusive against the respondent. Exhibit 1 is as follows:\u2014\nStatutory deed, dated January 9th, 1885, registered same day at 3.55 p.m., made by plaintiff Samuel Burgess of the first part, Elizabeth M. A. Burgess his wife (who joins for the purpose of barring her dower only) of the second part, and defendant of the third part, whereby in consideration of $1,400 (the payment of which is therein acknowledged and a receipt for the money signed in the margin) the lands in question were conveyed to the defendant.\nHere, then, is shown, not a conveyance of the equity of redemption but a deed in fee simple; with a statement of the joining therein of the wife of Burgess to bar her dower; and the consideration therein is stated to be $1400. By the solemn instrument referred to the amount to be paid for the land was agreed to be $1400 and how then can the respondent be permitted to contradict it? That deed is the best evidence against the respondent, who is a party to it, to establish the contention of the appellants, and I hold that he, the respondent, cannot repudiate it unless he could clearly and by irresistible evidence show that the insertion of that sum as the consideration was made through error or fraud, or by equally irresistible evidence that it was contrary to the terms of the bargain which the parties had made and went to Napanee to have carried out. Such has not been attempted to be shown. It is, however shown that before the delivery of the deed some figuring, as Burgess calls it, was done by Currie, the clerk who prepared the deed, and the respondent, and after some conversation with Burgess the sum of $104.50 was announced by them to him as the balance coming to him after providing for the payment of the mortgage. This he demurred to as Whalen, the father-in-law of the respondent, had made a calculation when Burgess was about selling to Wagar, by which Burgess would be entitled to about $300. On his so demurring and stating that such was the case the respondent and Currie told him that Whalen did not understand figuring; and that he had made a mistake. Hearing that Burgess reluctantly submitted to what they said and received the $104.50 as the balance due him. I have just quoted from the evidence of Burgess; and from the manner in which he gave it, and from the surrounding circumstances, I have satisfied myself that his evidence is more reliable than that of the two others referred to. Currie knew personally nothing of what took place before the parties went to the office. His evidence therefore does not sustain that of the respondent as to matters previous. The respondent, therefore, is wholly unsustained when he, to some extent but inferentially only, contradicts the evidence of the witnesses of the appellant as to the bargain of the previous day. I feel bound, under that evidence sustained by admitted facts and by uncontradicted statements, to find that a bargain for $1400 was entered into and that the parties went to Napanee to have it completed.\nHaving arrived, then, at that conclusion where can a defence be found to the appellant's action?\nThat defence consists of the allegation that the respondent purchased the equity of redemption for $104.50 and that he paid it. It will be seen that the defence is not that the respondent purchased for $1400 but that subsequently, and before the execution of the deed, Burgess agreed to take a less sum which was paid to him. That defence under the evidence, would not be sufficient, but the testimony of Burgess being more probable should be acted on.\nThe more I have considered the evidence and surrounding circumstances the more firmly I have been convinced that Burgess was imposed upon when he received the $104.50. The respondent admits that at the time of the dispute as to the balance due to Burgess that he said to Burgess that the time for paying off the mortgage for $1063 had expired and he adds\nMr. Drury said if Mr, Conway assumes that or pays anything out of it he will be doing it on his own responsibility,\nmeaning that if Conway did not charge Burgess $1313 be would run the risk of losing the difference between that sum and $1068 and when Drury made that statement Conway says\nI told Burgess the time had passed for the Company's offer.\nIt is plain then that they falsely and fraudulently persuaded Burgess that he (Conway) would have to pay the larger amount when he at the time knew full well that he could have the mortgage released for the smaller one.\nBurgess was examined and cross examined at great length and amongst other questions was asked\nHow much did you expect to get? A. The way Conway and Whalen figured there was between three and four hundred dollars coming to me. Q. $1075 was the amount against the place? A. Yes. Q. That would be $375 difference? A. Yes that is what Conway and Whalen said would be coming to me\u2014That is the way they spoke the day before\u2014Thursday.\nThese statements were either true or false. If the latter we should expect them to have been contradicted by Conway and Whalen but they were not; and when both were examined as witnesses and were silent as to those statements of Burgess are we not bound to believe them? He appears to have been rather an illiterate man unable to make the calculations required to ascertain the sum really due him. He says he was dissatisfied first and last. He says they, Conway and Drury, did not go over any calculations with him but merely gave results.\nHe was asked in cross-examination\nThen how did you come to quietly accept $104 without asking some explanation? A. I asked Conway and Drury how it was and they said Mr. Whalen didn't understand figuring it.\nHe is asked by His Lordship the presiding Judge:\nWhat did you understand the mistake to be? A. That there should be more money coming to me than I got. Q. Why? A. The way Whalen figured it to me and the way Conway figured it when we made the bargain\u2014I did not figure it myself\u2014I was not capable of figuring it.\nIf those statements are true, and I fully believe them to be so, it requires but a slight imagination to picture the position of this man, incapable of making the necessary calculations, in the hands of the other two, an unconscious victim.\nThe law governing this case is plain and well ascertained and establishes the right of the appellants to recover the difference between the amount the respondent paid to redeem the mortgage to which is to be added the $ 104.50 paid and the sum of $1400. I think the judgment of the Divisional Court should de sustained and that the judgment of this court should sustain it with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In my opinion it is to be regretted that the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose, who tried the case, was interfered with by the Divisional Court of Queen's Bench. I quite agree with those learned judges of the courts below who have held that the question was purely one of fact, which the learned judge who heard the witnesses had the best opportunity to determine. That question was: What was the agreement between the parties upon which the deed executed by Burgess in favor of Conway was executed? And the learned judge has in effect found, as matter of fact, that the bargain was that Conway was to give $1400 for the fee simple estate in the land, of which sum the mortgage to the Hamilton Provident Loan Society should be counted as part, to the amount which appeared upon its face to be secured by it, and not to the amount which the company would accept in satisfaction of it if paid before its maturity, and that the difference between such face value of the mortgage and $1400.00 should be paid in cash to Burgess; that thereupon a calculation was made in Burgess' presence to ascertain the amount so coming to him in cash which was ascertained to be $84.50 or thereabouts; that thereupon Burgess suggested that he should receive interest upon instalments of the mortgage which he had already paid, to which Conway assented, the amount being ascertained to be about $20.00, which sum added to the $84.50, making together $104.50, Conway paid to Burgess, whereupon Burgess executed a deed to Conway which, although in terms purporting to convey the fee simple estate in the land did in fact pass only, as it only could pass, Burgess' interest therein, that is to say his equity of redemption subject to the mortgage to the loan society which Conway assumed. With the bargain so concluded the learned judge has found that Burgess was and expressed himself to be well satisfied.,\nSubsequently Conway paid the mortgage before its maturity the company accepting in discharge of it a less sum than the amount appearing on its face to be secured by it and thereby realised a sum of money the prospect of realising which the learned judge found to have been Conway's motive for concluding the above bargain with Burgess. This sum of money is the subject of this suit and upon the above findings the learned judge rendered a verdict and judgment for the defendant. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has concurred in this view; and unless we can pronounce it to be clearly erroneous we are not justified in interfering with it. So far from thinking it to be erroneous I concur in the findings of the learned judge. The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Deroche & Madden.\nSolicitors for Respondent: Kerr & Bull.\n[1] 9 Gr. 193.\n[2] 9 O.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nSubstitution\u2014Minors \u2014Tutor ad hoc\u2014 Intervention\u2014Status\u2014 Arts. 269-945 C. C.\nIn an action to account and for removal from trusteeship instituted by the party who had appointed the defendant trustee and curator to a substitution created by marriage contract, a tutor ad hoc to the minor children and appel\u00e9s to the substitution has not sufficient quality to intervene in said suit to represent the minors.\nArt. 269 C. C. provides for the only case where a tutor ad hoc can be appointed to minors ([1]), Strong J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) ([2]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court which maintained a demurrer to an intervention filed by the respondent as tutor ad hoc to minor children in a suit pending between William Herring, in his quality of curator to the institute (grev\u00e9) and the appellant as trustee appointed to administer the property of the substitution. The facts and pleadings of the case are fully stated in the report of the case in the court below (2) and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fournier hereinafter given.\nIrvine Q.C. for the appellants.\nFirst, as to the legality of the appointment of Larue. There was no property in which, the minors were interested and no occasion for the appointment of a tutor. The father was alive and was guardian of their persons; if it was necessary to have a tutor a regular tutor should have been appointed.\nLarue has no legal status as a tutor ad hoc. Such tutor can only be appointed for a special purpose. The law provides that the affairs of a minor and the care of his person shall be in a tutor appointed in a particular way and when the tutor cannot act, in the interest of the minor a tutor ad hoc is appointed. Art. 269 C.C. provides for the only case in which a tutor ad hoc can he appointed. Here, no tutor was appointed prior to the appointment of the tutor ad hoc\nSecondly\u2014Even if the tutor was properly appointed he has no right to intervene. The act allows any person likely to be affected by the result of a case to be represented. In this case the decision would not hind the children, nor affect them in any way. This intervention is not to protect the children but to protect Herring, which is not what is intended by the act.\nStuart follows: The law of Lower Canada in regard to tutors is different from the modern law of France. Under our law the parents of minors have no authority, as such, over the letters' property. Under the modern law of France, during the time of the marriage the father has the legal domination over the property of the minors. Upon the death of one of the parents the survivor is the legal tutor of the children If the survivor dies one of the ascendants is the tutor by law; if he refuse, or if there be no ascendants, a tutor is assigned.\nThe following statutes and authorities were cited: Arts 269 and 304 C. C.; art 14 C C P; St Norhert d'ATthabasaa v. Champoux ([3]); Brousseau v. Bedatd ([4]); Vall\u00e9e v. Leroux ([5]) Boss\u00e9 Q.C. for the repondent.\nThe appellant has waived the objection as to the right of intervention and cannot raise it now. Arts. 154-8466 C.C.\nThen as to the appointment of Larue there is nothing in the French law corresponding to art, 269 of our code. See Marchant Code de la Minorit\u00e9 ([6]); Rolland de Villargues ([7]).\nIt has never been necessary to appoint a tutor first when the necessity for appointing a tutor ad hoc exists. Art. 269 does not contradict this. Arts. 225 to 346 show that it is specially provided for. There is no change in the old law. The spirit of the law is that whenever a party cannot speak for himself a tutor ad hoc is appointed to represent his interest.\nWe have to deal with a demurrer and have not the reasons why a tutor was not appointed; unless there is a plain infringement of the law the court \"will not infere.\nThe appointment is good on its face and should stand. Dalloz ([8])\nLacoste Q.C. follows and refers art. 921 C.C.P. Proudhon Trait\u00e9 sum l'Etat des Personnes ([9]); Laurent ([10]). Art.- 956 0. 0.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I consider the point involved in the appeal one of those matters of procedure with which this court ought not to interfere. I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be affirmed.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le litige entre les parties en cette cause s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur l'intervention produite par l'intim\u00e9 LaRue, en qualit\u00e9 de tuteur ad hoc, dans une action intent\u00e9e par William Herring en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur \u00e0 l'interdiction pour cause de prodigalit\u00e9, de Dame Isabelle Abbott Young, \u00e9pouse de Beverly R. Eppes, demandant la destitution de l'appelant Rattray de sa position de fid\u00e9icommissaire (trustee) des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s substitu\u00e9es par Madame Eppes en faveur de ses enfants.\nLa substitution dont ii s'agit en cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par Madame Eppes en vertu de son contrat de mariage avec M Eppes avec r\u00e9serve d'usufruit en leur faveur. Henry Talbot Walcot et l'appelant, nomm\u00e9s fid\u00e9icommissaires pour l'administration des biens substitu\u00e9s, accept\u00e8rent cette charge dont, plus tard, Talbot Walcot se fit relever r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Le seul en office aujourd\u2019hui est l'appelant qui est encore en possession des biens substitu\u00e9s\nHerring en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur \u00e0 Madame Eppes a demand\u00e9 la destitution de l'appelant, parce que ce dernier aurait pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es n\u00e9glige de payer la rente viag\u00e8re cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le contrat de mariage en faveur de la m\u00e8re de Madame Eppes, pour n'avoir pas place pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la substitution les capitaux qu'il avait retir\u00e9s, parce qu'il \u00e9tait devenu insolvable et refusait de rendre compte. Ii concluait \u00e0 la destitution de l'appelant de ses fonctions de fid\u00e9icommissaire et demandait un compte final de son administration.\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande l'appelant produisit un compte faisant voir qu'il avait pay\u00e9 ce qu'il avait re\u00e7u, et que dans ces paiements se trouv\u00e2t une partie du capital substitu\u00e9 en faveur des enfants de Madame Eppes, qu'il avait pay\u00e9 sur demande sp\u00e9ciale de Madame Eppes et de son mari pour acquitter leurs dettes. Ce plaidoyer est demeur\u00e9 jusqu'ici sans r\u00e9ponse. Se fondant sun le fait qu'une partie des capitaux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e un conseil de famille fut convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de Herring. Ce conseil recommanda la nomination d'un tuteur ad hoc charg\u00e9 d'intervenir dans la cause de Herring demandant la destitution de Rattray et de prendre dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des mineurs appel\u00e9s \u00e0 cette substitution des conclusions semblables \u00e0 celles de Herring.\nL'appelant plaida par defenee an fonds en droit \u00e0 l'intervention de W. E. Larue, present intim\u00e9, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu tuteur ad hoc et lui niant le droit d'invoquer les moyens qu'il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et le droit de prendre les conclusions prises par son intervention.\nLa defenee en droit fut maintenue et l'action renvoy\u00e9e par l'honorable juge en chef Stuart. Sur appel, le jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 de trois \"juges contre deux\u2014faisant une \u00e9galit\u00e9 d'opinions en sens inverse dans les deux cours. J'est le jugement qui est maintenant soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de cette cour.\nParmi les questions importantes discut\u00e9es par les savants conseils des parties, tant dans leurs plaidoiries orales que dans leurs facturns il en est une qui les prime toutes et dont la solution doit rendre inutile l'examen des autres. C'est celle de savoir si l'intervenant nomm\u00e9 tuteur ad hoc \u00e0 des mineurs qui n'avaient pas encore de tuteur, poss\u00e8de une qualit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale lui donnant le droit de repr\u00e9senter des mineurs qui n'ont pas de tuteur.\nQuelles sont les fonctions du tuteur ad hoc et quand y a-t-il lieu d'en faire la nomination? L'article 269 C.C. dit:\nSi pendant la tutelle il arrive que le mineur ait des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 discuter en justice avec son tuteur, on lui donne, pour ce cas, un tuteur ad hoc dont los pouvoirs s'\u00e9tendent seulement aux obeets \u00e0 discuter.\nD'apr\u00e8s cet article il est \u00e9vident qu'il ne peut y avoir de tuteur ad hoc lorsque les mineurs n'ont pas encore de tuteur avec lequel ils pussent avoir des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 discuter en justice. Si l'on pr\u00e9voyait que ceux dont il s'agit pouvaient avoir des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger en justice on autrement c'est par la nomination d'un tuteur ayant l'administration de leurs personnes et de leurs biens qu'il aurait fallu commencer. On ne pouvait pas plus, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent que dans aucun autre se dispenser de proc\u00e9der r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, suivant les dispositions du code civil et du code de proc\u00e9dure. La tutelle aurait di Citre d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au p\u00e8re, on \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut pour des motifs l\u00e9gitimes, an parent le plus proche. Pour justifier cette omission, li intim\u00e9 argue des int\u00e9r\u00eats du p\u00e8re en qualit\u00e9 de grav\u00e9 de substitution, comme \u00e9tant contraire \u00e0 ceux de ses enfants qui sont les appel\u00e9s \u00e0 cette substitution. Ce motif n'\u00e9tant pas suffisant pour exclure le p\u00e8re de la tutelle qui lui appartenait de droit, et dont l'excusions ne pouvait avoir lieu chue pour raisons graves, comportant presque toujours contre la des conduite du p\u00e8re un bl\u00e2me s\u00e9v\u00e8re que l'on devait \u00e9viter de lui infliger inutilement. L'existence d'int\u00e9r\u00eats contradictoires entre le grev\u00e9 et les appel\u00e9s \u00e0 une substitution pouvait bien \u00eatre un excellent motif d'adopter le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 voulu par le code civil pour la protection des mineurs int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, mais ne justifiait nullement la nomination d'un tuteur ad hoc que le code ni indique pas comme le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre dans le cas qui nous occupe. L'intim\u00e9 s'est \u00e9videmment tromp\u00e9 sur la nature du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'il devait adopter. Dans ces circonstances, ce n'\u00e9tait pas un tuteur ad hoc qu'il fallait nommer, mais bien d'abord un tuteur aux personnes et biens et ensuite pour l'ex\u00e9cution de la substitution un curateur \u00e0 la substitution comme on verra claps\u00e9s par le statut de Qu\u00e9bec, 38 Vict. ch. 13. La question de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la tutelle ad hoc, lorsqu'il n'y a pas encore de tutelle aux personnes et biens n'est pas nouvelle. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans la cause de la Corp. de St. Norbert d'Arthabaska v. Champoux, rapport\u00e9e au ler vol. des L. R. Qu\u00e9bec ([11]) et d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la cour de R\u00e9vision, compos\u00e9e de Sir William 0. Meredith, alors juge en chef, et des honorables juges Casault et Tessier. Ce dernier dans ses notes sur cette cause se fait la question suivante:\nNotre code de proc\u00e9dure et notre code civil admettent ils la tutelle ad hoc dans ce cas ci?\nEt il y r\u00e9pond comme suit;\nL'article 1278 du C.P.C. ne parle du tuteur ad hoc que Iorsqu'il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 un tuteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour contr\u00f4ler l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de celui-ci,\nL'article 269 C.C. pourvoit au m\u00eame cas. .\nD'apr\u00e8s ces principes, la tutelle ad hoc d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au mineur est certainement annulable.\nL'honorable juge Casault fait au m\u00eame sujet l'observation suivante:\u2014\nMais la tutelle ad hoc n'est qu'une exception au droit commun, que le code nous p\u00e8rmet d'employer seulement dans le cas o\u00f9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats du mineur sont en conflit avec ceux de son tuteur\nL'honorable juge Cross qui avec l'honorable juge Tessier diff\u00e9rait de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour du Banc de la Reine dans cette cause apr\u00e8s avoir cite l'article 269 C. C., dit:\u2014\nIt is therefore manifest that there is no room for a tutor ad hoc for minors who have no tutor.\nSir Andrew Stuart juge en chef qui a rendu le jugement en cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dit aussi en parlant de l'article 269:\u2014\nProviding for the only case when a tutor ad hoc can be appointed to minors and establishes the limits of the powers conferred by said appointment.\nEn 1871, l'honorable juge J. T. Taschereau, ci-devant membre de cette cour avait \u00e9galement jug\u00e9 dans la cause de Brousseau v. B\u00e9dard ([12]):\u2014\nQu'un tuteur ad hoc, ne peut intenter une action pour un mineur qui n'a pas de tuteur.\nComme on le voit, il y a une grande majorit\u00e9 des opinions exprim\u00e9es, jusqu'ici, par les juges sur laquestion en d\u00e9bat, en faveur de la n\u00e9gative contre l'affirmative soutenue par les trois juges de la cour du Banc de la Reine qui ont prononc\u00e9 le jugement. L'opinion des premiers \u00e9tant fond\u00e9e sur l'art. 269 C. C. qui ne me semble pas laisser de doute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, j'adopte leur mani\u00e8re de voir.\nPour confirmer ce que j'ai dit plus haut au sujet de l'erreur commise par li intim\u00e9 dans le choix du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 qu'il avait adopt\u00e9 pour la protection des appel\u00e9s, il suffit de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'art. 945 C. C. C. tel qu'amend\u00e9. Il est vrai qu'en premier lieu cet article n'avait pourvu \u00e0 la nomination d'un curateur \u00e0 la substitution que pour le cas o\u00f9 tous les appel\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9s omettant ceux qui \u00e9taient n\u00e9s mais cette omission a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9par\u00e9e par l'amendement qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que;\nTous les appel\u00e9s, n\u00e9s et \u00e0 naitre, sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en tous inventaires et partages par un curateur \u00e0 la substitution nomm\u00e9 en la mani\u00e8re \u00e9tablie pour la nomination des tuteurs Ce curateur \u00e0 la substitution veille aux int\u00e9r\u00eats des appel\u00e9s en tous tels inventaires et par\u00e9ages, et les repr\u00e9sente dans tous les cas auxquels son intervention est requise ou peut avoir lieu.\nD'apr\u00e8s cet article, ainsi amend\u00e9, il \u00e9tait clairement du devoir de ceux qui voulaient prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats des appel\u00e9s, de prendre ce moyen de les faire repr\u00e9senter. Le curateur n'aurait pas eu, comme le tuteur ad hoc des fonctions se limitant \u00e0 surveiller la contestation en cette cause et se terminant avec elle; mais il aurait eu la surveillance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des int\u00e9r\u00eats des appel\u00e9s assist\u00e9 aux inventaires et partages et aurait pu aussi les repr\u00e9senter dans le present proc\u00e8s; tandis que le tuteur ad hoc n'a aucun de ces pouvoirs. L'article 946 oblige le grev\u00e9 \u00e0 proc\u00e9der dans los trois mois \u00e0 l'inventaire des biens substitu\u00e9s et \u00e0 la pris\u00e9e des effets mobiliers. Au d\u00e9faut du grev\u00e9 de faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cet inventaire, les appel\u00e9s, leurs tuteurs ou curateurs et le tuteur \u00e0 la substitution sont tenus de faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cet inventaire. Le code a comme on le volt, amplement pourvu \u00e0 la protection des int\u00e9r\u00eats des appel\u00e9s par la nomination d'un curateur a la substitution dont les fonctions sont clairement d\u00e9finies, et qu'aucune loi n'autorise un tuteur ad hoc \u00e0 exercer. La tutelle ad hoc n'\u00e9tait donc pas le mode \u00e0 adopter, mais bien la nomination d'un curateur \u00e0 la substitution.\nL'honorable juge Taschereau m'a remis une liste d\u2019autorit\u00e9s sur lesquelles il se fonde pour arriver \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que moi et je me fais un plaisir de les ajouter \u00e0 mes notes, viz:\nLe d\u00e9faut de qualit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre oppose en tout \u00e9tat de cause, m\u00eame en appel.

P. and issue having been joined on the pleadings under art. 820 C. C. P., the petition was dismissed by the Superior Court. From that judgment McK. appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) and that court maintained the judgment of the Superior Court. Thereupon McK. appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nOn motion to quash for want of jurisdiction;\nHeld. that the judgment was a final judgment in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sec. 28 ch. 135 R. S. of C. and therefore appealable\u2014Taschereau J. dissenting. Stanton, v. Canada Atlantic Ry. Co. reviewed ([1]).\nOn the merits it was :\nHeld, per Ritchie C. J., Fournier and Taschereau JJ. that a fraudulent preference to one or more creditors is a secretion within the meaning of art. 798 C.C.P.\nAlso that an endorser of a note discounted by a bank has the right under art. 1953, C. C. to avail himself of the remedy provided by art 793 C. C. P. if the maker fraudulently disposes of his property (Strong, Henry, Gwynne JJ. contra.)\nThe court being equally divided the appeal was dismissed without costs.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ([2]) sitting at Montreal, rendered on the 27th day of January, 1887, and confirming a judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing a petition of the appellant to quash a writ of capias ad respondendum issued against him by the respondent\nThis was an action brought by the respondent on the 26th November, 1888, against the appellant to recover the sum of $29,686.99, being the amount of 21 promissory notes signed by Sharpe & Mackinnon, the appellant firm, and was instituted by a writ of capias upon an affidavit of the respondent, alleging that the respondent had reason to believe and verily believes that the appellant was about immediately to leave the Province of Canada with intent to defraud his creditors in general, and the respondent in particular, and that the departure of the appellant would deprive the respondent of his recourse. In the affidavit were given the reasons for the belief of the said respondent, and also in the said affidavit the respondent swore that the said appellant had secreted and made away with, and was about immediately to secrete and make way with his property and effects and the effects of the firm of Sharpe and Mackinnon, with intent to defraud his creditors in general and the respondent in particular.\nThe appellant fyled a petition to be discharged from arrest under said capias in which he denied the allegations of the affidavit, also alleging in the said petition that the notes mentioned in the affidavit, were the property of third parties to whom respondent had sold and transferred them, and that respondent had no interest in the present suit, but was merely lending his name to third parties.\nTo this petition a general answer was fyled and the parties went to proof.\nAt the trial it was proved that the promissory notes sued upon had been given for value but had been endorsed and discounted by respondent at different banks in the city of Montreal at the time he made the affidavit for capias. These notes were however subsequently filed in the record.\nThe facts relied on by the learned judge at the trial for his finding that the appellant had been frequently dealing with his assess with a view of defrauding his creditors are as follows :\u2014\nThat in May, 1886, Sharpe & Mackinnon gave to the Bank of Commerce one of their creditors, a statement of their affairs up to the 31st December, 1885, representing that they had a surplus of $36,439.24 which statement was false and fraudulent.\nThat in July, 1886, they had to borrow money to pay their workmen and were on the eve of having to suspend.\nIn the months of August, September and October their affairs went on getting worse until the 20th November 1886 when they were obliged to assign.\nThat notwithstanding their insolvent condition being well known to them, they in the month of October 1886 sold goods to the amount of $43,393.74 on account of which they received a sum exceeding $20,000 which they applied to the payment of certain creditors by way of fraudulent preference and to the detriment of their other creditors including the respondent.\nThat Mackinnon had paid fraudulently and by preference to the respondent and to his other creditors, at a time when he knew he was insolvent considerable sums of money to the firm of Mclndoe & Vaughan, to Northey & Co and other creditors.\nThat on the last day that the firm of Sharpe & Mackinnon ran their business the bookkeeper Dennis and each of the partners took some goods and, realized on them, and each one appropriated two hundred and twenty dollars a piece. Greeyshields for respondent moved to dismiss appeal for want of jurisdiction, the appeal only relating to the writ of capias and not finally disposing of the suit Citing arts. 1797\u20148 C. C. P. Blanckensee v. Sharpley ([3]); Carter v. Molson([4]); Stanton. Canada Atlantic Ry. Co.([5]). McMaster Q. C. and Hutchinson contra referred to Arts. 8.19, 820, 821 0. CC. Goldring v. Hochelaga Bank ([6]); Phillips v Sutherland ([7]); Shaw v. St. Louis ([8]).\nThe court decided to hear the appeal and r\u00e9serve the objection.\nMcMaster, Q.C., and Hutchinson for the appellant. The writ of capias was asked for on two grounds : First that McKinnon was about to leave the country : Secondly that he was secreting his property in order to defraud his creditors See Arts. 796-7-8 C.C.P.\nThe writ of capias must contain a special prayer which, in this case, was for a money condemnation and that the debtor be imprisoned.\nArts. 819 820 821 C. C. P. provide for the discharge of a prisoner under a writ of capias.\nKeroack does not swear that he was the holder of the notes which had been discounted in three several banks. See Daniel on Negotiable Inst. ([9]); Byles on Bills ([10])\nAs to the secretion see Gautt v. Donnelly ([11]); Reg. v. Wynn ([12]); Emmanuel v. Hagens. ([13]); Quebec Bank v. Steers ([14]); Warren v. Morgan ([15]).\nGault v. Dussault ([16]) relied on by the respondent, is not applicable. The faces in this case show a perfect swindle from leginning to end. Greenshields for the respondent cited Dalloz vo.Mandat ([17]), as to the right of a pr\u00eate-nom to sue in his own name M for the benefit of a third party Also Pothier on Obligations ([18]) and relied on Gault v. Dussautt ([19]) and Mol-son's Bank v. Leslie ([20]) as applicable to the facts of this case.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014Assuming this is an appealable matter I cannot say the findings of the two courts on the question of fraudulent dealing by defendant with his goods with a view of defrauding his creditors is not fully sustained by the evidence; the question then simply resolves itself into this; Is such a fraudulent dealing and preference a secretion or making away with the goods as the code contemplates? The only question therefore it appears to me we are called upon to decide is as to the correctness of the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench in holding that a fraudulent preference comes within the meaning of the terms s secreting or making away with,\" leaving the other questions raised to be be tried out in due course in the courts below.\nIn the Province of Quebec it appears to be well established that so soon as a debtor finds himself in-solvent and unable to meet the demands of his creditors the general body of his creditors become entitled to an equal and just distribution of his assets, and he ceases to have any legal right to deal with or distribute his property otherwise, than the law directs, either for his own benefit or for the benefit of any other party creditor or otherwise whereby such an equal distribution is hindered and the intent and object of the code was, no doubt, to prevent any fraudulent making away by an insolvent with his property with an intent to render a just and equitable distribution of his property rateably among all his creditors impossible. Article 1036 of the civil cole, declares that every payment by an insolvent to a creditor knowing his insolvency is deemed to be. made with intent to defraud. I cannot but think that a disposition by a creditor of his property in fraud of his general creditors, or the individual creditor in the proceedings, whereby such an equitable distribution becomes impossible, is such a making away with his property as it was the object of the code to prevent by this article If then the intention and object of this provision of the law was to prevent an insolvent debtor from secreting or making way with his property with intent to defraud his creditors in general or the individual creditor how could this making away be better accomplished than by transferring his property with the intent indicated, in other words, fraudulently making away with his property to one creditor in fraud of his other creditors? What could the object of the article of the code be if it was not to prevent debtors from so dealing with their property as to put it beyond the reach of their creditors? I do not think \"secreting\" and \"making away with\" can be considered or dealt with as equivalent terms but I can readily conceive that there may be a fraudulent making away with without secretion.\nI am at a loss to understand what other construction can be put on the words \"ou soustrait\" \"or make away with,\" if it was not intended that they were to include and cover fraudulent dispositions by the debtor of his property that the limited primary meaning of the words \" cacher \" or \" secrete \" might leave doubtful; or in other words, if the legislature had intended that the primary meaning of the words in the English version \" has secreted or is a \u201cabout immediately to secrete \" or in the French version \" a cache ou soustrait ou est sur le point de cacher\" were to govern the construction of the sentence and be limette to hiding or concealing, why should in the English version \" or make away with\" or in the French version \" ou soustrait \" have been used and having been used what right have we to eliminate these words?\nI find in a French dictionary of high repute \" soustraire, means \u00f4ter quelque chose \u00e0 queiqu'un, le priver de certaines chooses par addressee on par fraude, deduire, diminuer, retenir, retranheer, \u00f4ter, d\u00e9tourner, receler' enlever, ecarter and in the Imperial dictionary we find \" to make away \" signifies \" to alienate to transfer as to make away property;\" and to make away with\" signifies t to put out of the way to remove.\"\nIf a debtor, knowing himself insolvent, secretes or makes away with his property when he has no right to do so in fraud of his creditors, what possible difference can it make in the eye of the law whether he secretes or makes away with the property for the benefit of himself individually or any member of his family or a stranger, whether a creditor or not having a right to the property with intent in law to defraud his creditors generally or the plaintiff in particular? What can be a greater secreting or making away with property under the code than with intent to defraud his creditors in general or the plaintiff in particular, to illegally transfer or hand it over to a person not entitled to receive it to be by him appropriated and dealt with for his own use? If this is not illegally making away with property I am at a loss to conceive what is : for so soon as the debtor became aware of his insolvency all payments made to a creditor are deemed to be made with intent to defraud and the debtor has no right to deal with his property, or put it in a position, where it would be inaccessible to all his creditors.\nIn Gautt et al v Dussautt ([21]) the head note is as follows :\u2014 Fraudulent preference, by which assess which should be available to the creditors generally, are given to one or more\u00bb is equivalent to secreting.\nDORION C.J. is reported as follows\nThe Chief Justice commented on the facts as established by the evidence, (which appear in the judgment below) and held that it was a clear case of fraudulent preference, amounting to secreting. His honor could not understand the attempt to make a distinction between secreting and fraudulent preference. The French version used the words cacher ou soustraire. This was the same as rec\u00e9ler which was d\u00e9tourner', distraire, divertir, the effects which should be available to the creditors generally and there could be no doubt that the acts of the respondent were equivalent to a recel.\nThere has been no doubt some conflict of opinion in the course of Quebec on this point but I think the height of authority and the reasoning is in favor of a conclusion at which I have arrived, and Ramsay J. in Gault v. Dussault, intimates that the Privy Council in Molson v. Carter ([22]) concurred in this view he says\nRamsay J.\u2014* * * but if a preference or any other disposal 'amounts to a fraud, it appears to me to be secreting within the meaning of the act. Secreting does not mean hiding alone but as the article says, any \" making away \" with property which shall put it unlawfully out of the creditors' reach. Thus one may secrete or make away with property by putting legal impediments in the way of the creditor, by which he is prevented from getting possession of it in order to be paid. I expressed this opinion in the case of Molson v. Carter, and I understand the Privy Council concurred in it Indeed, it is difficult to understand that the legislature could have intended it should be otherwise. I am at a loss to conceive why courts should use so much ingenuity to put a strained interpretation on the law to defeat its manifest object.\nIn Gault et al and Donnelly,Sep.9th 1887([23]), although it was held, that an undue preference given by an insolvent to one of his creditors, by selling him goods in payment of his claim, is not a s secreting with intent to defraud,\" and. does not justify the issue of a capias ad respondendum,\nDuval, C.J., dissenting says :\nIn this case a capias -issued against the defendant but was set aside in the court below on the ground that there was no proof of fraudulent secretion by the defendant. The majority of the court think that this judgment should be confirmed, but I am of a different opinion. The whole case turns upon the interpretation to be put upon the word s secreting.\" The facts of the case are that the defendant being the plaintiff's debtor and being insolvent, made over a portion of his property to Mr. Walsh, another of his creditors.\nIt is contended that this was only an undue preference, and doss not amount to a fraudulent secretion. But what meaning can be given to the term of secreting, if it be not a secreting to put property beyond the reach of the creditors, as was done in this case.\nI am of opinion, whenever, by any improper means, a creditor is deprived by his debtor, of the means of getting his just claims, that such act is a secreting.\nNo remarks were made by Drummond, Mondelet and Johnson JJ.who concurred in confirming the judgment.\nAnd in Molson v Carter Sir A. A. D\u00f4rion C.J. says ([24]) :\nIf a man, being indebted to his father, or to his wife, or to his family, knowing that he is insolvent, goes and pays them, so that the money cannot be reached by the creditors, he is guilty of secretion. Secretion, in the eye of the law, is putting property beyond the reach of the creditors.\nEven if this case was open to doubt I think article 12 of the civil code might be invoked with effect viz that where a law is doubtful or ambiguous it is to be interpreted so as to fulfill the intention of the legislature and to obtain the object for which it was passed; which, in my opinion, can only be done by giving the article the construction placed on it by Chief Justices Duval and Dorion.\nStrong J.\u2014lo. On the motion, I am of opinion that it should be refused, the case being appealable on the authority of Chevalier v. Cuvillier ([25]); and Shields v. Peak ([26]).\n20 On the merits Tam for allowing the appeal adopting the reasons of Cross J. that fraudulent preference is not concealing or making away with property. The weight of jurisprudence is in this sense. 30. Further it is shown not only that the notes were not due at the time of the arrest, but it is also Proved that they were all outstanding in the hands of three banks who were holders for value Granting that the non-maturity of the notes by itself would have been no objection to the arrest in case of notorious insolvency, yet we have here the additional circumstance that they were outstanding in the hands of bon\u00fb, fide holders for value. Keroack was therefore not a creditor in respect of the notes which he did not hold and he was not a creditor in respect of the original debt for which the notes were taken, for the English law that where notes are taken for a debt and\" the creditor endorses the note over, the right to sue on the original debt is suspended, is the general commercial law.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014L'action de li intim\u00e9, accompagn\u00e9e d'un bref de capias ad respondendum,\u00e9tait pour $29,68,09. L'appelant demand\u00e9 par requ\u00eate l\u2019annulation du bref de capias. L'affidavit donn\u00e9 pour l'obtenir all\u00e9guait 1\u00b0 que l'appelant \u00e9tait imm\u00e9diatement sur le point d\u00e9 laisser la province du Canada avec l'intention de frauder ses cr\u00e9anciers en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et li intim\u00e9 en particulier, 2\u00b0 que l'appelant :\u2014\nHas secreted and made away with and was about immediately to secrete and make away with his property and effects of his firm of Sharpe & MacKinnon, with intent to defraud his creditors in general and the respondent in particular.\nL'action est bas\u00e9e sur vingt-et-un billets promissoires d\u00e9crits dans la d\u00e9claration.\nPar sa requ\u00eate l'appelant nie les all\u00e9gations de l'affidavit et all\u00e8gue que les billets v mentionn\u00e9s sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de tierces parties auxquelles l'intim\u00e9 les a c\u00e9d\u00e9s et transport\u00e9s, qu'il n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l'action et n'est qu'un pr\u00eate-nom.\nLa contestation li\u00e9e un grand nombre de t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus. Le premier moyen\u2014l'intention de laisser la province du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, faute de; preuve et formellement abandonn\u00e9e lors de l'argument devant cette cour. Il ne rest\u00e9e que le second qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis par la Gour Sup\u00e9rieuee dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par celle du Banc de la Reine en appel.\nLors des plaidoiries orales devant cette cour, ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendu que le jugement dont il s'agit n'\u00e9tait pas appelable. C'est sans doute en ne consid\u00e9rant que comme interlocutoire le jugement rendu sur cette requ\u00eate que l'on se fonde pour soutenir que l\u2019appel ne pouvait avoir lieu que sur le jugement au m\u00e9rite. Ce jugement ne pent \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 celui rendu par cette cour dans la cause de Stanton v. The Canada Atlantic Ry. Co. L\u00e0, il ne s'agissait que d'un ordre rendu sur une demande d'injonction ne devant avoir d'effet que jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 autrement par la cour ou un juge. Cet ordre \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment d'un caract\u00e8re interlocutoire et n'avait aucune finalit\u00e9. Le refus du Conseil priv\u00e9 d'entretenir l'appel dans des causes o\u00f9 ii s'agissait de jugements interlocutoires ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 ici contre l'appel \u00e0 cette cour. Ces jugements n'ont pas d'application dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le code de proc\u00e9dure civile ayant \u00e9tabli des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales pour la d\u00e9cision des contestations sur capias. L'article 821 declare que si la contestation n'a lieu que sur la suffisance des all\u00e9gations de l'affidavit la cour ou le juge pourra en disposer sur audition; mais si la contestation est fond\u00e9e sur la fausset\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de l'affidavit la contestation dolt \u00eatre li\u00e9e sur la requ\u00eate du d\u00e9fendeur, suivant le cours ordinaire et ind\u00e9pendamment de la contestation sur la demande principale, \u00e0 moins que l'exigibilit\u00e9 de la dette ne d\u00e9paude de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de l'affidavit, dans lequel cas le bref pent Ctre .contest\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que le merite de la cause. Comme on 16 voit cet article fait de 1st contestation du capias, lorsqu'elle repose sur la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des faits de l'affidavit, une contestation s\u00e9par\u00e9e et ind\u00e9pendante de l'action principale et qui doit suivre le cours ordinaire de la proc\u00e9dure.\nDans le cas seulement o\u00f9 l'exigibilit\u00e9 de la dette est contest\u00e9e il est loisible aux \"parties de contester en m\u00eame temps le bref et le m\u00e9rite de la cause. La premi\u00e8re partie du 2e paragraphe de cet article rend obligatoire une contestation s\u00e9par\u00e9e lorsqu'il s'agit de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des faits de l'affidavit\u2014la 2e ne donne que la facult\u00e9 au cas o\u00f9 la dette est contest\u00e9e, de joindre le m\u00e9rite \u00e0 la contestation du bref\nLes parties n'ont pas voulu se pr\u00e9valoir de cette derni\u00e8re facult\u00e9, elles n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de joindre les deux contestations La cour n'est pas intervenue pour les y contraindre. Elles out proc\u00e9d\u00e9, comme cet l'article leur en donne le droit de m\u00eame que dans une contestation ind\u00e9pendante du m\u00e9rite. Le jugement qui s'en suit n'est donc pas interlocutoire. On ne peut donner une meilleure preuve qu'il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme final que le fait que l'art. 822 C. de P. C. donne au d\u00e9fendeur dont la demande a \u00e9te rejet\u00e9e le droit d'en appeler, sans se conformer aux dispositions du code de P. C., concernant l'appel des jugements interlocutoires. Je suis d'avis que le jugement dont il s'ag\u00eet est appelable \u00e0 cette cour en vertu des dispositions de l'acte de la Cour Supreme et de ses amendements qui r\u00e8glent le droit d.appel \u00e0 cette cour.\nQuant au m\u00e9rite j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que le premier moyen donn\u00e9 Pour obtenir le capias avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9. Il ne reste que la question du secreting\nJe ne crois pas devoir r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l'histoire des transactions de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont I\u2019 appelant faisait partie et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 allegu\u00e9es et prouv\u00e9es pour \u00e9tablir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait qu'il soustrayait ses biens dans la vue do frauder ses cr\u00e9anciers. Apres examen de la preuve, je suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le fait de cacher ou soustraire, suivant l'intention de l'art. 797, ses effets ou plut\u00f4t ceux do la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 amplement prouve.\nPour enlever \u00e0 ces faits prouv\u00e9s et rapport\u00e9s dans le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, leurs cons\u00e9quences juridiques comme \u00e9tablissant le fait d'avoir cach\u00e9 ou soustrait ses effets, on a pr\u00e9tendu qu'ils ne constituaient qu'une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence frauduleuse qui ne pouvait \u00e9tre un motif suffisant pour obtenir un capias. En effet il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu del\u00e0 qu\u2019une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence frauduleuse n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante. C'est la proposition d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Cross dans son dissentiment en cette cause fond\u00e9e sur les m\u00eames raisons qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9es dans la cause do Moison v. Carter ([27]). Avec tout le respect que j'ai pour l'opinion du savant juge, je no puis croire quo des faits que l'on qualifie do pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence frauduleuse, no puissent \u00eatre tout \u00e0 la fois une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence frauduleuse pour le cr\u00e9ancier qui en profite, et en memo temps une soustraction frauduleuse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard do la victime, \u00e0 li insu do laquelle ces pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences sont pratiqu\u00e9es. Pour la victime c'est \u00e9videmment une soustraction frauduleuse. Jo citerai \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard los opinions do Sir A. A. Dorion, juge en chef dans la cause de Gault et al v. Dussault (1) et do feu l'honorable juge Ramsay dans la m\u00eame cause.\nChief Justice Dorion said :\u2014\nIt had been decided over and over again by the Court as now constituted, that the remedy by capias subsisted concurrently with the Insolvent Act. He was not therefore prepared to hear the question raised in this case. The Chief Justice commented on the fact as established by the evidence which appear in the judgment of the Court below, and held that it was a clear case of fraudulent preference, amounting to secreting. His Honor could not understand the attempt to make a distinction between secreting and fraudulent preference. The French version used the words cacher ou soustraire This was the same as receler which was detourner, d\u00e9truire, diverting the effects which should be available to the creditors generally and there could be no doubt that the acts of the Respondent were equivalent to a recel\nRamsay J. :\u2014\nI concur so fully in which has fallen from the learned Chief Justice, in delivering the judgment of the Court, that I should have thought it unnecessary to add any remarks of my own were it not that T consider it important that there should be no doubt as to individual opinions of the Judge in this important matter. The question is simply as to the meaning of art. 721 of the Code of Procedure. As the Chief Justice has said over and over again we have decided that proceeding in insolvency did not deprive the creditor of the right to take out a capias, Again there is no doubt as to the proceeding being fraudulent. We are all agreed there was fraud. The effect of the transaction complained of appears to have been to reduce the available assess from 75 cents in the dollar to about 12 cents. The argument which has been pointedly stated by one of the learned judges who dissents, is that there may be a fraudulent disposal, which does not amount to secreting and that an instance of this is a fraudulent preference. I believe there is some authority for this view, but I confess I am unable to understand. I can conceive a payment being so trifling that it could not be considered fraudulent, but if a preference or other disposal amounts to a fraud it appears to me to be secreting within the meaning of the Act. Secreting does not mean hiding alone, but as the article says any making away with property which shall put it unlawfully out of the way of the creditor's reach. This one may secrete or make away with property by putting legal impediments in the way of the creditor, by which he is prevented from getting possession of it in order to be paid. I expressed this opinion in the case of Molson v. Carter and I understand the Privy Council concurred in it. Indeed it is difficult to understand that the legislature could have intended it to be otherwise. I am at a loss to conceive why courts should use so much ingenuity to put a strained interpretation on the law to defeat its manifest object. If it be said that it is figurative to call it secreting to pass a fraudulent deed to shield property from seizure I admit it, but I am not aware that in the interpretation of statutes it is necessary always to adopt the first meaning of the terms used. Dorion, Ramsey and Baby\u2014Dis. Monk and Cross.\nDans la cause de Molson v. Carter ([28]) Sir Aim\u00e9 Dorion dit :\u2014 It is secreting, in the eyes of the law, when a debtor, unable to meet his liabilities, fraudulently puts his property, or any appreciable portion of it, beyond the reach of his creditors.\nL'opinion de ces honorables juges fut soutenue par la majorit\u00e9 de la cour.\nLa jurisprudence sur cette question semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e par ces deux d\u00e9cisions. Je la crois conforme \u00e0 une saine interpr\u00e9tation de notre loi et \u00e0 une juste appr\u00e9ciation d\u00e9s faits. Je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de regretter que cette jurisprudence soit mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9, parce que les r\u00e9sultats ne pourront manquer de favoriser les transactions frauduleuses dej\u00e0 trop nombreuses dans les affairas commerciales.\nL'appelant a aussi pr\u00e9tendu que les billets promissoires ayant Ste escompt\u00e9s par diverses banques, l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas droit d'action contre lui. Cela serait vrai si la faillite de l'appelant n'avait pas mis fin aux d\u00e9lais accord\u00e9s par ces billets. Ils sont devenus exigibles de ce moment et li intim\u00e9 (art. 1953 C. C.), m\u00eame avant d'avoir pay\u00e9, avait droit d'agir contre l'appelant pour s'en faire indemniser. C\u00e9 droit de se faire indemniser constitue en sa faveur une action personnelle qu'il a droit de faire valoir par tous les moyens l\u00e9gaux. Il a tous les recours ordinaires et le droit d'employer les moyens conservatoires pour assurer sa cr\u00e9ance. Il ne iui en est interdit aucun. Le recours an capias lui \u00e9tait ouvert comme les autres.\nL' objection fond\u00e9e sur le fait quo les billets n'\u00e9taient pas en possession de l'appelant an moment ou il a donn\u00e9 son affidavit n'est pas s\u00e9rieuse Son droit d'action existait du moment de la faillite et le fait qu'il ne les avait pas alors no pouvait l'emp\u00eacher d'agir comme caution, parce que son action est fondre sur la faillite et l'obligation l\u00e9gale qui en r\u00e9sulte dabs ce d\u2019as di indemniser la caution.\nD'ailleurs les billets promissoires out \u00e9t\u00e9 produits et sont an pouvoir de li intim\u00e9 qui est pr\u00eat \u00e0 los remettre \u00e0 l'appelant si celui-ci vont les payer. M\u00eame si l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait qu'un pr\u00eate-nom ii aurait encore le droit d'action en les produisant comme preuve de son autorisation de poursuivre.\nPour ces raisons je suis d'opinion que le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 et l'appel renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014Two questions for decision are open in this case. The first is raised by a motion on the part of the respondent to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was not an appealable case. I have considered the matter and have arrived at the conclusion that the appeal was regular, and having had the privilege of reading a judgment prepared herein by my brother Gwynne refer to it for the reasons that have influenced my conclusion. The other question is as to the claim of the appellant to have a writ of capias under which he was arrested set aside and his bailbond given up to be cancelled. The affidavit of the respondent upon which the capias in question was issued and attested to on the 20th day of November, 1886, sets out that the appellant is indebted to the respondent in the sum of $29,686.09, and that he h has reason to believe and verily believes that the defendant James B. Mackinnon is about to leave immediately the Province of Canada, to wit the now Provinces of Quebec and Ontario with intent to defraud his creditors in general and the plaintiff in particular and that such departure will deprive the plaintiff of his recourse against the defendant.\"\n\"That my reasons for so swearing that the defendant is about immediately to leave the Province of Canada, are that I was informed yesterday by one Galibert of the city of Montreal that the said James B. Mackinnon had told him said Galibert, that he was about immediately to leave the Dominion of Canada and go to the United States of America to reside there permanently.\"\nThe affidavit goes on to allege that the said indebtedness was as and for the amount of certain promissory notes to wit the following notes. The notes are then described as made payable to the order of respondent and alleged to have been made by the firm of Sharpe and Mackinnon the appellant, and amounting to the number of twenty-one in all. It is shown that of that number but four had matured.\nThe affidavit then alleges the insolvency of the appellant and that of his firm and \" That the defendant \" has secreted and made away with and is about immediately to secrete and make away with his Property \" and effects and the property and effects of the said \" firm of Sharpe & Mackinnon with intent to defraud \" his creditors in general, and the plaintiff in particular,\" and t that without the benefit of a writ of capias \" ad respondendum against the body of the said defendant t the plaintiff, myself, will lose his debt and sustain ''damages.\"\nUpon the above allegations and statements, if true the respondent was justified in having recourse to the , writ of capias.\nIt was necessary, however, that the allegation of indebtedness to the respondent should be true at the time he made the affidavit in question and the writ issued. If the appellant was not legally indebted in any sum whatever to the respondent the foundation of his right to make the affidavit and to have the capias issued was wholly wanting.\nIt was shown by his own evidence that at the time of the making of the affidavit and the issue of the capias the respondent was not the holder of any one of the notes in question\u2014that he had endorsed them all and that when he made affidavit the Bank of Com mercer and other banks were the holders for value of the said notes The indebtedness was then to the banks and not to the respondent. He was then not the creditor but the guarantor only of the appellant. I will deal with that subject further on. The appellant in his petition denies all the allegations in the respondent's affidavit as therein contained. The respondent by his answer to the petition after alleging that the statements in his affidavit were true and that the statements in the petition were false alleges as follows :\u2014\n\" That the said petitioner at the date of the issuing \" of the said capias was about immediately to abscond \" from the Province of Canada, present Provinces of \" Quebec and Ontario and had secreted and was immediately about to secrete his property and effects with \" the intent as set forth in the said affidavit.\nBy the petition and the answer then, two and only two issues are raised, that is to say :\n1st. Was the appellant about to abscond, and\n2nd. Was he guilty of the charge of secreting his property and effects with the intent before stated.\nAs to the first it is only necessary to say that the charge was not only unsustained but disproved, and it was so so found by the court below.\nThe second requires to be fully considered in the light of the evidence adduced; and it is necessary to see what the real issue is and how it is provided to be disposed of. Article 819 of the code of civil procedure provides for the, presentation of the petition. Article \" 821 provides \" But if the contestation is founded on \" the falsity of the allegations, issue must be joined on \" the petition of the defendant in the ordinary course, \" &c.\"\nIt is shown above that such issue has been joined and by it we have but to determine if the r\u00e9pondent has shown that the appellant was guilty of the concealment or that he was about immediately to be so guilty. That being the only issue raised we can consider no other The statement in the affidavit is that he had secreted and made away with &c. The latter three words are not in the answer of the respondent and are therefore no part of the issue, but if they were I do not think the fact would vary it so far at all events, as this case is concerned.\nArticle 2277 C. C. provides that the arrest of a debtor by a writ of capias ad respondendum shall be according to the provisions of chap. 87 of the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada and in the manner and form specified in the code of civil procedure.\nThe 1st. section of that act in the English version provides for such arrest on an affidavit setting out, among\" other things, \" that the defendant hath secreted \" or is about to secret his property &c.\"\nThe corresponding section in the French version is \" Ou que le d\u00e9fendeur a cache ou est sur le point de cacher ses biens et effets &c.\"\nWe look in vain in the one for the words \u201csoustrait\" and in the other for the words \" make away with &c \"\nArticle 797 of the civil code of procedure in the English version provides for the issuing of a capias against a defendant t if the latter is about to leave i immediately the Province of Canada, or if he secretes \" his property with intent to defraud his creditors.\" The latter provision in the French version is \" si ce \" dernier est. sur le point de quitter imm\u00e9diatement la P Province du Canada ou s'il soustrait ou cache sea biens, dans la vue de frauder ses cr\u00e9anciers.\" The statute and the code of procedure are provided by the civil code as our guides to determine as to the right to issue the capias. Both versions of the statute limit it to the fact of secreting and the English version of the code of procedure does the same. What then is the reasonable conclusion? It is that the use of the word \" soustrait in the French version of the latter was not intended to provide another and different cause for an arrest; but was merely intended to express the views of the legislature by the use of two words instead of one. Besides, what is the legitimate meaning of s soustrait.\" The verb soustraire means t to take \" \" to take away,\" \" to preserve,\" \" to save,\" \" to secure,\" \"to shelter,\" \" to screen\" \" to subtract.\" The term therefore, as embodied in the code of procedure must refer to something alleged to have been done with his property, and selecting the words \" to shelter \" or \" screen \" as being the most appropriate I would construe the provision simply to mean a sheltering, screening or secreting of his property.\nI therefore think that in constructing the French version referred to we must limit the provision to \" secreting.\" I have read the evidence bearing on this issue and cannot find anything approaching to the establishment of the allegation of secreting. The respondent admits in his evidence that he had no personal knowledge of any such thing, and no one of his witnesses proved anything more. Instead of any such secreting the negative was most fully proved by a number of witnesses. Much stress has been laid on the fact that in the month of May previous, the appellant's firm exhibited a statement (not to the respondent but to other parties with whom they were dealing) showing a balance of about $30,000 of assess over liabilities and as in November following they were deficient to meet their liabilities they must have secreted. To say the least this under any circumstances cold only be received as very weak evidence, and of bit an inferential character. The matter was, however, very fully, and to my mind, satisfactorily explained by the appellant's book-keeper who, says that the statement was wholly made up by him and that he did it in good faith and without any suggestions from his principals or either of them but that he had not reliable data from one of the manufacturing establishments, and had to estimate largely as to it; and that he made a large error in the statement. He however, and those having charge of different branches of the business establish by their testimony that no secreting or improper handling of any of the assets took place, and give evidence that shows that none could have taken place.\nI will now deal with the objection that the respondent was not the creditor of the appellant when the capias was issued.\nMr. Justice Tessier in his judgment for the majority of the court lays down the legal proposition that the respondent as endorser, but not the holder of the notes, can by action recover the amount of them. He says :\nLa premiere objection de l'appellant est que l'Intim\u00e9 n'est pas le v\u00e9ritable cr\u00e9ancier et ne peut poursuivre en son nom \" qu'il n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans cette poursuite \" et qu'il ne fait que pr\u00eater son nom \u00e0 d'autres parties.\"\nIl faut observer que la demande est fond\u00e9e sur des billets promissoires sur lesquels Mackinnon est prometteur avec Sharpe son cidevant associ\u00e9, donn\u00e9s \u00e0 Keroack qui les a endoss\u00e9es et fait escompter dans certaines Banques.\nIl s'en suit que quoique les Banques soient cr\u00e9ancieres des billets contre les prometteurs il a int\u00e9r\u00eat que ces billets soient pay\u00e9s par les prometteurs.\nEn poursuivant en son nom il suffit qu'il soit capable de remettre les billets aux prometteurs sur paiement par eux : c'est le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat que le prometteur Mackinnon peut invoquer.\nOr il est en preuve que Keroack a produit les billets dans la cause et one Mackinnon peut les obtenir de suite sur paiement. Keroack est cr\u00e9ancier de ces billets, a pris arrangement avec les Banques, il en est le porteur et tout au plus il serait procurator in rem suam ce qui est un int\u00e9r\u00eat suffisant pour lui donner droit de poursuite en son nom.\nThe learned judge after stating that the claim of the respondent rested upon promissory notes of McKinnon, & Sharpe, made to the respondent and by him indorsed and discounted in certain banks says that the banks were creditors thereby of the makers and indorser and that the indorser is also creditor of the makers and has an interest that the notes should be paid by the makers. He adds in suing in his own name it is sufficient that he should be able to give up the notes to the makers upon payment by them, and cites Daniel on Negotiable instruments as authority for the proposition that \" The production of the instrument in its possession is sufficient prim\u00e2 fadie evidence to sustain its suit.\"\nI do not think it necessary to accept the law as so laid down and ii the respondent had possession of the notes as a holder when he made the affidavit for the capias, the mere production of them would have been good prim\u00e2 facie evidence that he was such holder, and in that case he would be the creditor of the respondent, It is in evidence, however, by his own witnesses that he only got the mere possession of them on the morning of the day when the issues herein were tried; and the evidence further shows that he did not obtain such possession as a holder of them-that at that time they were proved to be the property of the several banks, and it is not shown how he obtained such possession or upon what terms, or that he had any authority to deal with the appellant concerning them. I, however, do not consider that such a consideration is material. A man cannot be permitted to arrest another for a debt not due to him but to a third party, and when the legality of the arrest is questioned to purchase the debt from the other party and get an assignment of it. We can only look at the position of the case when the affidavits for the arrest were made. It was either right or wrong, regular or irregular, then; and if not right or regular then nothing done afterwards can be admitted to make the wrong right or the irregular regular. At the time of the making of the affidavits the creditors of the appellant thought the notes in question were the banks and it cannot be contended he at the same time owed the same debt also to the respondent. Payment to the respondent when the affidavit was made would have been no bar to the claims of the banks as holders and they, disregarding the proceedings of the respondent against the appellant, might, if otherwise justified, have each issued a capias against the appellant.\nThe right to issue a capias ad respondendum is wholly founded on the statute and the two codes before referred to; and no one has the right to cause an arrest unless under the conditions therein specified.\nSec. 1 of the statute requires that the affidavit must he made by the plaintiff or his book-keeper, \u201cclerk or legal attorney that the defendant is personally indebted to the plaintiff, &c.\u201d\nThe legal interpretation of the term \" indebted \" is well known and appreciated. That the appellant at the time in question was indebted to the banks cannot be contested. That he was indebted to the respondent I cannot admit, and if not so indebted he had no right to swear he was and have the capias issued and executed by causing his arrest. Article 2314 C. C. prescribes the act of an indorser to entitle him to recover against either an acceptor or drawer of a bill as follows :\u2014 \" Payment by an indorser entitles him to recover from \" the acceptor and drawer and all the indorsers prior \" to himself.\" The respondent is not shown to have paid any of the bills when he made the affidavit and therefore he had no right of action against the appellant. Besides seventeen of the bills had not matured; and therefore at the time no cause of action existed in either the banks, the holders or in the respondent Here is an action brought on bills of which the banks are the holders and to whom the amount of them is due. If the respondent is allowed to proceed to judgment he would recover upon notes seventeen of which were not due and the remaining four held by and due to the banks. On the latter four the banks could proceed to judgment immediately, and on maturity of the others could do the same as they each fell due In the meantime if the respondent obtained judgment he could levy for the amount of it and take the appellant's property from the control of the banks. I am free to admit that had he taken the proceedings in question as the duly authorized agent or pr\u00eate-nom of the banks each could no doubt have taken measures to realize what was due to each separately out of the judgment, if the means of doing so were available, but there is no evidence of such agency or of his authority as such pr\u00eate-nom. His proceeding was not adopted by the banks when the capias was issued nor was it even at the trial It was proved by the managers of the banks that the notes were at the time of the trial the property of the banks and no evidence was given that the respondent had any authority to take the proceedings he did. All then that the banks could do was to look to the respondent as the indorser of the notes. The re-suit too of the respondent's obtaining judgment would be to enable him to recover and enforce the payment of the seventeen notes not yet due months before the respondent promised to pay them, and thus obtain a position which the holders could not obtain. This view is of course independent of the provision that when bankruptcy takes place notes and bills running become due but they would become due only to the legal holders.\nThe remaining point to be disposed of is as to the allegation of secretion. There is no evidence whatever that the appellant or his firm directly secreted any of his property, but it is claimed that their dealing with their property after the month of May before his arrest was fraudulent, and that being so it amounted to a secreting within the meaning of the statute and the codes referred to. I have read and considered the evidence very carefully and have failed to see in it anything to sustain the charge.\nThe evidence shows that after the statement was made up in May the appellants firm, continuing their large manufacturing business with means and with aid derived from several parties made payments to them in the ordinary way of business, and to some in larger proportions than to others. During the period in question they purchased largely from the respondent, giving the notes of the firm to the amount stated in his affidavit,\u2014 but four only of which Were due when it was made and they only for a few days\u2014and the amount of them was about $4000. The payments made to the other creditors of which the respondent complains were made before the four notes fell due and as far as I can see were made for debts previously due and for advances in cash. The payments so made cannot be called fraudulent and were made before the respondent's notes had matured. I am not now dealing with the question of unjust preference, as that question does not arise under the issue but if it did I should be slow to say that even within the provisions of the bankrupt act there was evidence to sustain such a charge. I am therefore of opinion that in this case the charge of fraudulently dealing with their property is not sustained by evidence.\nIf however such had been established I am of opinion it would not have authorized the arrest of the appellant. There was no secreting of the property shown and without evidence of it I cannot add to the provisions of the statute and codes, but feel it my duty to decide that all that was proved instead of sustaining the charge of secrecy most fully rebuts it. By the law in Quebec a man finding himself unable to meet the demands of his creditors is authorized to make an assignment of his estate in trust for the benefit of all his creditors without preference. This the appellant and his firm did on the day the affidavit of the respondent was made and the latter was by it made the trustee No creditor could complain of such an assignment and none would be hardy enough to say that the execution of such an assignment should be called a \" secreting.\" I have read the cases in Quebec bearing on this question but they run in both directions Some of them go so far as to say that a man making preferential payments to some of his creditors becomes amenable to arrest I cannot sustain such a doctrine. I maintain that it becomes s secreting \" when a party disposes of his property so far as to secrete it from his creditors for his own benefit or at all events hides or conceals it in such a way that his creditors may not be able to find it. Such and such only is, in my judgment, the case intended to be provided for, and the arrest is provided for to enable creditors, as far as possible, to recover possession of or control over the property secreted. To say that making preferential payments to one or more of a man's creditors means a secreting of his property is to my mind a perversion of language. Statutes abridging the liberty of a man or limiting his common law rights are properly held to be construed strictly. If so what right has any court to say in such a case as the present that the legislature meant more than it has said? I make no apology if I express views on this question different from those of the learned judges in Quebec as given in some of the later cases The learned judges of those course may feel bound to adopt decisions previously made but it is the privilege as well as the duty of this court to declare; the law. If, indeed, the legislature recognized the validity of such decisions the case would be very different. To sustain the judgment in this case would be, in my opinion, usurping by this court the power of the legislature.\nI am of opinion, for reasons given, and for those contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross, that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the bond in question ordered to be cancelled.\nTASCHEREAU \u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction. But as the majority hold the cause appealable, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J\u2014 In my opinion this case is appeasable and is not governed by Stanton v. The Canada Atlantic Railway Company ([29]), the circumstances of which case were quite dissimilar to those of the present case. In that case Mr. Justice Torrance had ordered the issue of a writ of injunction enjoining the respondents and certain other persons named therein from issuing or dealing with certain bonds until otherwise ordered by the court or a judge thereof. Upon a motion subsequently made before Mr. Justice Mathieu that learned judge suspended the writ until the final adjudication of the action on the merits. This decision of Mr. Justice M athieu had the same effect in substance, as if the temporary injunction which had been granted by Mr. Justice Torrance had never been granted. Now it is to be observed first that the application for the in-junction was made to the discretion of the judge, it was not a matter of right. The object the plaintiff had m applying for it was to deal temporarily with what was the very gist of the action upon the merits, and its effect would have been to secure to the plaintiff until the hearing of the cause upon the merits, or until the court or a judge should make further order to the contrary, the benefit which the plaintiff sought to obtain permanently at the final hearing upon the merits. A d\u00e9cision granting or refusing the injunction was therefore purely of an interlocutory character not having any finality in it.\nBut in the case of an arrest the law authorizes, before the trial of the action a contestation with the same formality as that attending the trial of the action upon the falsity of the allegations in the affidavit upon which the writ of Capias is founded. These allegations are that the defendant is personally indebted to the plaintiff in a sum amounting to or exceeding forty dollars upon a certain cause or certain causes of action set out in the affidavit and that the deponent has reason to believe and verily believes, for reasons specially stated in the affidavit, that the defendant is about to leave immediately the Province of Canada with intent to defraud his creditors in general, or the plaintiff in particular, and that such departure will deprive the plaintiff of his recourse against the defendant : or, besides the existence of the debt as above mentioned that the defendant has secreted or made away with or is about to secrete or make away with, his property and effects with such intent.\nOne of these last mentioned acts committed or intended to be committed with intent to defraud must co-exist with the debt to the plaintiff to justify the arrest of the defendant.\nNow by the 821st article of the C. C. P. it is provided that if a contestation is founded upon the falsity of the allegations in the affidavit, issue must be joined upon the petition of the defendant in the ordinary course and independently of the contestation upon the principal demand, unless the eligibility of the debt depends upon the truth of the allegations of the affidavit in which case the writ may be contested together with the merits of the case.\nIf the existence of the debt alone without more, was what the defendant had put in contestation by his petition, it might be very proper that the contestation as to the legality of the arrest should take place together with the contestation upon the merits of the action. But when the existence of the debt and the truth of the other allegations, necessary to be established to justify the arrest, are all contested, as these latter allegations are not matters issuable in the action the defendant seems to have a right under this article to have the whole matter tried at once upon petition in advance of, and wholly independently of, the trial of the action upon its merits. That was what in point of fact did take place in the present case.\nThe affidavit upon which the writ of capias was founded was made by the plaintiff and it alleged that the defendant was personally indebted to the plaintiff upon 21 promissory notes set out in the affidavit, four of which were overdue and the residue not yet due and payable according to their tenor, but it alleged that the defendant had become insolvent : it also alleged that the plaintiff had reason to believe for a cause therein stated that the defendant was about to leave Canada with intent to defraud his creditors and that the defendant has secreted and made away with and is about to secrete and make away with, his property and effects and the property and effects of a firm of Sharpe & McKinnon of which the defendant was a member, with intent to defraud his creditors generally and the plaintiff in particular.\nThe defendant by his petition contested every one of these allegations, and the court, being of opinion that the allegation of the intent to leave Canada with intent to defraud had not teen established but that the existence of the debt and the secreting of his property and effects by the defendant with intent to defraud had been, delivered judgment maintaining the validity and legality of the arrest.\nNow although the existence of the debt is a matter inquire bee in the action when tried upon its merits, still the allegation of fraudulently secreting his property by the defendant is not; that is a matter wholly collateral to and independent of, the matters which are issuable in the action and the co-existence of this fraud with the debt is absolutely necessary to sustain the judgment of the court; the point adjudicated by the judgment is a point wholly independent of the matters which are issuable in the action, and for the trial of which the law has provided an independent procedure; the judgment of the court is conclusive upon the only matter which is adjudicated by it, namely the validity of the capias and the arrest and is therefore a final judgment upon a matter or judicial proceeding within the clause of the statutes regulating appeals to this court t and being appealable the whole of the matters contested by the issues joined upon the defendants petition are now open before this court.\nUpon the merits of the appeal I am of opinion that the evidence clearly shows that at the time the plaintiff made the affidavit upon which the writ of capias issued under which the defendant was arrested he was not the holder of any of the promissory notes in his affidavit mentioned as constituting the debt then alleged to have been due from the defendant to him but on the contrary these notes were some of them the property of the Molson's Bank, some the property of the National Bank, and the residue the property of the Merchants' Bank, who were the holders thereof respectively and entitled to receive payment thereof. Four of them only were over due; the remaining 17 had not yet became due according to their tenor; but it was contended that in virtue of article 1092 C. C. the respondent having become insolvent he could not set up that the time of payment mentioned in the notes had not yet arrived. This article, in my opinion endured to the benefit of the respective banks, who were then the holders of the notes and to whom they were payable, and had not the effect of altering in any respect the relation which the plaintiff then bore to the defendant, which was that of surety only as indorser to the several banks who were the holders of the notes, and, as such, the creditors to whom the defendant owed the sums secured by the respective notes. The evidence also established that on the 20th November the defendant on the application and demand of a creditor made an abandonment of all his property and effects, and that he and his brother made an abandonment of all the property and effects of the firm for the benefit of their creditors as required by the civil code of the Province of Quebec, and the plaintiff was made provisional guardian of the insolvent estate and that such abandonment had been lodged in the prothonotary's office before the defendant was arrested under the writ of capias.\nIn the judgment of the Superior Court, which has been maintained by the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal, the right of the plaintiff to have arrested the defendant as he did is rested upon three grounds:\n1.That the plaintiff, as endosser upon the notes of which the banks were the holders, and as surety to the banks for the payment of the notes by the defend-ant, had the right under article 1953 C. C. to proceed against the defendant to be indemnified before paying or becoming the holder of the notes which had been transferred by him to the banks and that having such right he had the right also to arrest the defendant as his, the plaintiff's, debtor, to the amounts of the notes before the plaintiff should pay them or become the holder of them;\n2.That certified copies of the notes having been produced in conformity with article 101 C. C. P. at the return of the suit and the originals themselves having been placed in the record by the plaintiff upon the 6th December, 1886, it results as a consequence from these two facts that the plaintiff had been authorized by the holders of the notes to use them for his own benefit and advantage and that the defendant as debtor upon the notes could not contest the right of his creditor the plaintiff, to demand payment of them in his own name; and\n3.That the appropriation by an insolvent debtor of any portion of his property or effects by way of pay-ment to one or more creditor or creditors in preference to another or others is a secreting of his property with intent to defraud his creditors within the meaning of the statute authorizing imprisonment for debt.\nNow with respect to the first of the above grounds, the article 1953 C. C. only authorizes the surety to take proceedings against his principal to obtain indemnity against his suffering loss at suit of the creditor of the person for whose debt he is surety. The article does not alter the condition of the surety, or the relation which he bears to his principal. It does not convert the surety into the creditor of his principal or make the latter his debtor for the amount personally due to a third person; the payment of which amount the surety has guaranteed. The position of a creditor entitled to arrest his debtor is very different from the position of a surety entitled to call upon his principal for indemnity against loss by reason of default of the principal to pay the debt due to his creditor. The rights and remedies of the two are wholly different, a surety to a third person for the payment of a sum of money due to such third person by another is not competent in my opinion to arrest such other on his committing default in payment of his debt due to such third person, or upon his becoming insolvent: he cannot make the affidavit necessary to be made to support the issuing of a writ of capias at his suit.\nAs to the second of the above grounds, it proceeds upon a legal inference which is drawn by the court from two facts stated, one of which, as appears in the consid\u00e9rant, occurred on the 6th December, sixteen days after the arrest which is complained of was made. The inference which is drawn from the facts stated is one which cannot be deduced from the facts which are relied upon as justifying it, and further the inference drawn is directly at variance with the evidence. The evidence shows that the arrangement upon which the plaintiff became possessed of the notes from the banks who were the holders thereof and entitled thereto was not made until after the arrest of the defendant, nor until the examination of witnesses upon the defendants petition to quash the writ of capias was in progress, so that whatever authority from the holders of the notes which if any, the plaintiff may have acquired, in virtue of that arrangement of proceeding to judgment in an action commenced by him as holder of the notes at a time when he was not the holder of any of them the arrangement cannot be invoked to support a, capias and arrest made there under at a time when the plaintiff' had no such authority from the holders of the notes and had not possession of them. Even if the plaintiff had paid notes in full to the holders thereof and had thus become legal holder of them after he had arrested the defendant he could not sustain an arrest made by him in an action which he had commenced as holders of the notes when in point of fact he was not the holder of them\u2014a fortiori be could not sustain the writ of capias issued in the present case, and the arrest made thereunder by force of any authority derived from the holders of the notes subsequently to the arrest. The validity of the capias must depend upon the right of the plaintiff to issue it at the time when it was issued.\nAs to the 3rd ground upon which the courses below proceeded, I am of opinion that a payment to one or more creditors of a debtor although he be in insolvent circumstances in \"preference to another or others is not a secreting of the debtor's property with intent to defraud within the meaning of the act authorizing imprisonment for debt. Upon this point I need only say that I entirely concur with the dissentient judgment of Mr. Justice Cross in the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal.\nI am of opinion therefore that this appeal should be allowed with costs and that the arrest should be set aside and the writ of capias quashed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Mac Master, Hutchison, Weir & MacLennan.\nSolicitors for respondent : Greenshields, Guerin & Greenshields.\n[1] Cassels's Digest 249.\n[2] 15 Rev.

The Canada Company\nAPPLICATION to STRONG J. in chambers for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the decision on further consideration of the judge who tried the cause, without any appeal to the Divisional Court or the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe grounds urged in support of the application are fully set out in the judgment of His Lordship.\nGodfrey supported the application.\nMcCracken contra.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal directly to this court from the judgment pronounced on further consideration by the judge who tried the action, there having been no intermediate appeal either to the Divisional Court, or to the Provincial Court of Appeal. The application is of course made under section 6 of the \"Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879,\" the only enactment which authorises the making of such an order as is sought to be obtained. I am of opinion that the section referred to authorises an order being made in any proper case, as well when the proceeding in the court below is an action at law as where it is a suit in equity; and, indeed, as regards the province from which this case comes it would be almost impossible, in the altered state of the practice under the Judicature Act, to give effect to any such distinction. But I am clear that no such distinction ever existed. Then, it is objected that this section 6 does not apply to a case like the present, where it is sought to appeal directly from the judgment of the judge who tried the case (without a jury), no recourse having been had to the jurisdiction of the Divisional Court. I am against this objection also. Under the practice now prevailing in Ontario the judgment of the judge at the trial is in effect the judgment of the Divisional Court, and appeals directly from a judgment such as this to the Court of Appeal are according to the general course of practice. Every appeal from this province to the Supreme Court heard during the present session has been a proceeding of this kind, that is, one in which the appeal to the Court of Appeal was directly from the judgment of the judge at the trial on further consideration.\nIt remains, however, to be considered whether this is a case in which section 6, being, as already said, applicable, it is proper to exercise the power thereby conferred, and I am clearly of opinion that it is not. It is suggested as a reason for allowing an appeal directly to this court that an appeal to the Court of Appeal would be useless, as that court has already decided the point in dispute viz., that the period of limitation to an action on a covenant for the payment of rent is 20 years and not 10 years as the defendant contends. It is, therefore, said that this abstract point of law having been thus decided, and subsequent cases in England[1] having, as it is urged, since decided otherwise, it would be useless now to appeal to the Court of Appeal, inasmuch as that court, without regard to the English cases referred to, would adhere to its previous decisions. I could not admit this as a sufficient reason for making the order asked for even if I thought that the English cases referred to at all affected the question decided by the learned judge whose decision is sought to be brought under review. In the case of Moffatt v. Merchant's Bank[2], which is relied on for the appellant, leave to appeal direct to the Supreme Court of Canada was given because the Court of Appeal had not only decided the same legal question which the proposed appellant sought to raise, but had decided it upon the same actual state of facts and virtually upon the same evidence, oral and documentary, as that upon which the decision which it was proposed to appeal from had proceeded. Under these circumstances it was manifestly a proper case for giving leave for a direct appeal, since the Court of Appeal could not be expected to take a different view of the legal consequences flowing from the identical state of facts upon which they had lately pronounced. Here, however, it is, at the most, said that the Court of Appeal has decided the same abstract proposition of law which it is proposed to raise in this court if the appeal is admitted. I should regard this as an insufficient ground even if the assertion was found to be warranted upon a consideration of the decided cases. But it is clear the Court of Appeal has never pronounced any decision which would debar them from acting on the English authorities referred to if they applied.\nThese English cases, however, have no application whatever. The question which arises here was in England set at rest by Foley v. Paget (1), a decision which is wholly untouched by the recent English authorities. To my mind an appeal to this court on any such grounds as those suggested would be frivolous and unfounded, and as the foundation of an application under section 6 of the Act of 1879 for leave to appeal direct must be some reasonable ground of appeal, I hold that for want of any such ground this motion must be refused with costs.\nMotion refused with cost.\n[1] Sutton v.

B. contracted with C. et al. for the delivery of an engine in accordance with the Herreshoff system to be placed in the yacht \" Ninie \" then in course of construction. The . engine was built, placed in the yacht, and upon trial was found d\u00e9fective On the 31st August C et al took out a saisie conservatoire of the yacht u Ninie \" and claimed $2,199.37 for the work and materials furnished. B. petitioned to annul the attachment and pleaded that the amount was not yet due as C. et al. had not performed their contract, and by incidental demand claimed a large amount. After various proceedings the saisie conservatoire was abandoned and the Court of Queen's Bench, on an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court in favor of B., both on the principal action and incidental demand, ordered that experts be named to ascertain whether the engine was built in accordance with the contract and report on the defects A report was made by which it was declared that C et al contract was not carried out and that work and materials of the value of $225 was still necessary to complete the contract.\nOn motion to homologate the experts' report, the Superior Court was again called upon to adjudicate upon the merits of the de-mand in chief and of the incidental demand, and that court held that as C. et al. had not built an engine as covenanted by them, B's plea should be maintained, but as to the incidental demand held the evidence insufficient to warrant a judgment in favor of B. On appeal to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that court, taking into consideration the fact, that the yacht \" Ninie \" had since the institution of the action, been sold in another suit at the instance of one of B's. creditors, and purchased by C. et al. the proceeds being deposited in court to be distributed amongst B's.creditors., credited B. with $225 necessary to complete the engine, allowed $750 damages on Bs. incidental demand, and gave judgment in favor of C. et al for the balance, viz., $1,225 with costs.\nThe fact of the sale and purchase of the yacht subsequent to the institution of the action did not appear on the pleadings.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and cross. Appeal as to amount allowed on incidental demand by Court of Queen's Bench it was:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Sir W. J. Ritchie O.J. and Taschereau J, dissenting that as it was shewn that at the time of the institution of C. et al\u2019 s action it was through faulty construction that the engine and machinery \u2022 therewith connected could not work according to the Herreshoff system on which system C. et al. covenanted to build it their action was premature.\nHeld, also that the evidence in the case fully warranted the sum of $750 allowed by the Court of Queen's Bench on B's. incidental demand, and therefore he was entitled to a judgment for that amount on said incidental demand with costs. Taschereau J, was of opinion on cross appeal, that B's. incidental demand should have been dismissed with costs\nAppeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe action was brought for the recovery of an. amount of $2,199.37 being the balance of the sum of $3,199.37, consisting of an amount of $2,000\u2014the price agreed upon for the construction of an engine, and $1,199.37 for materials supplied to and work done by the plaintiffs for the defendant. It was accompanied by a writ of attachment by means of which the plaintiff caused to be seized the steam yacht, \" Ninie, \" upon which the work had been performed.\nThe pleadings, writings forming part of the con- tract and the various incidents and proceedings in the cause until the judgment now appealed from was rendered are sufficiently stated in the head note and judgments herein after given. .\nIRVINE Q.C. and Amyot for appellant contended that as a matter of fact, three courts and a report of experts, had all found that the plaintiffs had not fulfilled\" their contact to furnish an engine on the Herreshoff system, which worked perfectly; that their action was premature, and that the evidence warranted the judgment de-livered in the Superior Court in favor of the defendant on his incidental demand.\nBoss\u00e9 Q.O. for respondents contended that if there was any defect in the engine or its working, the appellant was responsible, as the plaintiffs followed the plans and had carried out his instructions, he having himself superintended the putting in of the engine and placed it in charge of a second class engineer who had never before heard of a Herreshoff boiler, and moreover, that as the engine had been sold to pay off the defendants liabilities, it was impossible for plain-tiffs to compl\u00e8te the engine as directed by the Superior Court, and the Court of Queen's Bench justly and rightly held that the defendant could not, by allowing the vessel to be sold, deprave plaintiffs of all recourse for the sum of $2,000 being for work which had in-creased the price of adjudication by that amount. On the cross-appall the learned counsel contended that if plaintiffs were entitled to succeed on the principal-demand there could be no cross demand, and, moreover that the damages claimed were not proved.\nIrvine Q.C. in reply contended that the engine had been placed in the yacht by plaintiffs and they were responsible for its proper working, and that the fact of the sale of the \" yacht \" was not before the court but if that fact is taken into consideration as a ground for saying that the respondents are no longer, through the fault of theirs, in a position of fulfilling their con- tract it must be remembered that it is equally admitted by respondents, that the yacht has been bought by them and is still in their possession, Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This was an action brought by Carrier to recover a certain amount claimed for the price of an engine for a yacht delivered to Bender. There is a cross demand for damages. It cannot be denied that Carrier did not fulfill his contact according to its terms and by reason of the non-performance of the contract a deduction from the amount claimed S. was allowed by the court below. After careful consideration of the case I think the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed.\nThe yacht has been sold at the suit of Bender's creditors, and he has consequently received its value less, it may be assumed, the amount the express found Carrier's work was deficient. By this sale it was obviously put out of the power of Bender tab call on Carrier to make good the deficiencies and complete the yacht. But he or his creditors must be assumed to have received the value and consideration for the yacht, which included the engine supplied by Carrier and for which he ought to pay less $225 the value found by the express, which the Court of Appeal adopted and with which we should not interfere, as the deficiency in Carrier's contract. In addition to this Bender should receive in reduction of the price he was to pay for the yacht, the amount of damages which Bender sustained by reason of the non-completion of the contract; this the Court of Queen's Bench has awarded him, amounting to $750, and I am not prepared to say erroneously. The result therefore is Viz:\u2014\nAmount of contract and materials\n$3,199 37\nDamages\n$750\nDeduction in accordance with report of experts\n225\n975 00\n$2,224 37\n$2,244 37 Paid on account\n1,000 00\nAmount awarded by Court of Queen's Bench\n1 ,224 37 STRONG J.\u2014I have read the judgment which will be delivered by my brother Fournier and 1 concur in the conclusions which he has arrived at and the reasons given by him therefore.\nFOURNIER .J.\u2014Cette cause, quoique en apparence fort compliqu\u00e9e par les nombreux incidents do proc\u00e9dures auxquels elle a donn\u00e9 lieu, n'offre cependant qu'une simple question de fait \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre.

Iva cour a aussi consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'inexp\u00e9rience du m\u00e9canicien employ\u00e9 par l'appelant (Bender) a pu aggraver les difficult\u00e9s mais nanifiions ii r\u00e9sulte de la preuve que les vices inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 la machine et surtout l'absence di r\u00e9servoir d'eau chaude et autres vices de construction ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les causes principales qui out emp\u00each\u00e9 la machine de fonctionner. ici la cour au lieu de prononcer une condamnation obligeant les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 compl\u00e9ter leur contrat, a pens\u00e9 que Ta vente du yacht Infinie faite par autorit\u00e9 de justice par les cr\u00e9anciers de Bender l'oblige\u00e2t \u00e0 modifier son jugement, et consid\u00e9rant que quoique cette vente e\u00fbt mis les intim\u00e9s dans li impossibilit\u00e9 do compl\u00e9ter le dit engin elle no los dispensait cependant pas do r\u00e9parer los dommages que l'appelant avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 Ta dite v\u00eatit pour no lui avoir pas fourni une machin\u00e9e ou engin conforme aux conditions intervenues entre eux, lesquels dommages elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 la somme do $750. Elle a enfin condamn\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelant $225 pour. prix et valeur des parties du dit engin que les dits intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fournies et d\u00e9duisant ces deux sommes du montant de la demande des intim\u00e9s elle a condamn\u00e9 l'appelant Bender \u00e0, .payer $1215 aux intimes avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les d\u00e9pens de la demande principale en premi\u00e8re instance, moins les d\u00e9pens de la saisie-arr\u00eat et les frais d'expertise y compris les frais pour homologuer et faire rejeter le tout ou partie du rapport d'experts, chaque partie devant payer ses propres frais tu\u00e2t sur la dite saisie-arr\u00eat que sur les expertises qui out eu lieu, ainsi que l'appel des dits appelants.\nLes trois jugements d\u00e9j\u00e0 prononc\u00e9s jusqu'ici sur le m\u00e9rite de cette cause s'accordent tous sural nature du contrat fait entre les parties et sur les faits. que ce contrat n'a pas re\u00e7u son ex\u00e9cution.\nIl r\u00e9sulte des \u00e9crits des parties un contrat des plus explicites pout la construction de l'engin en question d'apr\u00e8s le syst\u00e8me Herreshoff Un seul point n'\u00e9tait pas finalement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par ces \u00e9crit s et requ\u00e9rait une preuve suppl\u00e9mentaire, c'est la partie du contrat au sujet de l\u2019installation de l'engin et de la responsabilit\u00e9 qui en r\u00e9sulte. Elle se lit comme suit :\nLes.mat\u00e9riaux et la main-d'ceuvre devront \u00eatre de premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9 et l'engin devra fonctionner parfaitement s'il est install\u00e9 par nous dans le b\u00e2timent.\nLes intim\u00e9s out pr\u00e9tendu par leur r\u00e9ponse sp\u00e9ciale que l'installation dans le yacht n a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par eux mais par l'appelant lui-m\u00eame qui doit en porter toute la responsabilit\u00e9. Cette pr\u00e9tention n'a \u00e9videmrnent \u00e9t\u00e9 imagin\u00e9e qu'apr\u00e8s coup dans le but de se soustraire \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de livrer un engin qui devrait fonctionner parfaitement s'il \u00e9tait install\u00e9 par eux. La preuve de cette installation par eux est compl\u00e8te, bien que les deux principaux t\u00e9moins qui en parlent\u2014Z\u00e9phirin Leblanc et Johnny Samson\u2014aient fait tout en leur pouvoir pour d\u00e9naturer les faits, D'\u00e2pres eux ce.-. n'est' que sons la -direction et les ordres de Bender qu'ils ont travaille \u00e0 cette installation et non comme ouvriers de la boutique des intim\u00e9s.\nPour faire voir jusqu'\u00e0. quel; point Leblanc a pouss\u00e9 sous serment la ccomplaisance pour son ma\u00eetre, je citerai cette partie de.son t\u00e9moignage o\u00f9 il se convainct de fausset\u00e9:\u2014\nQ. Vous consid\u00e9rez quo l'obligation do M. Carrier \u00e9tait finie quand. l'engin \u00e9tait sorti do Ia boutique?\nR. Quand i\u2019 engin \u00e9tait livr\u00e9 , oui.\nQ. Il n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 do 10 poser?\nR. Non.\nQ. Vous en \u00eates bien certain?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Vous consid\u00e9rez que la pose do l\u2019engin et le reste, c'\u00e9tait sous la direction do M. Bender?\nR. Oui.\nQ. M. Carrier n'a en rien \u00e0 y voir?\nR. Non.\nQ. Il chargeait bien le temps do ses hommes mais \u00e7a no faisait pas partie du contrat?\nR. Non.\nQ. C'\u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement en dehors de cela?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Comment expliquez-vous le fait quo vous veniez travail\u2019er comme cola pour M. Bender, que ce n'\u00e9tait pas M. Bender qui vous payait, c'\u00e9tait, la boutique?\nR. Le temps \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 a M. Bender.\nQ. Mais c'\u00e9tait la boutique qui vous payait?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Quelle affaire la boutique avait-elle \u00e0 payer pour M. Bender?\nR. Jo n'en sais rien.\nPar le langage assure et positif que tient le t\u00e9moin sur Ta nature du contrat On croirait que c'est lui-m\u00eame qui l'a fait. Il en limite l'\u00e9tendue \u00e0 la livraison- de l'engin; dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas oblige de le poser et qu'il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 sous la direction de Bender Cependant il n'a pas. \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent an contrat et. n'en a pu conna\u00eetre Quelque chose que par ou\u00ef-dire. Le contrat est par. \u00e9crit et les intim\u00e9s ont sp\u00e9cialement pourvu an cas o\u00f9 l\u2019installation de l'engin .e ferait par eux m\u00eames, Leblanc, qui travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 cette installation comme ouvrier de la boutique des intim\u00e9s, dont le temps \u00e9tait marqu\u00e9 par un des commis des intim\u00e9s et pay\u00e9 par eux, non pas par Bender, a, malgr\u00e9 cela, l'audace de dire que c'est Bender qui faisait installation.ill n'a pas d'autre motif pour en tirer cette conclusion que le fait que Bender assistait assez souvent \u00e0 des travaux o\u00f9 ii avait place la plus grande partie do son avoir. Sa pr\u00e9sence est suffisamment expliqu\u00e9e par son int\u00e9r\u00eat et ne constitue pas une ing\u00e9rence dans les travaux. Les m\u00eames remarques doivent s'appliquer au t\u00e9moignage do Johnny Samson.\nInd\u00e9pendamment des inductions tir\u00e9es par Leblanc et Samson contrairement \u00e0. la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des faits nous avons sur cette importante partie do la cause les all\u00e9gations des intim\u00e9s eux-m\u00eames, qui forment \u00e2 ce sujet une preuve compl\u00e8te que l'installation do. l'engin et des accessoires a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par eux-m\u00eames.\nOn a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu plus haut quo les intim\u00e9s dans leur affidavit pour obtenir une saisie conservatoire et dans leur d\u00e9claration, out all\u00e9gu\u00e9:\nQue tous l\u00e8s ouvrages et mat\u00e9riaux \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour la confection et l'installation do l'engin et accessoires d'icelui pour le Yacht \u00e0 vapeur \" Ninie \" alors en voie do construction par le dit d\u00e9- fendeur, et \u00e9taient indispensables \u00e0 la construction du dit yacht dans lequel ils out \u00e9t\u00e9 places par les demandeurs et dont ils forment maintenant Partie.\nCette d\u00e9claration si formelle faite par los intim\u00e9s eux-m\u00eames au sujet do l'installation de l'engin dans le yacht doit mettre fin \u00e0 tout doute et r\u00e9duit \u00e0. nant les assertions mensong\u00e8res de leurs t\u00e9moins \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Non-seulement ils admettent avoir install\u00e9 l'\u00e9ngin mais ils en demandent los frais Dana leur compete de particularit\u00e9s. Il r\u00e9sulte do tout cela que ce qui \u00e9tait ind\u00e9fini dans la soumission et l'acceptation \u00e9u sujet do l'installation do l'engin est devenu clairement et finalement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par los admissions des intim\u00e9s qu'ils ont eux-m\u00eames fait li installation et qu'ils 80 nt en con s\u00e9quence obliges de livrer un engin fonctionnant parfaitement.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont-ils rempli cette obligation? Il est \u00e9vident que non. Les honorables juges Caron et Andrews, qui out chacun d'eux s\u00e9par\u00e9ment jug\u00e9 cette cause au m\u00e9rite, out d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s n'avaient pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 leur contrat et out, en cons\u00e9quence, renvoy\u00e9 leur action avec d\u00e9pens. La cour du Bane de la Reine a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le contrat n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 dans son jugement, en partie cite plus haut, les principaux points sur lesquels les intim\u00e9s avaient failli \u00e0 leur obligation. Je crois inutile de les r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici.\nEn se fondant sur la vente du yacht survenue pendant li instance, la cour du Bane de la Reine a cru. trouver un moyen de mettre fin an litige, si dispendieux pour les parties; mais cette solution est-elle l\u00e9gale? En face d'un contrat aussi clair et d\u00e9fini et d'une preuve certaine et positive de sa non-ex\u00e9cution, la cour pouvait-elle se dispenser de d\u00e9cidera l'unique question soulev\u00e9e par l'exception temporaire, de savoir si les intim\u00e9s, sans avoir rempli leur contrat, avait un drift d'action? La preuve ne laissant aucun doute sur l'inex\u00e9cution du contrat l'action des intim\u00e9s devant \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. Cette proposition de droit ne saurait \u00eatre contest\u00e9e; il est hors de doute qu'une partie qui n'a pas encod\u00e9e ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ses obligations, n'a pas d'action pour contraindre son co-contacteur \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les siennes.\nIl n'est pas douteux que la vente du yacht augmente les difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9gler entre les parties, mais c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 cause de ces nouvelles complications dont nous n'avons pas les d\u00e9tails et dont il n'y a aucune preuve que la cour du Bane de la Reine aurait d\u00fb s'en tenir \u00e0 la contestation entre los parties. Chaque partie aurait eu dans ce cas cc qu'il avait strictement droit d'avoir. L'action des intim\u00e9s e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e comme elle devait l'\u00eatre, et l'appelant Bender aurait sans doute vu les intim\u00e9s se mettre \u00e0 l\u2019c\u0153uvre pour r\u00e9parer l'engin, le mettre en \u00e9tat de fonctionner parfaitement et aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure de l\u2019accepter en payant ce qu'il devait. Chacun e\u00f9t ainsi obtenu ce qu'il devait avoir d'apr\u00e8s son contrat. Mais on objecte la vente du yacht et on dit que les choses ne sont plus enti\u00e8res. Ii n'y a de celai all\u00e9gation ni preuve l\u00e9gale. Ce fait n'apparaissant pas au dossier n'aurait pas d\u00fb servir de-base au jugement sur le litige en question. Mais si on prend pour vrai le fait que le yacht a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu, il faut \u00e9galement prendre pour vraie la mention du fait que ce sont les intim\u00e9s qui en ont fait l'acquisition. Dans ce dernier cas ii n'v a donc plus aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 renvoyer l'action, par\u00e9e que les intim\u00e9s peuvent facile ment se mettre en position d'ex\u00e9cuter leur contrat vis-\u00e0-vis de Bender. Pans tous les cas qu'ils aient le yacht on non, le fait non all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni prouv\u00e9 do sa vein\u00e9e no pouvait justicier l'admission d'un droit d'action qui n'existait pas encore. Je suis en cons\u00e9quence en faveur du renvoi de l\u2019action principale.\nQuant \u00e0 la demande incidente bien que les dommages accord\u00e9s par la cour du Bane de la Reine ne me semblent pas suffisants pour couvrir los pertes subies par Bender mais sommeils sont d'une nature assez difficile \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser je ne crois pas devoir diff\u00e9rer sur ce point.\nJo sous pour confirmer l'opinion do la cour du Bane de la Reine, accordant $750.00 de dommages sur la demande incidente et les d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014 This case arose in the first place by proceedings taken on the 31st of August 1883, by the respondents to seize the steam yacht \"Ninie,\" then recently built by the appellant, and in which the respondents had placed an engine built by them, for the yacht under the declaration following:\u2014\nLos demandeurs representent;\nQue le d\u00e9fendeur leur doit une somme de deux mille cent quatre vingt dix-neuf piastres trente-sept cents, montant du compte produit. \u00e9tant pour les divers ouvrages et mat\u00e9riaux y motionnes; faits, fournis et livr\u00e9s per les demandeurs \u00e0 et pour le d\u00e9fendeur aux tempo, lieu, pour lea prix et des valeurs y mentionn\u00e9s, et sur la prom esse du d\u00e9fendeur do payer les dites sommes.\nQuo los dits ouvrages ont ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 faits tant en vertu do conventions verbales, qu'en vertu do la soumission en date du six mars dernier, maintenant produite et duement accept\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur qu'en vertu do l'ordre fait et sign\u00e9 par le dit d\u00e9fendeur le neuf mai dernier.\nQuo tous los dits ouvrages et mat\u00e9riaux \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour la confection et l'installation de l'engin et accessoire di icelui pour le yacht \u00e0 vapeur le \"Ninie,\" alors en vole do construction par le dit d\u00e9fendeur et \u00e9taient indispensable a la construction et completion du dit yacht, dans lequel ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 places par les demandeurs et dont ils forment maintenant partie.\nQuo par les dits ouvrages la valeur du dit yacht a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9e do la susdite somme et qu'ils ont termin\u00e9 et compl\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9 dit yacht et son \u00e9quipement.\nQuo le dit yacht est d'un port suffisant.

That was shown abundantly by the report of the express and so decided by all the courses. For that failure and the resulting consequences the respondents were by their contract liable unless the appellant was, at the time of the commencement of the illegal proceedings now under consid\u00e9ration, by some act or actions of his stopped from setting up that defence. The respondents alleged in their pleadings that the engine was built and all the other works done under the special surveillance of the appellant, but I cannot find the evidence to sustain that allegation. It is true some drawings were handed to them by the appellant, but his doing so was merely suggestive, and as they knew that he was not a person of any skill as to the matter they were not necessarily bound to adopt them, and if their adopting of them was apparently a deviation from the contract before doing so they were bound to so inform him and re-quire him to expressly adopt them in substitution. This does not appear to have been done. Besides, it is not at all clearly shown that the work was altered in any way by the fact of those plans or sketches having been given.\nIt is also alleged that the appellant superintended placing the engine and other works made by the respondents in the yacht. Such is to some extent shown, and if the failure in the working of the engine was shown to have been caused by any improper placing or putting in of the machinery that might be held to excuse the respondents. Such, how ever, is not shown, but on the contrary it is proved that the failure was caused by the imperfection in the construction of several parts of the machinery.\nHad, then, the respondents by the completion of their contract, or by showing that its want of completion was due to the appellant, shown that when they seized the yacht they had an available cause of action against him? If not, then the seizure was illegal and cannot be sustained. After the appellant had a trial of the machinery, of which he was previously unable to form an opinion, he immediately by a notarial protest and otherwise informed the respondents of their failure to perform their contract, and offered to re-deliver the engine and machinery to them to be made according to the contract. If not according to the contact it was then their duty to have accepted that offer font instead of doing so they caused the seizure of the yacht four or five days afterwards. Here then the dealings in respect of the contract ceased, and the question is to be decided solely as to the legal rights of the parties at that time. What look place subsequently as to the levy on the yacht by other parties, creditors of the appellants, her sale and purchase by the respondents, cannot and should not affect the legality of the original seizure by the respondents either one way or another.\nUnder the issues raised and the evidence as to them it is my opinion that the respondents failed to fulfill their contract, that they have not pleaded or proved any justification therefore, and that the appellant in consequence sustained serious loss and damage.\nThe express, who call themselves arbitrators, but were not, in one part of their report declare that the respondent (now the appellant) has suffered loss from the non-fulfillment of the contract on the part of the appellants (now respondents) to the gross amount of two hundred and twenty-five dollars. They find, also, that the ' condenser ' (a most important part of the machinery, and without which properly made no machinery can work properly, if at all was not made either in form, dimensions or connections, according to the requirements of the Herreshoff system.\" There is thus shown an important breach of the contract.\nThe express express an opinion that the want of knowledge and experience of the Herreshoff system on the part of the engineer who was on board the yacht was another cause of the failure of the machinery, but how can it be asserted in reference to machinery that. they themselves found was not according to Herreshoff's system.\nHerreshoff's system to work satisfactorily, as all other perfect systems, must be thoroughly applied, and if from ignorance or design a party who has contracted to supply an engine according to that system fails to do so in any important feature, the party for whom it is to be supplied need only ascertain that fact and refuse to take it\u2014even if it were of system superior to that contacted for and could be shown to be as good or better than it. If I purchase a horse to be black in color I am not bound to accept a white one, if even of more value. The same law applies to articles contracted to be manufactured by a particular person or at a particular place. It was an engine to be built on the Herreshoff principle that the appellant contracted for and that he was entitled to get and as soon as he discovered after a trial that it was not so and besides that it was defective and would not work he had a perfectly legal right to take the course he did.\nThe express have in my opinion not overestimated for the failure in perfecting the machinery by allowing two hundred and twenty-five dollars to which the appeal court added seven hundred dollars to the appellant under his incidental claim, deducting the aggregate of those two sums from the amount of the respondents' claim. I am of the opinion that the demand of the respondents should be dismissed and that the appellant is entitled to have a judgment for seven hundred and fifty dollars being the amount to be awarded by the court of appeal with costs in all the courses.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014 I would dismiss the appeal with costs and allow the cross-appeal with costs. Judgment against Bender for $1,975 with interest from service of action and all costs on the action and seizure not including those of expertise of which, each party shall pay half and. incidental demand dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs wild cross-\nappeal dismissed, with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Blanchet. Amyl &c Pelletier.\nSolicitors for respondents : Boss\u00e9 & Lancelot.\n"}

Proceedings were then taken by the appellant for an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, but the same have remained in abeyance, pending an application to a judge of this court to order an appeal directly to this court under sec. 6 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879.\nThe application was opposed and I have now to dispose of it.\nThe section in question provides, amongst other things, that by leave of this court or a judge thereof an appeal shall lie to it \"from the final judgment of any superior court of any province, other than the province of Quebec, in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding originally commenced in such superior court, without any intermediate appeal being had to any intermediate court of appeal in the province.\"\nUnder the provisions of that section ample discretionary power is, in my opinion, given to this court or one of its judges to make an order such as that applied for in this case, but I cannot assume that it was intended to be acted on unless some good reason could be found for doing so.\nThe reason advanced in this case is that the Court of Appeal in Ontario, in a case before it, decided the main point in this case; and that inasmuch as that court has in their judgment virtually settled that point against the appellant, it would be an useless expense to have an intermediate appeal to that court.\nThe case referred to is re Moulton and Haldimand[1]\nI have carefully considered it and am of the opinion that the decision of this case ought not to be affected by the decision in that. It was heard by four of the learned judges of that court. It was an application to the court by a writ of mandamus to compel the county of Haldimand to repair an existing bridge or the erection of a new one\u2014the bridge being part of a highway then opened up and used. The court decided that the duty to repair the bridge or erect a new one was on the county of Haldimand, but were equally divided as to the remedy sought, and the court below having decided to refuse the mandamus, the appeal was dismissed\u2014two of the learned judges arriving at the conclusion that the remedy by indictment was alone available.\nThe case now under consideration differs from that just referred to. The latter was virtually to compel the repairing of a bridge forming part of a highway then in use by the public. In this the proceeding is to compel the opening up of a new highway on land appropriated for it. The Appeal Court in Ontario, by an equal division of its members, dismissed an appeal from a decision that the remedy by indictment was alone available as applicable to the matter of the repair of the existing highway, but I could hardly conclude that any member of that court would be heard to say that the respondent township could be indicted for not opening up a new highway.\nThe decision of the one case does not therefore, in my opinion, in that respect affect the other, and the same learned judges who were of opinion that an indictment was the only means of remedy may be of the opinion that although mandamus is not the proper remedy in the one case, it may be in the other. I think, therefore, it would be a wrong exercise of the power bestowed on this court and its judges to allow an appeal directly to this court.\nThe application of the appellant is therefore refused with costs.\nMotion refused with costs.\n[1] 12 Ont.

The agreement made no provision for securing to A. the payment of his labor, but when it was drawn up there was a verbal agreement between the parties that in default of payment by B. the wood could be held by A. as security and be sold for the amount of his claim.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting, that evidence of this verbal agreement was admissible on the trial of an action of replevin for the wood by an assignee of A., and that its effect was to give B. a lien on the wood for the amount due him.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Manitoba ([1]), setting aside a verdict for the defendant and directing judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs.\nThis was an action of replevin and arose out of an agreement by the defendant to cut and haul a quantity of cordwood for one Andrews who had a license from the Hudson Bay Company, who owned the land on which the wood originally stood, to cut and remove it. The agreement between the defendant and Andrews was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cSewell, Oct. 6th, 1882.\n\u201cMemorandum of agreement made in duplicate this 6th day of October, A.D., 1882, between James Byers, of Sewell, in the County of Brandon and Province of Manitoba, lumberman, of the first part, and Geo. E. Andrew, of the said town of Brandon, hotel keeper, of the second part: Witnesseth, that the said party of the first part hereby agrees to cut and deliver five hundred or more cords of wood taken from section twenty-six, township ten, range 16 west and to be delivered at Sewell station at three dollars per cord, excepting what may be delivered before snow, which amount will be paid for at three dollars and twenty-five cents per cord, also to cut and take from section eight, township ten, range 16 west, two hundred cords or more at three dollars and fifty cents, the whole to be delivered at Sewell station before the twentieth day of March, 1883; and for the due fulfilment of the above contract the said party of the second part hereby agrees to pay to the said party of the first part the contract price less twenty per cent, for all wood according to measurement at Sewell station, which twenty per cent, will be paid on the fulfilment of this contract.\u201d\nAndrews assigned his license to cut the wood, and all his interest in the contract with the defendant, to one Stephenson, and by various mesne assignments it finally became vested in the present plaintiffs.\nThe defendant cut the wood and carried it to Sewell station, placing it upon the grounds of the railway company, where it remained until after the 20th March when, not having received payment for his work, he shipped three carloads to Brandon, where it was replevied by the respondents. On the trial of the action the defendant set up a parol agreement with Andrews made, as he alleged, at the same time that the above contract was signed, to the effect that if the amount due him for cutting and hauling the wood at the rates specified was not paid on the 20th March, 1883, (the date mentioned in the agreement) the defendant would be entitled to hold the wood as security and to sell it to realize what was then due. Evidence of this alleged parol agreement was admitted by the judge subject to objection by plaintiffs counsel.\nThe learned judge who tried the case held that such a parol agreement was really made, and that it vested the property in the wood in the defendant, who obtained a verdict in accordance with such ruling.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench set aside this verdict on the ground that the evidence of the parol agreement was improperly admitted as its effect would be to vary the written contract entered into by the parties. From this decision the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nEwart Q.C. for the appellant.\nThe original contract was entirely complete and the parol agreement can only be regarded as collateral; in fact, security is generally given by an agreement outside of the main contract.

McWilliams ([14]).\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Manitoba, reversing the decision of Mr. Justice Dubuc, before whom the action was tried without a jury, and directing judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs in the action.\nThe material facts disclosed by the evidence are as follows: George Andrew having a permit from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, authorising him to cut and remove from certain lands belonging to them a quantity of wood\u2014five hundred cords or upwards, on the 6th of October, 1882, entered into an agreement with the defendant, James Byers, to cut the before mentioned quantity of wood and haul it to a railway station known as \u201c Sewell Station.\u201d This agreement was reduced into writing by Andrew and was signed by the parties to it, and was in the following words:\u2014\nMemorandum of agreement made in duplicate this 6th day of October, A.D., 1882, between James Byers of Sewell, in the County of Brandon and Province of Manitoba, lumberman, of the first part, and Geo. R. Andrews of the said town of Brandon, hotelkeeper, of the second part; Witnesseth, that the said party of the first part hereby agrees to cut and deliver 500 or more cords of wood taken from section 26, township 10, range 16 west, and to be delivered at Sewell station at $3 per cord, excepting what may be delivered before snow which amount will be paid for at $3.25 per cord, also to cut and take from section 8, township 10, range 16 west, 200 cords or more at $3.50, the whole to be delivered at Sewell station before the 20fch day of March, 1883; and for the due fulfilment of the above contract the said party of the second part hereby agrees to pay to the said party of the first part the contract price less 20 per cent, for all wood according to measurement at Sewell station, which 20 per cent, will be paid on the fulfilment of contract.\nThe agreement was prepared by Andrews himself and the parties had no professional assistance.\nBefore signing, however, the appellant raised a question as to what security he was to have for the monies to be paid him under the agreement, and both he and Andrews state that it was then verbally agreed that he was to have security for the amount to which he would be entitled under the agreement upon the wood itself which, in case of default in payment, he was to be at liberty to sell in order to raise the amount due to him; in other words, that he was to have a lien or right of retention until payment, with a power of sale superadded.\nWhat passed between the parties is thus detailed in the depositions of the appellant and Andrews. Byers\u2019 evidence is as follows:\u2014\nQ. I want to know as to any security? A. I spoke to Mr. Andrews as to any security for this wood, for the pay, and he said it was not necessary to have any security for the wood, that he thought it was enough security that it was mine until he paid for it.\nQ. Was there anything further? A. He also said that it was agreed that if at the expiration of the agreement it was not paid, if he did not pay for the wood and take possession of it, that I had a right to sell the wood.\nQ. Had you known Mr. Andrews previous to that time? A. No, that is the reason I asked for security ; that was the first time I had seen him.\nQ. Now you spoke about a verbal agreement that was made with Mr. Andrews, now was that made at the time the writing was drawn up? A. Yes.\nQ. Who drew up the written agreement? A. Mr. Andrew.\nQ. And you signed it then and there? A. Yes.\nQ. And it was when this was being drawn up that you came to the agreement about the security? A. Yes.\nQ. It was not made afterward or before it? A. No.\nQ. It was part of the same agreement really? A. Yes, it was a verbal agreement.\nQ. But was really part of the same agreement? A. Yes.\nQ. Was there anything on the face of this document that induced you to sign it\u2014was there anything in this exhibit \u201c4\u201d that induced you to sign it? A. Yes.\nQ. What was it? A. I was to have the wood as security for my pay in case of his not paying me when the time was up, I had a right to sell the wood.\nQ. And that is what induced you to sign it? A. Yes.\nA. I spoke to him about security and he said he did not see that I needed any more security, that I had the wood, that the wood was my security until I was paid according to the contract, and that in case I was not paid at the time the contract was up I had a right to sell the wood.\nAnd this is entirely confirmed by Andrews as shewn by the following extract from his evidence:\u2014\nA. The bargain was, when he talked about security, and I told him that the wood was all the security he needed, that he could hold the wood until he was paid for it; I intended to take the wood right along as he got it out and pay the balance on the first of March when the contract expired.\nQ. That is the bargain that was made as to security? A. Yes, as to security, if I did not pay him he had the wood that he was the owner of it?\nQ. That is what was said? A. Yes.\nQ. Now what was the bargain? A. I cannot profess to repeat it in the same words. I cannot remember the exact words for three or four years. If Byers was not paid for the wood when the contract was completed, that he was the owner of the wood; the wood was his security.\nUpon the faith of this agreement the appellant went on and cut the wood and hauled it to Sewell station in fulfilment of this contract.\nOn the 4th January, 1883, Andrews assigned his right under the contract to one Stephenson who on the same day made a similar assignment to the firm of Woodworth & Rouncefell, who subsequently by two formal bills of sale dated respectively the 18th of August, and 26th September, 1883, transferred their rights to the present respondents. The wood remained at the railway station in the possession of the appellant until after the 20th March, 1883, the day fixed by the memorandum of agreement for completion and until some time in October, 1883, when the appellant not having been paid the full amount due to him for the cutting caused three cars to be loaded with wood which he designed to send forward to a market for sale, when the respondent on the 2nd of November, 1883, issued the writ of replevin in this action.\nThe appellant\u2019s pleas were, 1st, Non cepit; 2nd, that the goods were his and not the respondent\u2019s and 3rd, not guilty.\nThe cause coming on for trial before Mr. Justice Dubuc, it was objected that the parol evidence of the appellant and Andrews already set forth was not admissible to establish the appellant\u2019s right to security on the wood. The learned judge, however, over-ruled the objection and admitted the evidence, which he held to be worthy of credit and sufficient to establish the agreement for a lien. He also held that the execution of the written agreement by the appellant constituted a sufficient consideration for the supplementary verbal agreement, and gave judgment accordingly for the defendant.\nFrom this judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, which reversed the decision of the trial judge and ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs. The defendant has now appealed to this court.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench proceeds upon two distinct grounds. First it is said that the parol evidence was inadmissible, being excluded by the written agreement; and, secondly, that there was no consideration for the collateral agreement for a lien. I am of opinion that the court was wrong on both points. No difficulty arises as to the law of lien for it is beyond all doubt or question that a party to an agreement for the performance of work such as that undertaken by the appellant may stipulate for a lien on the products of his labor. And it is equally clear that subject to the applicability of any objection based on the rule of evidence invoked by the respondents that such an agreement may at common law be made orally and without writing ([15]). Further, no objection to such a stipulation being made without writing can be founded either on the Statute of Frauds or on the Chattel Mortgage Act. The Statute of Frauds does not in any of its provisions apply to agreements for liens, and the Chattel Mortgage Act is out of the question since the possession was to be retained by the appellant as it clearly was in fact according to the evidence.\nThat Mr. Justice Dubuc was warranted by the evidence in finding that this verbal agreement was actually concluded between the parties and that upon the faith of it the appellant signed the written memorandum provided he gave credit to the witnesses, cannot admit of dispute, and as regards the credibility of the witnesses his finding must be held conclusive. I am also of opinion that the learned judge rightly construed the evidence as shewing an agreement for a lien with a right of sale, and not as a conditional agreement for an absolute sale of the wood to the appellant in the event of non-payment. The parties had no professional assistance in the transaction and we must not therefore assume that they understood the technical meaning of the language in which they expressed themselves. Both Andrews and the appellant say that the collateral arrangement was for the object of providing security for the appellant. Andrews distinctly says, \u201cthe bargain was when he talked about security and I told him the wood was all the security he needed that he could hold the wood until he was paid for it,\u201d and again, \u201c if Byers was not paid for the wood when the contract was completed that he was the owner of the wood, the wood was his security.\u201d\nIt is apparent from the context that by the ownership of the wood here spoken of what was meant was ownership by way of security, the parties not discriminating between absolute ownership and special ownership by way of lien or pledge.\nThere remains therefore as the only point in the case the question as to the admissibility of the evidence, and upon this I confess I see little room to doubt the correctness of the ruling of Mr. Justice Dubuc.\nThe cases between landlord and tenant in which parol evidence of stipulations as to repairs and other incidental matters, and as to keeping down and dealing with the game on the demised premises, has been held admissible, although there was a written lease, Erskine v. Adeane ([16]); Morgan v. Griffith ([17]); Lindley v. Lacey ([18]), afford illustrations of the rule in question by the terms of which any agreement collateral or supplementary to the written agreement may be established by parol evidence, provided it is one which as an independent agreement could be made without writing, and that it is not in any way inconsistent with or contradictory of the written agreement.\nThe cases referred to as instances in which the rule of exclusion has been held not applicable are all fully stated and considered in the judgments of the court below and need not here be more particularly referred to.\nThese cases (particularly Erskine v. Adeane which was a judgment of the Court of Appeal) appear to be all stronger decisions than that which the appellant calls upon us to make in the present case, for it is difficult to see how an agreement, that one who in writing had undertaken by his labor to produce a chattel which is to become the property of another shall have a lien on such product for the money to be paid as the reward of his labor, in any way derogates from the contemporaneous or prior writing. By such a stipulation no term or provision of the writing is varied or in the slightest degree infringed upon; both agreements can well stand together; the writing provides for the performance of the contract, and the consideration to be paid for it, and the parol agreement merely adds something respecting security for payment of the price to these terms. Surely it would be competent to the parties, either contemporaneously with the written memorandum or subsequently to it, to have stipulated by parol that the appellant should have had as security for payment a lien or pledge upon some chattel belonging to Andrews other than the wood then delivered to him or already in his possession, and if such an agreement would not have been obnoxious to the rule of evidence in question it is hard to see how the circumstance that the lien was to be on chattels to be brought into existence under the agreement can make any difference.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the cases cited are indistinguishable and amply support the appellants contention, and that the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench must be reversed. I regard the question of consideration concluded by the finding of Mr. Justice Dubuc; there was not only ample circumstantial evidence warranting the inference that the appellant signed the written memorandum on the faith of having the security stipulated for by him, but there is direct evidence to that effect to be found in the deposition of the appellant whose testimony was fully accredited by the learned judge. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench seems to have overlooked this evidence for it is said there was no consideration for the verbal agreement other than that given for the written contract.\nIn the view I take, I do not feel called upon to consider the other questions which were raised and I avoid expressing any opinion upon those points.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and judgment in the action entered for the appellant with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurs.\nHENRY J.\u2014The determination of the issues in this case depends on the right of the appellant to change the legal effect of the following agreement under seal entered into by him and one George E. Andrew, which is as follows:\n(His Lordship read the agreement.)\nThe wood to be cut and hauled was the property of Andrews, and Byers was therefore only his employee or servant for the purpose of cutting and transporting it to the railway station at Sewell, owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. When so placed the appellant had by law under the above agreement no lien on the wood whatever. Any possession he had of it was only to enable him to fulfill his contract, and even that qualified possession was at an end when, in pursuance of his contract, he placed it upon property not belonging to himself nor under his control, but upon the property of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. His doing so would destroy any lien if any he had on it. The property in the wood therefore remained in Andrew, He, however, assigned over his property therein to one E. F. Stephenson who subsequently assigned the same to Messrs. Woodworth & Rowncefell, of Brandon, who before the beginning of the present action assigned to the respondents.\nOn the part of the appellant it is contended that a parol contract in relation to the wood in question was entered into between him and Andrews which, as may be stated substantially, was to give to the appellant the ownership of the wood, or at least a lien upon it, for the amount due him under the contract or until his account for cutting and hauling was paid. It is well laid down in Taylor on evidence, ([19]) as follows:\u2014\nThe first general rule which it will be necessary to notice respecting the admissibility of extrinsic evidence to affect what is in writing is that parol testimony cannot be received to contradict, vary, add to or substract from the terms of a valid written instrument, and that * * * applies to every document which contains the terms of a contract between different parties; and is designed to be the repository and evidence of their final intention.\nHe then proceeds at p. 966:\nHaving thus pointed out the class of written instruments to which the rule applies it may next be observed that the rule does not prevent parties to a written contract from proving that either contemporaneously or as a preliminary measure they had entered into a distinct oral agreement on some collateral matters. Still less * * * does the rule exclude evidence of an oral agreement, which constitutes a condition on which the performance of the written agreement is to depend.\nThere are many cases where parol evidence may be received to show a written contract void, but the principles affecting them are not necessary to be considered in this case.\nThere is no doubt that where there is a written contract a parol agreement on some collateral matter may be enforced, and that the operation of a written agreement may be limited to the happening of a particular event or otherwise. The rule in regard to the latter position will, however, have no effect on the construction and effect of the written document when once operative. If a man by writing leases a house and premises to another and the writing contains all that is necessary as to the holding, rent, & c, but makes no reference to the house as being finished or not, and the lessor makes a parol independent contract for a consideration dehors the written contract for the finishing of one or more rooms, that would be what might be considered as a collateral matter, although to some extent improving the house and rendering it more desirable as a residence. I have considered the decisions referred to by the learned judge who tried this action and consider them clearly distinguishable from the present case. It is true that in Lindlay v. Lacey (1) evidence of a previous oral agreement was admitted, but the case shows it to have been so admitted solely on the ground that it was specially made a condition of the execution of the written agreement, such execution being considered a sufficient consideration to bind the parol contract. That consideration was expressly proved and admitted, but it was not, as I shall hereafter show, in this case. Mann v. Nunn (2) has been cited but in that case the agreement by parol was entered into some days before the agreement for lease and the court held that it was independent of the terms of the lease which was silent as to the subject matter of the parol agreement, and that the execution of the lease was the necessary result of the previous parol contract and the consideration for executing it. That however is not the case here.\nIn Angell v. Duke (3) the result of Mann v. Nunn was at least questioned and it was virtually overruled. Lord Cockburn C.J. said:\nI agree with the cases which have been cited to this extent that there may be instances of collateral parol agreements which would be admissible but this is not the case here\u2014something passes between the parties during the negotiations but afterwards the plaintiff enters into a written agreement to take the house and the furniture in the house which is specified. Having once executed that without making the terms of the alleged parol agreement a part of it, he cannot afterwards set up the parol agreement. Mellor arid Field, Justices, concurred, as did also Lord Blackburn who said, \u201c It is a most important rule that where there is a contract in writing it should not be added to if the written contract is intended to be the record of all the terms agreed upon between the parties ; where there is a collateral contract the written contract does not contain the whole of the terms. As to the cases which have been cited I should decide Morgan v. Griffith ([20]) the same way. The decision in Mann v. Nunn I am inclined to think wrong but it is unnecessary to say how that may be. Here the lease expresses the whole of the terms\u2014the defendant agrees to let and the plaintiff to take the house and furniture at a certain rent\u2014there is said to have been an arrangement made beforehand during the negotiation that the defendant should let the plaintiff have more furniture for the same rent\u2014How is this collateral? I cannot perceive that it is.\u201d\nThat decision was founded on the fact that the written agreement provided for the rent to be paid for the house and the furniture described in it. The parol agreement if admitted would have made the same rent payable for the house and furniture mentioned in the lease with the addition of the extra furniture referred to in the parol agreement. The parol agreement would therefore be contradictory to the lease. So in this case if as I have shown the property in the wood in question when deposited at the railway station would under the written contract remain in Andrews and his assignees, the result of the admission of the parol agreement would be to deprive him of that property, and the legal effect of the written agreement would be wholly destroyed and the right to property transferred by a parol agreement wholly inconsistent with and opposed to the terms of the written agreement. By the written agreement the property in the wood would be in Andrews and his assignees, by the parol agreement it would be in the appellant. Can there be a doubt as to which should prevail? And how can the parol agreement be considered as an independent collateral one?\nSee also Evans v. Roe ([21]); Abrey v. Crux ([22]); Mason v. Scott ([23]); In this latter case it was held:\u2014\nThat a verbal stipulation and agreement by a lessor as to improvements to be constructed by him upon demised premises could not be established by parol, so as to add to or vary the lease, although it was proved that without such verbal promise and agreement the lease would not have been accepted.\nIn the conclusion of his judgment in that case Harrison C.J. very properly says:\u2014\nTo allow the respondents contention in this case to prevail would, in my opinion, be to fritter away, if not to destroy the plain terms of an old and well established rule of evidence, which is or ought be common alike to courts of law and equity.\nMr. Justice Moss in that case said:\u2014\nBut even if this agreement were collateral or independent in the same manner as the agreements enforced in some of the modern cases it may be excluded by the universally recognized limitation that the parol agreement cannot be proved if it conflicts with the written document.\nI have already shown that the parol agreement in this case is in no wise collateral to the written one but wholly negatives the legal effect of it, inasmuch as it transfers the right of property from Andrews to the appellant. I will hereafter refer to the proof of the parol agreement as shown by the testimony of the appellant and Andrews. I agree with the learned judge who tried the action that it was a rather unlikely one, but being so, it should be received, as it was by him, with a good deal of doubt. I have examined that testimony and it is anything but satisfactory. To permit oral evidence to contradict a deed would be a violation of one of the fundamental principles of evidence, but it is alleged that such is not asked for here. It is, however, asked to be permitted to add to it and show either an antecedent or contemporaneous collateral parol agreement. If that does not affect the written agreement, it may be admitted as collateral, but if it does, then it is not collateral and must be rejected. In some cases in Ontario verbal \u201c warranties\u201d have been admitted where there were written contracts of sale. These decisions are not at all binding on this court, nor, in my opinion, do they affect the general rule.\nIn Morgan v. Griffiths ([24]) it was decided that a collateral binding agreement had been proved. Kelly C. B. said\nThe signature to the lease was a good and sufficient consideration. * * * I think the verbal agreement was entirely collateral to the lease, and was founded on a good consideration. The plain tiff, unless the promise to destroy the rabbits had been given, would not have signed the lease. Pigott B. said: \u201cIt was on the basis of its performance that the lease was signed by the plaintiff, and it does not appear to me to contain any terms which conflict with the written document.\u201d\nIt will appear from that case that the parol agreement was admitted because\u2014first that it was made before the written document, and that the lessee refused to sign the latter unless under the terms of the previous parol agreement, and secondly, that it did not appear to contain any terms in conflict with the written document.\nIn reference to Lindley v. Lacey ([25]) a parol agreement was admitted, but it was because the promise was given in consideration of the purchasers signing the agreement, and it was in other respects an agreement altogether in respect of a collateral matter.\nErskine v. Adeane ([26]) was in regard to an excess of game complained of by the lessee, and he refused to sign the lease until the lessor undertook in a prescribed manner to lessen it which he did not do. The latter case was decided on the same legal principles as in Morgan v. Griffith.\nThe decisions in those cases do not affect the legal position of the parties in this. I have already shown that the two positions are required to be shown. The consideration for the signing of the agreement must be shown and the non-interference with the terms of the written document, which could not be shown in this case affecting as it does the right of property. According to the authorities quoted and cited it is necessary, as before shown, that the signing of the written contract was in consideration of the previous parol agreement, and so stipulated, and that the parol agreement did not affect or contradict the written one. Both are necessary. I have shown that in the latter respect that in this case the parol agreement would over-ride the written contract, and I will now consider the evidence as to the first.\nTo affect the operation of a solemn agreement, under seal as in this case, the most clear, decided and reliable evidence must be adduced. The appellant must show then that such evidence appears on the record. The evidence of the parol agreement was objected to on the trial by the counsel of the respondent and was received subject to the objection.\nTurning then to the evidence of the appellant on the point in answer to this question from his counsel:\u2014\nYou have told us that Mr. Andrews promised you some security. Will you tell me what he said.\nTo which he replied:\u2014\nWhen I spoke to him about security he said he did not see that I needed any more security than what I had, that was the wood\u2014he said the wood was mine until he paid me in full for it\nHe was asked again:\u2014\nDid he tell you anything else? Answer. Yes, he said it was agreed, that suppose he should not, when the contract was fulfilled on the 20th of March, if I was not paid for the wood according to the agreement, that I had a right to sell the wood. Did he say anything else? I don\u2019t remember anything further.\nHe is asked further:\u2014\nWas there anything said about your selling the Wood before you actually put your names to the agreement. Did you sign your agreement first then did he give you the right to sell the wood, or did he give you the right first? Answer. I cannot remember that.\nAgain in answer to the leading question:\u2014\nThen that agreement was come to before you actually put your signature down there? Answer. Yes, I think it was.\nAgain by the significant pressure of his counsel in the question or statement:\u2014\nThat took place before you signed it and this conversation took place while he was writing out this agreement? Answer. Yes, we talked about it. I cannot just remember now.\nIf, then, the appellant could not say at the trial whether the alleged parol agreement was made before or after he signed the written contract, he has certainly failed to give such evidence as would justify any court or jury in finding that it was before the signing of the written contract, and the case is not therefore within the rule laid down and acted on in the cases before referred to. I have read carefully the evidence of Andrews and although he corroborates the evidence of the appellant he does not appear to have been asked or to have stated whether it was before or after the signing of the written contract. There is, therefore, no evidence that it took place before and so this case is unaffected by the decisions in Lindley v. Lacey ([27]); Morgan v. Griffith ([28]); or in Erskine v. Adeane ([29]); upon which the learned judge of first instance relied.\nThe whole current of reliable authorities establish, the rule of evidence laid down by Taylor before quoted, and I would not feel justified in aiding to fritter away one so long and beneficially established as must be the result if the parol agreement is permitted in this case to contradict or vary the terms of the valid, written instrument.\nI am, for the reasons given, of opinion that the appeal herein should be dismissed and the judgment of the court below affirmed with costs,\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr, Justice Gwynne. GWYNNE J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my brother Strong that this appeal should be allowed. The question seems to me to be reduced to this, namely, whether the agreement in virtue of which the defendant claimed a lien with a power of sale to indemnify himself in case Andrews should not pay for the wood in the terms of the written agreement, was or was not collateral to the written agreement, and I am of opinion that it clearly was; and that nothing said in Angell v. Duke on the motion for a nonsuit as reported ([30]) militates against this conclusion. The court in that case held that the matter there relied upon as being collateral to the lease constituted from its nature a qualification of the terms of the demise, and therefore could not be set up as part of those terms by parol against the written lease.\nBlackburn J. there while disapproving of Mann v. Nunn ([31]), which was a case similar to Angell v. Duke (36) approved of Morgan v. Griffiths ([32]), and this latter case is sufficient for our present purpose, and, in my opinion, governs the present case. As a matter of fact it was established to the satisfaction of the learned judge, who tried the case without a jury, that but for the agreement as to the lien with power of sale the defendant never would have executed the written agreement which was merely in relation to the defendant cutting wood upon land in which Andrews had an interest under license from the Hudson Bay Company, at and for certain sums per cord to be paid by Andrews on delivery as provided in the written agreement.\nNow, the contract for the lien and power of sale was made for the express purpose of taking effect only in the event of a breach being committed of his written agreement as to payment by Andrews; there can therefore, I think, be doubt that a verbal agreement which provides only for the event of a breach of the written agreement being committed by Andrews, an event which according to the terms of the written agreement was never to occur, is an agreement wholly collateral to and independent of the written agreement, and can therefore be proved by parol. Such a parol agreement is quite consistent with, and does not necessarily form part of, the terms that should have been expressed in the written agreement. The written agreement contemplated that it should be fulfilled in all its terms. The verbal agreement contemplated taking effect only in the event of a breach being committed in the written one, and is therefore, as I think, clearly collateral to it.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Daly & Caldwell.\nSolicitors for respondents: J.W.E.

In an action by S. to have it declared that McK. had no interest in the property.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, and confirming the judgment of the trial judge, Henry J. dissenting, that the evidence greatly preponderated in favor of the contention of McK. that the purchase was a joint one by himself and S.\nHeld, also, that S. being liable for an ascertained portion of the purchase money there was a resulting trust in his favor for his interest in the land.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the decision of Armour J. in favour of the defendant.\nThe question to be decided in this appeal is a simple one, namely, whether or not the purchase of land, the deed of which was in the plaintiffs name, was a joint purchase by him and the defendant, the action being brought to have it declared that the defendant had no interest in the land.\nThe defendant had advanced, in money and promissory notes, a portion of the purchase money and claimed that he did so as a purchaser, that the deed was to the plaintiff alone according to the agreement between them and that the plaintiff was to execute a transfer of an undivided half in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s contention was that the money so advanced was simply a loan and that there was no such agreement.\nMr. Justice Armour who tried the case gave judgment in favor of the defendant, holding that the evidence established a purchase by the parties on joint account. The Court of Appeal reversed his decision. The defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcLennan Q.C. for the appellant.\nGarrow Q.C. for the respondent.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that the original judgment of Mr. Justice Armour in this case was correct, and for the reasons given by Chief Justice Hagarty I think this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Armour restored. I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that the money paid by defendant on account of this purchase was money lent to the plaintiff. All the surrounding circumstances of the case seem to me opposed to such an idea; on the contrary, it appears to me the payments made and notes given by defendant were for and on account of the purchase money of a joint speculation and purchase by defendant and plaintiff, each contributing a moiety, and that the deed of the property was taken in the plaintiffs name alone for their joint benefit. If the money had been advanced merely as a loan it is abundantly clear there would be no resulting trust, but thinking this not to have been the case, I think the appeal should be allowed,\nSTRONG J.\u2014The purchase was completed on the 8th of April, 1882, when the conveyance of the land to the respondent was executed and the purchase money, or at least that portion of it which was to be paid in addition to the outstanding incumbrances assumed as part of the price, was secured by the joint promissory notes of the appellant and respondent, namely, one note at a short date for $1,500 and four notes at long dates for the residue, amounting altogether to $830. It is clear, therefore, that at the time of the completion of the purchase the appellant was legally bound to the vendor to contribute to the payment of the purchase money, equally with the respondent.\nThe law is clear that in order to raise a resulting trust the party asserting it must be able to show that at the time of the completion of the purchase he either factually paid, or came under an absolute obligation to pay, the whole or some ascertained proportion of the price. It cannot be doubted that, prim\u00e2 facie at least, the appellant brings himself within these requirements of the law. If the appellant had insisted on his beneficial interest as a joint purchaser with the respondent before any money had been paid on account of the purchase, that is between the 8th and 17th April, he would have established his case by showing that he had become equally liable with the respondent for the payment of the promissory notes which had been given to secure the purchase money.\nBut a trust thus prim\u00e2 facie resulting from the payment of an obligation to pay the purchase money may always be rebutted by parol evidence on the part of the nominal purchaser, and so on the other hand this rebutting evidence may in turn be contradicted by the same sort of evidence on the part of the alleged benefi- ciary, and the question to be decided may thus become a pure question of fact to be determined on the conflicting evidence alternately adduced for these purposes. Such a question of fact to be determined on conflicting evidence is exactly what is presented by the case now before us.\nThe respondent attempts to destroy the presumption in favor of the appellant resulting from the joint liability on the promissory notes by proving that the appellant joined in making the notes, not as a joint purchaser of the land but as a mere surety for the respondent, and that his subsequent contributions to the monies applied to the payment of these notes were loans and advances made by him to the respondent.\nThe appellant in his turn denies that he was either a surety or a lender and asserts that he undertook the liability and paid the money for his own benefit as a joint purchaser of the land.\nThe question to be decided is, therefore, one not involving any legal principles, but exclusively one of fact, and to a considerable extent one of conflicting evidence to be determined according to the preference to be given to one set of witnesses rather than another. Then viewing the case as thus depending on a question of evidence, the first observation to be made is that the indirect and circumstantial proof by itself tends strongly in the appellant\u2019s favor inasmuch as the facts are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the appellant undertook the liability he came under in respect of the notes merely as a surety for the respondent. The appellant paid promptly and voluntarily and without any appeal being made to him by the respondent, but as a party primarily liable would have done, nearly an exact moiety of the money secured by these notes as they fell due, and altogether acted as if he was liable as a joint principal and not secondarily as a surety. This, however, is not conclusive against the respondent who asserts that the appellant was not only a surety in respect of his liability upon the notes, but, besides and beyond his undertaking as such, had agreed to lend to and advance for the respondent one-half of the money required to retire the notes, or rather the amount actually advanced by him for that purpose, being somewhat more than a half. There is, however, a total absence of evidence of any specific agreement for a loan, and the consequent uncertainty as to the terms of repayment, the rate of interest, and other details which the parties would naturally have provided for if that had been the real character of the transaction, operate strongly against the respondent\u2019s assertions in this respect and make the account which he gives of the appellant\u2019s connection with the matter an extremely improbable one. When, however, in addition we consider the conduct of the appellant from first to last in connection with the purchase, the chief part which he took in making the bargain and procuring the execution of the conveyance, and the principle of equality which, if not exactly observed owing to the inability of the respondent to furnish the full amount of his share, nevertheless runs throughout the whole transaction as regards the payments, to say nothing of the exercise by the appellant of indubitable acts of ownership over the property, the circumstances in evidence seem to me so strong in the appellant\u2019s favor, that even if they had been unsupported by any direct testimony I should have hesitated long before giving effect to the evidence of the respondent and the vendee Gibson as sufficient to displace the appellant\u2019s prim\u00e2 facie title to a beneficial interest. When, however, we have opposed to the evidence of the respondent and Gibson not only the circumstances surrounding the transaction but also the positive and direct evidence of the appellant himself and his witness John Wilson, and when we find that these latter witnesses are accredited by the judge before whom they were examined in open court, who accepts their statements in preference to those of the respondent and his witness, it seems to me impossible, without entirely disregarding at once the effect of the evidence, and the authority of decisions (now become numerous both here and in England\u2019 prescribing the rules which should govern appellate courts in dealing with the conflicting testimony of witnesses, to do otherwise than to adopt the conclusion of the learned judge who tried the action. Had I considered the facts and circumstances as disclosed in the evidence, corroborated the respondent\u2019s rather than the appellant\u2019s explanation of the transaction, I should not have hesitated to have come to a different conclusion; for as regards the rule in question 1 adhere to the definition and limitation of it given with the sanction of the Court of Appeal in Sanderson v. Burdette[2], and according to the terms in which it is there expressed the decision at the trial is only to be deemed conclusive as regards the credit to be given to conflicting witnesses, and the appellate court is not to be excluded from drawing inferences from documentary evidence, from the surrounding facts and circumstances, from inconsistencies of statements, and from the self-contradictions of witnesses, even though such inferences may vary from those of the primary judge. In the present case, however, I think all the inferences of this kind which the evidence Warrants accord with the finding of the learned judge who presided at the trial, and if I had had to deal in the first instance with the same evidence now before us, but presented upon written depositions taken before an examiner or commissioner, I should, with a confidence at least as strong as that expressed by Mr. Justice Armour, have found in the same way.\nAs regards the costs I am of opinion that the conduct of the appellant in withholding the deed from registration and thus endangering the respondent\u2019s title rendered the action to a certain extent necessary, and although the respondent failed in his demand so far as he claimed to be entitled to the whole of the land yet he in part succeeded at the trial, inasmuch as he established his right to have the deed produced for registration. Therefore, in my opinion, no costs should be given to either party up to and including the trial. The costs in appeal both here and in the Court of Appeal having been wholly caused by the contention of the respondent as to the character of the purchase, in which he has failed, should be paid by him to the appellant. Therefore the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversed, and the original judgment of the Common Pleas Division restored with the variation as to costs just mentioned.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I, also, am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Armour restored.\nHENRY J.\u2014I entirely agree with the views of the three learned judges of the Court of Appeal who gave judgment in this case, and with the conclusion at which they arrived. In regard to the evidence it is, in my mind, conclusive that the land in question was purchased solely by the respondent.\nIn regard to the law I think it is also in his favor. In cases where there is contradictory evidence as to important points in a case, and where the result depends upon the weight of evidence, the learned judge who tries the issue and has the witnesses before him is very possibly much better able to judge of their credibility than a judge who has not had that opportunity, and in such cases the finding of the judge is generally held to be conclusive. This, however, is not such a case, for there is little if any conflict of evidence, and upon the only important point of difference between the parties in the cause the appellant, contradicted as he was by; the respondent, is also, as to the same point, contradicted by three other witnesses and corroborated by none. The contention of the appellant upon which the decision of the case turns is, that the land was purchased by him and the respondent to be held by them as tenants in common, each of a moiety\nBefore referring to the oral evidence I think it proper to refer to the deed. That is itself the strongest prim\u00e2 facie evidence that it was made to the purchaser; and then it is shown to have been procured to be so made by the appellant himself without giving any satisfactory explanation why, if it were a joint purchase, a deed was given to the respondent alone. He attempted to do so, but his statements are contradictory and, to my mind, wholly unreliable. It would have been very different had the respondent caused the deed to be so made. The appellant might in such a case have complained, and if in his power shown a joint purchase. The appellant does not pretend that as to the deed being taken to the respondent after the purchase was made that there was any conversation or agreement between the parties on the subject; and if, when the purchase was agreed upon, the appellant was to have had a half interest in the land, is it not unaccountable that the appellant should have had \\ the deed made as it was without the slightest understanding with the respondent? He is shown to have been an intelligent business man, and how can we so consider him such if in regard to an interest amounting to nearly two thousand dollars he failed in any way to provide for its protection? The deed being so made was the act of the appellant, and even from his own version of the circumstances I should consider that the evidence furnished by the deed alone should prevail. No mistake is suggested. The act on the part of the appellant was deliberate. The deed solemnly says the land was purchased by the respondent and no court should, in my opinion, reject its effect under such evidence as we have here. It may be asked: Why did the appellant advance money and security if he were not a joint purchaser? The evidence, as remarked by one or more of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, amply furnishes the answer. He was the father-in-law of the respondent\u2019s brother, who, together with the respondent and another brother, lived on a small farm, of a little over a hundred acres, left them by their father to be divided between them according to value. The appellant was one of his executors and seemed to have felt the responsibility of having the land divided, which was to take place in about four years when the youngest son came of age. He too, no doubt, felt an interest in the position and prospects of his son-in-law. The farm had been let by lease, having about four years to run when the land was purchased. When the youngest of the three Sandersons came of age the respondent after the land was divided sold a part of his share to one of his brothers and the balance to the other, intending to retain and keep for himself the land conveyed to him and now the subject matter of this suit. That was, I fully believe, what was intended by the appellant when he told the respondent that he would have the deed made to him, the respondent, and that if he wanted it when the other property was divided he could have it. He expected, no doubt, that such an arrangement would benefit his son-in-law and very likely that was why he insisted in the purchase, and it is a little surprising that until after the division of the other property the appellant is not shown ever to have claimed to own an interest in the land. On the contrary it is shown he repudiated it. That division, however, having been made, and his son-in-law being no longer interested in the purchase or owner- ship of the land in question herein, the appellant set up a claim to the title of half of it. I have thus; given what the evidence shows as the intention of both parties when the deed was made. I have no difficulty in arriving at that conclusion from the admitted facts, but when we consider the testimony of Gibson, Bell and Ireland I cannot help expressing myself strongly by saying that it is conclusive. I extract for the purpose their evidence, as found in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson:\u2014\nThere is further in support of respondent\u2019s contention the evidence of Gibson, the vendor stated by the appellant to be a respectable and truthful man, that he sold the land to the respondent alone, and that appellant said to respondent in his (Gibson\u2019s) hearing that he would help him through with the payments. Then Bell says: Appellant told him shortly after the purchase that one of the Sanderson boys was getting the place; that appellant always said it belonged to the Sandersons, and denied that he had any claim on it and that \u201cBill\u201d(respondent) would go on it when the boys settled; that is, when the division of the homestead was made. And Andrew Ireland says: Appellant told him when on the way with the deeds to get Mrs. Gibson to sign them, which must have been directly after the bargain, that \u201cBill Sanderson (respondent) had bought it.\u201d\nThe learned judge after citing this evidence very forcibly says:\u2014\nWith this clear and undisputed evidence all in support of the appellant\u2019s contention, and of the conveyances themselves, it is submitted that the learned judge was unduly impressed with the importance of the acts and conduct referred to in his judgment, not one of which in view of all the circumstances was unequivocal or inconsistent with the appellant\u2019s contention, and that he should have found that the true agreement was that appellant was to be the sole purchaser, and that respondent only agreed to help him in such purchase by loaning him what money he could.\nHere, then, is the positive statement of Gibson, whose veracity is vouched for by the appellant himself, swearing that he sold the land to the respondents, and to place the matter beyond any doubt, that he heard the appellant say to the respondent that he would help him with the payments, Would that be langu- age of a man who was a joint purchaser?\nConsider then the evidence of Bell. Can anything be stronger or more conclusive? Then again the statement of Ireland that when he with the appellant were on the way to obtain Mrs. Gibson\u2019s signature to the deed that the appellant said the respondent had bought the land. The appellant was examined as to those statements of the three witnesses just referred to and he would not undertake to contradict any of them. We must conclude then that they were true. If so we have the strongest evidence that could be produced and which estops the appellant, as admissions made by himself, from saying that the land was not purchased by the respondent alone. Taking into consideration the evidence that, immediately after the statements to which Gibson and Ireland refer the appellant got the deed executed, we have, in my opinion, an issue fully and satisfactorily proved by the respondent.\nThe law in respect of the statute of frauds as given by Patterson, Burton and Osier, justices, as applicable to this case, is in my opinion correct, and I think it only necessary to refer to their judgment. I also agree with the learned justices named that the evidence is wholly insufficient to establish the contention that there was any resulting trust. The evidence on the part of the appellant independently of the respondents does not, in my opinion, show any such trust. The law is so fully declared by the learned justices that I need only refer to their judgment.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the court below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and the original judg- ment restored, for the reasons given by Hagarty C.J. dissenting in the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014There is much contradiction in the oral evidence given in this case and the learned judge who heard the evidence and saw the witnesses has expressed a strong opinion in favor of the defendant\u2019s contention, namely, that he was a co-purchaser of the land with the plaintiff and that it was as such that he paid his money, and not that he lent the money to the plaintiff as contended by the latter.\nUpon a careful perusal of the evidence I cannot say that this opinion of the learned judge is erroneous and not justified by the evidence.\nIf the money was, as the plaintiff contends, advanced by the defendant to him as a loan, it is very singular that no terms of repayment should have been ever spoken of between them, or any security asked or offered. It is to be observed also that it was at the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the plaintiff became a party to the transaction\u2014that the payments made by the defendant were made direct to the vendor and not to the plaintiff\u2014and that the notes given to the vendor, securing the purchase money not paid when the deed was executed, were the joint notes of the plaintiff and the defendant, although neither the vendor required nor did the plaintiff ask the defendant to join in these notes as his surety. Why the defendant should have joined in these notes otherwise than as co-purchaser with the plaintiff no reasonable explanation appears to have been offered. These and other considerations referred to by Mr. Justice Armour, who tried the case, seem to me to lead to the conclusion that his finding upon the fact upon which the case depends is correct. But it is contended that a portion of the evidence given by the plaintiff himself is conclusive against his payments haying been made qua-purchaser. The evidence relied upon as having this effect is that the defendant admitted that when speaking to the plaintiff about his and his brothers joining with the defendant\u2019s sons in making the purchase the following took place:\u2014\nOn Saturday I asked him what his brother and our boys told him, he said he only saw my son Alexander and that Alexander told him we had as much land now as we could work and that he would be willing to go in for it only on speculation; to which defendant replied: \u201cNo matter, I will go in with you for it, and put your name down in the writings, and if you want it when you are making division of your homestead property you can have it.\u201d\nIt is contended that this last sentence shows that the defendant\u2019s position was not that of a co-purchaser with the plaintiff. To my mind, I must say that it conveys no such necessary conclusion, but that, on the contrary, it seems to me to be more consistent with the fact of the defendant being a co-purchaser with the plaintiff than with the fact of his being merely a lender of money to the plaintiff to enable him to make the purchase for himself alone. If the plaintiff was the sole purchaser what was the sense of the defendant saying that he would put the plaintiff\u2019s name down in the writings, and that if he should want the land, on his making a division of his homestead, he, the plaintiff, could have it?\nSurely there could have been no doubt that if the plaintiff was the sole purchaser the deed would naturally be in his name without any act or permission of defendant, or that the land, eo instanti of the conveyance being executed and the plaintiff\u2019s purchase completed, would be his own property apart from any condition of his wanting to have it upon a future occasion when the homestead should come to be divided. What was the sense of the defendant saying that conditionally upon the plaintiff requiring the land on a future event arising, he could have that which was already his own by the purchase? And if the plaintiff should not require the land upon the division of the homestead, where was the beneficial interest in the land to be in the meantime? Not with plaintiff for it was only conditional upon a future event arising that he was to have it.\nThe remark relied upon seems to be rather in the nature of a promise made by the defendant that conditionally upon the future event spoken of occurring the plaintiff should have from the defendant that which it could only be in the defendant\u2019s power to give by his being co\u2011purchaser of the land with the plaintiff. This appears to me to be a more natural inference to draw from the remark than that it establishes the relation of borrower and lender between the parties to the conversation, and so reading this passage in the defendant\u2019s evidence it is the promise which would be void within the statute of frauds.\nThere was another argument used against the claim of the defendant, namely, that the land is subject to a mortgage executed by the plaintiff\u2019s vendor, which mortgage or any part thereof the defendant, as is said, is under no liability to pay, and therefore, as is contended, he cannot be heard to claim as a co-purchaser with the plaintiff. But in this respect the plaintiff is in the same position as the defendant, for neither has he entered into any obligation to pay the mortgage. He is, of course, liable to lose the land upon a bill of foreclosure being filed if he should fail to pay it, but he has entered into no obligation to pay it. Now the defendant if he be co-purchaser with the plaintiff is equally subject to the same consequence even though the bill of foreclosure and the decree therein for foreclosure should be against the plaintiff alone, and as co-purchaser with the plaintiff he could with him file a bill to redeem. The conveyance executed by the vendor has been a bargain and sale of the land with covenants for title against the acts of the vendor, but both the plaintiff and the defendant knew of the mortgage, the amount of which was retained to meet the mortgage and not paid to the vendor so that notwithstanding the vendor\u2019s convenant the estate conveyed was in the eye of a court of equity only the vendor\u2019s estate in the land which was subject to the mortgage. Now the plaintiff and defendant, assuming them to be co-purchasers, are both precisely in the same position as to the mortgage, that is to say, neither of them is under any obligation to pay it, but in default of their paying it they are both liable to lose their respective interest in the land, so that the fact of the defendant having entered into no obligation to pay the mortgage, affords no argument or reason whatsoever at variance with his being, as he insists he was, a co-purchaser with the plaintiff. But on the other side, if the plaintiff was sole purchaser and if he should suffer the mortgage to be foreclosed what obligation did he incur to repay the defendant those sums which the plaintiff now claims to have been loans to him? None whatever; and in such case the defendant was wholly at the plaintiff\u2019s mercy, while adopting the defendant\u2019s contention the plaintiff\u2019s interests were protected. The most reasonable conclusion to draw from the evidence is, I think, that arrived at by the learned judge who tried the case, namely, that the defendant was a co-purchaser who paid his money in that character, but took the deed in the name of the plaintiff for the sake of convenience, with a view to the possibility of the plaintiff at a future time desiring to acquire the whole property.\nThe appeal therefore should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Armour restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Cameron, Holt & Cameron.\nSolicitors for respondent: Garrow & Proudfoot.\n[1] 13 Ont.

Q.)\u2014 Award\u2014Validity of\u2014Faiss et articles\u2014 Art. 225 C. C. P.\nE. B. et at. joint owners of land situate in the city of Quebec were awarded $11 000 under 43\u201444 Vie. ch. 43 sec. 9 for a portion of said land expropriated for the use of the North Shore Railway Company.\nOn the 12th March, 1885, E. B. et at. instituted an action against the North Shore Railway Company based on the award. The company not having pleaded foreclosure was granted, and on the 21st April, process for interrogatories upon faits et articles was issued, and returned on the 20th April. The company made default. On the 18th June the fails et articles were declared taken pro confessis. On the 16th May E. B. et al. consented that the defendants be allowed to plead, but it was only on the 7th July that a plea was filed, alleging that the arbitration had been irregular and was against the weight of evidence. On the 2nd September, E. B. et al, inscribed the case for hearing on the merits, on which day the railway company moved to be authorized to answer the faits et articles and the motion was refused.\nThe notice of expropriation and the award both described the land expropriated as No. 1, on the plan of the railway company deposited according to law, but in another part of the notice it described it as forming part of a cadastral lot 2345 and in the award as forming part of lots 2344\u20142345. On the 5th December, judgment was rendered in favor of E. B. et at. for the amount of the award. From this judgment the railway company appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) and that court reversed the judgment of the Superior court, holding inter alia the award bad for uncertainty, and that the case should also be sent back to the Superior Court to allow the defendants to answer the faits et articles. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was\nHeld, 1, reversing the judgment of the court of Queen's Bench(appeal side that there was no uncertainty in the award as the words of the award and notice were sufficient of themselves to describe T the property intended to be expropriated and which was valued by arbitrators.\n2. That the motion for leave to answer faits et articles had been properly refused by the Superior Court. Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellants.\nThis was an action brought by the appellants against the respondents claiming the sum of $11,000, being the amount of an award made under the provisions of \"The Quebec Consolidated Railway Act 1880.\"\nThe notice by the North Shore Railway Company to appellants was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cNOTICE BY THE NORTH SHORE R.R.

E. BLONDEAU, N. P. A proper notice was given to all the arbitrators oi the day on which it was to be made viz., 14th August, but it was adjourned and the award was rendered on the 28th August at which meeting Bertrand withdrew during the sitting. In his evidence at the trial he said:\u2014\nThe two other arbitrators have concurred in the award which has been rendered after the fulfilling? of all the essential formalities. I received all the necessary notices, and all the proceedings have been regular before the arbitrators. I only refused to sign because I considered that the amount awarded was exaggerated and unjust.\nThe pleadings sufficiently appear in the head note and in the judgment of Fournier J. hereinafter given.\nPelletier for appellant.\nAs to the objection regarding the fails et articles.\nThe default of the defendants was first recorded on 26th April 1885 then on a formal motion the interrogatories were held pro-confessis. Over two months afterwards the defendants apply to answer without filing their answers, without offering to pay the costs incurred and in spite of the terms of the consent in virtue of which they had\u2014long after the delays,\u2014filed their plea, which they were only entitled to do on condition that the case would not be delayed. There must be a certain limit to delays obtained by means of omissions on behalf of parties. Pending the long d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, was it not the duty of the defendants to make a motion accompanied, as usual, with their answers and with the offer of paying the costs as required by law in such instances? The defendants have not thought fit to act in that way. Is it not probable that they were afraid of being allowed to file their answers? Then the case might have gone back on the enqu\u00eate roll and evidence might have been adduced provin that the plaintiffs' pretentions were correct.\nThe Superior Court was obviously right in granting some kind of protection to the plaintiffs against the extra ordinary delays, omissions and defaults of the defendants. The same court could not on motion reverse and annul the judgment already rendered, declaring the faits et articles taken proconfessis.\nThen the Court of Appeal orders the case to be sent back to the Superior Court, for the defendant to answer upon faits et articles and new arbitrators to be appointed.\nWhy then order the case back to the Superior Court in order that the fails el articles should be answered?\nWhat benefit would result from that for either party?\nIf the faits et articles are to be answered what is the use of appointing new arbitrators?\nAs to uncertainty the lot described in the notice, is exactly the same as the one mentioned in the award to wit: l lot number one upon the plan of the trac\u00e9 of \" the railroad as deposited according to law.\"\nThe plan of the railroad, deposited according to law,\" became the real and only legal plan and description of the lot in question. Both the notice and the award give its area: \" 2 arpents et 40 perthes.\" So soon as that plan was deposited it was by law substituted for the general cadastral plan, which can no longer apply to the lot of which the said plan is a parceling out and subdivision.\nThe second objection raised by the defendants in their factum before the Appeal Court is that there seems to be no notice to the arbitrators of ther sitting on the 28th August.\nIt is alleged by the action\u2014not specifically denied, and proved by the faits et articles\u2014that such meeting was an adjourned one, as decided by the arbitrators at their meeting of the 14th, duly called by the notice produced in the record. Subs. 18 (of said Sec. 9) provides for those adjourned meetings.\nBut let us go a step further. The three arbitrators appeared before the notary on the 28th of August. Bertrand, the defendants' arbitrator, who withdrew during the sitting of the 28th, when examined as a witness by the defendants says that they have examined many witnesses and adds: That he had received all the necessary notices and all the proceedings had been regular.\nThe third objection raised is that the plaintiffs have no juridical existence as a company. The defendants' notice served on the plaintiffs shows that defendant had accepted them as joint proprietors; they sued as such; no exception to the form has denied their qualities (Code of Procedure arts 116 et 119)\nThe defendants, not having denied the qualities assumed by the plaintiffs in the writ of summons, must be held to have admitted them and to have waived all possible objection. It is too late to have the award invalidated for defect of form.\nSubs 27 of the said section 9 is also a peremptory answer to that objection. It says: \" Nor shall it be \" necessary that the party or parties to whom the sum is to be paid be named in the award.\"\nDuhamel Q.C. and Drouin for respondents.\nThe illegalities on which we based our plea are the' following:\n1. That there is no identity between the ground valued by the arbitrators, and the one that they were charged to valuate.\nIn fact, by the notice given by the respondents to the appellants in conformity with subsec. 13 of sec. 9 of the Quebec Consolidated Railway Act, notice which according to this subsection must contain \" a description of the lands to be taken, &c.,\" the respondents requested two arpents and forty perches forming part of the lot 2345 of the official cadastre for the parish of St. Sauveur. But the majority of the arbitrators without taking account of this injunction, adjudged on an other parcel of land, on a parcel forming part of the lots 2344 and 2345 of the official cadastre for the parish of St. Sauveur. '\nConsequently there is no conformity between the designation inserted in the notice and the one contained in the sentence * and on the part of the arbitrators there was adjudication on a litigation not submitted to them\nSub-sec. 22 of sec. 9 of the same act decrees that: \" A majority of the arbitrators at the first meeting of their appointment, or the sole arbitrator, shall fix a day on or before which the award shall be made.\" It does not appear by the record that there was any such day fixed. There is in the record a notice from one of the arbitrators but this notice, which could not fulfill the prescription of the above disposition, is made for the 14th of August, and the pretended sentence has been rendered on the 28th of August\nThe pretended sentence of arbitrators does not mention the names of the owners on the ground expropriated and on which it is adjudged. They are there designated in this manner \" l'association de cons situation portant les noms de Elis\u00e9e. Beaudet et autres.\" But this association not being incorporated has no juridical existence. It is true that it is alleged in the declaration, \" Que les mots ' Association do constrction portant les noms de Elis\u00e9e Beaudet et autres ' employ\u00e9s dans les titres sont une expression de convention employ\u00e9s pour designer les Demandeurs comme propri\u00e9taires indivis des dits immeubles,\" but this allegation is of no value because it is not proved, and even if proved it could not cover this absence of designation of parties required by the law. One of two things, either the proceedings and the sentence of the arbitrators have a judicial quality and then no doubt that the names and qualities of all the parties ought to be mentioned, at least in the sentence; or, they have an extra judicial quality and the designation of names and qualities is still rigorously exacted by the Article 1344 of the Civil Code of Procedure of Lower Canada.\nIn any case the judgment of the Court of Appeal was correct in ordering the record to be sent back to the Superior Court in order to allow the respondents to answer the faits et articles, for it is in accordance with the jurisprudence and the law (Article 225 Civil Code of Procedure Bas Canada). The circumstances and excuses set forth on the motion, the impossibility for the respondents to assemble their board, and above all the fact that the answers were made and deposited in the prothonotarys office, at the time of its pr\u00e9sentation,\u2014implied certainly good faith on the part of the respondents,\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014 I think the judgment of the Superior Court should be Restored. I think the arbitration was quite regular and the award perfectly good and binding on the parties; that there is no object whatever to be gained by sending the case back to answer upon faits et articles and that there is nothing in the objection that the award does not mention the names of the owners of the ground expropriated. The names in the award are the same as those used by the railway company in their notice of expropriation and in the arbitration throughout and as to the consid\u00e9rant.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il v a aussi erreur clans le jugement final rendu le cinq d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt quatre, approuvant la sentence arbitrale, en autant que la dite sentence contient une description du terrain \u00e9valu\u00e9, diff\u00e9rente de celle du terrain dont l'appelante a demand\u00e9 l'expropriation, et que cette difference dans (Jette description rend la sentence arbitrale incertaine quant au terrain expropri\u00e9 I think this view cannot prevail. This, in my opinion, is just a case where the maxim falsa demonstratlo noz nocet applies. There is adequate and sufficient definition with convenient certainty of what was intended on the application and award, that is to say, the words of the notice and award exclusive of the falsa demonstratio, are sufficient of themselves to describe the property intended to be expropriated and which was valued by the arbitrators. As has been stated the characteristic of cases strictly within the above rule is this that the description, so far as it is false, applies to no subject, and so far as it is true it applies to one subject only; and the court, in these cases, rejects no words but those which are shown to have no application to any subject.\nNew in this case the words \"Et portant le numero\" un sur le plan du trace du chemin de fer tel que \" d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant la loi \" must be referred to for the purpose of determining the land the company sought to expropriate. Without these words it would be impossible to locate the lands to be expropriated.\nThe land valued by the arbitrators is described as\nUne portion de terre de deux arpents et quarante perches en superficie, tel que maintenant jalonn\u00e9e, et faisant partie du lot numero (2345) deux mille trois cent quarante cinq du cadastre pour la paroisse de St. Sauveur de Quebec, et portant le num\u00e9ro un sur le plan du trac\u00e9 do chemin do fer tel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant la loi.\nAnd in the award the land is described as follows:\nUn certain terrain contenant deux arpents et quarante cinq perches en superficie, born\u00e9 au nordouest, au sudest et \u00e0 l'ouest par la dite association, et \u00e0 l'est par los h\u00e9ritiers Tourangeau et faisant partie des lots num\u00e9ros (2344 et 2345) deux mille trois cent quarante-quatre et deux mille trois cent quarante cinq du cadastre pour la dite paroisse do St. Sauveur, et portant le num\u00e9ro un sur la plan du trac\u00e9 du chemin do fer tel que d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant la loi.\nSo that whether it was part of lot 2345 or part of lots 2844 & 2345, or these numbers be rejected altogether, the rest of the description specifies the land beyond, all doubt as part of lot number one of the railway plan It is therefore clear that the notice and. the award refer precisely to the same parcel of 2 arpents & 40 perches of land and is the same land taken possession of by the defendants, viz; lot number one upon the plan of the trac\u00e9 of the railroad as deposited according to law and which they sought to expropriate Under these circumstances there can he no doubt there was a good and sufficient description. The arbitrator of the company under oath says all the proceedings were regular and that he differed from the other arbitrators only as regards the amount. The appeal, in my opinion, should therefore be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have read the judgment which will be delivered by Mr. Justice Fournier and I fully concur in the reasons given by him for reversing the judgment appealed from.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. L'action des appelants demandait la confirmation d'une sentence arbitrale rendue par des arbitres nomm\u00e9s en vertu de l'acte consolid\u00e9 des chemins de fer de Qu\u00e9bec 43-44 Vict. ch. 43 pour faire l'\u00e9valuation du terrain expropri\u00e9 pour le pass\u00e9e du chemin de fer de la compagnie intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci a plaid\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 de cette sentence, sans, cependant, indiquer par sa d\u00e9fense un seul moyen de nullit\u00e9. Elle en a aussi attaqu\u00e9 le m\u00e9rite en pr\u00e9tendant que le montant accord\u00e9 exc\u00e8de la valeur r\u00e9elle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et n'est pas justifi\u00e9 par la preuve. Quant \u00e0 ce dernier moyen il est \u00e9vident qu'en vertu des arts 13.3 et 1354 du code de proc\u00e9dure l'intim\u00e9e n'avait aucun droit de remettre en question devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure le m\u00e9rite de la contestation qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise aux arbitres. Elle ne devait attaquer cette sentence que par des moyens de nullit\u00e9 pouvant l'affecter, ou des questions de forme pouvant en emp\u00eacher l'ex\u00e9cution. Elle n'en a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni prouv\u00e9 aucun, et en cons\u00e9quence la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 son plaidoyer, confirm\u00e9 la dite sentence et condamn\u00e9 li intim\u00e9e \u00e0 en payer le montant.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 porte en appel \u00e0 la Cour du Bane de la Reine, et l\u00e0, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, l'intim\u00e9e a \" invoqu\u00e9, pour attaquer la sentence en question, des moyens de nullit\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas plaid\u00e9s.\nLe premier est que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 requise par l'intim\u00e9e et d\u00e9sign\u00e9e dans l'avis qu'elle a donn\u00e9 n'est pas Ta m\u00eame que celle d\u00e9crite dans la sentence arbitrale 20 Qu'il n'apparait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 avis aux arbitres de leur s\u00e9ance du 28 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 laquelle la dite sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. 30 Que les appelants n'ont pas d'existence l\u00e9gale comme compagnie.\nLa premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me de ces questions seules m\u00e9ritent une r\u00e9ponse; car la cour du Bane de la Reine en a fait des consid\u00e9rants de son jugement, infirmant celui de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Quant \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me, la cour d'Appel n'ayant pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'en faire mention, je ne crois pas devoir m'y arr\u00eater. Les motifs qui ont fait le base de son jugement sont: 1\u00b0 le refus de permettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre aux interrogatoires sur faits et articles auxquels elle avait fait d\u00e9faut de comparaitre. 20 Le d\u00e9faut di identit\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 requise avec celle d\u00e9crite dans la sentence arbitrale 3\u00b0 Le d\u00e9faut des arbitres d'avoir fix\u00e9 \u00e0 leur premiere s\u00e9ance la date de la prononciation de leur sentence\nLa plus importante de ces questions est celle concernant le refus de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure de permettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'\u00eatre relev\u00e9e de son d\u00e9faut sur faits et articles et d'offrir ses r\u00e9ponses. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ii est assez facile dans une contestation s\u00e9rieuse de se faire relever de ce d\u00e9faut. L'article 225 du C. P. C. dit:\u2014\nThe party who thus makes default may, however, answer the interrogatories afterwards, before the hearing of the case, but he must bear whatever costs are occasioned by his default.\nL'art. 221 dit que les parties peuvent \u00eatre interrog\u00e9es en tout \u00e9tat de cause mais sans retardation du procss ou jugement.\nEn consultant le dossier on volt que li intim\u00e9e n'a gu\u00e8re attache d'importance \u00e0 sa contestation. L'action est entr\u00e9e en cour le 24 mars 1884; l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e de plaider le 16 avril, et la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite aux enqu\u00eates ex pante pour le 26. Les appelants avaient obtenu une r\u00e8gle pour faits et articles rapportable ce jourl\u00e0 \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9e fit d\u00e9faut.

Ce jour l\u00e0 son enqu\u00eate est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sons la r\u00e9serve du droit d'entende deux t\u00e9moins qui le sont plus tard. Ce n'est que le 7 juillet, plus de deux mois apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e de l'action et apr\u00e8s la cl\u00f4ture de l'enqu\u00eate que l'intim\u00e9e produit ses plaidoyers. Les parties soumettent la cause an juge le 8 juillet et le d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 le 9 sans qu'on sache pour quel motif. Le 2 septembre la cause est de nouveau inscrite pour audition finale au micrite pour le 17 du m\u00eame mois. Le 16 li intim\u00e9e produit l'affidavit de T.E. Normand avec un avis de motion pour permission de r\u00e9pondre aux faits et articles. Le 19 cette motion est renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. On voit par les dates de la proc\u00e9dure que c'est plus de quatre mois et demi apr\u00e8s l 'enregistrement du d\u00e9faut sur faits et articles que la demande d'en \u00eatre relev\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et an moment o\u00f9 la cause \u00e9tait inscrite pour audition finale. Cette permission n'\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment demande que dans le but gagner du temps. L'honorable juge a compris que dans des circonstances oi li intim\u00e9e avait fait preuve de tant d\u00e9 n\u00e9gligence, il ne pouvait sans violer i\u2019 article 221 accorder cette demande. Get article d\u00e9clare que l'interrogatoire sur faits et articles aura lieu sans retardation de cause. L'enqu\u00eate \u00e9tant close g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, permettre alors de r\u00e9pondre aux interrogatoires, c'\u00e9tait priver les appelants du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la preuve leur r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut de comparution et du jugement d\u00e9clarant les interrogatoires comme avou\u00e9s et confesses, et les obliger \u00e0 refaire leur enqu\u00eate. C'\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment retarder la cause, cn violation de l'article 221. Ind\u00e9pendamment de cette objection insurmontable, il en existe encore plusieurs autres pour justifier le refus de l'honorable juge. D'abord cette permission de r\u00e9pondre apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9faut ne pent \u00eatre accord\u00e9e qu'avant l'audition de la cause, b before the hearing of the case.\" La cause avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 entende lorsque la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et elle Catit au moment d'\u00eatre entendue pour la deuxi\u00e8me fois. L'art. 225 ne donne pas la facilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 laudition mais avant \"before the hearing,\" ii \u00e9tait trop tard pour faire cette demande qui, d'ailleurs, n'\u00e9tait pas faite conform\u00e9ment an dit article. En effet cet article impose \u00e0 l'octroi de cette permission une condition absolue c'est celle de payer les frais occasonnn\u00e9s par le d\u00e9faut but he must bear the costs occasiondd by his defaullt Il anrait d\u00fb accompagner sa motion du montant de la diff\u00e9rence de frais et honoraires entre l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 en \u00e9tait alors la proc\u00e9dure, et celui o\u00f9 il aurait fallu la remettre pour continuer l'enqu\u00eate. Li intim\u00e9e ne s'\u00e9tant pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 cette condition, la motion ne devait pas \u00eatre re\u00e7ue. De plus l'excuse que le buieau de direction ne s'est r\u00e9uni que le 4 septembre pour autoriser les r\u00e9ponses est insuffisante. Normand ne jure pas qu'il n'y a pas en .dc r\u00e9union du bureau entre le 26 avril et 4 septembre, et d'ailleurs l'absence de r\u00e9union du bureau n'est pas une excuse acceptable, c'\u00e9tait le devoir des officiers de la compagnie d'en convoquer une sp\u00e9cialement pour cet objet s'il ne devait pas y en avoir pour d'autre affaire. Convaincu que le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du d\u00e9faut dolt rester acquis aux appelants, et qu'il en r\u00e9sulte une preuve compl\u00e8te de toutes les al \u00e9garions de sa demande, je suis d'avis que cc motif seul serr\u00e2t suffisant pour faire infirmer le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nSi bien fo\u00e8ne que soit le refus de permettre la production des r\u00e9ponses sur faits et articles, j'inclinerais probablement \u00e0 les recevoir, si les deux autres consid\u00e9rants du jugement \u00e9taient bien fond\u00e9s en fait, mais je regrette d'avoir \u00e0 dire que je ne partage pas l'opinion de la cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. .Te crois que, comme question de fait, li identit\u00e9 de l'immeuble dont il s'agit tel quo d\u00e9crit dans l'avis d'expropriation et dans la sentence arbitrale, est parfaitement \u00e9tablie. Il en est de m\u00eame de la pr\u00e9sence de l'intim\u00e9e, on plut\u00f4t de son arbitre, lorsque la sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e. L'objection \u00e0 li identit\u00e9 du terrain consiste dans le fait que l'avis d'expropriation ne fait mention que de partie du lot cadastral 2345, tandis que la sentence mentionne partie des lots 2344, 2345 du m\u00eame cadastre. Toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dans la province sont cadastr\u00e9es et d\u00e9sign\u00e9es par num\u00e9ros. C'est leur d\u00e9signation officielle taut qu'elle n'est pas modifi\u00e9e en vertu d'une loi. Pans ce cas-ci elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu de l'acte des chemins de fer 43-44 Vict. ch. 43. En vertu de la section 8, lorsqu\u2019un compagnes de chemin de fer vent exproprier des terrains pour le passade de son chemin elle doit faire faire une carte on plan du chemin de fer son cours, des terrains qu'il doit traverser et qui devront \u00eatre expropri\u00e9s \u00e0 cette fin; aussi un livre de renvoi pour le chemin de fer qui contiendra:\u2014\na. Une description g\u00e9n\u00e9rale desterrains s\nb. Les noms des propri\u00e9taires des terrains et occupants, en tu\u00e2t qu'ils pourront \u00eatre constat\u00e9s; et\nc. Tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour bien comprendre la carte.\nCes proc\u00e9d\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre examines et certifi\u00e9s par le Commissaire d'agriculture et des travaux publics.\nDans la carte pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par les ing\u00e9nieuses de la Cie., les lots ou partie de lots requis pour le passage du chemin de fer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9signes par des num\u00e9ros particuliers. Celui des appelants est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le n\u00b0 1 sur la carte du chemin de fer et il est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le m\u00eame n\u00b0 dans l'avis et dans la sentence arbitrale, et c'est maintenant sa description l\u00e9gale, il ne peut \u00eatre connu autrement et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux nos du cadastre dans l'avis n'\u00e9tait qu'une indication sans utilit\u00e9 et nullement obligatoire apr\u00e8s l'approbation officielle et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du plan du client de fer. Dans l'avis et dans la sentence la description devenue la seule l\u00e9gale et officielle est donn\u00e9e comme \u00e9tau de deux apens et 40 perches avec r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au plan du chemin de fer et en indiquant le no de ce plan. L'identit\u00e9 est parfaite et l'erreur impossible. Si cette objection avait quelque fondement, l'intim\u00e9e n'aurait-elle pas d\u00fb en prendre avantage par son plaidoyer et mettre les appelants en demeur\u00e9e de faire la preuve de cette identit\u00e9, si elle n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 suffisamment prouv\u00e9e par l'avis et la sentence ainsi que par les autres documents en preuve? Je consid\u00e8re donc cette objection comme une pure technicit\u00e9 qui ne peut aucunement affecter la sentence ni en emp\u00eacher l'homologation.\nQuant an d\u00e9faut d'avis du \"jour o\u00f9 devait \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e la dite sentence arbitrale, la r\u00e9ponse est que la d\u00e9claration contient une all\u00e9gation qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ni\u00e9e sp\u00e9cialement que cet avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et que la r\u00e9union des arbitres le 28 juin avait eu lieu en vertu d'un ajournement. Si ces faits n'\u00e9taient pas amplement \u00e9tablis par la preuve an dossier, ils le sexaient dans tons les cas par labsence de r\u00e9ponse aux faits et articles. Mais II y a plus que cela, le proc\u00e8s-verbal authentique de la r\u00e9union des arbitres, le 28 juin, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le notaire Blondeau, fait preuve de la r\u00e9union des trois arbitres. Cette r\u00e9union n'a pu avoir lieu qu'en vertu d'un ajournement que la loi d\u00e9clare un avis suffisant (voir sec. 9, ss. 18). De plus la preuve de la pr\u00e9sence de l'arbitre de l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9j\u00e0 faite par le proc\u00e8s-verbal, est encore confirm\u00e9e par son propre t\u00e9moignage dans lequel il d\u00e9clare positivement y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent et n'avoir laiss\u00e9 la s\u00e9ance que parce qu'il diff\u00e9rait d'opinion d'avec ses coll\u00e8gues. Voici ce qu'il dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\u2014\nJ'\u00e9tais l'un des experts choisis pour faire l'arbitrage dont ii est question en cette cause. Je n'ai pas concouru dans la sentence rendue. Nous avons examine plusieurs t\u00e9moins et dans mon opinion cette sentence n'est pas conforme \u00e0 la preuve faite devant nous.\nDans ses transquestions il ajoute:\u2014\nC'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 mon opinion, mais j'\u00e9tais seul do mon opinion; les deux autres arbitres, formant la majorit\u00e9, ont concouru dans la sentence rendue apr\u00e8s l'observation de toutes les formalit\u00e9s essentielles. J'ai re\u00e7u tous les avas n\u00e9cessaires et toutes l\u00e8s proc\u00e9dures' ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8res devant les arbitres. J'ai seulement refuse de signer parce que je consid\u00e9rais le montant adjug\u00e9 exag\u00e9r\u00e9 at injuste. J'\u00e9tais l'arbitre nomm\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nAinsi, ii est \u00e9vident que le consid\u00e9rant fond\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9faut d'avis n'est pas fond\u00e9. Par tous ces motifs, je suis d'avis que le jugement de la Cour du Bane de la Reine doit \u00eatre infirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, et oelui de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli.\nHENRY J. This is an action to recover the amount of an award made by arbitrators in favor of the appellant for lands taken from him and others for the railway of the respondent company.\nNo objection to the appointment of the arbitrators, who were nominated by the parties, was made, hut two objections were taken to the award.\nOne that the arbitrators did not at their first meeting appoint a time for the final meeting to make their award. I will deal with this objection first. In the first place it is not shown that they did not do so. The proof of that issue was on the respondent company and not having adduced the proof of the allegation we have no right to assume it was not done. The respondent company was represented at the final meeting by their own arbitrator who attenddd and took part with the two other arbitrators in respect to the subject matter of the reference and in the deliberations as to the award, which was made in his presence. The company having been present by their arbitrator are estopped from making the objection.\nThe provision in the statute upon which the respondent company relies to sustain the objection was made solely to limit the time for making the award, which by the proceedings was not otherwise done, and when the time for making the award is so limited and no award be made within the time so limited the power of the arbitrator ceases and any award subsequently made would not be binding; but if before an award should be made the parties interested should mutually extend the time in a proper manner, or the arbitrators should extend it, it would be binding. Sub-section 22 of section 9 provides a and if the same (the award) is not made on or before such day or some other to which the time for making it has been prolonged either by consent of the parties, or by resolution of the arbitrators, then the sum offered by the company, as aforesaid, shall be the compensation to be paid by them.\" I therefore think the objection on that ground must fail.\nAnother objection was made that the description of the lands in the award differs from that in the submission. Such an objection was not pleaded and I am of opinion that to get any benefit from the contention it should have been. By the statute the award might have been invalidated if it did not clearly state tb sum awarded or did not describe clearly the property expropriated, but I think such a defence cannot he considered unless specially pleaded.\nThe Court of Appeal rested its judgment on two points:\n1. That of variance in the description of the land between the notice of expropriation and the description in the award and\n2. That the respondent company was not present when the award was made.\nI have already stated that, in my opinion, the respondent company was present by its arbitrator.\n\"We have now to compare the description of the lands in the notice of expropriation with that in the award.\nThe land expropriated is described in the notice for that purpose as:\nUne portion de terre de deux arpents et quarante perches en superficie, tel quo maintenant jalonn\u00e9e, et faisant partie du lot num\u00e9ro (2345) deux mille trois cent quarante-cinq du cadastre pour la paroisse de St. Sauveur de Qu\u00e9bec, et portant le num\u00e9ro un sur le plan du trace du chemin de fer tel que d\u00e9pos\u00e9 suivant la loi.\nThe description in the award is:\nUn certain terrain contenant deux arpents et quarante-cinq perches en superficie, borne au nordouest, au sudest et \u00e0 l'ouest par la dite association, et \u00e0 l'est par les h\u00e9ritiers Tourangeau et faisant partie des lots num\u00e9ros (2344 et 2345) deux mille trois cent quarante quatre et deux mille trois cent quarante-cinq du cadastr\u00e9e pour la dite paroisse de St. Sauveur, et portant le num\u00e9ro un sur la plan du trace du chemin do fer tel que d\u00e9pon\u00e9e suivant la loi.\nThere was no evidence produced to show that the land described in the award differs on the ground from that described in the notice of expropriation; there was none to show that the boundaries mentioned in the award are not exactly the same as cover the same two acres and forty perches staked off as stated in the notice \u2014the quantity is the same in both. The plan in question is referred to in both, and with it both agree as far as shown and which, appears on reference to it. The only difference that can be discovered is that two numbers of the cadastre are stated in the award \"while but one is stated in the notice. That however is unimportant for if the plan which the statute refers to as settling the size and shape of the lot expropriated, is referred to in both the notice and award there can arise no doubt as to the laud mentioned in the award being the same as that expropriated in quantity and shape, and the other parts of the description in the notice and award maybe rejected as surplusage.\nThere is therefore no variance as contended for by the respondent company.\nThere was another point referred to in the argument which was that the plaintiffs could not sue jointly on the award but I am of the opinion their action will lie. The land belonging to them was expropriated in one lot. The notice was directed to the appellant and others. It was served, we must assume on all of them. They were treated, therefore, as owners jointly, or as tenants in common. There is no evidence that I can see that they did not so hold. The award declares that the sum awarded should be paid to the same parties and I think that without any plea or evidence adduced re must assume them to be entitled to recover. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J \u2013 I would dismiss this appeal. The plaintiffs* action cannot stand upon the record as it now is. They are not the parties in favor of whom the award was made. They have not alleged nor proved that they are the association in favor of whom the award was made. Then there is no proof of Dr. Trudel's death as alleged in the declaration. Even the faits et articles do not cover that fact. The 26th relates to a Dr. Dorion. The case should be remitted to the Superior Court, with permission to the defendant to answer the faits et articles.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action upon an award made by two of three arbitrators appointed under the provisions of the statute in that behalf to assess the value of a piece of land belonging to the plaintiffs and required by the defendants to be expropriated for the purposes of their railway. The declaration specially alleges the award and the performance of all matters necessary to be performed to give effect to it. Interrogatories surfaits et articles served upon the defendants were ordered to be taken pro confessis for default in answering them. The defendants having neglected to plead to the action were, by special consent of the plaintiffs, allowed to plead upon certain conditions which, however, never were fulfilled. They filed however pleas besides the general issue to the following effect:\n1. That the said award had no legal validity and had been irregularly and illegally made. 2. That the said award is completely at variance with the proof advanced before the said arbitrators and\n3rd. That the award made by the said arbitrators is much more extensive than the evidence and the value of the piece of land in question warranted.\nA motion made by the defendants two months after the interrogatories sur faits et articles had been taken pro confessis, and without performance of the conditions upon which the plaintiffs had consented to the defendants pleading to the action for leave to produce answers to the interrogatories having been refused by the court, the case was heard upon the merits. The defendants examined two witnesses which were the only witnesses offered by them in support of their pleas. In the Superior Court judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs upon the ground that the defendants wholly faired to support their pleas impeaching the award. The Court of Queen's Bench in appeal revised this judgment upon the grounds that the motion of the defendants for leave to file answers to the interrogatories had been wrongly refused, and that in the judgment of the majority of the said Court of Appeal the piece of land mentioned in the award was different from the piece of land of which the defendants by their notice required the expropriation; and on the ground further that the arbitrators had not at their first meeting appointed a day on or before which their award should be made; wherefore the Court of Appeal set aside the award and ordered and adjudged that the parties should proceed anew to the appointment of arbitrators to determine the value of the piece of land which the defendants required to be expropriated. It is from this judgment that the present appeal is taken.\nThe appeal must in my opinion be allowed, for not only was there no evidence offered sufficient to invalidate the award but the pleas themselves contained no allegation sufficient for that purpose. To a declaration averring as the declaration in this case does, the performance of all acts essential to give validity to the award, it is no plea to say that the award has been illegally and irregularly made, or that it has no legal validity. If anything which was necessary to give the award validity had been omitted to be done, such matter should have been specially pleaded in a plea stating what was the particular matter which was omitted the omission of which is relied upon as making the award null and void; for if the omission should appear to have been in respect of some matter of mere form such an omission would not make the award null. As to the plea that the award is more extensive than the evidence and the value of the piece of land warranted that was a matter not open in the present action and if it had been, the evidence offered by the defendants upon the point only went to this that the defendants' arbitrator was of opinion that the amount awarded by the other two arbitrators was excessive. Then the grounds upon which the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal have annulled the award are, in my opinion, neither raised upon the record, nor, if they were are they established by the evidence.\nIt is not pleaded that the piece of land in respect of which the award was made is a different piece of land in whole or in part from that of which the defendants required the expropriation, and assuming such an objection to be open on the record there was no evidence offered in support of it. The grounds upon which the Court of Appeal arrived at the conclusion that the piece of land in respect of which the award has been made is a piece of land different from that of which the defendants by their notice required the expropriation, are quite inadequate.\nThe piece of land required by the defendants is by their notice declared to be a piece of land containing precisely two arpents and 40 perches and designated as number one upon a plan of the railway deposited according to law and which piece of land the notice describes as forming part of a cadastral plan No. 2345 of the Parish of St-Sauveur de Quebec. The material part of this notice is that the defendants require the piece of land designated as No. 1 on the railway plan as deposited according to law. Now the award is made in respect of the same piece of land containing just two arpents and forty perches, and designated as number one on the plan of railroad deposited according to law, and further describing it as forming parts of cadastral numbers 2344 and. 2345 in the Parish of St-Sauveur de Quebec. Now whether the piece of land so required by the defendants, and which was , designated on the plan upon which they were by law required to designate it as number one, was situated wholly on the piece of land known as the cadastral plan No. 2345, or partly upon that cadastral lot and partly upon an adjoining lot designated as cadastral lot No. 2344 in the Parish of St-Sauveur makes no difference whatever, the plaintiffs being, as is admitted, owners of the whole piece required by the defendants and designated on their plan deposited according to law as No. 1. There can be no uncertainty for the defendants could only have taken possession of, and have only taken possession of, and are by the award required to pay for, the piece of land containing the two arpents and forty perches which they have designated on their plan deposited according to law as number one. Then again, there is no plea upon the record that the arbitrators had not at their first meeting appointed a day on or before which the award should be made nor, assuming such a plea, without more to offer a good defence to the action did the evidence warrant the conclusion that no such day had been appointed or an adjudication of nullity of the award for that reason; in fact no evidence was uttered to establish the default suggested by the Court of Appeal, nor does the point appear to have been noticed in the Superior Court. If there had been such default and if it had been legally established, and if the effect of the fault was to nullify the award, then the judgment of the Court of Appeal was erroneous in ordering a new arbitration to be had for in the event of the section, which directs the arbitrators at their first meeting to appoint a lay on or before which their award shall be made, applying so as to nullify their award if made in contravention of of that section, then in such a case the act directs that the amount tendered by the defendants shall be the compensation to be paid by them.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs ([1]).\nSolicitors for appellants: Blanchet, Amyot & Pelletier,\nSolicitors for respondent: Drouin & Flynn.\n[1] Appiication for leave to appeal to the Privy Cuncil was refused.\n"}

The evidence on the trial showed that B. had knowledge, before his purchase, that a portion of the lot had been sold.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that even if B. was not fully aware that the portion so sold was that bordering on the river front, the knowledge he had was sufficient to put him on inquiry as to its situation, and he could not recover on the ground of misrepresentation. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court, by which a decree in favor of the plaintiff was affirmed.\nThe facts set up in the statement of claim and on the trial were that the defendant Macklin had offered for sale a portion of land, representing that it extended to the bank of the river Lynn; that it was bought by the plaintiff who discovered, before paying the purchase money, that the portion on the river front had previously been sold to other parties; that he then attemped to negotiate with Macklin with a view to obtaining a reduction of the price, and Macklin consented to an arbitration to fix the value of the land not so included; that the arbitration fell through and he brought an action for a rescission of the contract or compensation in the shape of reduction in the price of the land.\nThe misrepresentation as to the extent of the land was denied by Macklin, who claimed that a map was exhibited to plaintiff at the time of the sale showing the situation of the land; that he offered for sale 18 acres more or less, and the conveyance which he executed gave to plaintiff the same quantity; that if plaintiff supposed he was getting the river front he must have expected to get twenty-six acres instead of eighteen as offered in the advertisement; and that the arbitration was a farce, as he had never sold the land of which the arbitrators were to fix the value and they could award nothing for it.\nThe Chancellor, before whom the case was heard, decided in favor of the plaintiff, and ordered a reference to the master to take an account of the amount due the plaintiff on account of the misrepresentation by Macklin, giving, however, an option to the latter, to be exercised within ten days, of having the decree altered so as to direct a rescission of the contract. On appeal to the Divisional Court this judgment was confirmed, but on further appeal to the Court of Appeal it was reversed, the last mentioned court holding that the only relief that could be granted would be a rescission of the contract, and that there was nothing in the circumstances of the case to warrant the court in granting such relief as they would not support an action of deceit. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. Cassels Q.C. for the appellant.\nThis case depends entirely on questions of fact and the judge at the trial, the judges of the divisional Court and the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Court of Appeal have all concurred in finding the facts in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Under such circumstances the Court of Appeal should not have reversed the judgment. Smith v. Chadwick[1]; Redgrave v. Huril[2]; The Picton[3]; Grasett v. Carter[4].\nMr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal has not considered the case as it was presented but treated it as if it was a case for compensation from the beginning, which has never been contended for. In fact, therefore, two judges of the Court of Appeal have reversed the judgment of the court below.\nThe cases relied on by Mr. Justice Burton are not applicable. In Brownlie v. Campbell[5] there was a special agreement that errors of the character of those complained of would not entitle the purchaser to relief. Wilde v. Gibson[6] was treated as an action of deceit which would require evidence of a very different character from that required in a case like the present. Petrie v. Guelph Lumber Co.[7]\nThe following authorities also were cited: Mathias v. Yetts[8]; Newbigging v. Adam[9]; Hart v. Swaine[10]; Arkwright v. Newbold[11]; Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co.[12]\nRobinson Q.C. for the respondent.\nIn Hale v. Kennedy[13] it was contended that the court should not interfere with the findings of the courts below on matters of fact it was held, following Symington v. Symington[14], that it was a question of the practice of the appellate court.\nIn order to succeed the appellant must show absolute fraud. Kerr on Frauds[15].\nThe defendant did everything possible to supply information to the plaintiff, and if the plaintiff would not take the trouble to make inquiries and find out what he was getting he must bear the consequences.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts are very fully stated in the elaborate judgments delivered by the judges of the Court of Appeal, and need not be repeated here.\nThe plaintiff having taken a conveyance and having no contract entitling him to compensation for deficiency[16] is restricted to such relief as he may be able to obtain on the covenants for title contained in his purchase deed, or to relief by way of rescission for fraud. An action on the covenants for title was out of the question, for it is not pretended that the respondent had not a good title to all the land he assumed to convey (and which comprised all he ever contracted to convey also) that is to the two parcels of 13\u00bc acres and 13 acres respectively, less the land expressly excepted which had been sold to the railway company by Papps. There remained, therefore, no remedy open to the plaintiff (if any he was entitled to) but an action for rescission. Accordingly we find the statement of claim framed as making a case for rescission and the first claim for relief adapted to the case so made, though an alternative claim for compensation is added. The judgment, it is true, is for compensation, but I think we may accept the explanation of this given by the learned Chancellor in his judgment from which it appears that at the trial before Mr. Justice Proudfoot the learned judge offered the respondent the option of having a judgment against him for compensation instead of rescission, and that after deliberation the respondent accepted the first alternative. This option was, of course, given to the respondent with the assent of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel as it could not have been regularly offered otherwise, and having been accepted by the respondent no party can now complain of it. I must remark, however, that the offer of the option, with the assent of the plaintiff and its acceptance by the respondent, ought regularly to have been shown on the face of the formal judgment, and it is to be regretted that the proper practice in this respect was not observed.\nIn some of the learned judgments delivered in the court below much stress is laid on the form of the relief given being erroneous. Whilst I entirely agree that it would be so, apart from the assent of the parties, I also agree with Mr. Justice Osler, that if this were the only objection to the decision of the Chancery Division \u201cthere would be no difficulty in turning the judgment into one for rescission\u201d which, also agreeing with the same learned judge, I hold \u201cto be the only relief which the plaintiff can possibly be entitled to.\u201d\nThe question we have to determine is then reduced to this: Has the plaintiff made by his pleadings and evidence such a case as the well settled principles of law require to entitle him to have the conveyance of the 15th of June, 1882, by which the executory contract of sale of the 8th of the same month was carried into execution, rescinded and set aside?\nIn the late case of Brownlie v. Campbell[17] Lord Selbourne and Lord Blackburn both lay it down most distinctly that after a conveyance of land has been executed nothing in the way of misrepresentation, short of actual positive fraud, will warrant a judicial rescission between vendor and purchaser. What amounts to actual fraud in the way of misrepresentation is hardly susceptible of abstract definition. It certainly does appear from the authorities that, as regards executory contracts, innocent misrepresentation may be a ground for rescission[18]; while an action for deceit is not maintainable unless there is actual moral fraud, as is well demonstrated in the judgment of this court in the case of Petrie v. Guelph Lumber Co.[19] As regards the defence to an action for specific performance, which depends on principles altogether different from an action for rescission, it has long been settled that honest misrepresentation free from all taint of fraud will constitute a defence. The case of Brownlie v. Campbell17, however, warrants the proposition that whatever may be the rule applicable to other executed contracts a contract for the sale of land executed by a conveyance, and especially when the conveyance is preceded by a preliminary agreement in writing[20], is governed by different principles from those which regulate the same relief as applied to an executory contract requiring something to be established beyond mere innocent misrepresentation, namely, that there was either conscious falsehood on the part of the person making the representation, or that it was made by a person who ought to have known the fact, to one who had a right to rely on the accuracy of his statement, recklessly and without caring whether it was true or not[21]. In other words, a party who seeks to set aside a conveyance of land executed in pursuance of a contract of sale for misrepresentation relating to a matter of title is bound to establish fraud to the same extent and degree as a plaintiff in an action for deceit. It is not pretended in the present case that the respondent when he made the statement which is charged as fraudulent, viz., that the land he had to sell in lot 10, the southerly or 13 acres parcel, extended to the edge of the river, was knowingly stating what was false; if, then, his representation is to be deemed fraudulent, it can only be because he recklessly made the statement without knowing or caring whether it was true or false. In addition to the falsehood of the representation something more must be proved. In the words of Sir W.P. Wood, V.C., in Barry v. Croskey[22], it must also be established \u201cthat such false representation was made with the intent that it should be acted upon,\u201d by the person to whom it is made. And, further, that such person did act upon it accordingly, and from so doing suffered an injury which was an immediate and direct, and not a remote, consequence of the representation. The plaintiff cannot, therefore, succeed in this action unless he brings himself within these conditions.\nIn Redgrave v. Hurd[23] the Master of the Bolls says:\u2014\nIf it is a material representation calculated to induce him to enter into the contract, it is an inference of law that he was induced by the representation to enter into it, and in order to take away his title to be relieved from the contract on the ground that the misrepresentation was untrue, it must be shown either that he had know- ledge of the facts contrary to the representation or that he stated in terms, or shewed clearly by his conduct, that he did not rely on the representation.\nThis passage, however, has in later cases[24] been unfavorably criticised, and in Hughes v. Twisden the court say that it is not a presumption of law that the party was induced to enter into the contract by the misrepresentation, but that the misrepresentation is\nTo be regarded as an important piece of evidence from which, if there is nothing else, the court may draw the inference of fact that the plaintiff was induced by the statement to enter into the contract;\nand in the case before it, the court declined to draw such an inference.\nNext proceeding to apply these general principles of law to the facts of the present case, I think it can be shewn from the circumstances and documents in evidence, and that without transgressing any established rule of appellate procedure which requires us to consider the finding of the judge at the trial in whose presence the witnesses were examined conclusive as to their credibility, that the plaintiff when he entered into the contract of purchase, and at all events when he took his conveyance, must have had knowledge of facts which indicated to him that he could not safely rely on the representation, and further, that in point of fact the plaintiff did not rely on the representation in entering into the agreement for purchase and certainly not in completing the purchase by conveyance.\nThe case made by the statement of claim is that the whole of the two parcels were sold without exception or reservation, and that the exceptions were contained for the first time in the deed. The written agreement is not stated by the plaintiff, and the case is put forward as that of a sale in which there had been no written agreement preceding the conveyance. In pleading fraud parties are still, notwithstanding the laxity in pleading which seems now to some extent to be countenanced by the Judicature Act, bound to more than ordinary exactitude,[25] and if there were not more substantial grounds for maintaining the judgment under appeal it might be worth while to inquire whether a plaintiff could be entitled to relief in a case charging fraud, when his own statement on oath varies so materially from his pleading as we find it does here. The respondent, whilst he admits he did not know at the time he put the land up for sale at auction, nor until he examined the map on the evening of that day\u2014the 7th of June\u2014the locality of the piece of land part of the 13 acre parcel (X) which had been sold to the railway company, swears he did on that evening, by an examination of the map B made in the presence of the plaintiff, discover the exact quantity and situation of the piece of land, consisting of 2 acres and 29\/100, extending along the river front, which had been sold to the railway company. That he made this discovery on seeing the blue figures still remaining on the map (now before me) which plainly indicated these facts which, beyond doubt, they were intended to be a record or memorandum of. The exact quantity of land which the respondent had to sell in the two parcels was 18 88\/100 acres, the pieces sold to the railway company being altogether 7 87\/100 acres, viz.: 5 and 8\/100 acres, part of the 13\u00bc acres piece (Y) and 2 29\/100, part of the 13-acre parcel (X). The advertisement of sale described the land to be sold as 18 acres, more or less. The respondent, in his evidence at the trial, gives the following account of what took place on the ground on the 7th June, when he put the land up for sale by auction:\u2014\nQ. Now did you offer this land for sale? A. I did.\nQ. How many acres did you offer? A. 18 acres more or less.\nQ. Did you announce the number of acres when you offered the land for auction on the 7th June? A. I did. Q. Was the map you see before you now produced at that time shown? A. It was.\nQ. What did you represent to be the boundaries of the land that you were offering? A. Well, I had this map on the ground at the] time of the sale, the time I offered it for auction I had this plan and stated that the quantity was in two parcels, and one contained 13\u00bc and the other 13 acres, and that the quantity I had for sale was 18 acres, 88\/100\u201418 acres more or less; that one portion had been sold to the railway and was marked off; I stated there was five acres sold to the railway, five and a fraction over, and that dotted lines showed the portion sold to the railway; I stated there must have been two acres sold off the other parcel, because the quantity I had for sale was 18 86\/100, and there must have been some 7 acres sold, but I did not know on what part the two acres was.\nQ. And there was no fence on it to designate it? A. No.\nQ. And you never had examined the deed or plan of the railway company to ascertain what portion had been sold off? A. No.\nQ. Were these figures, 5.08 in parcel D referred to on that day as designating the parcel which had been sold to the railway company on that date? A. Well, I do not know whether I pointed out the figures, but I stated positively that there was about five acres sold off this piece; I pointed out the land marked off and stated it was five acres.\nQ. And off the other piece about two acres? A. Yes.\nQ. And I understand you to say you did not know what portion had been taken by the railway company; A. No, but I knew that about two acres must have been taken off C, but I did not know what portion.\nQ. Did you describe the boundary in reference to the river Lynn and lake Erie? A. Well, I described it two or three times on the ground; I stated there is 26 acres in the two parcels; there is five acres sold on one, I know about that five, and two acres sold off the other, but I did not know what two that was.\nQ. Was there any sale made on that occasion when you tried to auction it? A. No, offers were made but I refused them.\nQ, Then there was nothing further done in regard to selling the property till the evening? A. No.\nThe plaintiff and his witnesses Foster, Passmore, and Anderson all deny having heard these statements which the respondent swears to having made. They say he described the land as bounded by the river Lynn and the lake. If there was nothing more in the case it would be very difficult to say that these denials coupled with the finding of the learned judge ought not to have been considered conclusive. But even if we consider this evidence by itself, isolated from the documentary proof and the other facts and circumstances of the case, and apart from the account which we have of what afterwards occurred in connection with the sale, and from the conduct of the parties, I should, notwithstanding the direct contradiction of the respondent\u2019s testimony by the plaintiff and his witnesses, still consider that there were many surrounding circumstances to be taken into consideration as tending to confirm the respondent\u2019s account of what actually occurred. The respondent swears he only offered 18 acres and a fraction of an acre for sale; in this he must state the truth, for consistently with the hand bill, by which he had advertised the sale and which was of course before him and the other parties on the ground, he could not have offered more, for the land is described in this poster as \u201ctwo parcels containing 18 acres more or less.\u201d The plaintiff and his witnesses all state that the sale was without any restriction or specification as to the contents of the two parcels beyond the exception of the land enclosed by the railway company. That the respondent did, as he states, announce that there were some two acres to be excepted from the 13 acres as having been sold to the railway company is, to say the least, extremely probable. The parties were on the land itself, they had the plan B which showed distinctly enough that the area of the two parcels were 13\u00bc acres and 13 acres respectively. The railway fences which were before their eyes showed that a piece of the northerly parcel (Y) was in the possession of and belonged to the railway company. It would surely be most natural that seeing this the persons present taking an interest in the sale should have asked how much was included within these fences as belonging to the railway company, A very cursory examination of the plan would have enabled the respondent to answer, or others to see, that it amounted to 5 8\/010 acres; then the most simple process of calculation would have shown any one that there was in another part of the property some 2 acres more to be deducted to reduce the contents of the two parcels to the quantity of land for sale, 18 acres or thereabouts. Everything favors the inference that the statements the respondent swears he made were, in truth, made as, in the due course of what would most naturally have occurred, they would have been.\nAs regards the statement of the plaintiff and his witnesses that the respondent represented the river as the boundary, I think it very likely he may have done so, but not as the boundary of what he was actually proposing to sell, but as that of the parcel of 13 acres which he offered to sell, less a piece of some 2 acres or thereabouts sold to the railway company and the locality of which he could not determine. These considerations, if I had been dealing with this case on written evidence in a court of first instance, would have appeared to me of great weight, but as the evidence was taken in open court before a judge who has found adversely to all these probabilities after having seen and heard the oral testimony I should not, if the case had rested here, have been prepared to disturb the findings.\nThe case however does not stop here. There remains other evidence, of even greater importance than that relating to what took place at the sale, to be considered.\nIn the evening of the same day that the sale by auction had been attempted there was an interview between the plaintiff and the respondent, at which the negotiations which led to the sale now impeached were entered upon. It took place in a back room in the plaintiff\u2019s hotel, at Port Dover, at which the respondent was, at the time, staying. What then occurred is stated by the respondent in his deposition at the trial as follows:\u2014\nQ. You were staying at the plaintiff\u2019s hotel? A. Yes.\nQ. Wae there any conversation regarding this land that evening between Mr. Bell and yourself? A. Yes.\nQ. Where did it occur? A. Well, it occurred in Mr. Bell\u2019s; it was in his bar-room, and then we went into his back sitting-room.\nQ. Was this map in question before you at this time? A. Yes, Mr. Bell said \u201cwell, let us look at the map,\u201d and we went into the sitting-room and I produced the map.\nQ. Was it spread out before you on the table? A. Yes.\nQ. And did you and Mr. Bell together examine it? A. Yes, we did.\nQ. Was there any discussion or talk of the portion that had been sold oft the parcel C, that is the parcel nearest the lakes? A. Oh, yes, it was about that, the object of examining the map was to ascertain where the two acres had been sold off.\nQ. Will you tell us what took place between you and Mr. Bell? A. I then looked over the map with Mr. Bell and I noticed the figures 2.29 in the land, and says I \u201cMr. Bell, I can tell you now where the parcel is off,\u201d and so I made a memo, and I numbered the two parcels 13\u00bc, and 13 altogether, and took 5.08 and 2.29 and added them together and deducted them from 26\u00bc and the remainder was 18 88\/100, and I said that is the parcel that was sold, and I said that proves that this 2 29\/100 is the portion that had been sold to the railway company.\nQ. Is there any doubt that you gave Mr. Bell to understand that a portion had been sold to the railway company oft this part C? A. No, not the slightest, and I made out a memo. in writing showing the result and handed it to Mr. Bell that evening.\nQ. Did you come to an agreement that night? A. Well, no.\nQ. And did he make you an offer? A. He did make an offer that he would give the $1,200; I did not accept it that night, but it was accepted the next morning.\nQ. And you drew up and he signed this paper? A. Yes.\nQ. Was there any discussion the following morning regarding the 2.29 parcel at all, and was the map taken out and examined the following morning? A. There was no discussion; I am not sure whether the map was taken out and referred to; I accepted the offer the next morning and drew up that agreement signed by Mr. Bell as already stated.\nThe account of what occurred at the interview as given by the plaintiff is less positive than his evidence respecting the events of the morning. Indeed, he gives varying, if not inconsistent, accounts of it in his ex- amination before the trial and in his evidence at the trial. Being examined previously to the trial before an examiner, his statement is as follows:\u2014\nI didn\u2019t ask Mr. Macklin about parcel \u201cX,\u201d I paid no attention to it. I had the map and examined it, and saw the figures 13 acres. I never gave it much of a thought; I thought Macklin owned the parcel, and thought the map to be correct; I had a conversation with Mr. Macklin on the evening of the day on which the land was offered for sale on the premises; it was in the back sitting room. I think we were there alone, the agreement for sale had not then been signed, the subject of the sale of this land was being talked of between us; I don\u2019t know if the map was referred to, I won\u2019t say whether it was or not. I think we made a bargain that night, we agreed on the price I think. I don\u2019t recollect my saying to him on his retiring to bed, \u201cyou had better take $1,200 for the parcels\u201d; I did not make Mr. Macklin an offer during the day the land was offered on the premises; I did bid $1,200 at the sale, and he refused it, he was asking $1,400 for these two parcels, and I had made up my mind not to give it.\nDuring the afternoon I had given up all idea of buying, and during the afternoon no negotiations had taken place between me and Mr. Macklin; until we met in the evening I had given up all idea of buying, as I supposed Macklin would not take less than $1,400.\nThe agreement \u201cC\u201d was signed by me on the evening of the day when the property was offered, or on the morning of the next day; before I signed this agreement I read it, after I signed the agreement I might have looked over the map, but cannot say.\nIn his cross-examination the plaintiff, speaking of the map and of what occurred at the interview in the evening, does not at first deny that he then saw the map, as the following extract from the deposition shews. Speaking of the map, he is asked:\nQ.\u2014Was it before you on the evening of the day on which the auction was held, did you see it then? A.\u2014Well, I might, I do not recollect; I recollect him leaving it with me; he left it with me that morning he was going away; I suppose that was when the bargain was made about the land.\nIn a subsequent part of the cross examination the plaintiff makes the following statement respecting this interview in the evening:\nQ. Did you bring along with you the little memo. in pencil or ink that Mr. Macklin gave you before the agreement was signed, showing you how this 18 acres was made up? A. No. Q. Will you swear he did not give you such a memo.? A. No.\nQ. I refer to the memo. that my client says he gave you the night before the agreement was signed, showing how the land was made up, 18 88\/100? A. I have no recollection of it.\nAnd further on we have this evidence:\nQ. After the auction sale was over Mr. Macklin was staying at your hotel? A. Yes.\nQ. And you talked in the evening? A. Yes.\nQ. What was the subject of your conversation? A. Well, he wanted to get $1,400 for the place and I told him I would not give more than I had bid for it.\nQ. Where did you go that evening to discuss the matter? A. Well, I forget where it is.\nQ. He says it was in the back room, but it was in some private room; have you any doubt that was so? A. Well, I think that must have been in some room, I do not think it was in the barroom.\nQ. Had you that map before you that evening? A. No, the map Was never given to me till after I signed that agreement; that was the only time I saw the map on the day of sale till after I bought it, and he gave me the map and said this would show me what I had bought.\nQ. Then you swear positively that map was not before you previous. to the signing of the agreement? A. No.\nQ. Were there any papers before you? A. Not any, I do not recollect any papers at all only we made the agreement and he said, I will let you have it for $1,200.\nNow if the respondent did, previously to the signing of the agreement for sale, either point out to the plaintiff the actual locality of the 2 29\/100 acres on the map, as he swears he did, or if he at any time before the conclusion of the contract told the plaintiff that 2 29\/100 acres, part of the 13 acres, had been sold to the railway company, and that he was not able to specify the site, but that wherever it was it was to be considered as excepted from the sale, it is manifest that the action must fail, for in the first case the effect of any misrepresentation as to quantity or description would be neutralised by the disclosure of the truth, and in the second case, the plaintiff would have had before concluding his bargain ample notice that he was not to rely on any representation as to the water frontage since the land (13 acre parcel) was sold subject to an exception of a piece of 2 29\/100 acres, the locality of which was not ascertained and of which the plaintiff had to take the risk.\nIs there then any evidence to be found in the case, apart from the testimony of the respondent himself, which warrants the inference that any such communications were made by the respondent to the plaintiff? Direct evidence, save that of the respondent, there certainly is none, but I think there are circumstances stated by the plaintiff himself which authorize the presumption that the facts as they now appear with regard to the locality of the land sold must have been brought to the notice of the plaintiff before he entered into the contract of purchase. In the plaintiff\u2019s examination before the examiner he made this statement:\u2014\nI thought I was buying piece marked \u201cX\u201d in which there was 13 acres marked. I didn\u2019t think there was 13 acres on it; I thought I Was getting 8 acres, and a little less than 11 acres in the two parcels, in the neighbourhood of 18 acres altogether.\nThe time here referred to is, of course, that of making the agreement for sale. We have here then this most important admission from the mouth of the plaintiff himself, that at the time he made the contract to purchase he knew exactly the contents of the land he was buying, namely, \u201cin the neighbourhood of 18 acres altogether\u201d, and he knew that he was getting 8 acres in one parcel and a little less than 11 acres in the other which was also almost exactly the truth, the fact being that the northern parcel (Y), after deducting the 5 acres 8\/100 sold to the railway, contained 8 acres 17\/100 and the southern parcel, that principally in question (X), after deducting 2 29\/100 acres contained 10 71\/100 acres, Which the plaintiff was entitled to under his contract. All this the plaintiff swears he knew on the morning of the 8th June when he completed the bargain to purchase for $1,200 and the agreement was signed. Now, the plaintiff has sworn most positively that he did not know these particulars before the auction, and that he did not acquire the knowledge of them at that time. The plaintiff says nothing took place between the respondent and himself, and that nothing in the way of, negotiations about the land passed until the evening interview already mentioned in the extracts given from the evidence of both the plaintiff and respondent. It is not and could not be suggested that there were any sources from which the plaintiff could have acquired this information in the interval between the date of the return from the ground after the attempted auction sale and the making of the agreement early the next morning, except from an examination of the map, or from the respondent. We are, therefore, irresistibly forced to come to the conclusion that when the plaintiff made the purchase he did so, either after an examination of the map which must have disclosed the exact position and boundaries of the excepted 2 29\/100 acres, and therefore have entirely removed the effect of any misdescription previously made by the respondent, or the fact that 2 29\/100 acres were to be excepted out of the 13 acres piece, as having been sold to the railway company, must have been communicated to him by the respondent, and, if so, it is to be presumed there must have been involved in that communication one or the other of three alternative explanations as to the locality of the piece so to be deducted as belonging to the railway company, for, 1st, it must either have been defined, as it actually appeared laid down in the map B; or (2) it must have been represented to have been in some other ascertained locality; or (3) it must have been stated by the respondent, that although the quantity of land to be excepted was ascertained he was not able to define its situation, and that consequently the purchase was necessarily subject to uncertainty and risk as regarded the silus of this piece previously sold by the respondent\u2019s authors in title. The second alternative we must altogether reject since such a representation that the two and a half acres were in some other part of the land than the locality where it is shown on the map, would have been a distinct and independent fraud with which the plaintiff does not pretend to charge the respondent, and therefore one which cannot be presumed against him. Then the respondent\u2019s communication, if that was the source from which the plaintiff obtained his knowledge that 2 29\/100 acres was to be excepted, must necessarily have been accompanied, either by a description of it according to the lines and marks on the map, or it must have involved a statement that the locality was uncertain and not within the knowledge of the respondent and so have been sufficient to give the plaintiff notice that he was running the risk which he actually took upon himself by the agreement he afterwards entered into of buying the land subject to the exceptions of the parts previously sold which remained undefined except as to quantity. Taking either of these alternatives, and one or the other of them must be true unless, indeed, the plaintiff got his knowledge from the map itself, the plaintiff cannot possibly say that he purchased on the faith of the representation that he was to get the whole J 3 acres with the river for his boundary on the south; he must either have been informed of the exact truth that this frontage had been already sold, or he must have been warned, if not in express words yet by an intimation sufficiently direct for the purpose, not to rely on any representation as to the frontage which had been made at the auction by being to d that 2 29\/100 acres had already been sold in some unknown situation, from which it must have been an obvious deduction to be made by any sensible man that this piece previously sold might include the river front which the plaintiff says it was his object to acquire in making the purchase. If, under these circumstances and in the face of either actual knowledge or of such a warning as I have mentioned, the plaintiff thought fit to conclude a bargain and enter into the contract which he signed for the purchase of the land, he did so with his eyes open and the maxim caveat emptor is the plain answer to the claim for relief which he now puts forward.\nAnother aspect in which we are, I think, entitled to view the case, by reason of this admission of the plaintiff that at the date of his purchase he knew with reasonable exactitude the quantity of land in each of the two parcels, is that taken in connection with the undeniable facts that his knowledge in this respect could only have been acquired by him at the evening interview, by a personal examination of the map, or from information which the respondent then gave him, it casts doubt and suspicion on the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to what passed on that occasion. It will be remembered that the plaintiff in his examination before the trial says he does not know, and will not say, whether the map was referred to or not at the evening meeting in the back room, where it is to be remembered the parties were alone. Again, in the earlier part of his cross examination at the trial, he refuses to swear that the respondent did not give him the memorandum shewing the contents of the parcels and the deductions to be made, which the respondent had positively sworn to in his evidence, though later on he positively denies that he either saw the map or got the memorandum. These inconsistencies, however, when coupled with the unavoidable inferences already pointed out to be drawn from the important admission made by the plaintiff on the preliminary examination, as to the state of his knowledge at the time of the purchase, are I think sufficient wholly to discredit his evidence as regards what passed at the interview on the evening immediately preceding the agreement for the purchase. This leaves the respondent\u2019s account of that interview uncontradicted, and having regard to the intrinsic marks of truthfulness which the respondent\u2019s statement contains, and to the subsequent conduct of the parties which is strongly confirmatory 6f the respondent\u2019s evidence, I am of opinion that his testimony should be accepted as worthy of credit, which is of course conclusive of the case.\nI do not consider that we are precluded from acting on this view of the evidence by the rule laid down in \u201cThe Picton,\u201d[26], and in Grassett v. Carter[27], as well as in other cases decided both here and in England. I have always considered that rule which recognises the finality of the finding of the trial judge who sees and hears the witnesses as limited to cases where questions of facts are entirely dependent on the credit to be given to one witness or set of witnesses over another or others proffering testimony directly contradictory, and when neither documentary evidence nor admitted or incontrovertible facts can be called in aid to turn the scale. I adhere to the rule as laid down in the Court of Appeal in the case of Sanderson v. Burdett[28], and as there propounded there is nothing in it which excludes an appellate court from drawing inferences from documentary evidence or admitted or incontroverted facts, or from any gross inconsistencies and self contradictions which may be found in the depositions of witnesses. I find nothing in the judgments of the Court of Appeal offending against the rule in question when thus limited and defined. They have dealt with the evidence in a way they were entirely justified in doing, by drawing inferences from the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, from documents and from the conduct of the parties, and in doing this they have not, I think, invaded in the slightest degree the province of the trial judge to determine the degree of credit to be given to the witnesses so far as that is exclusively to be determined from their demeanor while under examination. And in the scrutiny to which I have submitted the evidence I venture to say that I am equally free from any offence against the rule in question.\nAnother rule which I consider altogether distinct from that just adverted to is propounded by the Privy Council in Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co.[29], according to which a second court of appeal ought not to reverse the concurrent decision of two preceding courts on a question of fact. I do not regard this as applying to the Divisional Court and therefore it was open to the Court of Appeal to review the case on the facts, within proper limits, which having done they have reversed the decisions of the Chancery Division. It is not now proposed to reverse their decision, but to affirm it. Allen v. The Quebee Warehouse Co.29 does not therefore apply.\nI should have pointed out that the conduct of the parties immediately after the sale and up to the month of July, 1883, when the plaintiff for the first time advanced the claim which he afterwards made the subject of this litigation, was entirely consistent with the view I take that the respondent\u2019s evidence of what passed during the negotiations for the sale, on the evening of the 7th June, 1882, was truthful and entitled to credit. In the first place, the respondent left with the plaintiff the map shewing clearly, as it does to this day, by figures and letters written with a blue crayon, the exact quantity and location of the 2 29\/100 acres to be excepted from the sale of the 13 acres, and according to the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence the respondent said that he did this in order that the plaintiff might examine it and see what land he had bought. Now, it must be remembered that this was done whilst the sale was still in an executory stage, a week before the execution of the conveyance and two months before it was completed according to the contract, by the execution of the mortgage securing the purchase money. Can it be supposed that if the respondent had induced the plaintiff to become a purchaser by gross fraud and misrepresentation, as the plaintiff contends he did, that he would thus spontaneously put into the plaintiff\u2019s hands, with a recommendation to examine it, a document the slightest examination of which would have exposed his dishonest trick, and enabled the plaintiff to set aside the contract he had just entered into? Further, is it to be supposed that if the plaintiff had for the first time become aware in the month of April, the very latest date to which the information received from Anderson can be ascribed, of the fraud which he pretends the respondent had practised upon him he would have remained silent for more than three months before making any complaint and during that time have written the letters which we find in the correspondence of June, 1883? All this is entirely inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s evidence but entirely in keeping with the account given by the respondent.\nThe arbitration agreement has, I think, but little bearing on the case. As Mr. Justice Osler points out there is nothing like an admission on the part of the respondent involved in the submission to arbitration itself. The respondent does not admit his liability to make good to the plaintiff the value of the land sold to the railway company, and merely refers the amount of the indemnity which he was to pay to arbitration, but according to the submission which he proposed, and both parties signed, the whole question of liability as it is now raised in this action was made the subject of arbitration. There can, of course, be no admission involved in such a reference. It is said, however, that during the negotiations about the arbitration it was admitted by the respondent that he had actually sold the land as bounded on the river Lynn. It is scarcely possible that any such admission was made, as the written documents, the contract and conveyance by which the sale was carried out, directly contradicted any such statement as the respondent well knew. It is also said that the respondent at this time admitted that he had represented the land as extending to the river. This is denied by the respondent. It is asserted by the plaintiff, by Foster and Folinsby. As regards the plaintiff his evidence is entitled to little or no weight since the discredit cast upon his testimony in other respects for the reasons already fully discussed shows that he is an unreliable witness. Folinsby\u2019s deposition, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Patterson, contains internal evidence of his untruthfulness, and shows that he was an instructed witness; he speaks of the dispute as to the place at which the arbitration shoul4 be held as having arisen at the interview at Port Dover when the submission was signed, when, in fact, it did not arise until some time afterwards and then not at any meeting between the parties but in the course of correspondence, so that he must have been told by others what he states about it and alleges to have taken place at this time; we must therefore put aside his evidence also. There remains Captain Foster whom I must, on the finding of the learned judges, accept as a candid and truthful witness; his statement is, how- ever, entirely inconsistent with the document drawn up and signed by the parties at the time. Moreover, he gives his evidence with a lack of clearness and precision which greatly impairs its force. His memory is not good, as he himself admits, and in the case of a witness detailing a conversation this is, of course, of importance. But granting all he deposes to to have been admitted by the respondent, I think we may safely assume that it referred only to what passed on the day of the auction sale, which the evidence already adverted to shows was explained and rendered innocuous by the subsequent information given by the respondent to the plaintiff in the evening.\nOn the whole, I am of opinion that the action entirely failed on the evidence and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action brought by the appellant against the respondent and one David Foster for the cancellation of a conveyance of lands made by the respondent to the appellant and Foster. The conveyance in question was in pursuance of an agreement previously entered into between the parties as the result of previous negotiations between the appellant and respondent. A mortgage for the amount of the purchase money ($1,200) was executed by the appellant and Foster; after which (on the 23rd of September, 1882,) Foster, for the consideration of $200, sold and conveyed his interest in the lands to the appellant, he, the appellant, agreeing to pay the mortgage.\nThe appellant concludes his statement of claim as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff claims:\u2014\n1. That the agreement for sale of said lands may be set aside and cancelled and that said conveyance by the defendant Macklin to said plaintiff and defendant Foster, and the said mortgage from the plaintiff and Foster to the defendant Macklin may be set aside and cancelled, and the defendant Macklin ordered to repay to the plaintiff all moneys paid by him on account of said mortgage.\n2. Or that an account of the value of said lands so excepted by said conveyance may be had and taken, and the amount thereof deducted from the amount due or accruing due on said mortgage, and that the said mortgage may be reformed accordingly.\nThe appellant, therefore, seeks in the first place the cancellation of the conveyance with the resulting legal consequences; or if he cannot establish his right to the cancellation he asks to have compensation awarded him for what he alleges to be a deficiency in the quantity of land purchased.\nThe learned judge (Mr. Justice Proudfoot) gave a judgment on the hearing for relief and \u201creferred it to the master to determine the amount that ought to be deducted from the purchase money.\u201d\nIf the learned judge considered that the evidence was sufficient to justify a judgment for cancellation we should necessarily consider that his judgment would have taken that shape. We have, therefore, the right, and I think we are bound, to conclude that he considered that in that respect the appellant had failed.\nThere was an appeal to the divisional court resulting in a confirmation of the judgment and then an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and judgment rendered by the latter court, allowing the appeal and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action. From the latter the case was removed by appeal to this court. It has been fully argued and we have to give judgment.\nThe law is well settled that if a party agrees by a binding contract to sell a certain ascertained lot of land he is bound to convey it all. If he afterwards tenders a conveyance of less land the purchaser is not bound to accept and no court would hold him bound to do so either in a suit for specific performance or otherwise but, on the contrary, specific performance would be decreed against the vendor. That, if his contention has any foundation, was the position of the appellant before the conveyance. It is naturally to be considered that a party selling land should know what his title to it is and the extent of it, of which the purchaser may be considered either to be wholly ignorant or, at all events, not to be so well informed. The purchaser may, therefore, be presumed to trust to his agreement and to its guarantee.\nThe duties and liabilities are, however, wholly changed after a conveyance is accepted. The case of Hart v. Swaine[30] has been cited and relied on by one or more of the learned judges in the courts below. It is, however, wholly inapplicable to this case. In that case a vendor sold and conveyed land as treehold, and the purchaser afterwards ascertained that the vendor had but a copyhold title. The sale was set aside with costs and expenses. The deed in that case conveyed by a title not held by the vendor. The decision in that case does not at all affect the rights involved here. The misrepresentation in that case was in the conveyance itself. In every county in Ontario there is a registry of titles and a purchaser has the right, and it is his duty, to ascertain from an inspection of the title of the seller how his title covers the lands purchased. In the written agreement for the lands in question certain portions of the two lots purchased are excepted as lands stated to have been conveyed by the original owner, Papps, who held as a trustee, to the Hamilton and North Western Railway Company. In the conveyance to the respondent of the lands sold by him to the appellant the same exception is made, so that by reference to the registry the exception to the portion would have appeared, and not only so but the description of the lands in the conveyance or conveyances to the railway company would have shown that the 2 29 acres, which is the subject of the present contestation, was one of the two exceptions referred to in the agreement and conveyance. If then before the acceptance of the conveyance the appellant did not avail himself of the means at his command to ascertain the extent of the portions so excepted the laches were his own and he cannot now be permitted to complain. The description in the agreement was of two parcels of land \u201csaving and except thereout the portions sold, &c. The appellant was, therefore, informed that thereout,\u201d meaning out of each parcel, a portion, if not portions, had been conveyed to the railway company and were not intended to be included in the lands sold and to be conveyed. He was thereby invited to ascertain for himself what the portions consisted of, and he had every opportunity of doing so. Besides, he lived near by; and, as far as can be gleaned from the evidence, knew really more about the land than the respondent, who lived at Toronto and had only recently got them, together with other lands in other places, for a lump sum.\nI have read attentively all the judgments given, and I have no hesitation in declaring that those of three learned judges of the Court of Appeal who dismissed the action commend themselves to my judgment.\nIn those judgments the law is fully, and, as I think, properly stated, and the facts referred to. They are exhaustive and leave little to be added. I concur with them most fully, both as to the several questions of law involved and as to their conclusions as to the facts from the evidence.\nThe learned judge of first instance decided principally on the evidence of what took place at the unsuccessful attempt to sell at the auction and his decision is mainly based on what he considered the weight of evidence as to what then was said by the respondent and others; and the same consideration seems to have influenced the decision of the Divisional Court and the learned Chief Justice. It is not a pleasure to do so, but duty compels me to say that, according to the law as found in the most controlling authorities, what passed on that occasion cannot be considered as affecting the rights of the respondent. There is a contradiction in the evidence of what then took place, but, in my view, whoever may have stated truly what then took place it does not matter. It is a well established principle in regard to evidence in a case like the present one, that recourse cannot be had to preliminary statements without actual fraud after a written agreement is entered into as to the subject matter; besides, it is proved without contradiction that the terms and particulars were agreed upon after the abortive attempt to sell by auction and without reference to what took place thereat. It is shown that a plan was exhibited to the appellant\u2014it was critically examined by him and left with him, and he had it from thence in his possession. He had, therefore, all the information that the respondent had. He knew then that fact. There was no secreting or keeping back by the respondent of any information he had as to the excepted portions of the two lots, but there is this further conclusive evidence. The respondent says that during the negotiation which resulted in the written agreement, he made a memorandum of the 18.88 acres he was selling, and that the appellant then offered $1,200 for the lots which he did not then accept but that next morning he did accept that offer. The memorandum as is follows:\u2014\nParcel C, 13 acres, reserved 2.25 acres, for sale 10.71 acres.\nD, 13\u00bc\n5 08\n8.17\n26\u00bc\n7\n18.88 The appellant was asked on the trial, when being examined, if he brought that memo with him, to which he replied \u201cno.\u201d He said he had no recollection of it, but declined to say he did not get it. He in that respect does not deny that the respondent\u2019s statement was correct. We must, therefore, conclude that the statement of the respondent was true. What then does it show? Nothing less than that the appellant well knew from the plan and the memo. that the 2.29 acres now in dispute had been sold to the railway company and formed no part of the land he was purchasing.\nThen we have the letters written after the appellant made the discovery that the 2.29 acres were not included in the agreement and conveyance. In the statement of claim of the appellant the time of the discovery is put down as in the September following. In his examination he puts it down as in October or November, and said that it certainly was before December. In his evidence on the trial he puts the time as the April following. Why he was induced to finally postpone the time to the April following may be gathered from his letters to the respondent. In November, 1882, he writes to the respondent forwarding $55 on account of the mortgage, and expressing his belief that he would be able to make the first payment early in the spring.\nOn the 16th June, 1883, being subsequent to his admitted knowledge in April, he writes to the respondent:\u2014\nI received yours of the eighth of June and in reply I have to say that your money is ready for you when you want it, &c.\nbut no intimation of the alleged discovery is given. On the 23rd of the same June he wrote again about a matter of rent and interest, and about the boundaries of lot D not in question in this suit, but made no camplaint about 2.29 acres. He wrote again on the 27th of the same month in respect of the land conveyed to him, and there is no complaint or reference to the 2.29 acres. He must be a man of a very patient and angelic temperament, to write as he did after making the alleged discovery that the respondent had induced him by fraud and false representations to pay for land he did not own or from which there was, at least, to be deducted the most valuable part. Such praiseworthy conduct would place him far above the large majority of mortals, but as he has not been shown to occupy such an exceptionally high position, we are bound to conclude that when he wrote those letters he did not feel that he had equitably, legally or morally any cause of complaint.\nReference has been made to the fact that when about the time the second and last payment on the mortgage was falling due and the complaint now attempted to be made was started, but refused to be admitted by the respondent, he agreed to refer the matter to arbitration; and it is advanced as an argument to sustain the complaint. I cannot in deciding this case give that fact the slightest weight. The one party complained, the other denied there was any reason for it, and they agreed to refer the matter to arbitration. If admitted to have any weight in this case, why not in every other where a party resisting a claim agreed to a reference to settle the contest.\nAfter reading the able and exhaustive judgments of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal before referred to, both as to the law governing the points in issue and as to the facts in evidence, I feel it wholly unncessary to say more than that the declarations of the law made by them cannot by any recognised authorities be found incorrect, and I think that their estimate of the evidence is entitled to the approval of this court.\nI will only add, and in general terms, that the rule referred to by the learned Chief Justice in regard to the finding of the judge of first instance only applies to cases where there is merely oral contradictory evidence and does not apply, to a case like this where written evidence largely affecting the decision is adduced and the truth of which and its application to the issues can as well be decided by a court of appeal. In this case there is, however, more, for the learned judge admitted improperly, as we have the right to decide, evidence as to what took place at the time of the attempted and abortive sale by auction and founded his decision principally thereupon.\nFor the reasons given I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, the judgment of the court below affirmed and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur in the review of the evidence as made by my brother Strong and by the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nToo much stress appears to me to have been laid by the Court of Chancery upon the evidence as to the statements alleged to have been made by the defendant at the auction which fell through, and too little upon what took place subsequently, for those statements, assuming them to have been made at the abortive auction, cannot have had, or at least should not have had, in view of what took place subsequently, any influence in inducing the plaintiff to enter into the contract which he subsequently did enter into; and having entered into that contract the plaintiff has offered no sufficient excuse for his not having promptly taken measures to procure a rescission of the contract if he had had any confidence in the truth of those allegations of fraud which he has so freely made in his statement of claim and still insists upon.\nThe material points in the case appear to me to be, that after the abortive auction and in the evening of that day the plaintiff and defendant entered into negotions for the purchase and sale of the 18 acres which the defendant had unsuccessfully offered for sale at auction they went together into a room at the plaintiff\u2019s house and the defendant produced a map, which he left with the plaintiff, and which showed the piece of land now in question as containing 2 29\/100 acres; the defendant swears he then pointed out this piece to plaintiff as not being included in what the defendant was offering for sale, and as being one of two pieces previous]y sold to the railway company by the person from whom the defendant acquired title; the plaintiff says he does not recollect this, but he admits that the plaintiff left the map with him, at least from the time the contract was signed, which showed in blue pencil a piece of land upon the river described as containing 2 29\/100 acres, which, being deducted from one of the pieces, together with 5.08 acres deducted from the other piece, which pieces together contained the 18 acres, more or less, which the defendant was offering for sale, made precisely 18 88\/100 acres, whereas, if this piece should be included in what the defendant was offering for sale, the plaintiff, as it appears he well knew, would have got 26 27\/100 acres for the 18 the defendant was intending and offering to sell.\nThen the agreement is signed on the following morning, the map being still left in the possession of the plaintiff, and this agreement shews in express terms that at least two pieces were excepted from the description as given of the two pieces of land on which the eighteen acres the defendant was agreeing to sell were situate. The area of the excepted pieces being deducted from the whole area left the eighteen acres the defendant was agreeing to sell, and these two excepted pieces were spoken of as having been previously sold to the railway company. The plaintiff then, by this agreement, the existence of which he has slippressed in his statement of claim, had express notice of there being two pieces excepted, which notice rendered it incumbent upon him to find ont where they were. Had he looked at the map, which he retained in his possession, that would have shewn him, or he could have ascertained their situs by reference to the railway company or to the registry office, if he did not already know it from what had taken place between him and the defendant on the occasion of their examining the map together the night before the contract was entered into. Then a week after the contract was signed a deed was executed by the defendant and delivered to the plaintiff, describing the land sold precisely as it was described in the contract of sale, and about two months after the plaintiff executes a mortgage back securing the purchase money. Then the plaintiff in his statement of claim, and subsequently on his examination upon his statement of claim, alleges that in the month of September or October following the execution of the deed to him he first acquired the information that the piece of land now in question containing the 2 29\/100 acres above mentioned had been one of the pieces sold to the railway company, and therefore did not belong to the defendant at the time the contract of sale was entered into. Yet with this knowledge the plaintiff entered into possession of the land on December 1, and he wrote to the defendant the letters which have been sufficiently commented upon by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Then in July, 1883, he pays the defendant $400 on account of the purchase money secured by the mortgage.\nIt is true that he did this when the defendant agreed to refer to arbitration a question as to whether the plaintiff should have any reduction made to him from the price agreed upon, but his paying that sum, what- ever may have been his motive in paying it, was an express abandonment of all claim, if the plaintiff ever had any, for rescission of the contract. Upon the whole, not to repeat comments upon the evidence which has been so fully reviewed in the Court of Appeal for Ontario and by my brother Strong, in which review I entirely concur, I am of opinion that the plaintiff has completely failed in establishing the fraud alleged in his statement of claim, and that therefore the appeal must be dismissed with costs and his claim in the Court of Chancery dismissed out of that court with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: T.G.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nLitigious rights, sale of\u2014Arts. 1582\u20141583--1584, \u00a7 4 C. C. (P. Q)\nB. became holder of 40 shares upon transfers from D. & al, in the capital stock of the St. Gabriel Mutual Building Society. At the time of the transfers the shares in question had been declared forfeited for non-payment of dues. Subsequently by a Superior Court judgment rendered in a suit of one C., other shares, which had been confiscated for similar reasons, were declared to be valid and to have been illegally forfeited, Thereupon B. by a petition for writ of mandamus asked that he be recognized as a member of the society and be paid the amount of dividends already declared in favor of and paid to other shareholders. B.'s action was met, amongst other pleas, by one, setting forth: that B. had acquired under the transfers in question, litigious rights and that, by law, he was only entitled to recover from the respondents the amount he had actually paid for the same, together with legal interest thereon and his cost of transfers.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Fournier and Henry J J. dissenting, that at the time of the purchase of said shares, B. was a buyer of litigious rights within the provisions of Art. 1583 C. C, and under Art. 1582 could only recover from the liquidators the price paid by him with interest thereon.\nAlso, that the exception in Art. 1584 \u00a7 4 of C. C. only applies to the particular demand in litigation which has been confirmed by a judgment of a court, or which having been made clear by evidence is ready for judgment.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, Appeal side ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, maintaining a plea of litigious rights. The appellant sued the respondents, the liquidators of the St. Gabriel Mutual Building Society, claiming a mandamus to compel them to acknowledge him as a shareholder in the society and to collocate him for dividends on 40 shares he held under transfers, on equal terms with other members. The principal plea set up by respondents was that appellant was a buyer of litigious rights and under Art. 1582 of the Civil Code, could only recover the price paid, with interest thereon.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows Hugh Brady, the appellant, purchased from George Dalrymple, Samuel McFee, Alexander Coultry and William Haddlesley all members of the St. Gabriel Mutual Building Society, their hooks or shares in the latter. At the time of this purchase, the books be-longing to these members had been confiscated and declared forfeited for non-payment of dues. Dalrymple and the other shareholders (appellant's vendors had been notified of such forfeiture, and had acquiesced therein, until the society went into liquidation.\nSubsequent to the society going into liquidation, the appellant, not a member of the said Society, procured from the shareholders above mentioned transfers of their respective books or shares for a consideration in most of the cases of twenty five cents on the dollar of the amount each had paid into the society; and in one case as the evidence discloses, in consideration of the sum of $15 dollars, another further sum being payable in the event of the appellant being successful in his proposed lawsuits against the respondents for the recovery of the whole amount of the said books or shares.\nSubsequent to the acquisition of these books or shares by the appellant, a test case, on behalf of the shareholders whose books had been forfeited but not transferred, was instituted against the respondents by one Rev. Mr. Charbonneau, whose shares had been so forfeited; and the Court of Queen's Bench, in appeal, held that the forfeiture in question not having, been accompanied by all the formalities required by law, was insufficient and illegal. It was subsequent to this judgment that the appellant instituted his action, in which were rendered the judgments now appealed from.\nDoherty for the appellant.\nThe question is whether art 1583 of the Civil Code applies. At this time when the present appellant acquired these shares were they litigious rights Refers to report of the case in 2 M. L. R. 272, and Troplong Vente ([2]) Marcar d\u00e9 Droit Civil ([3]).\nCurran Q.C. for the respondent cited Pothier, Contrat de Vente ([4]); 4th Report of Codifiers ([5]) on arts. 99-100 now arts. 1552, 1583 C. C. (4).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014There can be no doubt that at the time this purchase was made the shares had whether rightly or wrongly been decaled confiscated and forfeited by the company for non payment of dues, and that the company at the time of the transfer were insisting on the validity of such confiscation and forfeiture and did not withdraw such contention until the decision of a suit by another party whose shares had been similarly confiscated and forfeited, where by such confiscation and forfeiture was declared invalid and there can be no doubt that it was well understood by all parties that an action for the recovery of the rights claimed would be necessary, in fact the purchase was made on speculation by appellant with full knowledge that the company considered the forfeiture effective and the claim disputed and in the belief that before anything could be realized litigation would be necessary. The evidence of the appellant himself is conclusive to my mind, and as to the litigious character of the right sold establishes the case of the respondent.\nOn his examination as to the purchase of these shares he says:\u2014\nI bought them at very reduced prices. I paid Alex. Country $40.50 for his shares; I paid Sara. McKee $51.25 for his shares; I paid to Win. Haddlesley $19.25, and I paid to Geo. Dalrymple$15 for his shares, with the understanding that if I succeeded in getting the whole amount, paid on his shares I would give him a further sum of $15. Thus he only paid $126 for shares which, according to his claim, would give him $727.75 for dividends already declared, as well as establish his rights to the future dividends.\nMcKee says:\u2014\nI understood that a lawsuit would have to be instituted before we could get the amount, and I sold Brady the books at his own risk; and Wm. Haddlesley being asked whether he sold a lawsuit, answered, \"1 understood it that way, certainly.\"\nAs William Haddlesley says:\u2014\nI am one of the former shareholders of the St. Gabriel Mutual Building Society. I was in possession of the book, no one hundred and forty-six (146) which I have now before me and on which was paid seventy-seven dollars ($77.00). After paying that amount I stopped payments, and after stopping payments the society considered me confiscated. I had received several notices that I was in arrears and after a while I was informed that my book was considered confiscated.\nIt was after liquidation that I gold my book to the best of my belief before selling my book I remember at least once that I went to the plaintiff's Brady's house at a meeting of the forfeited share-holders. We had the meeting for the purpose of clubbing together to fight the directors or liquidators, and to try and receive the amount of our books. Our intention that is the intention of the meeting and of myself, one of them, was to take legal proceedings against the liquidators. Sometime after I sold my book to the plaintiff, Hugh Brady, for the amount stated in transfer, of twenty-five per cent on the amount paid.\nQ. So that in fact at the time you sold your book, you sold a law suit?\nA. I understood it that way certainly, but I was clear, of the whose thing \u2022 that was what I understood.\nQ. You could not get the amount without a suit before you sold to Mr. Brady?\nA. No. And J do not think that a subsequent decision in a suit by another party that a similar confiscation had been declared of no effect can avail the appellant under the 4th exception of art. 1584, C. C., viz., that the provisions of art. 1582 do not apply \"when \" the judgment of a court has been rendered affirming \" the right or when it has been made clear by evidence a and is ready for judgment t because I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal as appears by the judgment of that court as delivered by Mr. Justice Cross,\" that it only applies to the particular demand in litigation, having been confirmed by the judgment of a court \" or when it has been made clear by evidence and is ready for judgment.\nI think that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of the same opinion for the reasons given in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nFOURNIER J.:\u2014II est admis que l'appelaut est devenu membre de la S Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mutuelle de construction de St. Gabriel,\u201d en vertu de divers transports qui lui out \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par George Dalrymple, Wiliiam Haddlesey, Alexander Coultry et Samuel McPhee, des actions que chacun d'eux poss\u00e9dait dans le fonds social de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Par r\u00e9solution du 19 juillet 1879, cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en vertu du oh. 69 des Statuts du Bas Canada s'est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement mise en liquidation conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l'acte. Les intim\u00e9s liquidateurs ayant omis le nom de l'appelant de la liste des actionnaires, celui-ci s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour se faire reconna\u00eetre comme propri\u00e9taire de quarante actions dans la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et faire ordonner aux liquidateurs de le porter sur la feuille de dividendes des deniers provenant de la r\u00e9alisation des biens de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour la somme de $727.55 pour sa part des dividendes d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s. Les intim\u00e9s out produit eu r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 Cette demande plusieurs plaidoyers qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 on rejet\u00e9s on abandonn\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'exception de celui par lequel ils out all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que par les divers transports qui avaient Ste faits \u00e0 l'appelant il est devenu acqu\u00e9reur de droits litigieux, et qu'en vertu de la loi il ne pouvait r\u00e9clamer d'eux que le montant qu'il avait actuellement pay\u00e9 pour acqu\u00e9rir ses actions, avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et les frais de transports. La seule question qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve eu cette cause est de savoir Si les divers transports accept\u00e9s par l'appelant peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une cession de droits litigieux donnant aux intim\u00e9s le privil\u00e8ge de r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du retrait accorde par l'art. 1582, C. C, La nature des cr\u00e9ances dont l'appelant est devenu le cessionnaire n'a certainement rien de litigieux il s'agit d'actions pour des mutants d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement souscrites, dans le fonds social d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement constitu\u00e9e en vertu de la loi. Les souscripteurs originaires en out fait cession \u00e0 l'appelant pour valable consid\u00e9ration et sa position, comme les repr\u00e9sentant en vertu des transports qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits, est admise. Peut-on signaler dans tous ces faits qui constituent l'appelant cr\u00e9ancier des actions en question, un seul point litigieux on contestable, il est \u00e9vident que non. Un droit est litigieux, dit l'article 1583 C. C., lorsqu'il est incertain, disput\u00e9e ou disputable par le d\u00e9biteur. Cet article n'a \u00e9videmment aucune application aux faits concernant la cession dout\u00e9 ii s'agit. Ii est impossible de consid\u00e9rer qu'il v ait la moindre incertitude au sujet de l'existence de la cr\u00e9ance: aucune contestation n \u00e9tant soulev\u00e9e dans la cause au sujet du droit lui-m\u00eame, on ne peut pas non plus dire qu'il est disput\u00e9, et enfin ii est clair qu'il n'est pas disputable en consequence de 1 \u00e9vidente certitude de son existence. Ii ne doit pas suffire \u00e0 un d\u00e9biteur de dire sans aucune apparent\u00e9e de raison qu'il disput\u00e9e on contest\u00e9e sa dette pour rendre celle-ci disputable, Cela ne peut d\u00e9pendre de la violon\u00e9e seule du d\u00e9biteur. La loi indique elle-m\u00eame qu'il faut pour cela un motif, elle signale en premier lieu l'incertitude du droit. Ce d\u00e9faut dolt provenir de la nature de la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame. L article, en ajoutant que le droit doit \u00eatre disput\u00e9 ou disputable, signifie sans loute que ce sera pour des motifs attaquant la cr\u00e9ance elle-m\u00eame, comme si par exemple le d\u00e9biteur niait la. Consid\u00e9ration, all\u00e9guant fraude, etc., on enfin pour toutes autres raisons qui pourraient faire perc\u00e9e \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance c\u00e9d\u00e9e son caract\u00e8re de certitude.\nLes intim\u00e9s n'ont absolument rien de ce genre \u00e0 opposer \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Leur pr\u00e9tention qu'elle est litigieuse n'est que le r\u00e9sultat d'une erreur palpable de leur part. A 1 \u00e9poque du transport en question il se trouvait un certain nombre d\u2019actionnaires qui s'\u00e9taient laiss\u00e9s tomber en arr\u00e9rage. Sons l'impression que dans le cas de d\u00e9faut de paiement apr\u00e8s un certain d\u00e9lai les r\u00e8glements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pronon\u00e7aient de piano cont\u00e9e les actionnaires en retard la peine de confiscation de leurs actions, et croyant que cette peine avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par\u00e9e que leurs noms n'apparaissaient pas dans la liste des actionnaires, les liquidateurs avaient d'abord d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de les traiter comme ayant perdu leurs droits. Mais les actionnaires se trouvant dans ce cas, se ligu\u00e8rent pour porter dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat commun cette question devant les tribunaux. Le cas du Rev. M. Charbonneau en tons points semblable \u00e0 celui de l'appellent, fut choisi pour d\u00e9cider la question. Ii fut \u00e9tabli qu'il n'v avait eu aucune confiscation de prononc\u00e9e ni par la loi ni par les directeurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, des actions sur lesquelles ii y avait des arr\u00e9rages \u00e0 payer. L'honorable juge Mathieu qui a prononc\u00e9e le jugement dans cette cause le 16 ao\u00fbt 1883, r\u00e9sume ainsi les faits dans quelques-uns de ses consid\u00e9rants: \u2014\nAttendu que le requ\u00e9rant a r\u00e9pondu quo ses actions n'avaient pas. \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9es et qu'il n'avait jamais cess\u00e9 d \u00eatre membre do la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9; que la section. 4 des r\u00e8glements de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pourvoit \u00e0 I'envoi d'avis aux membres arri\u00e9r\u00e9s, mais ne d\u00e9clare pas la confiscation et n'autorise pas le secr\u00e9taire \u00e0 faire cette confiscation que l'expiration du d\u00e9lai, apr\u00e8s l'envoi de l'avis ne constitue pas la confiscation; mais qu'il fallait que cette confiscation f\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et que les directeurs m\u00eames n'avaient pas le droit de confisquer les actions: que les directeurs n'ont jamais pass\u00e9 de r\u00e9solution confisquant les actions du requ\u00e9rant t que les rapports des directeurs n'ont jamais mentionn\u00e9 que les actions du requ\u00e9rant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confisqu\u00e9s et que cette mention e\u00fbt-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, cela n'aurait eu aucun effet sur la question en litige; que la pr\u00e9tendue confiscation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par les d\u00e9fendeurs est ill\u00e9gale:\nConsid\u00e9rant que par la section 15 de l'acte concernant les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de construction, chapitre 69 des statuts refondus du Bas-Canada, il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 quo chaque telle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pourra confisquer et declarer confisqu\u00e9es en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 les actions de tout membre qui pourra n\u00e9gliger de payer, ou qui doit des arr\u00e9rages sur le nombre des versements qui pourra \u00eatre fix\u00e9 par aucune stipulation ou r\u00e8glement;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il parait \u00e9vident par les dispositions do cette section quo chaque cas particulier doit \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui doit donner une d\u00e9cision et d\u00e9clarer confisqu\u00e9es les actions du membre s'il se trouve dans les cas mentionn\u00e9s dans les r\u00e8glements o\u00f9 il aura encouru la confiscation:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se soit jamais prononc\u00e9e sur la confiscation des actions du requ\u00e9rant, st quo le contraire appert par la preuve, et qu'il est constant qu'il n'y a jamais en telle confiscation;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la pr\u00e9tention des d\u00e9fendeurs que la confiscation a eu lieu de plein droit par l'avis donn\u00e9 et par l'op\u00e9ration de la dite section 4 des dits r\u00e8glements est mal fond\u00e9e; que cette section 4 des dits r\u00e8glements n'a pas la port\u00e9e que les d\u00e9fendeurs lui donnent, et que si cette disposition des dits r\u00e8glements avait ce sens, il s'en suivrait qu'elle serr\u00e2t ill\u00e9gale comme contraire aux dispositions do la dite r\u00e8glements 15 du dit statut et qu\u2019il est d\u00e9cr\u00e8te jar le dit statut que los r\u00e8glements ne pourront pas \u00eatre contraires \u00e0 ses dispositions ;\nConsid\u00e9rant quo la confiscation des actions du dit requ\u00e9rant ne pouvait \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e sans que le requ\u00e9rant e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 mis l\u00e9galement et r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en demeure: qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il ait eu mise en demeure r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et que la confiscation m\u00eame n'est pas prouv\u00e9e; que le nom du requ\u00e9rant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9 de la liste des membres avant la mise en liquidation de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9; Que la requ\u00eate du dit requ\u00e9rant est bien fond\u00e9e et quo les d\u00e9fenses des dits d\u00e9fendeurs sont mal fond\u00e9es;\nOn voit par les motifs donn\u00e9s par l'hon, juge qu'il n'y avait aucune raison de fait ni de droit pouvant justifier la confiscation des actions du Rev. M. Charbonneau Les faits de cette cause \u00e9tant absolument les m\u00eames, il faut en conclure \u00e9galement qu'il n'y a pas en et qu'il ne pouvait pas avoir lieu \u00e0 la confiscation des actions de l'appelant. Comme c'est uniquement sur ce motif de confiscation que les intim\u00e9s se sont appuy\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9tende que la cession faite \u00e0 l'appelant en \u00e9tait une de droits litigieux, il est \u00e9vident que cette pr\u00e9tention est absolument sans fondement et cons\u00e9quemment que les droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s n'\u00e9tant pas disputables par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 intim\u00e9e, il n'y avait pas lieu d'invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'art. 1582.\nMalgr\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention contraire des intim\u00e9s, les appelants et plusieurs de ses c\u00e9dants savaient que les droits en question n'\u00e9taient pas litigieux; quelques-uns d'eux il est vrai comprenaient qu'en cons\u00e9quence de l'erreur des intim\u00e9s, an sujet de la confiscation, une action pourrirait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9tablir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur ce point.\nLes intim\u00e9s out cite dans leur factum une \"partie du t\u00e9moignage de l'appelant pour prouver qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance les droits en question \u00e9taient litigieux. Cette citation de leur factum lui a fait dire d'une mani\u00e8re absolue:\nOf course, it is because these shares were disputed that I bought them at reduced price.\nIl v a erreur dans la citation par l'omission des mots suivants \"in the way they were.\" Ce qu'il a r\u00e9ellement dit d'apr\u00e8s le dossier, c'est ce qui suit:\u2014\nOf course, it is because these shares were disputed in the way they were that I bought them at reduced price.\nLa difference dans le sens de ces deux phrases est \u00e9vidente. D'apr\u00e8s celle du factum on lui fait dire d'une mani\u00e8re absolue qu'il a achet\u00e9 \u00e0 prix r\u00e9duit parce que les droits \u00e9taient disputes; tandis que dans son t\u00e9moignage, en ajoutant; i in the way they were\" il disait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu'il a ach\u00e9e \u00e0 prix r\u00e9duit par suite de la pr\u00e9tention erron\u00e9e qu'il v avait eu confiscation D'ailleurs, dans une autre partie de son t\u00e9moignage, il dit positivement qu'il savait que cette pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e.\nJe ne crois pas qu'il y ait en d'incertitude au sujet des droits c\u00e9d\u00e9s s mais en supposant qu\u2019il y en eut eue \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9poque dans l'esprit de quelques actionnaires, il n'y en avait certainement plus lorsque l'appelant a intent\u00e9 son action. Alors celle du R\u00e9v. M. Charbonneau qui n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise que pour faire d\u00e9cider la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9tendue confiscation \u00e9tait jug\u00e9e et avait donn\u00e9e gain \u00e0 ceux qui avaient soutenu le contraire. L'appelant, \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas nominalement partie dans cette cause, ne peut invoquer ce jugement comme devant avoir force de choie jug\u00e9e, mais comme l'un des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s qui ont pris part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations des autres actionnaires, dont le r\u00e9sultat a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'adopter le moyen dune poursuite au nom du R\u00e9v. \"M. Charbonneau pour faire d\u00e9cider par les cours la question de confiscation, il peut certainement invoquer ces circonstances pour d\u00e9montrer qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance personnelle, si son droit avait pu \u00eatre litigieux, il avait, au moment de son action, cess\u00e9 de lettr\u00e9; Qu'\u00e9tant alors devenu certain par l'effet de cette d\u00e9cision, il pouvait invoquer avec avantag\u00e9 lexemption cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le paragraphe 4 de l'article 1584.\nPar ces motifs, ainsi que pour les raisons expos\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Ramsay dans ses notes sur cette cause, je suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.-Concurred with Fournier J.\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons mentioned in the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Doherty & Doherty.\nSolicitors for respondents: Curren & Grenier.\n[1] M.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENSS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nMunicipal Council\u2014 Powers of\u2014Improvement of roads\u2014 Proc\u00e8s ver- bat homologated\u2014Effect of A.rts. 100-461, 705 M, C, (P. Q.)\u2014 Appeal R, S. C. ch. 135 sec. 29 (b).\nWhere a proc\u00e8s-verbal of a Municipal Council directing improvements to be made on a portion of a road situated within the municipality has been duly homologated, it cannot subsequently be set aside by an incidental procedure, but, like a by-law it can only be attacked by a direct procedure as indicated in the Municipal Code (P. Q.) arts. 100.461.\nParett v. Corporation St. Sauveur, 2 Q. L. R. 258, approved.\nBy a proc\u00e8s-verbal made by the Municipal Council of Ste. Anne du Bout de L'Isle a portion of the road fronting the land of one R. was ordered to be improved by raisins and widening it. Upon R.'s refusal to do the work the Council had it performed paid $200 for it and subsequently sued R. for the said $200.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, P. Q., on appeal affirmed a judgment in favor of the Municipal Council for that amount. On appeal to the Supreme Court it was\nHeld, Per Fournier, Henry and Gwynne J.J. (Strong and Taschereau J.J. dissenting, and Ritchie C.J. expressing no opinion on the point) that although the matter in controversy did not amount to $2,000, yet, as it related to a charge on the appellant\u2019s land whereby his rights in future might be bound, the case was appealable. R. S. C. ch. 135 sec. 29 (b).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action brought by the respondents against the appellant to recover the sum of $200 paid by the respondents to one W. A. Reburn, for raising and widening the road fronting appellant s property situated within the municipality of the Parish of Ste. Anne du Bout de l'Isle in virtue of a proc\u00e8s-verbal duly homologated by the said Municipal Council the 20th August, 1877.\nTo this action the appellant pleaded inter alia the nullity of the proc\u00e8s-verbal for irregularities and that the road ordered by the proc\u00e8s-verbal is a macadamized road and county councils alone have jurisdiction to order them.\nThe proces-verbal made by the council contained the following directions :\u2014\n\" 3. That the said road be raised with stones to-wit with large stones at first and then with small broken stones not more than two inches square so as to make an even surface six inches higher in the middle than at the sides.\n\" 4. That the said road be made 26 feet wide on its whole length.\n\" That the work to raise and widen the said front road of W. A. Reburn be done by the interested parties as follows :\n\" The said W. A. Reburn shall do alone at his own expense the whole work necessary to raise and widen his front road according to the paragraphs 3 and 4 of said proces-verbal, upon a length of 666 feet and 8 inches beginning at the north-east line of his property and the remainder to be done by all the proprietors of land situate between the boundary of the Parish to and including the property of Joseph Petit dit Lamarche.\"\nThe appellant appealed from the municipal council to the county council and the Proc\u00e8s'verbal was upheld.\nLaflamme Q.C. for appellant.\nThis case depends on a single question of municipal law, namely : What was the authority of the council to alter the road under the circumstances of the case? The road is a highway established from the beginning of the colony on the Island of Montreal To the parish is assigned certain authority with respect to roads and bridges, and it has control of county roads, that is, roads between two local municipalities.\nIn this case the road which has been opened since the establishment of the colony had never been altered; the municipality of the parish of St. Anne ordered a proc\u00e8s verbal to alter it. This proc\u00e8s-verbal remained in abeyance during the month of May 1877, and then the appellant petitioned the council to be relieved from the work.\nTwo things were asked for by the petition, the alteration of the road and relief from the work. The former was granted and the road ordered to be raised; the prayer for relief was refused.\nThe council appointed a superintendent of the work who made a report; this report was confirmed by the council and Reburn was ordered to macadamize the road in front of his property He considered this be-yond the authority of the council; that they could impose such a duty on all the land owners but not on a particular one and disobeyed the order; whereupon the council ordered the work to be sold. It was bought by a son of the appellant who, on an action to recover the amount, pleaded want of authority. The court held that the order should have been appealed from and that the father was stopped by the act of his son in purchasing.\nBut there was an appeal from the order. The appellant represented to the council that it was illegal. See 8 L. N. 67.\nIt is submitted that this is not local but county work and could only be ordered by the county. Arts. 754 and 757 Mun Code. Arts. 533-534.\nBisaillon for the respondents.\nIt is submitted that there is no right of appeal in this case. No future rights are involved; the appellant is merely called upon to pay $200 in consequence of not performing work ordered, by the council. If he does the work that is an end of the matter. See Le Cur\u00e9 de la St. Vierge v. Bank of Toronto ([1]).\nThen as to the merits. The appellant himself petitioned the County Council to have an action taken about this road and under Art 794 a superintendent was appointed and his proc\u00e8s verbal was duly homologated.\nThe raising and widening of a road is not macadamizing it and therefore the local council had jurisdiction over this matter under article 802 Mun. Code.\nIt is contended that this is a county road but the appellant has admitted the jurisdiction of the local council, by his petition. Art. 755 Mun. Code says what is a county road.\n(TASCHEREAU J. \u2014 We have no evidence to decide whether it is a county road or not.)\n(SRRONG J.\u2014The judgment in this case would not be res judicata as to whether or not it is a county road.\nThis point was not raised in the proceedings.\n(MR. LAFLAMME.\u2014It was never denied that it was a county road.)\nIn his plea the appellant says it was a question to be decided by the county council. We claim it is not a road dividing two municipalities but only a connecting road.\n(TASCHEREAU J.\u2014Is it held now that because a road connects two municipalities it is a county road?)\nThat \"point was raised for the first time in the court of appeal and all the judges were of opinion that a connecting road is not a county road. See Harrison's Municipal Manual (Ont.) ([2]).\nIt is claimed that a road can only be macadamized by a majority of the owners interested but, as I have said it is not a macadamized road. When the council only raise or widen a road there is no necessity for such majority.\nHe may be exempted but in this case he was not exempted by the proc\u00e8s verbal, which is final and will not now be disturbed.\nCites Parent v. Corporation of St. Sauveur ([3]).\nLaflamme Q.C. in reply. The appeal should be allowed on two grounds. First, rights in future are affected. It also brings up the question of the municipal by-law. The proc\u00e8s-verbal when homologated by the council becomes a by-law. In our province there must be an action to quash there is no such thing as a rule for that purpose.\nArt. 802 Municipal Code must be read in conjunction with art. 533.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J. Whether this case is appealable or not I think it should be dismissed on the merits. The appellant has not taken the proper steps within the proper time to discuss the validity of the proc\u00e8s-verbal and other proceedings in the case. The appellant appears to have appealed in this case and his appeal was dismissed and the proc\u00e8s-verbal appeases to have been homologated.\nIt is not competent to attack the validity of the proc\u00e8s-verbal by an incidental procedure, but, like a by-law, it should be attacked by a direct proceeding as indicated by the code municipal which puts the proc\u00e8s-verbal on the same footing as by-laws in matters of appeal and procedure. See Parent v. Corporation of St. Sauveur ([4]), and Art. 100 M. C. (P.Q).\nSTRONG J. I am of opinion that this appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nPOURNIER J.\u2014La sec. 29 de l'acte 49 Vict. ch. 135, r\u00e9glant la juridiction d'appel \u00e0 cette cour pour la province de Qu\u00e9bec, met au rang des causes appelables entre autres celles d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans la s.s. b par les expressions suivantes :\u2014\nRelates ..., or to an title to lands or tenements annual rents or such like matters op things where the rights in future might be bound.\nLa charge ou servitude impos\u00e9e \u00e0 appellant par le bylaw dont il se plaint est de sa nature permanente, et a n\u00e9cessairement l'effet d'affecter les droits futurs de lappelant dans la libre jouissance de sa lroPri\u00e9t\u00e9 Pour cette raison je suis d'avis que la cause est appelable.\nL'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi par l'intim\u00e9e pour la somme de $200.00, valeur des travaux de r\u00e9paration \u00e0 son chemin de front, ordonn\u00e9s par un proc\u00e8s-verbal dument homologu\u00e9 le 20 ao\u00fbt 1887. Ces travaux consistaient principalement dans ceux d\u00e9crits aux articles 3 et 4 du dit proc\u00e8s-verb al, ainsi qu'il suit :\n30. Que le dit chemin soit hauss\u00e9 avec de la pierre, savoir, avec de la grosse pierre d'abord, ensuite de la petite pierre cass\u00e9e de la grosseur de pas plus de deux pouces carr\u00e9s, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire une surface unie \u00e9lev\u00e9e de six pouces de plus au milieu qu'aux bords-,\n40. Que le dit chemin soit elargi partout o\u00e9 il sera n\u00e9cessaire pour que le dit chemin soit au moins de vingt-six pieds de largeur do route.\nL'appelant a offert plusieurs moyens de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 cette action, entre autres la suffisance du chemin alors existant pour les besoins du public, quo si ces travaux ordonn\u00e9s \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires ils auraient dus \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la charge de la municipalit\u00e9, qu'il n'y avait pas eu de demande pour ces changements par la majorit\u00e9 des int\u00e9resses; irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de tous los proc\u00e9das et surtout de ceux concernant l'adjudication des travaux ordonn\u00e9s et enfin comme principal moyen de d\u00e9fense \" quo le dit chemin ordonn\u00e9 par le proc\u00e8s-verbal, est un chemin macadamis\u00e9 lequel n'est pas dans les attributions d'un conseil do municipalit\u00e9, mais ne peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 que par le conseil de comt\u00e9 on approu\u00e9\u00e9 par lui,\" Dans une r\u00e9plique l'intim\u00e9e a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que si le dit proc\u00e8s-verbal \u00e9tait irr\u00e9gulier et ill\u00e9gal, le d\u00e9fendeur deviate appeler en temps et lieu de la d\u00e9cision du conseil de la paroisse Ste. Anne du Bout de l'Isle homologuant le dit proc\u00e8s-ver bal.\nLa cour superieure dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par celui de la cour du Bane de la Reine a maintenu la pretention all\u00e8gue dans la r\u00e9plique et prononc\u00e9 jugement contre l'appelant pour la somme demand\u00e9e.\nLe r\u00e8glement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 homologue le 20 ao\u00fbt 1877, et l'action signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant seulement le 21 f\u00e9vrier 1881, il avait laiss\u00e9 depuis longtemps expirer le d\u00e9lai pendant lequel le code municipal lui permettait d attaquer le dit proc\u00e8s-verbal. En effet si l'appelant voulait contester la validit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s-verbal qu'il veut maintenant faire d\u00e9clarer nul, il aurait di proc\u00e9der tel que permis par le ch. 7 du code Municipal-Cassation des r\u00e8glements municipaux. L'article 705 porte :\nN\u00e9anmoins toute taxe, contribution, p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 ou obligation impos\u00e9e par un\" r\u00e8glement sujet \u00e0 \u00e9tre cass\u00e9, et \u00e9chue avant la cassation du r\u00e8glement, est exigible nonobstant la cassation de tel r\u00e8glement, si la requ\u00eate sur laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e la cassation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour dans les trois mois apr\u00e8s l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du r\u00e8glement.\nQuant aux proc\u00e8s verbaux r\u00f4les, etc, l'article 100 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te ce qui suit :\u2014\u2014\nTout proc\u00e8s-verbal, r\u00f4le, r\u00e9solution ou autre ordonnance du conseil municipal, peuvent \u00eatre cass\u00e9s par la cour de Magistrat ou par la cour de Circuit du comt\u00e9 ou du district, pour cause d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai et avec les m\u00eames effets qu'un r\u00e8glement municipal, et sont sujets \u00e0 l'application des articles 461 et 705.\nDans la cause de Simard v.la Corp. du comt\u00e9 de Montmorency (1), il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine, que lorsqu' aucune proc\u00e9dure en cassation d'un proc\u00e8s-verbal ou acte de r\u00e9partition n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, par une partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e sous les articles 100, 461 et 705 C. M., dans le d\u00e9lai de trois mois apr\u00e8s les avis requis par la loi et relatifs \u00e0 ces documents, leur l\u00e9galit\u00e9 ne pourra \u00eatre mise en question incidemment sur un bref de prohibition et n-peut l'\u00eatre que par la proc\u00e9dure indiqu\u00e9e par le code (7 juin 1879). Une d\u00e9cision du m\u00eame g\u00ean\u00e9e (15 oct. 1873) avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sur cette question par l'hon. juge en chef Meredith qui avait juge dans la cause de Parent v. la Corporation de St. Sanveur \" qu'on ne peut attaquer la validit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement municipal au moyen d'une proc\u00e9dure incidente \" ([5]).\nJe reconnais cette doctrine comme correcte et applicable \u00e0 tout r\u00e8glement qui fait voir \u00e0 sa face qu'il \u00e9mane d'une autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente quels que soient d'ailleurs les vices de forme dont il peut \u00eatre entach\u00e9 et les int\u00e9r\u00eats qui peuvent \u00eatre blesses. Le r\u00e8glement ou proc\u00e8s-verbal en question \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment du ressort du conseil municipal de li intim\u00e9e, et l'appelant pour faire redresser les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et les griefs dont il se plaint aurait d\u00fb en appeler dans le d\u00e9lai de trois mois prescrit par le code municipal. Oette r\u00e9ponse s'applique \u00e9galement aux r\u00e9solutions du conseil approuvant les changements recommand\u00e9s comme \u00e0 toute cette partie de son plaidoyer dans laquelle ii se plaint di irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s et d'injustice en le soumettant \u00e0 des charges qu'il consid\u00e8re excessives, ce n'est que sur un appel qu'il aurait pu faire reformer le proc\u00e8s-verbal suivant ses pr\u00e9tentions.\nS'il \u00e9tait vrai, comme l'all\u00e8gue l'appelant, que le proc\u00e8s-verbal a de fait ordonn\u00e9 de macadamiser le chemin en question, je ne crois pas que l'on p\u00fbt dans ce cas opposer \u00e0 l'appelant les d\u00e9cisions ci-dessus cit\u00e9es. Le conseil de paroisse n'ayant pas le pouvoir de faire adopter le syst\u00e8me de macadamiser les chemins que le conseil de comt\u00e9 peut seul ordonner, il serait \u00e9vident qu'il aurait agi sans aucune comp\u00e9tence et qu'aucun tribunal ne Pourrat donner d'effet quelconque \u00e0 un tel r\u00e8glement.\nMais ici l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle substitu\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me de macadamiser les chemin \u00e0 celui ordinairement suivi pour leur confection? Je ne le pense pas. Ii ne s'agit que d'une r\u00e9paration \u00e0 un bout de chemin dont le sol est mar\u00e9cageux et qu'il s'agissait de rende plus solide. On avait d'abord pens\u00e9 \u00e0 changer l'endroit du chemin, mais apr\u00e8s bien des consid\u00e9rations pour et contre expos\u00e9es dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal du surintendant sp\u00e9cial le conseil en a conclu qu'il valait mieux conserver l'ancien chemin existant depuis plus dun si\u00e8cle et qui avait co\u00fbt\u00e9 beaucoup de travail aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, te ordonn\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence l'exhaussement du chemin sur la terre de l'appelant, de la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e ci-dessus. Cette r\u00e9paration ainsi ordonn\u00e9e ne me parl\u00e2t pas \u00eatre l'exercice du droit d'introduire le syst\u00e8me du macadam pour la confection des chemins. Y'est tout simplement suivant moi l'exercice de la discr\u00e9tion que peut et doit exercer le conseil dans la construction et la r\u00e9paration des chemins sous sa juridiction. Ii est vrai que ce travail est on\u00e9reux, et qu'\u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 passe ce chemin sur la terre de l'appelant sa longueur en est doubl\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence d'un d\u00e9tour qu'il y a \u00e0 faire. Le code municipal a pr\u00e9vu ce cas et ordonne par l'art. 783.\nqu'une moiti\u00e9 de ces travaux sera mise \u00e0 la charge des autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s* Cette diminution \u00e0 laquelle l'appelant avait droit lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accorde. Le travail de r\u00e9paration tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 me parait \u00eatre dans les limites du pondoir du conseil de l'intim\u00e9e. Quant aux irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dont se plaint l'appelant an sujet de l'adjudication des travaux, il n'a pas \u00e9tabli qu'elle lui avait porte le moindre pr\u00e9judice. Ii en a eu connais-sauce un avis lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve la nature des travaux \u00e9tait parfaitement connu de tous et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement expliquee par Amable Vall\u00e9e, l'inspecteur des chemins. D'ailleurs, comme l'entre preneur \u00e9tait son fils, l'appelant lui-m\u00eame s'est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 les faire approuver par le conseil municipal et a m\u00eame fait pr\u00e9parer par un avocat la r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e par le conseil municipal acceptant l'ouvrage en question. Appel renvoy\u00e9 accu d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014l am inclined to the opinion that this case was appealable, but on the merits I think the appeal should be dismissed. It was an imposition to oblige the appellant to macadamize the road in front of his property, and expense to which his neighbors were not subjected, but having allowed the money to be expended and the time for objection in the way pre-scribed to elapse, he cannot I think be permitted in this action to do so.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion to quash for want of jurisdiction, with the costs as if quashed on motion.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Was of opinion that the case was appealable, but that on the merits the appeal should be dismissed concurring with Fournier J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Laflamme, Huntington, La-flamme & Richard.\nSolicitors for respondent : Lacoste, Globensky, Bisailion & Brousseau.\n[1] 12 Can.
