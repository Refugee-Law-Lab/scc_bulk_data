Malone, [1934] S.C.R. 121\nDate: 1934-01-26.\nFrigidaire Corporation (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nJohanna Malone (Defendant) Respondent.\n1933: November 2, 3; 1934: January 26.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSale\u2014Cooling apparatus\u2014Conditional sale to contractor\u2014Building contract\u2014Apartment house\u2014Material furnished by contractor\u2014Commercial sale\u2014Purchase price unpaid\u2014Revendication, not from the buyer, but from the owner of the building\u2014Arts. 1488, 2013e, 2268 C.C.\nThe appellant company sold and delivered to the Standard Construction Company certain mechanical cooling devices and apparatus under the ordinary conditional sale terms that it would remain owner until full payment of the purchase price, which included the costs of installation. The conditions of payment were 25% cash when installation completed and the balance in twenty-four monthly instalments. The respondent was owner of certain property in Montreal and proposed to make over the building erected thereon into an apartment house. For this purpose, the respondent entered into a contract with the Standard Construction Company, which undertook to do the work and provide the materials for a fixed price based upon cost plus 20% for profit. The respondent was not aware of the existence of that contract with the appellant. The work, including the installation of the cooling apparatus, having been completed, the respondent paid in full the Standard Construction Company, which later on went into liquidation. As only the said cash payment of 25% had been made by the construction company, the appellant, alleging its ownership of the cooling apparatus in accordance with the terms of the contract, took an action to revendicate them, not from the buyer, the Standard Construction Company, but from the respondent, the owner of the building where they had been installed.\nHeld that, assuming that the cooling apparatus were still moveable things although \u201cincorporated\u201d into the building (art. 2013e C.C.), the appellant had no right to revendicate them from the respondent, who was in possession bona fide, in view of the terms of article 2268 of the civil code, especially the third paragraph, interpreted in the light of the circumstances of this case.\nHeld, further, that the words \u201cnor in commercial matters generally\u201d in article 2268 C.C. indicate, on the part of the Legislature, an intention to protect against the possibility of revendication the person possessing in good faith as proprietor not only a thing acquired through purchase, but any moveable thing acquired by \u201cacte translatif\u201d of ownership in commercial matters. The provision was enacted having regard to the superior interest of commerce.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 54 KB. 462) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, P. Demers J. and dismissing the appellant company\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of this Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014La cause que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider nous est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nFrigidaire Corporation (l\u2019appelante) a vendu et livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Standard Construction Limited certains appareils frigorifiques. Elle all\u00e8gue que cette vente \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019elle resterait propri\u00e9taire des appareils jusqu\u2019\u00e0 paiement complet du prix d\u2019achat. Le prix incluait le co\u00fbt de l\u2019installation. Le paiement devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de 25 p. 100 apr\u00e8s installation et de vingt-quatre versements mensuels pour la balance. Le paiement de 25 p. 100 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; mais les paiements subs\u00e9quents ne l\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9. L\u2019appelante invoque donc son titre de propri\u00e9taire qu\u2019elle a conserv\u00e9 par suite de la convention, et elle revendique les appareils frigorifiques. Mais elle ne les revendique pas de son acheteur. Les appareils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s dans les immeubles appartenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et c\u2019est de cette derni\u00e8re que l\u2019appelante les r\u00e9clame.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir plusieurs moyens de d\u00e9fense et elle a r\u00e9ussi en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e0 faire rejeter l\u2019action de l\u2019appelante.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis que ces jugements doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s pour les motifs suivants:\nIl ne saurait faire de doute, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, que les appareils frigorifiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s dans les immeubles de: l\u2019intim\u00e9e par suite d\u2019un contrat en vertu duquel Standard Construction Company Limited a entrepris de transformer ces immeubles en une maison de rapport contenant seize logements. M\u00eame si le document \u00e9crit ne sp\u00e9cifie pas les appareils frigorifiques, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019ils furent install\u00e9s comme partie de l\u2019entreprise.\nLa convention entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et Standard Construction Company, suivant une m\u00e9thode maintenant assez fr\u00e9quente, fixait le prix de l\u2019entreprise au co\u00fbt des travaux et des choses fournies, plus 20 p. 100 repr\u00e9sentant le profit des entrepreneurs.\nLes appareils furent install\u00e9s dans les immeubles de l\u2019intim\u00e9e par rappelante elle-m\u00eame. Cela \u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019une des conditions du contrat de cette derni\u00e8re avec Standard Construction Company. Par suite des termes de ce contrat et par le fait qu\u2019elle a elle m\u00eame proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019installation, l\u2019appelante savait que les appareils \u00e9taient destin\u00e9s aux immeubles de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Bien plus, elle s\u2019engageait \u00e0 les poser elle-m\u00eame.\nOn doit \u00e9galement conclure que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ignorait les conditions de la vente des appareils \u00e0 Standard Construction Company. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi; et nous ne trouvons aucune justification pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 son interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve sur ce point. Dans les circonstances, le r\u00e9sultat de la cause nous para\u00eet d\u00e9pendre de l\u2019article 2268 du code civil.\nAu moment de la revendication, les appareils frigorifiques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s dans les immeubles de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les fins auxquelles ils \u00e9taient destin\u00e9s. Cette installation \u00e9tait compl\u00e8te et il ne restait rien \u00e0 y faire. Si la cause \u00e9tait soumise comme une revendication de mat\u00e9riaux fournis pour la construction (car les mat\u00e9riaux peuvent \u00eatre des \u201cobjets fa\u00e7onn\u00e9s\u201d, art. 2013a C.C.), il y aurait beaucoup \u00e0 dire sur la question de savoir s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201cincorpor\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction\u201d, au sens de l\u2019article 2013e du code civil. Il se pourrait que le mot \u201cincorpor\u00e9s\u201d (en tenant compte du but de l\u2019article 2013e C.C.) ne doive pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens que le mot \u201cincorpor\u00e9s\u201d de l\u2019article 379 du code civil. Nous croyons devoir faire cette mention en passant pour \u00e9viter tout ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e de notre d\u00e9cision, mais sans nous prononcer, puisque nous devons d\u00e9cider la cause telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite et soumise par les parties.\nNous prenons donc pour acquis que les appareils frigorifiques \u00e9taient encore des meubles corporels au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019appelante a tent\u00e9 de les revendiquer de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nVis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019appelante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait un tiers ayant la possession actuelle des appareils frigorifiques et ayant cette possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire. Elle avait acquis cette possession et en \u00e9tait devenue propri\u00e9taire par suite du contrat qu\u2019elle avait fait avec Standard Construction Company et o\u00f9 cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 installer les \u2018appareils frigorifiques dans les immeubles de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Standard Construction Company \u00e9tait un entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dont l\u2019occupation et la fonction \u00e9taient, entre autres choses, d\u2019entreprendre des travaux de construction de maisons. Une des m\u00e9thodes courantes d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter des ouvrages de cette nature est de stipuler le prix sur la base du co\u00fbt des travaux, de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre et des choses fournies par l\u2019entrepreneur, avec, en plus, un pourcentage sur le tout, qui constitue le profit de l\u2019entrepreneur. C\u2019est la m\u00e9thode qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En pareil cas, l\u2019entrepreneur fait un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice sur le co\u00fbt de l\u2019ouvrage, y compris celui des choses qu\u2019il fournit. En plus, la preuve en cette cause-ci \u00e9tablit qu\u2019il est devenu d\u2019usage fr\u00e9quent, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans la construction des maisons de rapport contenant plusieurs logements, d\u2019include la fourniture et l\u2019installation d\u2019appareils frigorifiques qui font normalement partie de ce genre d\u2019entreprises.\nA l\u2019aide de ces faits, il suffit d\u2019envisager la cause du point de vue du troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 2268 du code civil. Il est probablement certain, comme l\u2019a dit Sir Alexandre Lacoste, C.J., dans la cause de National Cash Register v. Demetre[2] que cet article est le corollaire des articles 1487 et suivants du code civil. Mais la port\u00e9e des articles 1487, 1488 et 1489 C. C. est plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que celle des paragraphes de l\u2019article 2268 C.C. qui traitent sp\u00e9cialement de la revendication. Pour cette raison, nous pouvons limiter notre jugement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ce dernier article en tant qu\u2019il r\u00e9f\u00e8re au cas qui nous est soumis. Si les faits de la cause sont couverts par le texte, il en r\u00e9sulte \u201cun d\u00e9ni d\u2019action en revendication\u201d (Codificateurs, Rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire, p. 366), et nous n\u2019avons pas besoin d\u2019aller au del\u00e0.\nNous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ignorait les termes de la vente faite \u00e0 Standard Construction Company des appareils frigorifiques. Elle \u00e9tait donc de bonne foi (art. 412 C.C). D\u2019ailleurs la bonne foi se suppose toujours (art. 2202 C.C.), et \u201cc\u2019est au r\u00e9clamant \u00e0 prouver * * * les vices de la possession et du titre du possesseur\u201d (art. 2268 (1) C.C.). L\u2019article emp\u00eache la revendication\nsi ta chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e de bonne foi dans orne foire, march\u00e9, ou \u00e0 une vente publique, ou d\u2019un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res, (ou) en affaire de commence en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nCe texte, il faut le remarquer, est plus ample que celui du Code Napol\u00e9on; il importe d\u2019en tenir compte en comparant la doctrine fran\u00e7aise sur cette question, quoique les commentaires de Troplong (Prescription, sur article 2280, Code Napol\u00e9on, nos 1040 et suiv.) et de Laurent (vol. 32, nos 562 et suiv.) seraient loin de conduire \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent de celui que nous adoptons. D\u2019apr\u00e8s notre article, la possession actuelle \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire \u00e9l\u00e8ve un obstacle \u00e0 la revendication du r\u00e9clamant\nsi la chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e * * * d\u2019un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res.\nNous l\u2019avons dit: Il est suffisamment \u00e9tabli que, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, les appareils frigorifiques de ce genre sont compris parmi les fournitures que font les constructeurs de maisons de rapport contenant plusieurs logements. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait donc pr\u00e9tendre\u2014et elle n\u2019y a pas manqu\u00e9\u2014que, dans les circonstances qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es, elle a achet\u00e9 ces appareils de Standard Construction Company, qui, dans le cours ordinaire de ses affaires, trafiquait en semblables mati\u00e8res.\nMais l\u2019appelante soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu entre Standard Construction et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ni achat, ni vente. Elle soumet que l\u2019article 2268 C.C. ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019\u00e0 la possession r\u00e9sultant d\u2019une vente et elle attire notre attention sur l\u2019article 1683 du code civil, qui dit:\nLorsque quelqu\u2019un entreprend la construction d\u2019une b\u00e2tisse ou autre ouvrage par devis et march\u00e9, il peut \u00eatre convenu ou qu\u2019il fournira son travail et son industrie seulement, ou qu\u2019il fournira aussi les mat\u00e9riaux.\nCe texte, toutefois, n\u2019oblige pas \u00e0 attribuer au contrat d\u2019entreprise m\u00e9lang\u00e9 de vente de mat\u00e9riaux la nature exclusive d\u2019un louage de services. Comme le fait remarquer M. Planiol, l\u2019article dit seulement que, lorsqu\u2019on charge quelqu\u2019un de faire un ouvrage, on peut convenir qu\u2019il ne fournira pas seulement son travail ou son industrie, mais \u201cqu\u2019il fournira \u00e9galement la mati\u00e8re\u201d. C\u2019est une disposition purement \u00e9nonciative relative \u00e0 un contrat complexe et qui n\u2019\u00e9carte pas les r\u00e8gles de la vente pour la fourniture de mat\u00e9riaux. Les articles qui suivent se bornent \u00e0 formuler quelques pr\u00e9ceptes tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s, relatifs aux risques, qui ne permettent pas d\u2019en tirer des cons\u00e9quences plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la nature du contrat. (Voir Planiol & Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique, vol. II, p. 159.)\nMais, pour la solution de cette cause, il ne nous para\u00eet pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire la distinction entre les deux parties du contrat. L\u2019article 2268 C.C., interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans son esprit, ne nous restreint pas \u00e0 un sens aussi \u00e9troit. En introduisant dans le texte les mots \u201cni en affaire de commerce en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d, ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a entendu prot\u00e9ger contre la revendication, c\u2019est la possession acquise dans certaines conditions. Il ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 autant de la nature de l\u2019acte d\u2019acquisition que des circonstances dans lesquelles cette acquisition a eu lieu. Pour employer l\u2019expression de Troplong (Prescription, sur article 2280, n\u00b0 1063), le code prot\u00e8ge \u201cle droit du tiers qui poss\u00e8de la chose avec un \u201cacte translatif\u201d. Dans ce sens, et au moyen de sa convention avec Standard Construction Company, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a acquis de cette derni\u00e8re la possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire des appareils frigorifiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s dans ses immeubles; et, dans les conditions o\u00f9 s\u2019est faite cette acquisition (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un contrat o\u00f9 l\u2019entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, dans le cours ordinaire de ses affaires fournissait moyennant profit des appareils qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9s \u00e0 cette fin), la transaction est certainement couverte par le texte de l\u2019article.\nCe texte constitue une exception cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la loi en faveur des acqu\u00e9reurs, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du commerce en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Bourjon, \u00e0 qui l\u2019on attribue la maxime: \u201cEn fait de meubles, possession vaut titre\u201d, disait (Liv. 3, tit. 2, ch. 1, parag. IV): \u201cLa s\u00fbret\u00e9 publique le veut ainsi.\u201d Les commentateurs s\u2019accordent \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que les r\u00e9dacteurs du code civil ont consacr\u00e9 cette doctrine dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur du commerce (voir, entre autres, Troplong\u2014d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9 \u2014n\u00b0 1059, et 32 Laurent, n\u00b0 588). C\u2019est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la cause du Banc du Roi dans la cause de National Cash Register v. Demetre[3]. Ce n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs qu\u2019une application restreinte du principe que, en fait de meubles, il n\u2019y a pas de droit de suite.\nIl nous reste \u00e0 faire une observation:\nL\u2019action de l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e le 20 mars 1929. Une action de ce genre doit \u00eatre prise essentiellement contre le possesseur. Si l\u2019on s\u2019en tient \u00e0 la preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait alors; vendu \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Fiducie, depuis le mois de f\u00e9vrier 1929, les immeubles dans lesquels furent plac\u00e9s les appareils frigorifiques. Il s\u2019ensuivrait que l\u2019action n\u2019aurait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e contre le v\u00e9ritable possesseur. Nous n\u2019en faisons pas un motif de notre jugement, parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait \u00e9tat de cette situation, et il est donc probable qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019explication.\nMais nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens pour les raisons que nous avons expos\u00e9es.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hackett, Mulvena, Fosterm, & Hannen.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Garneau & H\u00e9bert.\n[1] (1933) Q.R. 54 K.B. 462.\n[2] (1905) Q.R. 14 K.B. 68.\n[3] (1905) Q.R. 14 K.B. 468.\n"}

Jackson (Respondents) Respondents.\n1933: November 29; 1934: January 26.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Smith, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nInfant\u2014Custody\u2014Parental rights\u2014Religious faith.\nAppellants applied in the Supreme Court of Ontario for the custody of their infant child who, for about ten years from early infancy, had been in the care of respondents. Appellants were Roman Catholics and respondents were Protestants and the child had become identified with respondents\u2019 church. The application was dismissed, an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed, and an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: In view of all the circumstances and the considerations in making the orders dismissing the application, those orders should not be disturbed.\nPer Duff C.J. and Smith and Crocket JJ.: The father\u2019s authority as to the religious faith in which his child is to be educated, however wide it may have been at common law, must now be measured by the rules of equity, which, by express provision in the Judicature Act, prevail in Ontario, and which, on an issue like the present one, recognize the welfare of the child as the predominant consideration. If the child\u2019s general welfare requires that the father\u2019s rights as to the religious faith in which his child is to be reared be suspended or superseded, the courts in the exercise of their equitable jurisdiction have power to override them, though in doing so they must act cautiously. Due consideration must be given to the father\u2019s wishes, but if the court is satisfied, upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances (and though no serious misconduct of the father is proved), that those wishes conflict with the child\u2019s own best interests, viewed from all angles\u2014material, physical, moral, emotional and intellectual as well as religious, then those wishes must yield to the child\u2019s welfare. (In re O\u2019Hara, [1900] 2 I.R. 232, at 239, 241; Ward v. Laverty, [1925] A.C. 101, at 110, cited). The orders made in the present case were justified.\nPer Rinfret J.: The rules of equity must prevail and a very great discretion is vested in the judge hearing the application. Having regard to all the circumstances, it cannot be said that the discretion has been wrongly exercised in this case.\nPer Hughes J.: It is an equitable principle that the court may control or ignore the parental right but in so doing should act cautiously, and should act in opposition to the parent only when judicially satisfied that the child\u2019s welfare requires that the parental right be suspended or superseded. As the orders herein were in their nature discretionary, and were affirmed by the Court of Appeal, there was no principle on which this Court could interfere.\nAPPEAL by the parents of the child, Helen (Thelma) DeLaurier, who was born on July 19, 1920, from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal of the said parents from the order of McEvoy J. of September 4, 1929, and the order of Kerwin J. of January 13, 1933, dismissing an application by way of originating notice, directed against the present respondents, for a writ of habeas corpus and for custody of the said child.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ.F. Boland, K.C., for the appellants.\nJ.L. Grogan for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff, C.J., and Smith and Crocket JJ., was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of McEvoy, J., delivered September 4, 1929, and of Kerwin, J., delivered January 13, 1933, refusing an order for a writ of habeas corpus against the respondents, and for the custody of an infant girl, Helen or Thelma DeLaurier, of whom the appellants were the natural and the respondents the foster parents.\nThe appellants\u2019 motion, it appears, was made before Mr. Justice McEvoy on January 11, 1928, when, after hearing the evidence of both appellants and both respondents, and some other witnesses, His Lordship stated that the child would remain in the custody of the court in the meantime. \u201cThat will mean\u201d, he added, \u201cwith the Jacksons for the time being\u201d. The matter remained in that position until the delivery of His Lordship\u2019s formal judgment on September 4, 1929, from which the appellants appealed to the Appellate Division, which, on December 11, 1929, gave them leave to move in Single Court for an order for the present custody of the child, the appeal to stand over pending the disposition of such motion. Various notices of motion returnable before different judges at chambers were subsequently served by the appellants, but no further proceedings were taken until June 28, 1932, when, in pursuance of an order of the late Mr. Justice Grant for the taking of further evidence before the Assistant Master, both the appellants and the respondents were further examined before that officer, and the evidence of other witnesses taken as well. The matter finally came before Mr. Justice Kerwin on December 20, 1932, when, after perusing the various orders and the evidence taken before Mr. Justice McEvoy and the Assistant Master, he concluded that he should see the parties and the child, and he therefore directed that they appear before him on January 9, the appellants after the hearing before the Master having removed to Montreal. Madame DeLaurier appeared before him in pursuance of this order and both Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, but Joseph DeLaurier was unable to attend. The three named were briefly examined, and the child interviewed, and on January 13 last His Lordship delivered his judgment refusing the application of the appellants for the custody of the infant.\nThe girl, Thelma, was born at Toronto, July 19, 1920. A few weeks after her birth her mother, Mrs. DeLaurier, was placed in a sanitorium for treatment for tuberculosis, and at the same time four of her children, including Thelma, were sent to a preventorium. Mrs. DeLaurier did not return to her home until February, 1922. Expecting to be confined shortly, she felt unable to look after the four children whom the authorities at the preventorium decided should be discharged from that institution. The Catholic Welfare Bureau undertook to place Thelma in St. Mary\u2019s Infant Home, and to see that she would be looked after until after the mother\u2019s confinement, and when she would be able herself to attend the child. It was found, however, that St. Mary\u2019s Infant Home was quarantined for measles and the Catholic Welfare Bureau then asked the Home to place the infant with some family. At the direction of the authorities of the Home, the father took the child on February 3, 1922, to Mr. and Mrs. Jackson who conducted a boarding house for infants, and who were to be paid by the Home at the rate of $20 per month. The City of Toronto paid for the child\u2019s maintenance for some time, and then the Catholic Welfare Bureau, but always through the Infants\u2019 Home. In September, 1922, the DeLauriers were notified that the Catholic Welfare Bureau would no longer be responsible for the child\u2019s maintenance and the Jacksons were notified by the Infants\u2019 Home that they would receive no further payments through that institution. The child\u2019s mother still felt unequal to looking after Thelma, and the husband thereupon made arrangements with the Jacksons for the latter to continue boarding the child at the same rate. The sum of $19 in all was paid by DeLaurier in instalments and the Jacksons then notified the parents to come and take the child, and to bring clothes for her. The parents were unable to supply the clothes and Thelma remained with the Jacksons. The father visited the child occasionally, but the mother states that she was unable to do so on account of her health, and because she was not familiar with the city.\nThese are the unfortunate circumstances which explain how the Jacksons were first brought into contact with Thelma when she was only 18 or 19 months old. A warm attachment seems to have grown up between them and the child, and, upon moving to Havelock, where Mr. Jackson had obtained a new position, they were allowed by the DeLauriers to take Thelma to live with them there. They remained there until 1927, when they returned to Toronto, bringing Thelma back with them, and continuing to treat her as a member of their family, as they had done during the whole period of their residence at Havelock.\nThe child has come to be known as Thelma Jackson, calls the Jacksons her father and mother and their son and daughter her brother and sister, although she knows that the DeLauriers are her natural parents. Both Mr. and Mrs. Jackson are Protestants and attend a United Church in Toronto, with which Thelma has become identified. She has been educated in the public schools of Toronto, where she has won honour certificates and apparently has been most happy.\nThe DeLauriers, who are Roman Catholics, have had fourteen children, of whom five were living with them in Toronto, one of these being a married son, whose wife and child lived also with them. Three younger boys occupied one room together in their parents\u2019 Toronto home, and a daughter another room, which Mrs. DeLaurier explained she proposed Thelma, when she came back, should occupy with her. Another daughter was under treatment in a hospital. DeLaurier himself had served a sentence of two months for an offence against the Ontario Liquor Law, while one of the boys had twice been convicted of theft and another before a magistrate for some minor offence.\nOne thing the evidence clearly shews\u2014that Thelma has been completely out of touch with her natural parents for a period of now over ten years and that her mother has had no contact with her since a few weeks or at most a few months after her birth.\nAfter a careful examination of the evidence and the learned trial judge\u2019s (Kerwin, J.) conclusion thereupon and the reasons he gives for his decision, we are satisfied that he in no manner disregarded the provisions of s. 24 of the Ontario Infants Act, upon which the appellants much rely. The effect of this section, no doubt, is that none of the provisions of that statute shall be deemed to alter whatever authority the father may otherwise by law possess as to the religious faith in which his child is to be educated. This authority, however wide it may have been at common law, must now be measured by the rules of equity, which in virtue of the express provisions of the Judicature Act prevail in Ontario as they do in England, and, in cases of this kind, recognize the welfare of the child as the predominant consideration. If the general welfare of the child requires that the father\u2019s rights in respect of the religious faith in which his offspring is to be reared, should be suspended or superseded, the courts in the exercise of their equitable jurisdiction have undoubted power to override them, as they have power to override all other parental rights, though in doing so they must act cautiously. This, as I take it, is the effect of Lord Justice FitzGibbon\u2019s well known exposition of the law on this subject in the O\u2019Hara case[1].\nDue consideration is, of course, to be given in all cases to the father\u2019s wishes but if the court is satisfied in any case upon a consideration of all the facts and circumstances, as shewn by the evidence, that the father\u2019s wishes conflict with the child\u2019s own best interests, viewed from all angles\u2014material, physical, moral, emotional and intellectual as well as religious\u2014then the father\u2019s wishes must yield to the welfare of the child. As to this see also remarks of Viscount Cave in Ward v. Laverty[2]. It is not a question of the father having forfeited his parental rights by serious misconduct, and it is, therefore, not necessary, in order to justify the court in ignoring the father\u2019s or the mother\u2019s wishes, that any such serious misconduct should be proved. It is solely a question of what is in the child\u2019s best interests.\nThis is the question to which the learned trial judge clearly addressed himself after a careful review of all the evidence taken before McEvoy, J., and the Assistant Master and after himself further examining the two respondents as well as the female appellant and personally interviewing the child herself, then in her thirteenth year.\nThere has been no case, so far as I have been able to ascertain, where a child, old enough to form any religious convictions, has, after the lapse of such a period of time, been ordered, against her own expressed wish, from the custody of a Roman Catholic family in which it has been reared, to the custody of a Protestant family, or from the custody of a Protestant family to that of a Roman Catholic family, once settled or strong convictions in favour of either religious faith have been acquired, as well as settled affections for the family in which he or she has been reared. Viscount Cave in the Laverty case[3] and FitzGibbon L.J. in the O\u2019Hara case[4] point out the grave risks which such an order would involve to the welfare and happiness of the child, apart from all other considerations.\nThe trial judge\u2019s personal interview with the girl herself afforded him an opportunity, of which we have no doubt he fully availed himself, to test the sincerity of her feelings in these all important features.\nWe are of opinion that there was ample justification for the decision of the learned trial judge to refuse the order asked for in this case, and that the appeal should, therefore, be dismissed.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs; the costs of the unsuccessful motion to quash (fixed at $75) to be set off against the respondents\u2019 costs. RINFRET J.\u2014This is a case where the rules of equity must prevail, and a very great discretion is vested in the judge to whom the application is made. Having regard to all the circumstances, I am unable to reach the conclusion that the discretion has been wrongly exercised in the premises, and I agree with the disposition of the case made by my brother Crocket.\nHUGHES J.\u2014On the 11th day of January, 1928, an application by Joseph DeLaurier for the custody of Helen (Thelma) DeLaurier came before Mr. Justice McEvoy, who heard evidence viva voce and, on the 4th day of September, 1929, being of opinion that the child should remain with the respondents, dismissed the application with costs. The said Joseph DeLaurier appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and that court gave leave to Joseph DeLaurier to move in Single Court for an order for the custody of Helen (Thelma) DeLaurier and upon such motion to use the evidence taken before Mr. Justice McEvoy and such further evidence as might be presented and heard, and further ordered the appeal to stand over pending the disposition of the motion. Further evidence was taken before the Assistant Master on the 28th day of June, 1932, and, on Friday, the 13th day of January, 1933, Mr. Justice Kerwin heard the application of Joseph DeLaurier and Marie DeLaurier on the evidence adduced before Mr. Justice McEvoy and before the Assistant Master, and dismissed the application without costs.\nMr. Justice Kerwin deemed it advisable to see the parties and the infant. All appeared with the exception of Joseph DeLaurier, whose wife, Marie DeLaurier, stated that they were living in Montreal and that it was not possible for him to leave his position. Mr. Justice Kerwin personally questioned the infant and later gave written reasons. He found that the appellants never definitely gave up their rights to the custody of the child, or their rights to have her brought up in their own faith, namely, the Roman Catholic faith. He was of opinion that the parents had done or omitted nothing since the previous hearing to forfeit whatever rights they then had, but he was of opinion that the child, almost thirteen years of age, should remain where she was, namely, with the respondents. Joseph DeLaurier and Marie DeLaurier then renewed their appeal from the order of Mr. Justice McEvoy and appealed from the order of Mr. Justice Kerwin, and the Court of Appeal, on the 12th day of April, 1933, dismissed both appeals with costs.\nWritten reasons were not given by the Court of Appeal.\nThe child was born on July 19, 1920. Shortly afterwards it was found that the mother had tuberculosis and she was ordered to go to a sanitarium, and four children, including Thelma, were placed in a preventorium, where she remained until February, 1922. At that time the mother was about to be confined and the Catholic Welfare Bureau agreed to place Thelma in St. Mary\u2019s Infants\u2019 Home. The Home, however, was quarantined with measles and the Catholic Welfare Bureau arranged with the Home to place the baby temporarily, and they placed it with the respondents. The City of Toronto paid for the child for a while, and later the Catholic Welfare Bureau paid, but, on September 20, 1922, payments ceased. Joseph DeLaurier then made an agreement to pay the respondents four dollars per week for Thelma\u2019s care. In the opinion of the father the child was well cared for. Joseph DeLaurier paid for a few weeks and then he was not able to pay any more, and had some negotiations with the respondents for the return of the child. Subsequently the respondents moved to Havelock and took Thelma with them. There was some correspondence between the parties and Marie DeLaurier sent a few dollars to the respondents at Havelock. The respondents later returned to Toronto and, in the month of August, 1927, Joseph DeLaurier told the respondents that he did not have any money but that he wanted the child back.\nMarie DeLaurier testified that she saw Thelma in December, 1922, and again the day before Christmas in the year 1927. In the meantime she had telephoned to the respondents asking them to come to some arrangement, and at least to permit her to see the child, but that the respondents had asked her to sign adoption papers before permitting her to see the child. She testified that she had written several letters to the respondents while they were at Havelock and, on one occasion, had sent two dollars for Christmas. The respondents answered twice and then ceased to write. The mother was of opinion that the respondents were good to Thelma.\nLila Jackson testified that the respondents were to receive $20 per month for the care of the child, but that payments ceased in September, 1922. An arrangement was then made with Joseph DeLaurier whereby he agreed to pay $4 per week, but he paid only $19 in all. Lila Jackson testified that she then asked Joseph DeLaurier by telephone to come and take Thelma home. She finally concluded that the appellants had abandoned the child. Lila Jackson testified that she was quite healthy and that she had two children of her own, both of whom were working. She stated that in September, 1931, Thelma\u2019s tonsils and adenoids had been removed and that she had gained nineteen pounds in weight between that date and the date of the last taking of evidence, namely, June, 1932.\nThe respondent, F.G. Jackson, was a mechanic. He corroborated the evidence of his wife. He stated that the question of pay for Thelma had been forgotten long ago and that the child was very dear to the respondents.\nKatherine Hughes, an associate worker of the Catholic Welfare Bureau, stated that on May 27, 1922, she had visited the house of the appellants; that it was a clean, comfortably furnished eight-roomed house. Marie DeLaurier was doing the work and apparently the family was managing very well and was comfortable. The evidence shewed, however, that Joseph DeLaurier had been sentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment for a breach of the Liquor Control Act, and one of the boys had been before the Juvenile Court on two occasions for theft.\nFrom the foregoing, it appears clear that the appellants were, at the time Mr. Justice Kerwin examined Thelma, practically strangers to her.\nThe appellants rely strongly on section 24 of the Infants Act, R.S.O., 1927, chapter 186, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNothing in this Act shall change the law as to the authority of the father in respect of the religious faith in which his child is to be educated.\nSection 21 of the Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1927, chapter 88, provides as follows:\u2014\nIn questions relating to the custody and education of infants, and generally in all matters in which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter, the rules of equity shall prevail. In equity a principle was early established that the court might control or ignore the parental right but in so doing it should act cautiously, and should act in opposition to the parent only when judicially satisfied that the welfare of the child required that the parental right should be suspended or superseded.\nIn the present case, Mr. Justice Kerwin interviewed the infant and then dismissed the application of the appellants, and Mr. Justice McEvoy had some time before dismissed a similar application after seeing the parties and hearing their evidence. The Court of Appeal affirmed these dismissals, and, as the orders of dismissal were in the nature of discretionary orders, I do not know on what principle this Court can now interfere. The appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs, against which should be set off the costs of the motion to quash the appeal fixed at $75.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.B.

In 1932 appellant made a return to the assessment commissioner of Toronto shewing income received (in Ontario) during 1931 on a certain trust under G.\u2019s will, which income had been paid over in 1931 to the persons entitled under the trust, who were domiciled and resident in the United States. The city assessor, in the assessment roll prepared in 1932 upon which taxes for 1933 would be levied, assessed appellant for the amount of said income.\nHeld: The assessment was legal under the provisions of ss. 4, 10 and 13 (1) (4) (5) (6) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238 (as amended in 1930, c. 46); which provisions are intra vires.\nThe legislation discussed with regard to its purpose, construction and effect. It does not offend against the requirement that provincial taxation be \u201cdirect taxation\u201d.\nAPPEAL by William G. Gooderham, one of the trustees of the estate of George Gooderham, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal of said appellant from the judgment of His Honour Judge Denton, Senior Judge of the County Court of the County of York, dismissing the appeal of said appellant from the Court of Revision for the City of Toronto confirming the assessment of the appellant in respect of income, amounting to $73,083, received on a certain trust under the said deceased\u2019s will.\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal was upon a special case stated by His Honour Judge Denton pursuant to s. 84 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 238. The special case was as follows:\n1. The late George Gooderham died on or about the first day of May, 1905. He was a resident of the city of Toronto, and he duly made his last will and testament, probate whereof was granted on the second day of October, 1905. A copy of such probate is hereto annexed.\n2. By his last will and testament the said George Gooderham set aside a share of his estate for his daughter, Mrs. V.D. Bird, and directed his trustees to pay to her the income arising there from during the term of her natural life, and on her death the said trustees were directed in the events that have happened to pay the income arising from one-half of said share to the husband of the said daughter in equal quarterly payments on the first days of January, April, July and October in each year, and subject thereto that the income from the said share or so much thereof as the trustees of the said will in their discretion should see fit should be applied towards the support, maintenance and education of the child or children of the said daughter until the youngest child shall have attained the age of twenty-one years, and upon the youngest child of such daughter attaining the age of twenty-one years to divide the whole with accumulations in case the husband be dead, or the one-half share in case he be alive among the surviving children of the said daughter and the issue of any children who may have died leaving issue surviving all as set forth in the said will, a copy of which is attached hereto.\n3. The said Mrs. V.D. Bird died prior to the year 1931, leaving her surviving her husband and daughters, all of whom are still living. The said daughters are all under the age of twenty-one years. 4. The said Mrs. V.D. Bird at the time of her death and for a long time prior thereto was domiciled and resident in the state of Massachusetts, one of the United States of America, and her said husband and children were at the time of the death of the said Mrs. V.D. Bird and are still domiciled and resident in the state of Massachusetts, and the income arising from time to time since the death of the said Mrs. V.D. Bird upon one\u2011half of the share of the estate of the said late George Gooderham set apart for the said Mrs. V.D. Bird, pursuant to the direction of his last will and testament as aforesaid, has been paid quarterly to the husband of the said Mrs. V.D. Bird for his own use, and as to the other one-half thereof has been applied towards the support, maintenance and education of the children of the said Mrs. V.D. Bird by paying the same to the said husband upon vouchers for the proper application thereof by him.\n5. The trustees of the will of the said late George Gooderham in the year 1932 made a return to the assessment commissioner showing the receipt by them of income to the amount of $73,083, received by them for the year ending December 31, 1931, upon the share of the estate of the late George Gooderham so set aside for the late Mrs. V.D. Bird under the provisions of the said will hereinbefore in part recited.\n6. The assessor, in the assessment roll prepared in the year 1932 upon which taxes for the year 1933 will be levied, has assessed William G. Gooderham, one of the trustees under the will of the said late George Gooderham, for the said sum of $73,083 (the income shown by the said return). No objection is taken on the ground that only one of the trustees had been assessed.\n7. From such assessment the appellant appealed to the Court of Revision and said appeal was dismissed.\n8. The appellant then appealed to the County Judge of the County of York from the decision of the Court of Revision and the appeal came on for hearing before me on the 14th day of December, 1932.\n9. On the hearing of the said appeal, the appellant requested me to make a note of the questions of law and construction of statutes raised by him and to state the same in the form of a special case for the Court of Appeal should my judgment be adverse to the appellant.\n10. After hearing the evidence and argument I delivered judgment dismissing the said appeal.\nAt the request of the appellant I have granted this special case, pursuant to section 84 of the Assessment Act. The questions of law and construction of statutes, which I now submit to the Court of Appeal, are as follows:\n(1) Was I right in holding that section 13 of the Assessment Act as enacted by section 3 of the Assessment Amendment Act, 1930 [c. 46 of 1930] is intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario?\n(2) Was I right in holding that under the provisions of the Assessment Act and the amendments thereto the appellant was properly placed on the assessment roll and assessed in the year 1932 in respect of such income as was received by the said trustees during the year 1931 and paid over in the same year as set forth in paragraph 4, the said assessment being the amount upon which taxes for the year 1933 will be levied?\nDated, January 31, 1933. J.H. DENTON\nJ. By the judgment of the Court of Appeal both questions submitted were answered in the affirmative.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that s. 13 (1) of the Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, as amended in 1930, c. 46) does not authorize an assessment of the person who receives the income as trustee, but provides for a tax in rem, on the income itself; that the intention of the legislation was to get at the income itself and to assess directly; that it does not authorize an assessment to be made in 1932 for the purpose of taxation in 1933 in respect of income received and paid over in 1931; the income cannot then be assessed \u201cin the hands of the trustees\u201d; that if the assessment is to be treated as a personal assessment of the trustee, then it was beyond the power of the legislature to enact the legislation.\nIt was contended on behalf of the respondent that s. 13 of the Act authorized the assessment of the appellant in respect of income received by him as trustee, which is payable to persons resident out of Ontario; that the Act authorized the assessment of the appellant in 1932 in respect of such income received in 1931; and that the legislation was intra vires.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are set out in the judgment now reported.\nD.L. McCarthy, K.C., and J.W. Pickup, K.C., for the appellant.\nC.M. Colquhoun, K.C., and J.P. Kent for the respondent.\nE. Bayly, K.C., for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014The facts are set forth in the stated case and it will not be necessary to repeat them. It will be convenient first to consider the question as to the validity of the legislation.\nThe primary provision of the Assessment Act is s. 4, R.S.O., 1927, c. 238, and it is in these terms:\nAll real property in Ontario and all income derived either within or out of Ontario by any person resident therein, or received in Ontario by or on behalf of any person resident out of the same shall be liable to taxation * * * The purpose of the legislature, clearly expressed in this enactment, is that income received in Ontario by or on behalf of persons not resident in Ontario shall be liable to taxation. The specific provisions dealing with income falling within this rule are to be found in s. 13 of the Act, subsections (1), (4), (5) and (6). But before discussing these provisions we shall first quote s. 10, which is in these words:\n10. (1) Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 4 and 9:\n(a) Every person not liable to business assessment under section 9 shall be assessed in respect of income;\n* * *\n(2) The income to be assessed shall be the amount of the income received during the year ending on the 31st of December then last past.\nFor the elucidation of this provision, it should be mentioned that s. 1. (l) provides that the word \u201cperson\u201d includes \u201cagent\u201d or \u201ctrustee\u201d. Where income is received, therefore, in Ontario during a given year by a trustee on behalf of somebody who is resident out of Ontario, that income, by force of the provisions of the Act, is assessable to income tax in the succeeding year. In the ordinary case, as it admittedly was in the present case, the assessment is made upon a return received by the Assessment Department from the trustee after the expiration of the year during which the income was received; and at a time, therefore, when the amount has been definitely ascertained.\nWe now turn to the provisions specifically dealing with income received in Ontario by trustees for payment to persons not resident in the province. These provisions are as follows:\n13. (1) Where a person resident in Ontario creates a trust or agency fund or dies leaving an estate, and income from such fund or estate is payable to a person resident outside of Ontario, the income payable to such non-resident shall be assessed in the hands of the executors, administrators, trustees or agents of such estate or fund, who may pay the amount of taxes out of the income in their hands.\n(4) Any executor, administrator, trustee or agent failing to pay the income tax levied upon any assessment made under this section out of the fund or estate shall be personally liable there for.\n(5) The municipality entitled to assess shall be the municipality in which the testator resided at the time of his death, or in which the settlor or principal resided at the date of the creation of the trust or agency fund, or, if the testator, settlor or principal did not reside in Ontario, at such time or date, the municipality where the trustee or agent resides, or if there be more than one, where the chief business of the trust or agency fund is carried on.\n(6) Where the person in receipt of income assessable under this section resides or carries on business within the municipality entitled to assess, the assessment shall be made either at his place of business or residence; and where such person does not reside or carry on business in the municipality entitled to assess, the assessment shall be made at the office of the clerk of such municipality.\nIn conformity with the general enactment of s. 4, such income is assessable, and it is not disputed that s. 10 (2) governs the procedure. The income described in s. 13 (1), therefore, is to be assessed \u201cin the hands of\u201d the executors, administrators or trustees in the year succeeding the receipt of it. It is assessable because, in the language of s. 4, it is \u201cliable to taxation\u201d. By that section, it is placed in precisely the same category purposes as income derived by \u201ca person resident\u201d in Ontario.\nThere can be no possible question that such income is taxable by the province. It is property in the province and subject to the control of the provincial legislature. Moreover, it belongs to a class of subjects to which Lord Hobhouse, in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe [1], refers to in these words:\n[It] is always spoken of as [a direct tax], and is generally looked upon as a direct tax of the most obvious kind;\n(See also the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Kingcome Navigation Co.[2]).\nThe legislature having determined to do what it was entitled to do, that is to say, to provide for the assessment of such income for the purposes of income tax, might have proceeded in various ways. The legislation intending to carry out this design might have enacted that the executor, administrator or trustee should hold the income in trust, primarily to pay the tax, and, thereafter, to pay over the residue in accordance with the trusts declared by the instrument creating the trust. The legislature adopted a somewhat different course. The statute first declares that income shall be assessed in the hands of the trustees; and then proceeds to empower the trustees to pay the tax \u201cout of the income in their hands\u201d, and then (subs. 4) to enact that the trustee \u201cfailing to pay the income tax levied upon any assessment made under this section out of the fund or estate shall be personally liable therefor.\u201d The intention of the statute appears to be unmistakeable. The income is to be assessed in the hands of the trustees. The trustees may pay the tax out of the income in their hands, and, failing to do so, they shall be personally liable. In substance, there appears to be little difference between authorizing the trustee to pay out of the income and penalizing him by making him personally liable if he fails to do so, and constituting him a trustee of the income for the purpose of paying the tax, or requiring him to pay the tax out of the income.\nThe purpose of the legislature being to levy a tax in respect of income received by the trustee in Ontario, (the trustee being, it may be added, as appears from subs. 5, resident in Ontario) I can see no reason why any one of these methods might not lawfully be adopted.\nI do not think such legislation offends against the condition requiring provincial taxation to be \u201cdirect taxation\u201d. The statute plainly contemplates, as already indicated, the residence of the trustee within the province, and the machinery provided is intended to prevent the frustration of the purpose of the statute by the transfer of the income beyond the boundaries of the province by the trustee without making provision for payment of the tax. The intent is to levy the tax pursuant to the assessment, that is to say, pursuant to the assessment in the hands of the trustee. The machinery is provided for the purpose of giving effect to this intention. It is to be paid out of the property of the person who is ultimately to bear the burden.\nThere remains a question as to the form of the assessment. The statute directs that the income shall be assessed \u201cin the hands of the trustee\u201d. The municipality has acted upon the view that, in compliance with this requirement, the trustee in his representative capacity should be assessed in respect of the income. We think this is a reasonable construction of the statute. The sections immediately under consideration, whatever else may be said about them, do undoubtedly contemplate an assessment of such a character as under the provisions of the municipal law will enable the municipality to levy and collect the tax; but they do not contemplate that the tax shall be levied and collected except in a manner consistent with the specific provisions of the statute dealing with the assessment of such incomes as we have cited above. The form of the assessment, it would appear, can be of little importance. The liability of the trustee is defined in explicit terms by the statute. The form of the assessment cannot, under the general provisions of the municipal law or the taxation law, either cut down or enlarge that liability. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.M.

The municipalities replaced the bridges by new and stronger ones, the change involving construction on alignments different from those of the old bridges and the substitution of two lines of track for the former single track. On application by the municipalities, the Manitoba Municipal and Public Utility Board made an order requiring appellant to pay the cost of placing rails, ties and foundations therefor on the bridges and one-half the cost of such work in connection with the approaches.\nHeld: The order was unauthorized. From the Board\u2019s memorandum of judgment, its line of consideration of the application, and its finding in former proceedings, the order must be taken as one grounded on s. 119 (a) of the Municipal and Public Utility Board Act, Man., 1926, c. 33; and to justify it under s. 119 (a) it must be an order requiring appellant to perform some duty or obligation imposed upon it by statute or municipal by-law or provisions of its own charter or by agreement with either of the municipalities or other owner; and no such obligation as the Board had ordered was so imposed. Having regard to the respective obligations of appellant and of the municipalities, under the agreements with respect to the old bridges, and it not appearing that the stoppage of service over the bridges was due to any default of appellant, and as no responsibility rested on appellant for the taking down and replacement of the old bridges, the Board had no authority to require the payments ordered from appellant, either as a statutory or contractual liability, or as payments necessitated by renewal of the former service. The taking down of the bridges, without any new agreement with appellant, relieved appellant from further obligation in respect of its agreements. Sec. 15 of by-law 543 (by-law granting franchise to appellant) of the City of Winnipeg, as to the city council\u2019s right to demand construction of new lines, had no application, as no such demand was shown to have been made, there was no obligation on appellant under the by-law to share in the cost of a new bridge, and appellant had its track on the bridge when it was taken down.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 41 Man. R. 1, affirming the Board\u2019s order, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the Winnipeg Electric Company from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], dismissing the Company\u2019s appeal from the order of the Municipal and Public Utility Board (the Board created by the Municipal and Public Utility Board Act, Statutes of Manitoba, 1926, c. 33), requiring the Company to pay the entire cost of placing rails, ties and foundations therefor on two bridges then in course of construction and one-half the cost of such works in connection with the several approaches to the bridges. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed and the order of the Board set aside, with costs throughout. W. N. Tilley, K.C., and R. D. Guy, K.C., for the appellant.\nJules Preudhomme, K.C., for the respondent, City of Winnipeg.\nF. Trafford Taylor for the respondent, City of St. Boniface.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014In the year 1893 the town council of St. Boniface passed a by-law granting to the Winnipeg Electric Street Railway Co., which was then operating a street railway system in the city of Winnipeg, the right to construct and operate single or double lines of street railway on any of the streets of St. Boniface. This franchise was originally granted for the term of 30 years, which period was within a few days extended to 40 years by an amending by-law, with the right to the town on the expiration of that period on notice to take over the system at a valuation to be determined by arbitration. One of the conditions of the franchise was that the fares to be charged should not exceed the fares then charged in Winnipeg and that no more than one fare should be charged for any continuous trip, \u201cthis to include a continuous trip from the Town of St. Boniface to the City of Winnipeg, or from the City of Winnipeg to the Town of St. Boniface.\u201d By a later by-law, passed July 31, 1902, it was provided that transfers \u201cshall be given on said railway in Winnipeg to passengers from St. Boniface and to St. Boniface in the same manner as transfers are at present given in Winnipeg\u201d.\nIn May, 1904, the Street Railway Co. entered into an agreement with the Norwood Improvement Co. Ltd., which had constructed a bridge across the Red River, the centre thread of which forms the boundary between the city of Winnipeg and the town (now the city) of St. Boniface, and was then maintaining it as a toll bridge, whereby the Improvement Co, granted the right to the Street Railway Co. to lay an electric street railway track upon the easterly side of the bridge and the approaches thereto and to operate passenger cars upon the said track for a period of eight years. This agreement provided that the Railway Co. should at all times during its continuance keep so much of the surface of the bridge as may be between the rails of the said track and for the space of two feet on the outside of each rail in good repair, and further, that the Improvement Co. should have the right, whenever it should deem it necessary, to take up the rails or that part of the bridge covered by the rails\nfor the purpose of altering or repairing the said bridge or for any other purpose within the province or privilege of the Improvement Company; the same being replaced by and at the expense of the Improvement Company.\nThere was a further clause that the Railway Co. should assume all responsibility and risk and liability of and in connection with the strength and sufficiency of the bridge \u201cfor the purposes for which the leave and licence hereby given is granted\u201d and that\nshould any strengthening or altering of the said bridge be required now or at any future time, during the continuance of this agreement, to make the same sufficient for such purposes, such strengthening and altering shall be done by the Street Railway Company at its own expense and to the satisfaction of the Improvement Company.\nAnother clause freed the Improvement Co. from all liability for any loss or damage arising from the construction or operation of the street railway upon and across the bridge.\nIn March, 1909, the City of St. Boniface purchased this bridge and all the vendor\u2019s rights in connection therewith from the Norwood Improvement Co. by an agreement in which the Street Railway Co. joined, and by which the latter accepted the City of St. Boniface in substitution for the Improvement Co. in all contracts and agreements between the Company and the Railway, and released the Company from all liability in respect thereof. By a supplementary agreement entered into a few days later the Railway Co. agreed with the City that whenever the City should pave the balance of the bridge, it would pave and maintain the pavement of that portion of the bridge lying between the railway tracks during the term of the operation of the Company\u2019s cars and keep the same \u201cin as good condition as the balance of the pavement on the bridge shall be kept and maintained by the City\u201d, and the City on its part agreed to make and keep the bridge as a public highway for the free passage of the public and the cars and passengers of the Company.\nThe Winnipeg Electric Railway Co. and its successor, the Winnipeg Electric Company, the present appellant, continued to operate its cars across this bridge under the terms of these agreements until September, 1929. In the year 1926, the bridge having been considered to be unequal to the strain of the increasing motor vehicle and other traffic, the Company put in some stringers at its own expense to strengthen and make it safe for its own cars after unavailingly notifying the city authorities that some means must be found to relieve the traffic conditions on the bridge with an intimation that if this were not done the Company would be compelled to discontinue its service over it.\nIn August, 1929, the question of the safety of the bridge was again raised, when the Company called the City\u2019s attention to the fact that, while it was complying with the recommendations contained in a report prepared by the City\u2019s consulting engineer as a result of the complaints of 1925, the City had taken no steps to control other traffic over the bridge, in accordance with its own engineer\u2019s report, and that unless something were done to this end, the Company would have to seriously consider discontinuing service over the bridge. The City\u2019s consulting engineer thereupon made a further examination of the bridge and recommended that all street cars, trucks and horse-drawn vehicles be stopped from using the bridge. The Company in consequence discontinued its service over the bridge, and immediately applied to the City Council of Winnipeg for permission to extend a bus service it was operating on River Ave. as far north on Main St. as the Union Station, in order that its patrons might not be inconvenienced. This permission was granted as a temporary measure and during the pleasure of the Council. On the St. Boniface side the Company installed a loop near the approach to the abandoned bridge and used the Provencher Ave bridge further down the river for the crossing of its cars to Winnipeg.\nBefore this stoppage the Street Railway Co. had maintained its St. Boniface-Winnipeg interurban service via the Norwood bridge and South Main St. which afforded the approach to the bridge on the Winnipeg side, running almost due north from and on a straight line with the bridge, and intersecting Bell, River and Mayfair Avenues, before crossing the Assiniboine River by the Main St. bridge on to Main St. These two bridges appear by the plans in evidence to be separated by a distance of some 800 feet. The substituted service provided for as above continued for upwards of a year without any arrangements being made by either the City of St. Boniface or the City of Winnipeg for the strengthening or replacement of the Norwood bridge, or the restoration of the former service. In the fall of 1930 negotiations took place between the two municipalities looking to the construction of new and stronger bridges across the Red River on the site of the abandoned Norwood bridge and across the Assiniboine River on Main St. and to the substitution of two lines of street railway track across both bridges for the single track on which the service had formerly been maintained, the proposal embracing also the widening of Main St. South, though a double track appears to have already been installed on this street between the two bridges. Both cities hoped to secure appropriations from the contributions which it was expected the federal and provincial governments would make for unemployment relief. In the end the two cities obtained estimates of the cost of the proposed two new bridges\u2014$620,000 for the Norwood bridge, and $480,000 for the Main St. bridge, and assurances that the federal and provincial governments would each contribute $180,000 to the cost of the Norwood bridge\u2014about 60 per cent. of the entire cost, and 25 per cent. each to the cost of the Main St. bridge. The balance of the cost of the Norwood bridge was to be shared between the two cities, while that of the Main St. bridge was to be borne by the City of Winnipeg. Efforts were then made to obtain from the Winnipeg Electric an agreement to share in the cost of both bridges. The president of the Company promised to recommend to the directors the approval of an arrangement whereby the Company would pay interest not exceeding 5\u00bd per cent. and sinking fund payments on such amount of money as might be necessary to build street car tracks on both bridges, together with any additional outlay which might be necessary to connect up the existing tracks with the bridges and any other changes which might result from their construction, the entire capital sum for which the Company should be responsible not to exceed $50,000. This proposal, however, was not acceptable, and the two cities went on with the work without effecting any agreement with the appellant, and, in June, 1931, while the bridges were in course of construction, applied to the Municipal and Public Utility Board to compel a contribution from the Company. This application was dismissed but the Board granted leave to the municipalities to reopen the application for the settlement of the terms by which car services across the bridges might be provided when construction was completed. The two cities, therefore, on June 30, 1931, joined in an application to have fixed the amount payable by the Company as its share of the cost of paving and for placing street car rails on both bridges and for the settlement of the terms by which street car services across the bridges might be provided when construction was completed. On this application the Board made an order requiring the Company to pay the entire cost of placing rails, ties and foundations therefor on both bridges and one-half the cost of such works in connection with the approaches to both bridges, and authorizing the Company to charge the expenses occasioned thereby to its street railway depreciation reserve fund\u2014a fund which, it was stated on the argument, does not exist. The amount of the required payments was not stated, but it is said in the appellant\u2019s factum that they will total between $50,000 and $60,000. From this order an appeal was taken to the Appeal Court of the Province of Manitoba. The Appeal Court dismissed this appeal[2], and the Company now appeals from the decision of the Appeal Court.\nBy s. 119 (a) of the Municipal and Public Utility Board Act, the Board is given power on notice to and hearing the parties interested to require every owner of a public utility to comply with the laws of the Province and any municipal by-law affecting the public utility or its owner,\nand to conform to the duties imposed thereby, or by the provisions of its own charter, or by any agreement with any municipality or other owner;\nand by subs. (c) of the same section:\u2014\nto establish, construct, maintain and operate any reasonable extension of its existing facilities when in the judgment of the Board such extension is reasonable and practicable and will furnish sufficient business to justify the construction and maintenance of the same, and when the financial condition of the owner reasonably warrants the original expenditure required in making and operating such extension.\nIt is quite apparent from the Board\u2019s memorandum of judgment that it dealt with the application as one for the restoration of an abandoned service, under 119 (a), and not as one for the extension of existing facilities under 119 (c). In fact the chairman in his judgment distinctly states that\nnotwithstanding that much of the evidence submitted was referable to the extension of existing facilities, the Board regards the application as one for the renewal of the former services which were temporarily abandoned because of the condition of the old bridges.\nNo consideration was given therefore to the question as to whether the financial condition of the Company reasonably warranted the expenditure which was ordered, without which by the express terms of 119 (c) no order could properly be made if the application were treated as one for the extension of existing facilities. As a matter of fact the Board itself, in dismissing the application to compel the Company to contribute to the cost of the new bridges, stated that the evidence was abundant that then and for some time this utility was not meeting and had not met costs properly chargeable to service with little or nothing whatever for the use of large sums of money fixed irrevocably in the assets of the utility, and found that the conditions existing were not those on which it should make an order grounded on 119 (c). It is perfectly clear, therefore, that the validity of the order appealed from must rest upon 119 (a), and that it can be justified only as an order requiring the Company to perform some duty or obligation which was imposed upon it by some Act of the Legislature or by some municipal by-law or by the provisions of its own charter or by some agreement with either of the two cities or other owner.\nIt is not contended that there is any provision in the Company\u2019s charter by which any such obligation is imposed as that which the Board has ordered. No provision of any Act of the Legislature was cited as the ground of the Company\u2019s liability to make the payments which the order requires. The only municipal by-laws and agreements, as regards the City of St. Boniface, which are relied upon by that City, are those which have already been mentioned, viz: the by-law of 1893 granting to the Company the right to construct and operate single or double lines of street railway on the streets of the town; the by-law of 1902; the agreement entered into between the Norwood Improvement Co. and the Railway Co. in 1904; and that of 1909 between the Improvement Co. and the City, in which the Railway Co. joined. The by-law of 1893 granting the franchise to the Company made no mention of maintaining an interurban service across Norwood bridge or any other bridge. The only provision in it that can be relied upon is that of paragraph 3, that the fares to be charged shall not exceed those then charged in Winnipeg and that no more than one fare was to be paid for any continuous trip, \u201cthis to include a continuous trip from the Town of St. Boniface to the City of Winnipeg, or from the City of Winnipeg to the Town of St. Boniface\u201d. In no view can this be said to imply an agreement on the part of the Company to provide a service across the old Norwood bridge which, it would seem, was not even in existence at that time.\nThe appellant\u2019s obligations in respect of maintaining a service across that bridge are grounded wholly on the Company\u2019s agreement of 1904 with the Norwood Improvement Co. and in the agreement by which the City purchased the bridge from that corporation in 1909 and in which the Railway Co. joined. These obligations have already been pointed out. They are clearly limited, so far as repairs are concerned, to the surface of the bridge between the rails of a single track and for two feet on the outside of each rail, and, as to the strengthening or altering of the bridge, to making the bridge sufficient for the purpose of running its own street cars over it, and then only during the continuance of that agreement. Neither of these agreements contemplated any obligation on the part of the appellant to strengthen or alter the bridge beyond the requirements of its own single track service. Most assuredly it never contemplated that the Company should be charged with the duty of strengthening or altering the bridge to such an extent as to make it sufficient to endure the increasing load and strain of motor cars and motor trucks and all other traffic. It must be remembered that the Norwood Improvement Co. built and owned the bridge and that the City acquired it from this company, not only with all the latter\u2019s rights under its agreement with the Railway Co., but with the Improvement Company\u2019s obligations under that agreement as well, and that one of these obligations was that if the Improvement Co. should at any time take up the rails or that part of the bridge covered by the rails for the purpose of altering or repairing the bridge or for any other purpose within the province or privilege of the Improvement Co., it should replace them at its own expense; also, that the City, by the supplementary agreement of March, 1909, undertook to make and keep the bridge as a public highway for the free passage of the public and the cars and passengers of the Railway Co.\nThe evidence by no means shews that the stoppage of the car service over the bridge was due to any default on the part of the Company. On the contrary it shews that it was brought about by the report of the City\u2019s own consulting engineer, and points rather to the conclusion that, while the Company was prepared to discharge its obligations in respect of this service, the City itself failed to heed the recommendations of its own engineer and to take any steps to control or curtail the motor and other traffic which was the real cause of rendering the bridge unsafe.\nIt is to be borne in mind too, that no responsibility rests on the Company for the taking down of the old bridge and its replacement by the new one. That responsibility rests wholly on the City of St. Boniface as the owner of the structure, which entered into the agreement with the City of Winnipeg to make the change without the consent or approval of the Company. Had the old bridge remained and been kept safe for a single track street car service, the Company\u2019s liability would have been at most to keep the pavement between its rails and two feet on either side of its track up to the standard of the pavement maintained on the rest of the bridge by the City, and the City, had it removed the railway tracks for any purpose, would have been required, by the express terms of its agreement, to replace them at its own expense. We think that when it took down the entire bridge in the absence of any new agreement with the Company it relieved the latter of any further obligation in respect of its agreement with the former owner in 1904 or with the City itself in 1909, and are quite unable to appreciate upon what ground it can be said that there was any contractual obligation on the part of the Company either to contribute to the cost of the new bridge or to pay for the substitution of a double track over it and its approaches in lieu of the single track on which it maintained its former service. The City may have been fully justified on grounds of public convenience and justice to the residents of St. Boniface, who were dependent on the old service for transportation to and from Winnipeg, in undertaking the construction of the new and larger work, designed for a double track and of a strength sufficient to carry street railway cars twice the weight of the cars which have all along been sufficient for the Company\u2019s traffic in and about Winnipeg, but, failing the negotiation of any new agreement with the Company, the Municipal and Public Utility Board, in our judgment, had no authority under their Act to require these payments from the Company, either as a statutory or contractual liability, or as payments necessitated by the renewal of the former service. Although it may be, as the Board states, that this service was temporarily abandoned because of the condition of the old bridges, the Company cannot fairly be said to be responsible for such abandonment, as already intimated, while the construction of the new and larger bridges was undertaken and carried to completion without any new agreement being entered into with the Company and at a time when it was providing a substituted service with the consent of both municipalities. Even if the Board had power to order a renewal of a former service\u2014the ground upon which the Board states it dealt with the application\u2014we cannot perceive upon what principle it can impose upon the Railway Co. any further outlay than that for which it was liable in the maintenance of such former service. The plans agreed upon between the two cities provided for the construction of both bridges on different alignments than those of the old bridges, necessitating additional expense in the building of approaches and otherwise, and for a double track instead of the former single track. An order requiring the Company to pay the entire cost of placing two lines of railway, ties and foundations, across the whole length of both bridges and one-half the cost of the new approaches, manifestly cannot be justified as an order for the renewal of the old service, with respect to which, under its agreements with the City of St. Boniface, the City agreed, in the event of its removing the rails of the single track, to replace them at their own expense. As regards the City of Winnipeg and the Main Street bridge over the Assiniboine River, the franchise granted to the Company by the City of Winnipeg is found in by-law 543 of that city. S. 12 of this by-law provides that\nThe City shall have the right to take up the streets traversed by the rails, either for the purpose of altering the grades thereof, constructing or repairing drains, or for laying down or repairing water or gas pipes, or for all other purposes now or hereafter within the province and privileges of the City, the same being replaced by and at the expense of the City, without being liable for any compensation or damage that may be occasioned to the working of the railway or to the works connected therewith.\nAlthough it was stated on the argument that there was no definition at that time that a street included a bridge, the Court of Appeal points out that under both the Winnipeg and St. Boniface charters the word \u201cstreet\u201d includes the word \u201cbridge\u201d. In any event, s. 12 of by-law 543 contains practically the same provision in respect of streets as s. 3 of the agreement of 1904 between the Norwood Improvement Co. and the Railway Co. in respect of rails on the Norwood bridge, namely: that if the City should take up any of the streets traversed by the rails of the Company for any purpose within the province or privileges of the City, the same should be replaced by and at the expense of the City\u2014a principle which the Board in its judgment described as not unreasonable.\nThe situation, therefore, with respect to the taking down of the Main St. bridge is practically the same as that with respect to the taking down of the Norwood bridge, Main St. bridge being owned and controlled by the City of Winnipeg, as Norwood bridge was owned and controlled by the City of St. Boniface.\nReliance was placed, in behalf of the City of Winnipeg, upon s. 15 of by-law 543, which gives the council the right by written notice served on the Company to demand the construction of any new line or lines within the city limits on any street or streets. This section seems to have no application, however, to the present question, for the record does not shew that there was any demand made by the council upon the Company for the construction of any new line of railway, and certainly there was no obligation upon the Company either to build or to share in the cost of building of a new bridge under any provision in the by-law. In point of fact, the appellant had its tracks on Main St. South between the two bridges and over the old Main St. bridge when it was taken down. There is, then, no more ground for the contention that there was any contractual liability upon the part of the Company to the City of Winnipeg, as the owner of the Main St. bridge, to provide new tracks over that bridge and approaches thereto, than there is for the contention that there was such liability to the City of St. Boniface to provide new tracks over the Norwood bridge and approaches thereto.\nThe matter seems to be one calling for the negotiation of a new agreement between the two cities and the appellant company. Failing such an agreement between the parties, it will then be for the Board to say whether, in view of all the circumstances and the financial position of the Company, it is justified in ordering the Company to operate a new service over these bridges in lieu of the service which the Company substituted for the former service across the old bridges with the consent of the City, and if the promised revenues from such new service and the financial condition of the Company warrants the Company in assuming any financial responsibility therefor.\nIn the meantime the Board\u2019s order must be set aside and the appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Guy, Chappell, Duval & McCrea.\nSolicitor for the respondent, City of Winnipeg: Jules Prudhomme.\nSolicitor for the respondent, City of St. Boniface: F.

(In re Swire, 30 Ch. D. 239; Ainsworth v. Wilding, [1896] 1 Ch. 673; MacCarthy v. Agard, [1933] 2 K.B. 417, and other cases, cited.)\nMOTION for re-hearing of an appeal (treated by the Court, as stated in the judgment, as a motion praying the Court to amend its judgment).\nThe defendants had appealed to this Court from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the plaintiffs' letters patent for new and useful improvements in processes of drying and apparatus therefor were valid and had been infringed by the defendants.\nBy the judgment of this Court, delivered on June 16, 1933, a new trial was ordered in the terms of the reasons for judgment, which reasons (delivered by Hughes J., with whom the other members of the Court, Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ., concurred) were as follows :\nThe respondents brought this action against the appellants for the alleged infringement of a patent.\nWe are all of opinion that the peculiar circumstances of the case require that the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada should be vacated and set aside, and that the appellants should be permitted to supplement the present record by adding to paragraph 10 of the amended particulars of Objections, sub-paragraphs (v) and (w) as set forth in the notice of motion dated the 26th day of June, 1931, which may be found at page 8 of the case; and also by adding further evidence in regard thereto. Counsel for the appellants consented, if a new trial were granted for the above purposes, to waive their remaining arguments on this appeal as to absence of subject matter, as to anticipation and other matters, reserving, of course, their full rights to urge these and all other defences on the new trial and on any appeal therefrom.\nNothing in this judgment is intended to be an approval or disapproval of any of the findings of the learned trial judge.\nIf either party desires any further amendment, application therefor may be made to the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe costs of the last trial will be costs in the cause. The costs of this appeal will be costs to the appellants in any event of the cause.\nThe judgment was drawn up and duly entered.\nSubsequently the plaintiffs (respondents) made the present motion.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., and R. S. Smart, K.C., for the motion.\nW. F. Chipman, K.C., contra\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET, J.-The respondents apply for a re-hearing of this appeal on the following grounds:\nthat the reasons for judgment and the formal judg\u00adment failed to provide the usual terms for such orders as settled in the case of Baird v. Moule's Patent Earth Closet Co. [2] as set out in the report of Edison Tele\u00adphone Co. v. India Rubber Co.[3], and followed in subsequent cases;\nthat the reasons overlooked the statement of counsel for the appellants made at the trial before the Exchequer Court that they did not intend to put in any further evidence with regard to the amendment they sought to add to the particulars, and consequently the costs of the appeal should not have been paid by the respondents.\nIn our view, this is not matter for re-hearing. In effect, it is a motion praying the Court to amend its judgment. Treating it as such, we find the situation to be as follows:\nJudgment was delivered by this Court on the 16th June, 1933, setting aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and directing that the appellants have leave to supplement the record by adding to the particulars of objections PRESENT: Duff, C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ. further particulars set forth in the notice of motion dated 26th June, 1931, before the Exchequer Court; also giving leave to add further evidence in regard thereto. Subse\u00adquently the judgment was drawn up and duly entered. In fact, the respondents in this Court petitioned His Majesty the King in Council for special leave to appeal from the judgment; and, on 27th November, 1933, the petition for leave was dismissed with costs.\nThe question really is therefore whether there is power in the Court to amend a judgment which has been drawn up and entered. In such a case, the rule followed in Eng\u00adland is, we think,-and we see no reason why it should not also be the rule followed by this Court- that there is no power to amend a judgment which has been drawn up and entered, except in two cases: (1) Where there has been a slip in drawing it up, or (2) Where there has been error in expressing the manifest intention of the court (In re Swire[4] ; Preston Banking Company v. Allsup & Sons [5] ; Ainsworth v. Wilding[6]). In a very recent case (MacCarthy v. Agard[7], the authorities were all reviewed and the principle was re-asserted. In that case, although, in-deed, all the judges expressed the view that the circum\u00adstances were particularly favourable to the applicant, but because neither of the conditions mentioned were present, the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that it had no power to interfere. (The rule as stated was approved by the Privy Council in Firm of R.M.K. R.M. v. Firm of M.R.M. V.L.[8]).\nThe respondents' application does not come under the so-called slip rule. Nor is it apparent that. some matter which should have been dealt with in the reasons has been overlooked; and, in our view, the minutes as settled accord with the judgment pronounced by the Court. Any doubt which might have subsisted on those points must have been made clear by the discussion before their Lordships of the Privy Council and the order made upon the petition for special leave to appeal.\nThe case involves the validity of a patent. A question of that nature concerns not only the immediate parties; it concerns as well the public to a large extent (Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Goodrich Co. Ltd.[9]). Bearing that in mind and in order to get at the real merits of the question, the Court exercised its powers under secs. 47 and 49 of the Supreme Court Act; and a perusal of the reasons shews that the order was intended to be made in the form of the minutes as settled and as interpreted by the Privy Council with regard to the right of both parties to adduce further evidence. Except as to costs of the appeal, which were granted to the appellant on account of circumstances which, in the reasons, are stated to have been \"peculiar \", the judgment of this Court does not prevent the Exchequer Court from adopting the form of order as settled in the case of Baird v. Moule's Patent Earth Closet Co.[10], should the respondents elect before it to abandon the suit, as a consequence of the amendments which have been allowed.\nThe motion will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smart & Biggar.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n[1] [1932] Ex.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1933: November 9; 1934: January 26.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Injury to employee\u2014Cause of the accident\u2014Liability of employer\u2014Circumstances when he is exonerated\u2014\u201cReasonable precautions\u201d\u2014Articles 1053 and 1054 C.C.\nUnder the terms of article 1054 C.C., an employer is exonerated from his responsibility for the damage caused to his employee \u201cby things he has under his care\u201d if he can establish that the accident has occurred in such circumstances that no reasonable precautions on his part could have prevented it. Quebec R.L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry ([1920] A.C. 662) and City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott Ltd. ([1922] 2 A.C. 555) foll.\nIn order to ascertain if such \u201creasonable precautions\u201d had been taken, the court must, in a case between employer and employee, ask itself whether the facts in evidence, in themselves or in the inferences properly arising from them, establish that the occurrences which caused the damage complained of would not fall within the risks reasonably foreseeable by an employer applying himself to the matter of the safety of his employees, under a proper sense of his duty in that respect. If the facts in evidence are such as properly to satisfy the tribunal of fact that this proposition has been established, then the exonerating paragraph (art. 1054 C.C., par. 6) applies and the employer has brought himself within its terms.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\u2014Upon the evidence in the record, it is impossible to find any reasonable means which the respondent might have employed to prevent the abnormal fact which caused the damage.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Martineau J. and dismissing the appellants\u2019 action.\nThe facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nCharlemange Rodier K.C. for the appellant.\nC. A. de L. Harwood K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the conclusion expressed by my brother Cannon negativing the liability of the respondents, the Canadian National Railway Co., and with the substance of the reasons, as I understand them, which he has assigned for that conclusion.\nThere are certain elements of the reasons which govern the determination of the appeal to which I shall devote a few sentences of my own.\nThe appellants, en reprise d\u2019instance, are children of Absolon Colpron who, while in the employ of the Canadian National Railway Company, met with an accident on the 20th of June, 1927, of which he died on the 28th of July following. The appellants\u2019 claim was for $10,000 damages for loss of support in consequence of the death of their father under arts. 1053, 1054 and 1056 C.C. The victim was struck by a flying plank (thrown by mechanical action), one of the utensils or appliances in use in the work in which the victim was engaged at the time of the accident. Art. 1054 C.C., the application of which is involved in the consideration of the appeal,\nestablishes a liability, unless, in cases where the exculpatory paragraph applies, the defendant brings himself within its terms. There is a difference, slight in fact but clear in law, between a rebuttable presumption of faute and a liability defeasible by proof of inability to prevent the damage. (Quebec Ry. L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[1].\nThe conditions giving rise to this defeasible liability are (Vandry\u2019s case, p. 675),1 that a certain thing was under the defendant\u2019s care, and[2] that the plaintiff was hurt by it. The question of the existence of these conditions need not detain us. The immediate and direct cause of the death of the workman was the impact of the flying plank upon the workman\u2019s body, which occurred in the employer\u2019s shop in the course of the employment of the victim. The plank, as already mentioned, was one of the appliances or utensils used by the employer in the workshop for the purpose of the work there being carried on; and was thrown by mechanical action. I am satisfied that the plank was a thing in the company\u2019s care and under their control when it started upon its flight which terminated with the blow from which Colpron\u2019s death ensued; but I do not stop to discuss the point,\u2014it may be assumed as against the company.\nWe now turn to a consideration of the clause of the article which provides for the exoneration of the defendant in certain circumstances. That clause is textually in these words,\nThe responsibility attaches * * * only when the person subject to it fails to establish that he was unable to prevent the act (le fait) which has caused the damage.\nIn the City of Montreal v. Watt and Scott, Ltd.2, the Judicial Committee, speaking through Lord Dunedin, placed upon this clause an authoritative interpretation. The passage in which that interpretation occurs, so far as now pertinent, is in these words.\nIf, therefore, the storm in question could be described as a cas fortuit * * * there would, in their Lordships\u2019 view, have been a case where the exculpatory paragraph would have applied.\nArticle 1054 C.C. is of wide scope and applies to many classes of cases. In what I am about to say, it must be understood that I am considering the application of this defeasance paragraph in a case of the kind which we have now before us, in which a claim is made against an employer under art. 1054 C.C. on the ground that something in his care has been the cause of injury to one of his employees.\nIt is not open to dispute that the language of the Judicial Committee just quoted embraces and, indeed, actually contemplates a case in which \u201cthe damage complained of\u201d has occurred in such circumstances that no reasonable precautions on the part of the employer could have prevented it. Nor do I think there is any room for controversy as to what \u201creasonable precautions\u201d means as applied to an issue raised by such a claim. I think one must put oneself in the position of an employer assumed to be both prudent and competent and to have applied his mind seriously to the risks of harm to which his employees might be exposed in the course of their employment. Then, I think, one must ask oneself whether the facts in evidence, in themselves or in the inferences properly arising from them, establish that the occurrences which caused the damage complained of would not fall within the risks reasonably foreseeable by such an employer so applying himself to the matter of the safety of his employees, under a proper sense of his duty in that respect. If the facts in evidence are such as properly to satisfy the tribunal of fact that this proposition has been established, then I think the exonerating paragraph applies and the defendant has brought himself within its terms.\nIn the present case there is some doubt, unfortunately, as to the precise effect of the findings of the lamented Mr. Justice Martineau who tried the case in the Superior Court. I shall assume that there is no finding in the courts below against the appellants\u2014a manner of looking at the case which I think is most favourable to them. Assuming there are no findings, one must consider the facts oneself for the purpose of eliciting an answer to the interrogatories already indicated; and one must approach the examination of the facts much as a competent jury would do.\nI have given the case the most anxious consideration and have come to the conclusion that the respondents have neglected no precaution, and have disregarded no risk, which one could find to have been reasonably appropriate or reasonably foreseeable. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCannon, J.\u2014L\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en recouvrement de dommages soufferts par Albert et Marguerite Colpron, enfants de feu Absolon Colpron, victime d\u2019un accident du travail le 20 juin 1927, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Depuis l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, savoir le 31 mars 1930, Albert Colpron est devenu majeur et, \u00e0 la demande du procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a repris ou continu\u00e9 l\u2019instance qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e par son tuteur pour l\u2019exercice de ses droits. Le procureur des appelants avait comparu pour lui, le 17 octobre 1932, dans les d\u00e9lais d\u2019appel \u00e0 cette cour. Nous pouvons, nonobstant les objections de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, consid\u00e9rer que Albert Colpron est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant nous comme partie appelante aux lieu et place du tuteur dont les fonctions ont cess\u00e9 et lui permettre, en cons\u00e9quence, d\u2019y faire valoir les droits ci-devant exerc\u00e9s par son tuteur.\nLe p\u00e8re des appelants, le 20 juin 1927, travaillait comme journalier \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au transbordement de pi\u00e8ces de fer d\u2019un hangar, dans le port de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 des wagons de l\u2019intim\u00e9e longeant ledit hangar. Ces pi\u00e8ces de fer en forme de poutres pesaient trois tonnes chacune et avaient une longueur variant de quarante \u00e0 cinquante pieds et une largeur de sept \u00e0 huit pouces. Les instruments dont Colpron et ses compagnons devaient se servir pour cette op\u00e9ration, sous la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019un contrema\u00eetre du nom de Renault, \u00e9taient un bloc de bois que l\u2019on pla\u00e7ait au bout de la poutre d\u2019acier et sur lequel on appuyait un madrier de bois de douze pieds de long pour servir de levier pour soulever la poutre de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l\u2019entourer d\u2019une cha\u00eene dont on se servait pour le transbordement. Au bout de cette poutre se trouvait une cavit\u00e9 o\u00f9 l\u2019on introduisait le madrier sur lequel deux des compagnons de Colpron pesaient pour soulever la pi\u00e8ce d\u2019acier suffisamment pour permettre \u00e0 Colpron d\u2019introduire en dessous la cha\u00eene en question. En cette occasion l\u2019on proc\u00e9da comme d\u2019habitude. Les t\u00e9moins Paris et Harvey, apr\u00e8s que Colpron e\u00fbt ceintur\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce d\u2019acier avec la cha\u00eene, la laiss\u00e8rent retomber sur la cha\u00eene au-dessus du bout du madrier sans retirer ce dernier. A ce moment, un bout de la poutre en acier reposait sur une autre poutre en m\u00e9tal et l\u2019autre partie sur la cha\u00eene. Harvey et Paris laiss\u00e8rent le madrier pour aller s\u2019occuper du \u201cchain block\u201d \u00e0 une distance de vingt \u00e0 vingt-quatre pieds pour continuer l\u2019op\u00e9ration. Dans cet intervalle, alors qu\u2019aucun des ouvriers ne touchait soit au levier, soit au bloc, soit \u00e0 la cha\u00eene, soit \u00e0 la poutre, cette derni\u00e8re fit un mouvement, et ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 la loi de la pesanteur, frappa le bout du madrier, le lan\u00e7a dans l\u2019espace, infligeant \u00e0 Colpron un coup dont il mourut \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital cinq semaines plus tard.\nL\u2019action, qui est en recouvrement de $5,000 pour chacun des demandeurs, \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois sur les articles 1053 et 1054 du code civil. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019action pour les consid\u00e9rants suivants:\nConsid\u00e9rant que les ouvriers occup\u00e9s audit travail n\u2019ont pu donner qu\u2019une seule explication de l\u2019accident; c\u2019est que la cha\u00eene avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise autour de la poutre d\u2019une mani\u00e8re un peu l\u00e2che, que quelques mailles \u00e9taient les unes sur les autres, qu\u2019elles auraient gliss\u00e9 sous le poids de la poutre qui elle-m\u00eame aurait oscill\u00e9 suffisamment pour donner un contrecoup au madrier;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la faute d\u00e9terminante de l\u2019accident serait alors la n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9funt lui-m\u00eame;\nConsid\u00e9rant, cependant, que si cette explication n\u2019est pas accept\u00e9e, la cause d\u00e9terminante de l\u2019accident serait inconnue;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le fait pour Les deux ouvriers en question d\u2019avoir laiss\u00e9 le bout du madrier sous la poutre alors qu\u2019elle reposait solidement sur un autre, ne constituait pas un acte de n\u00e9gligence, ce madrier ne pr\u00e9sentant pas alors et ne pouvant pr\u00e9senter aucun danger quelconque;\nConsid\u00e9rant d\u00e8s lors que la d\u00e9fenderesse ne saurait \u00eatre responsable dudit accident en vertu de l\u2019article 1053;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les demandeurs ne peuvent non plus invoquer l\u2019article 1054, ledit accident n\u2019\u00e9tant pas le fait autonome de la chose, mais le fait de ceux qui venaient de man\u0153uvrer lesdits madrier, poutre et cha\u00eene;\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision avec les dissentiments du juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et de M. le juge Rivard, qui, tous deux, auraient condamn\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour n\u00e9gligence dans la conduite de cette op\u00e9ration.\nAvec respect, je crois que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence du fait dommageable d\u2019une chose dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait la garde. Suivant les termes de l\u2019article 1054 C.C., tel qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Quebec Ry. L. H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[3], Lord Sumner nous dit qu\u2019il suffit au demandeur de prouver: premi\u00e8rement qu\u2019une chose \u00e9tait sous la garde du d\u00e9fendeur; et, deuxi\u00e8mement que cette chose lui a caus\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice, pour imposer \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense le poids de la preuve qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nLe Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Watt Scott Ltd.[4], a compl\u00e9t\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision en ajoutant qu\u2019il suffisait de prouver que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019avait pu emp\u00eacher le dommage \u201cpar des moyens raisonnables\u201d.\nNous croyons que toutes les choses inanim\u00e9es sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00e9chapper au contr\u00f4le et \u00e0 la garde mat\u00e9rielle de l\u2019homme, m\u00eame celles qui sont \u201cinertes\u201d. Ces derni\u00e8res, en effet, demeurent soumises aux lois physiques, \u00e0 l\u2019action des forces naturelles (pesanteur, vent, etc.). Sous l\u2019empire de ces forces, elles peuvent \u00e9chapper \u00e0 l\u2019action de leur gardien; elles ne lui ob\u00e9issent plus; il y a \u201cfait de la chose\u201d et non \u201cfait de l\u2019homme\u201d.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous pouvons conclure que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un fait dommageable caus\u00e9 par une chose qui a \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 la garde de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui l\u2019a laiss\u00e9e inerte dans une position telle qu\u2019ob\u00e9issant aux lois de la pesanteur, elle est tomb\u00e9e sur le madrier, blessant mortellement Colpron. D\u00e8s que la victime ou ses repr\u00e9sentants ont \u00e9tabli que la chose a \u00e9chapp\u00e9 au contr\u00f4le de son gardien, il ne reste \u00e0 ce dernier qu\u2019une ressource: d\u00e9montrer la cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re; faute de la victime, cas fortuit ou force majeure. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019est pas ni\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait le contr\u00f4le et la direction des choses qui ont caus\u00e9 le dommage. Ce pouvoir juridique lui permettait et ne permettait qu\u2019\u00e0 elle seule d\u2019exercer, ou de faire exercer par autrui, la garde mat\u00e9rielle de la chose.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas trouv\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement que l\u2019accident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la victime ellem\u00eame. Il nous dit:\nC\u2019est lui-m\u00eame qui avait pass\u00e9 la cha\u00eene autour de la poutre, et quand il eut fini il donna ordre aux deux hommes de la descendre, ce qu\u2019ils firent, laissant probablement le bout du madrier en dessous de la poutre. Ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore rendus \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 \u00e9tait suspendue la seconde cha\u00eene que le madrier, brusquement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 par un mouvement quelconque de la poutre, vint frapper le p\u00e8re des demandeurs.\nQu\u2019est-ce qui a pu occasionner ce mouvement de la poutre solidement plac\u00e9e sur une autre et qui y est rest\u00e9e? Une seule explication a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e; c\u2019est que la cha\u00eene avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise autour de la poutre d\u2019une mani\u00e8re un peu l\u00e2che, que quelques mailles \u00e9taient les unes sur les autres, qu\u2019elles auraient gliss\u00e9 sous le poids de la poutre, qui elle-m\u00eame aurait oscill\u00e9 suffisamment pour donner un contre-coup au madrier.\nDe ce qui suit, il me para\u00eet que si la faute d\u00e9terminante de l\u2019accident n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par le d\u00e9funt lui-m\u00eame, il faut dire qu\u2019elle est au moins inconnue, mais dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, la d\u00e9fenderesse ne serait pas responsable.\nNous croyons, avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait erreur en imposant aux appelants le poids de la preuve. Au contraire, c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la poutre avait \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 son contr\u00f4le par la faute de la victime ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pu \u201cpar des moyens raisonnables, emp\u00eacher\u201d cette perte de contr\u00f4le. Mais peut-on lui reprocher de ne pas avoir pris les moyens de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019accident, s\u2019il lui \u00e9tait impossible de pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019un pareil concours de circonstances pourrait amener le mouvement de cette poutre ou de la cha\u00eene? Apr\u00e8s avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, sans accident, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, il \u00e9tait invraisemblable qu\u2019une poutre de trois tonnes, plac\u00e9e au-dessus d\u2019une autre poutre reposant sur elle avec cette cha\u00eene, tomberait sur ce madrier de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 le projeter dans l\u2019espace. Nous croyons \u00eatre en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un pur accident; et, comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, l\u2019on ne saurait dire que, par des moyens raisonnables, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu \u00e9viter cet accident. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il ressort de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve que rien ne pouvait faire pr\u00e9voir cette perte de contr\u00f4le de la chose; et, en cons\u00e9quence, il serait impossible d\u2019indiquer par quel moyen raisonnable l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu emp\u00eacher le fait anormal qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nIl est bon de remarquer qu\u2019il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 la Cour de suppl\u00e9er d\u2019elle-m\u00eame comme susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre adopt\u00e9s des moyens qui n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s ni d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, ni de l\u2019autre, au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate et sur lesquels les parties n\u2019ont eu aucune opportunit\u00e9 de s\u2019expliquer. Toute conclusion qu\u2019on pourrait en d\u00e9duire ne s\u2019appuierait sur aucune preuve. Dans une question de cette nature, la Cour n\u2019est pas en \u00e9tat d\u2019ajouter d\u2019office ses propres vues \u00e0 celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nIl nous faut donc renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Rodier & Rodier.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Beckett & Harwood.\n[1] [1920] A.C. 662, at 677.\n1 [1920] A.C. 662, at 677.\n[2] [1922] 2 A.C. 555.\n2 [1922] 2 A.C. 555.\n[3] [1920] A.C. 662, at 675.\n[4] [1922] A.C. 555, at 563.\n"}

(32 Vict., c. 11), of suspending clause in Act or Ordinance of legislature of British possession \u201cregulating (its) coasting trade\u201d\u2014Construction of regulations\u2014Effect of non-publication of later substituted regulation in Canada Gazette (Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, s. 301).\nRegulations 4 and 12 of those brought into force by Order in Council of April 17, 1883, which regulations 4 and 12 were made under ss. 13 and 125 (3) of the Customs Act, 1877 (40 Vict., c. 10, Dom.), and provided, inter alia, that an officer of customs might go on board a coasting vessel and if any goods had been unladen therefrom before the master had reported to a customs officer, the goods and vessel should be forfeited, etc., and that no goods should be put out of any coasting vessel while on her voyage by river, lake or sea, were legally operative, notwithstanding that the procedure described by s. 4 (1) of The Merchant Shipping (Colonial) Act, 1869, Imp. (32 Vict., c. 11), requiring that an Act or Ordinance of the legislature of a British possession regulating its coasting trade should contain a suspending clause providing that the Act or Ordinance should not come into operation until Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure thereon had been publicly signified in the British possession, was not observed. The matters dealt with in said ss. 13 and 125 (3) of the Customs Act, 1877, and said regulations 4 and 12 were not \u201cregulation of the coasting trade\u201d within the meaning of said s. 4 (1) of the Imperial Act of 1869.\nThat s. 4 (1) of the Imperial Act of 1869 was not intended to apply to matters such as those dealt with in ss. 13 and 125 (3) of the Dominion Customs Act, 1877, or in said regulations, is indicated by its context, the effects and unreasonableness of a contrary construction, and especially from the circumstances in which it was passed. The Imperial Act of 1869 should be construed as an enabling statute creating legislative powers which did not previously exist, powers subject to prescribed conditions and exercisable according to a prescribed procedure. A statute of such a character, or even fairly capable of being so construed, should not be applied in such a way as to impose conditions upon the exercise of the plenary authority which had been conferred by the B.N.A. Act, 1867, upon the Dominion to legislate in respect of customs.\nThe word \u201cgoods\u201d in the phrase \u201cor if any goods had been unladen therefrom\u201d in said regulation 4 should not be construed as limited to dutiable goods or goods prohibited or smuggled (mentioned previously in said regulation). By Order in Council of May 31, 1901, the regulations of April 17, 1883, were amended by rescinding regulation 12 and substituting a new regulation 12, which new regulation was not published in the Canada Gazette as required by what is now s. 301 of the Customs Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42). Held, that the part of the Order in Council rescinding the old regulation could not be severed from that part enacting the new one; the Order in Council was, in substance, an amendment of the existing regulations and, as such, fell within s. 301; if any part of the amendment did not take effect by reason of non-publication, then the whole was inoperative; the present case stood to be decided on regulations 4 and 12 as they stood under the Order in Council of 1883.\nJudgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1934] Ex. C.R. 1, holding that the regulations in question, and the statutory provisions authorizing them, never became effective, and that the seizure of the vessel in question could not be maintained, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the seizure of the steamship Vedas could not be maintained, and that the steamship should be released to its owner, the claimant (the present respondent).\nThe steamer Vedas is a British ship registered at Halifax, Nova Scotia, the registered owner being the claimant (respondent), which is a British company incorporated under The Nova Scotia Companies Act and has its registered office at Halifax. At all times material to this proceeding the ship was under verbal charter to one Low.\nOn August 16, 1930, the Vedas reported outwards coastwise from Windsor, Ontario, for Montreal, Quebec, with a cargo consisting of 12,900 cases of beer and ale and one ton of steel, and before sailing its master signed a \u201cReport Outwards Coastwise\u201d, which, after setting out particulars, read as follows:\nI, the undersigned, Master of the above-named vessel, do solemnly declare that I am bound for and will proceed directly to the Port of Montreal and that I will not, during the said voyage, touch at any foreign port, nor take on board, nor land, nor put off from said vessel any goods liable to Customs duty or other Revenue Impost, before arriving at the above-named port of destination.\nBetween August 16 and August 30, 1930, after the Vedas had sailed from Windsor, and before she had arrived at Montreal, approximately 8,900 cases of the said beer and ale were put out of the vessel and lightered or transhipped. The vessel, after said Report Outwards Coastwise from Windsor, did not proceed directly to the port to which she was bound and the 8,900 cases of beer and ale were put out of the vessel and unladen as aforesaid while on her said voyage, without permit of the Collector or proper Officer of Customs. On August 30, 1930, the Vedas with her remaining cargo of approximately 4,000 bags or cases of beer and ale was seized by customs officers on Lake Erie about 20 miles southwest of Erieau, by reason of the matters and things above set forth, and upon such seizure was brought to Windsor, and the seizure reported to the Commissioner of Customs in accordance with s. 171 of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 42. Notice of seizure was given in accordance with s. 172 of said Act, which notice was in Department Form K. 30 and read in part as follows:\nThat contrary to the requirements of the Customs Act and Coasting regulations, the said vessel after report outwards coastwise from the port of Windsor, Ont., bound for Montreal, Que., on or about the 16th day of August, 1930, did not proceed directly to the port whither bound as declared; that goods were put out of the said vessel and unladen therefrom while on her voyage without permit of the Collector or proper officer of Customs and before report by the Master to a Customs officer; and that goods were carried contrary to the Customs Act and Regulations made by the Governor in Council.\nNo penalties were paid and the vessel was detained under s. 245 of the Customs Act. The value of the vessel was appraised by a duly qualified appraiser at approximately $50,000.\nThe matter came before the Exchequer Court by way of a reference by the Minister of National Revenue under s. 174 of the Customs Act.\nBy Order in Council of April 17, 1883, regulations were made respecting the Coasting Trade of Canada. These regulations were duly gazetted in the Canada Gazette. Secs. 4 and 12 of these regulations were as follows:\nSec. 4. The master of any such vessel or boat shall produce his licence to any officer of Customs, whenever the same shall be demanded, and answer all questions put to him, and such officer of Customs shall be at liberty to go on board any such coasting vessel when he may deem proper, and if he should find any dutiable goods therein which have not been entered at the Customs, or any prohibited or smuggled goods, or if any goods had been unladen therefrom before the master had reported to a Customs officer the goods and vessel shall be forfeited, and the master shall incur a penalty of $100.\nSec. 12. No goods can be carried in any Coasting Vessel or Boat, except such as are laden to be so carried at some port or place in Canada, and no goods shall be taken into or put out of any Coasting Vessel or Boat while on her voyage by River, Lake or Sea. By Order in Council of May 31, 1901, the regulations made by Order in Council of April 17, 1883, were amended by rescinding s. 12 and substituting a new s. 12 which read in part as follows:\n12. No goods shall be taken into or put out of any coasting vessel or boat, while on her voyage by river, lake or sea, without permit of the Collector or proper officer of Customs.\nThe substituted regulation was, however, never published in the Canada Gazette.\nBy the judgment now appealed from, Maclean J. held that the regulations in question never became effective, as neither they nor secs. 13 and 125 of the Customs Act of 1877 (Dom.) (40 Vic., c. 10), under which they were made, were enacted in the form required by the Imperial Act of 1869, The Merchant Shipping (Colonial) Act, 1869 (32 Vict., c. 11), as they did not contain the suspending clause required by s. 4 (1) of the said Imperial Act and they were never approved of and proclaimed as required by that Act. (Secs. 4 and 5 of the said Imperial Act of 1869 are set put in the judgment now reported).\nIt was contended on behalf of the Crown (appellant) that the provisions of the said Imperial Act of 1869 did not apply to ss. 13 and 125 of the said Customs Act of 1877, or to the regulations in question; that the Imperial Act of 1869 was by its very terms an enabling and not a restricting Act; its object was clearly not to restrict the power of the Dominion with regard to customs legislation or customs regulations, but to confer power under certain conditions upon the Dominions to legislate with regard to a matter previously withheld from them, namely, the ships to be engaged in the coasting trade; that the regulations in question were in reality customs regulations with regard to the coasting trade, and power over such matters was conferred on the Dominion by the B.N.A. Act, 1867. An argument was also grounded upon s. 151 of the Imperial Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, c. 36, and it was contended that the sanction required thereby would be effectively given when the Governor General assented to a Canadian Customs Act on behalf of the Sovereign.\nIt was also contended on behalf of the Crown that s. 12 of the regulations as amended in 1901 was not ineffective by reason of failure to publish it in the Canada Gazette; that it was not a general regulation requiring publication within the intent of what is now s. 301 of the Customs Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42); that if, however, s. 12 of the regulations as amended never became effective by reason of the fact that it was not gazetted, the amendment was effective for no purpose and could not repeal the original s. 12, which was therefore still in effect and sufficient to justify the seizure and detention in question; and that in any case the seizure and detention could be justified under s. 4 of the regulations, which was not affected by the Order in Council of 1901.\nIt was contended on behalf of the claimant (respondent) that ss. 13 and 125 (3) of the Canadian Customs Act of 1877 and the regulations made thereunder were regulation of coasting trade within the meaning of the said Imperial Act of 1869, and as the Canadian Act did not contain a suspending clause and Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure thereon was not publicly signified in Canada, the said sections of the Canadian Act and regulations thereunder never came into operation; that regulation 12 as passed by the Order in Council of May 31, 1901, never came into force because of failure to publish it in the Canada Gazette, as required by what is now s. 301 of the Customs Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42); that said Order in Council was effective to rescind regulation 12 as it then stood, even though the new regulation 12 did not come into operation; that regulation 4 in question could not support the seizure because the words \u201cany goods\u201d (in the phrase \u201cor if any goods had been unladen therefrom\u201d etc.) in the regulation must be read as meaning dutiable or prohibited or smuggled goods, in the light of the earlier portion of the regulation and the wording of the forms of the \u201cReport Outwards Coastwise\u201d and the \u201cReport Inwards\u201d; and it was conceded that the goods on the Vedas were not dutiable or prohibited or smuggled goods; that regulation 4 was not applicable to goods unladen from a coasting vessel \u201cwhile on her voyage by river, lake or sea\u201d (the words in regulation 12) but was intended to apply only to a coasting vessel while in port; that regulation 4 was ultra vires in so far as it purported to impose forfeiture of a vessel of the value of $400 or upwards.\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal was allowed and the claim of the respondent dismissed with costs throughout. J. McG. Stewart K.C. for the appellant.\nA. W. Greene K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014We shall consider presently the view advanced that this case does not fall within the regulations in question, (4) and (12), brought into force by the Order in Council of the 17th of April, 1883. The important question is whether or not these regulations are legally operative. The learned President of the Exchequer Court has held they are not so, on the ground that the statute under which they were promulgated (ss. 13 and 125 (3) of c. 10, 40 Vict.) had no legal effect because the procedure described by c. 11, 32 Vict., The Merchant Shipping (Colonial) Act, (1869), s. 4 (1), was not observed.\nIt is, perhaps, most convenient to reproduce verbatim ss. 4 and 5 of the statute of 1869. They are as follows:\nCoasting Trade\n4. After the commencement of this Act the legislature of a British possession, by any Act or Ordinance, from time to time, may regulate the coasting trade of that British possession, subject in every case to the following conditions:\n(1) The Act or Ordinance shall contain a suspending clause, providing that such Act or Ordinance shall not come into operation until Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure thereon has been publicly signified in the British possession in which it has been passed.\n(2) The Act or Ordinance shall treat all British ships (including the ships of any British possession) in exactly the same manner as ships of the British possession in which it is made.\n(3) Where by treaty made before the passing of this Act Her Majesty has agreed to grant to any ships of any foreign state any rights or privileges in respect of the coasting trade of any British possession, such rights and privileges shall be enjoyed by such ships for so long as Her Majesty has already agreed or may hereafter agree to grant the same, anything in the Act or Ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding.\n5. The following sections of The Customs Consolidation Act, 1853, are hereby repealed; namely,\nSection three hundred and twenty-eight as from the commencement of this Act:\nSection one hundred and sixty-three as from the date in the case of each British possession at which either an Act or Ordinance with respect to the coasting trade made within two years after the commencement of this Act in such British possession comes into operation, or if there is no such Act or Ordinance, at which the said two years expire.\nThe controversy as to the validity of the regulations, as it was envisaged by the learned President, turns almost entirely upon the point whether the contention of the respondents is well founded that, in enacting sections 13 and 125 (3) of the Customs Act of 1877, the Dominion Parliament was, as a condition of the validity of the legislation, required to observe the procedure laid down in s. 4(1) of the Act of 1869, in respect of Acts and ordinances falling within the statute; in conformity with which the Act or ordinance must contain a suspending clause providing that it shall not come into operation until Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure thereon has been publicly signified in the British possession in which it has been passed.\nIt will be desirable at the outset to understand clearly what it is that the respondents put forward as the construction of the enactment of 1869. This is that the procedure laid down in s. 4 (1). was, down to the date of the Statute of Westminster, imperative in respect of all legislation by the Parliament of Canada enacting or sanctioning, as applied to the coasting trade, (we quote from the factum)\nregulations usually made under Customs Acts, dealing with what goods shall be carried in such trade, the reports inwards and outwards which must be made to Customs officers, the examination by Customs officers of a ship, the warehousing of goods unladen from ships, and other matters;\nthat is to say, by the contention of the respondents, an Imperial statute of 1869 subjected the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada with regard to these ordinary matters of customs regulation to this condition, that such regulations must contain the suspending clause prescribed, if they were to be operative in respect of coastwise trade. This, of course, is a very sweeping proposition and the acceptance of it, as the respondents present the argument, would have the effect of invalidating most of the provisions of the Customs Acts passed by the Parliament of Canada since Confederation, as respects their application to the coasting trade.\nThe underlying assumption of the contention of the respondents is that where you have a regulation which in its nature is a customs regulation of the usual character, dealing, for example, with customs entries, with reports inwards and outwards and so on, that applies to the coasting trade, then you have a \u201cregulation of coasting trade\u201d within the meaning of the Act of 1869, which could only be competently enacted or sanctioned by complying with the procedure laid down in the statute.\nOn this point we do not find the argument of the respondents entirely convicing. As a rule, customs regulations do, no doubt, affect trade. It does not follow that every customs regulation applying to goods or ships in overseas trade, in coasting trade or in inland waters trade, is necessarily a regulation of that particular phase of trade within the intendment of a particular statute.\nThe respondents rest their argument upon two Imperial statutes. The Act of 1853, upon which they chiefly rely, is entitled \u201cThe Customs Consolidation Act, 1853\u201d, and deals primarily, of course, and almost entirely with customs matters. There are sections, such, for example, as ss. 163 and 328, which plainly regulate trade directly but the long title of the Act itself which is in these words,\nAn Act to amend and consolidate the Laws relating to the Customs of the United Kingdom and of the Isle of Man, and certain Laws relating to Trade and Navigation and the British Possessions,\nis sufficient evidence that, in legislative practice, the distinction is not overlooked between legislation in relation to customs and legislation in relation to navigation and trade. The line, no doubt, is not drawn with rigour, but it seems an extraordinary procedure to take a section which is obviously a regulation of customs matters, and, merely because it is found in juxtaposition with a section which deals with trade generally, to treat the customs regulation as the evidentiary basis of a definition of the phrase \u201cregulate the coasting trade\u201d in the Act of 1869. There is a group of clauses in the Act of 1853 under the heading \u201cAs to the Coasting Trade of the United Kingdom\u201d and among these clauses there are some which are obviously customs regulations. There are others which deal with trade directly: s. 152, for example, prohibits the carriage of goods or passengers coastwise from one part of the United Kingdom to another except in British ships. But one is a little puzzled to find a good reason for holding that a customs regulation under such a heading, and, therefore, presumably a customs regulation specially applicable to the coasting trade, in an Act consolidating the laws with regard to customs, and dealing (inter alia) with customs matters as affecting the coasting trade of the United Kingdom, provides a solid basis for a definition of the phrase we are considering, in the Act of 1869. The statutes referred to by the respondents contain a variety of provisions upon a variety of subjects, but we are quite unable to discover in them anything which would justify the conclusion that the phrase \u201cregulate the coasting trade\u201d necessarily includes minute regulations as to customs entries and the like; or imposes upon that phrase, in the statute of 1869, a reading which requires the procedure of s. 4 (1) to be followed whenever a customs regulation touching matters of detail, such as those mentioned above, is to be amended in any British possession.\nThe Act must, of course, be construed in light of the history of the legislation upon the subjects with which it specifically deals, as well as in light of the circumstances in which it was passed. Subs. 1 of s. 4 must be read together with subss. 2 and 3 and with s. 5. S. 5 repeals two former enactments, s. 163 and s. 328, of the Customs Consolidation Act of 1853. These two sections both deal with the coasting trade in the aspect in which the regulation of it was of importance to the United Kingdom, in respect, that is to say, to the vessels eligible to engage in it. S. 328, which applied to all Her Majesty\u2019s British possessions abroad, enabled Her Majesty, by Order in Council, on petition from a legislative authority of a British possession, to regulate the coasting trade as between two ports of the same possession, or between two possessions, \u201cso far as relates to the vessels in which it is to be carried on The repeal of s. 328 was to take effect from the commencement of the statute.\nS. 163 enacts a prohibition against the carriage of goods or passengers from one port of a British possession abroad to another port in the same possession except in British ships. This section (163) was repealed conditionally, that is to say, as appears from the text above set out, at the expiration of two years from the commencement of the Act, or at the date at which, within that period, an Act or ordinance \u201cwith respect to the coasting trade\u201d shall come into operation.\nWe call attention to this provisoin because it does not seem probable that repeal was to take effect upon the passing of some regulation with respect to some trivial customs matter, which would seem to be the logical consequence of the contention of the respondents. The main purpose of the Act would appear to be to substitute the enactments of s. 4 for the enactments repealed by s. 5; and it seems probable that s. 4 was intended to authorize the regulation of the subject matters of the repealed enactments or cognate subject matters. Subss. 2 and 3 of s. 4, moreover, seem to indicate that the essential character of the legislation is not customs legislation but shipping legislation. It seems a not unreasonable application of noscitur a sociis to read the principal enactment of s. 4 \u201cregulate the coasting trade\u201d in the light of subss. 2 and 3 of that section and of s. 5 and the earlier legislation thereby affected.\nBut there are broader considerations derived from the circumstances in which the statute was enacted which seem to supply a conclusive answer to the argument addressed to us by the respondents.\nThe statute applies to all British possessions, enjoying, it is perhaps needless to say, self-government in varying measure and degree. It seems right to read it, in view of what has been said, as an enabling statute devolving upon local legislatures and legislative authorities powers which they did not previously possess. Observe that, by ss. 163 and 328 of the Act of 1853, which the Act of 1869 replaced by the provisions of s. 4, the legislative authority of a British possession was invested with no legislative power, but only with a status to initiate legislative proceedings by presenting a petition to Her Majesty.\nThe respondents have, as we have mentioned, rested their contention mainly upon legislation of the Imperial Parliament enacted from ten to twenty years before, dealing with customs, navigation and trade. In respect of the particular matter with which we are now concerned, it is of vastly greater importance to take into account the fact that the British North America Act had gone into effect only two years previously. It is true that after the passing of the B.N.A. Act the Imperial Parliament retained the legal authority to enact measures amending the constitutional statute, by limiting the powers thereby vested in the Dominion Parliament, or conditioning the exercise of those powers by imposing upon Parliament a procedure such as that set up by s. 4 (1) of the Act of 1869. We should not, however, be justified in construing Imperial legislation (applying to British possessions generally) enacted after the passing of the B.N.A. Act, as having any such effect unless the intention was not only unequivocally, but precisely, expressed.\nThe jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under the B.N.A. Act in relation to customs is not susceptible of debate.\nThe Imperial Parliament in 1867 conferred on the Parliament of Canada full power to legislate regarding customs.\n(Croft v. Dunphy)[2]. This power is, indeed, explicitly recognized in s. 122 which is in these words,\n122. The Customs and Excise Laws of each Province shall, subject to the Provisions of this Act, continue in force until altered by the Parliament of Canada.\nIt follows from Croft v. Dunphy[3], that the \u201ccustoms laws\u201d in respect of which the Parliament of Canada received full authority in 1867, are not limited to laws imposing customs duties. Nor is it easy to see how the application of the phrase in s. 122 could be limited so as to exclude laws proceeding from the enactments of the Imperial Parliament; although this latter observation does not strictly enter into our decision.\nThere is here a recognition of the plenary authority of the Canadian legislature \u201cto legislate regarding customs\u201d. Nor is there any distinction here or elsewhere in the B.N.A. Act between customs laws affecting overseas trade and those affecting the coasting trade.\nThe Act of 1869 ought, we repeat, for the reasons already explained, to be construed as an enabling statute creating legislative powers which did not previously exist, powers subject to prescribed conditions and exercisable according to a prescribed procedure. A statute of such a character, or even fairly capable of being so construed, ought not to be applied in such a way as to impose conditions upon the exercise of the plenary authority conferred by the B.N.A. Act upon the Dominion to legislate in respect of customs. We are not necessarily concerned with the scope that may properly be given to s. 4(1) in respect of the classes of Acts and ordinances of any British possession that may take effect under the authority of s. 4, and would be incompetent but for the authority conferred by that enactment. It seems clear that, whatever be the scope of that section in that respect, the enactment, being enabling, or capable of being so construed, ought not to be so applied as to prejudice the Dominion of Canada in the exercise of the unqualified powers indubitably committed to her by the constitutional enactment.\nThere are some further considerations in support of our conclusion which it may be worth while to mention. No purpose or object has been suggested, and we can think of none, which, in respect of customs matters, could afford a ground for distinguishing between overseas trade and coasting trade, by fettering the authority of Parliament in one case, and leaving it, as is not disputed, free and untrammelled in the other.\nMore important than this is a consideration which has already been suggested, viz., that it is extremely difficult to discover any purpose or object which could be served by subjecting, in a so-called self-governing country like Canada, customs regulations of the ordinary type to a procedure such as that prescribed in s. 4 (1). It seems incredible that anybody should have thought of requiring the Dominion Parliament to follow such a procedure when amending, in order the better to adapt it to local circumstances, some regulation touching bonded warehouses or reports inward or outward.\nWe have emphasized the argument founded upon the improbability that the British legislature in 1869 would have so qualified the powers of the Dominion Parliament under the B.N.A. Act as the respondents now contend. It should be mentioned, perhaps, that the force of this argument is not in the least weakened by the possibility that there may have been customs legislation (affecting the coasting trade) in force under Imperial enactments which (it might be contended), by virtue of the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, the Canadian Parliament would, notwithstanding the general provisions of the B.N.A. Act, and notwithstanding the explicit terms of s. 122, have been incompetent to amend or repeal (Nadan v. The King[4].)\nNo such legislation has been called to our attention; but assuming such legislation did exist, and that it constituted an obstacle in the way of the complete exercise by the Dominion of its powers of legislation under the constitutional statute, that circumstance could not explain an enactment by the Imperial Parliament virtually amending the B.N.A. Act by imposing on the Canadian Parliament the procedure of s. 4 (1) of the Act of 1869 in respect of all regulations of customs affecting the coasting trade.\nIn this view, there seems to be no ground upon which the regulation of the 17th of April, 1883, can successfully be impeached or the sections of the Customs Act of 1877 under which those regulations were made. Of the last mentioned sections (s. 13 and s. 125 (3) of the Customs Act of 1877), s. 13 empowers the Governor General in Council by regulation to\ndeclare any trade or voyage on the seas, rivers, lakes or waters, within or adjacent to Canada, * * * to be a coasting trade or a coasting voyage within the meaning of this Act * * *\nIt is to be observed that the declaration is to be made for the purposes of the Customs Act. Then, the section goes on to authorize the Governor General in Council to dispense with any of the requirements of the next preceding four sections of the statute and to make further regulations as he may think expedient.\nNow, these four sections of the Act are concerned with matters which are, in substance and, indeed, strictly, customs matters. As to the general power to make further regulations, that power should not be considered to authorize the passing of any regulation inconsistent with s. 1 of ch. 14 of the statutes of 1870 which prohibits goods or passengers being carried from one port of Canada to another except in British ships, or with subss. 2 or 3 of s. 4 of the Imperial Act of 1869.\nAs to s. 125 (3), that, in substance, does not in any pertinent sense differ from s. 13 and the same observations apply.\nTurning to the regulations themselves, ss. 1 and 2 embody the substance of s. 1 of the Canadian statute of 1870 and recognize at the same time the enactments of subs. 3 of s. 4 of the Imperial Act of 1869. The remaining sections, dealing with subject matters within the scope of ordinary customs regulations, are entirely within the competence of the Canadian Parliament under the B.N.A. Act, and, on the view above expressed, are not affected by the Imperial Act of 1869.\nThe Customs Act of 1877 and the regulations made under it, were supported by Mr. Stewart in his argument on behalf of the Crown on another ground. He invokes s. 151 of ch. 36 of the statute of 1876, which was the first general customs consolidation in the United Kingdom after the passing of the B.N.A. Act. That section is in these words,\n151. The Customs Acts shall extend to and be of full force and effect in the several British possessions abroad, except where otherwise expressly provided for by the said Acts, or limited by express reference to the United Kingdom or the Channel Islands, and except also as to any such possession as shall by local Act or ordinance have provided, or may hereafter, with the sanction and approbation of Her Majesty and her successors, make entire provision for the management and regulation of the Customs of any such possession, or make in like manner express provisions in lieu or variation of any of the clauses of the said Act for the purposes of such possession.\nHis contention is that this section impliedly confers authority upon British possessions abroad, with the sanction and approbation of Her Majesty and her successors, to make \u201centire provision\u201d for the management and regulation of customs; and it is argued that, whatever be the effect of the statute of 1869, the statute of 1876 authorizes the passing of the Customs Act of 1877. As to the condition requiring \u201cthe sanction and approbation of Her Majesty and her successors it is contended that, in Canada, such sanction and approbation was effectively given when the Governor General assented to the Act on behalf of the sovereign. We do not think it necessary to consider this argument, although we think it is by no means without force (Attorney-General for Canada v. Cain[5]; Webb v. Outrim[6]).\nWe have still to consider the question whether the present case falls within the regulation. As to that, two points arise. In order to discuss them it is necessary to have the regulations before us. They are in these terms:\n4. The master of any such vessel or boat shall produce his licence to any officer of Customs, whenever the same shall be demanded, and answer all questions put to him, and such officers of Customs shall be at liberty to go on board any such coasting vessel when he may deem proper, and if he should find any dutiable goods therein which have not been entered at the Customs, or any prohibited or smuggled goods, or if any goods had been unladen therefrom before the master had reported to a Customs officer the goods and vessel shall be forfeited, and the master shall incur a penalty of $100.\n12. No goods can be carried in any Coasting Vessel or Boat, except such as are laden to be so carried at some port or place in Canada, and no goods shall be taken into or put out of any Coasting Vessel or Boat while on her voyage by River, Lake or Sea.\nBy regulation 4, there are two cases in which a forfeiture is declared: first, where there are dutiable goods not entered at the customs or prohibited or smuggled goods; and, second, where goods have been unladen from the ship before the master had reported to a customs officer. We cannot agree that goods in the second case can properly be limited to dutiable goods or goods prohibited or smuggled. Indeed, the absence of any expression indicating that goods within the second case are so limited seems to be conclusive on the point. We do not think that the forms can prevail against what appears to us to be the plain construction of the regulation.\nThen it is argued that, by force of the Order in Council of May 31, 1901, regulation 12 and, incidentally, regulation 4, were rescinded and that the regulation which was intended to be substituted never came into force. We do not think that in the regulation of the 31st of May, 1901, it is possible to sever that part of the Order which rescinds the old regulation 12 from that part which enacts the new regulation. We think the Order in Council is, in substance, an amendment of the existing regulations and, as such, falls within s. 301. If any part of the amendment did not take effect by reason of non-publication, then the whole was inoperative.\nWe think the case stands to be decided on sections 4 and 12 as they stood under the Order in Council of 1883. We, therefore, think the Crown is entitled to succeed on the appeal.\nThere will be judgment dismissing the respondents\u2019 claim with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

As a direct result of that judgment, such person may at any time be ordered by the bankruptcy court to make payments to the extent of the liability so fixed (ss. 58 and 59) and, therefore, the amount to which that liability extends is truly the amount involved in the appeal within the meaning of section 108.\nAPPLICATION for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in bankruptcy, Boyer J., and declaring the appellant a contributory of the Joyce Dress Corporation, Limited, in liquidation, for the sum of $2,524.25.\nThe application came before Rinfret J. who dismissed it, holding that, although he had jurisdiction to hear it, no principle of law or matter of public interest was involved such as would justify the granting of the petition.\nB. Robinson for the applicant.\nJ. G. Ahem K.C. for the respondent.\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant was declared a contributory of the Joyce Dress Corporation, Limited, in liquidation, to the amount of $2,524.25, by judgment of the Superior Court (Boyer J.), unanimously confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side). He prays that he be given leave to appeal from that judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThis matter is covered by the Winding Up Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 213). The authority to grant leave is given by section 108 of the Act, which requires that the amount involved in the appeal should exceed two thousand dollars. It was contended by the respondent that, in the premises, no amount was involved, since the decision goes merely to put the name of the appellant on the list of contributories, and does not condemn him to pay any specified sum. On that ground, objection was made to my jurisdiction to hear or to grant the appellant\u2019s petition.\nIn my view, the objection was not well taken. It may be that the judgments do not condemn the appellant immediately to pay a definite sum of money; but their effect is to fix the liability of the appellant as a contributory at the amount of $2,524.25. As a direct result of the judgments, the appellant may at any time be ordered by the court to make payments to the extent of the liability so fixed (sections 58 and 59). The amount to which that liability extends is truly the amount involved in the appeal within the meaning of section 108. The respondent\u2019s objection, therefore, fails.\nIt is not sufficient, however, that the amount involved in the appeal should exceed two thousand dollars, the appellant must get \u201cleave\u201d. That implies that he must show special reasons in support of the petition, which may not be granted as a matter of course, but only in the exercise of judicial discretion (In the matter of: Ontario Sugar Company)[1]. The object of the enactment is undoubtedly to avoid unnecessary delay and improvident incurring of costs in the winding up of insolvent estates.\nAfter having considered very carefully the record of proceedings in this case, I am unable to convince myself that any principle of law or matter of public interest is involved such as would justify the granting of the petition now presented to me. As I understand the judgments rendered against the appellant without a dissenting opinion, they are based on concurrent appreciations of the special facts of the case rather than on a particular construction of the relevant statutes, or the application of any new point of law.\nThe petition will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1911) 44 Can.

V, c. 9, s. 3\u2014Art. 1184 C.C. P.\nA judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court which had dismissed a petition in revocation of judgment, is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the provisions of section 2 (e) of the Superior Court Act Act. Hudon v. Tremblay ([1931] SCR. 624) discussed.\nOn an appeal from a judgment dismissing a petition in revocation of judgment and merely refusing leave to reopen the case and to \u201creplace the parties in the same position as they were in before the fact which gave rise to the petition\u201d (art. 1184 C.C.P.), there is no \u201camount or value * * * in controversy in the appeal\u201d; and the appellate court lacks in jurisdiction to grant special leave of appeal to this Court per saltum. (Section 37 of the Supreme Court Act).\nThe provision whereby the Supreme Court of Canada may \u201creceive further evidence upon any question of fact\u201d (section 68, Supreme Court Act, as amended by 18-19 Geo. V, c. 9, s. 3), while leaving the matter to the discretion of the Court, may be taken advantage of only \u201con special grounds and by special leave\u201d. An application to adduce further evidence directed solely to affect the credibility of witnesses is clearly not an application of the nature contemplated by the provision of the Act. Moreover, in this case, the question whether the evidence brought out in the petition in revocation could be relied on by the appellant had been finally decided and had become res judicata between the parties. The mere fact that the respondent had offered and paid to the appellant a sum of money (a cheque of $500 not cashed by the latter and offered back by him in his action for $15,000) to compensate for the damages he may have suffered on the condition that he would abandon all right of action he may have, does not constitute in itself an acknowledgment of liability on the part of the respondent. In this case, the appellant cannot succeed on that ground raised in his statement of claim, when all the surrounding circumstances are taken into consideration. (a)\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 53, K.B. 568) aff.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are as follows:\nThe appellant brought an action for damages which he sustained when alighting from the locomotive or coal tender of a train of the respondent company on which he had been stealing his passage and he alleged that the accident had been caused through the sole fault, negligence and violence of the respondent\u2019s employees. Before the issue of the writ, while the appellant was still in the hospital, the respondent company offered to him a cheque of $500 as compensation for the damages he may have suffered and upon the condition that he would abandon all right of action. The appellant accepted the cheque and signed the discharge; but he did not cash it and offered it back to the respondent with his action, asking for its nullity on the ground that he had acted through ignorance and while being gravely ill. The respondent did not insist on any right it may have through such discharge of liability, assenting to its being declared of no value and took back the cheque. The appellant\u2019s action was dismissed with costs by a judgment rendered by the Superior Court at Montreal, on December 26th, 1930, which judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench on April 19th, 1932, from which the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. On November 2nd, 1932, the appellant made a motion before this Court for an order granting a new trial to allow him to produce newly discovered evidence contained in another case in the Superior Court of Quebec between one Lafontaine and the respondent company; or, alternatively, to suspend the hearing of the appeal until the appellant had filed before the Superior Court of Montreal a petition in revocation of the judgment appealed from. Upon the motion, this Court ordered that the proceedings of the appeal should be suspended for fifteen days to allow the appellant to present such petition in revocation, which later on was dismissed by the Superior Court. The appellant then petitioned the appellate court, asking leave to appeal per saltum to this Court from the judgment just referred to, which leave was granted. Such an appeal having been taken by the appellant, the respondent made a motion before the Court to quash for want of jurisdiction, which motion was granted on December 22nd, 1933. The appellant thereupon, on February 16th, 1934, again petitioned this Court asking that he be allowed to join with the present appeal the record in the Lafontaine case already referred to which had been filed with the petition in revocation in the Superior Court and asking also for a final adjudication on his motion presented on November 2nd, 1932. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed this petition on March 2nd, 1934, and the main appeal on March 15th, 1934.\nMOTION by the respondent to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal per saltum, upon leave granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nC. Dessaulles K.C. for the motion.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appeal in the original action between the parties is now pending before this Court.\nBefore the appeal was inscribed for hearing, the appellant moved this court, on 2nd November, 1932, for an order allowing him to file, so as to form part of the record, certain evidence given in another case bearing number 6230 of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, district of Beauharnois, between one H. Lafontaine and the respondent. The ground for the application was that such evidence had a bearing on his own case, that it was of a conclusive nature and that it had only been discovered by the appellant after judgment rendered against him. Upon that motion, the court ordered that the proceeding of the pending appeal should be suspended for fifteen days to allow the appellant to present a petition in revocation of judgment in the Superior Court.\n(a) Reporter\u2019s note: The decision of the appellate court on that point has been favourably commented upon by La Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil, 1933, p. 560. The appellant availed himself of the order and presented the petition in revocation to the Superior Court at Montreal, where Mr. Justice Philippe Demers, after \u201chaving heard the parties, examined the proceedings and upon the whole deliberated,\u201d dismissed the petition in revocation, or requ\u00eate civile, on the merits, for the reason, amongst others, that the alleged new evidence, even if admitted, was not of a conclusive nature and it was not shewn that it would probably have changed the result.\nThe appellant thereupon petitioned the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), asking that he be allowed to appeal per saltum to this court from Mr. Justice Demers\u2019 judgment, and leave to appeal per saltum was granted.\nThe respondent now moves to quash for want of jurisdiction. A motion of that character must of course succeed upon any proper ground, raised by the court proprio motu, even although not advanced by the parties.\nThe power to grant leave of appeal per saltum is given to the highest court having final jurisdiction in the province in which the proceedings were originally instituted by section 37 of the Supreme Court Act, as amended by c. 24 of statute of Canada, 20-21 Geo. V.\nOne of the conditions for the application of section 37 is that the judgment appealed from should be a final judgment; and it was suggested at bar that the judgment dismissing the requ\u00eate civile was only interlocutory.\nWe think, however, that the judgment comes within the terms of the definition of a final judgment in section 2 (e) of the Supreme Court Act. In this connection, the appellant was entitled to rely on what was said by this court in Hudon v. Tremblay[1], although perhaps it should be pointed out that the dictum, therein referred to, of Lord Esher\u2019s judgment in Salomon v. Warner[2], would no longer be considered as correctly expressing the test adopted in England for ascertaining whether an order is final or interlocutory, in view of other and later pronouncements, not cited to us and to which our attention was not drawn in Hudon v. Tremblay. See: Bozson v. Altricham Urban District Council[3]. But another condition of section 37, and which is also an essential requisite of the power to grant special leave of appeal per saltum, is that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal should exceed the sum of $2,000. For that purpose, the amount or value depends, not on what is claimed in the action, but on what may be contested in the proposed appeal (Dreifus v. Royds[4]; Jack v. Cranston[5]). Now, the matter in controversy in the appeal on the requ\u00eate civile is whether the case ought to be reopened in order to allow the appellant to adduce the alleged new evidence. That this is not appreciable in money is concluded by our decision in Gatineau Power Company v. Cross[6] and in Tremblay v. Duke-Price Power Company[7].\nIt follows that, in our view, no amount is involved in what may be contested in the appeal on the requ\u00eate civile, and, as a consequence, that the Court of King\u2019s Bench was lacking in jurisdiction in this case to grant to the appellant special leave of appeal per saltum. The motion to quash should therefore be allowed with costs.\nThis, of course, should be without prejudice to the recourse, if any, which the appellant might yet possess before the Court of King\u2019s Bench against the judgment of Mr. Justice Demers\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[8] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal, Archer J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action for damages.\nC.

Elle portait uniquement sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait accorder \u00e0 l\u2019un des principaux t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nNous f\u00fbmes unanimes \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qu\u2019une preuve de cette nature ne pouvait constituer un des motifs particuliers pour lesquels la cour peut, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion et par permission sp\u00e9ciale, recevoir plus ample preuve sur une question de fait (art. 68 de la loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame, tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9 par les statuts du Canada 18-19 George V, 9). Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il y avait d\u2019ailleurs deux autres motifs pour refuser la permission que demandait l\u2019appelant:\nEn ce qui concerne la preuve faite dans l\u2019autre cause entre d\u2019autres parties, la demande \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 contenue comme conclusion alternative dans une motion ant\u00e9rieure de l\u2019appelant. La cour avait alors permis \u00e0 ce dernier de se pourvoir au moyen de la requ\u00eate civile. A cette fin, elle avait suspendu les proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019appel en d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle r\u00e9servait de se prononcer sur les autres conclusions alternatives au cas o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant ne pr\u00e9senterait pas sa requ\u00eate civile en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. La requ\u00eate civile ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, entendue et jug\u00e9e, il n\u2019y avait plus lieu pour cette cour d\u2019adjuger sur les autres conclusions de la motion.\nEn ce qui concerne la demande d\u2019\u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 verser au dossier toutes les proc\u00e9dures de la requ\u00eate civile, cette question, suivant nous, \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9finitivement r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le fait que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure refusant de maintenir la requ\u00eate civile \u00e9tait devenu final. Ce jugement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la nouvelle preuve invoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant ne pouvait affecter le litige. L\u2019appelant tenta d\u2019amener le dossier de la requ\u00eate civile devant nous au moyen d\u2019un appel per saltum; mais l\u2019appel fut rejet\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut de juridiction, avec r\u00e9serve \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de se pourvoir devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, s\u2019il en avait encore le droit et s\u2019il le jugeait \u00e0 propos. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ce droit qui lui \u00e9tait ainsi r\u00e9serv\u00e9. La cons\u00e9quence est que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure rejetant la requ\u00eate civile est devenu d\u00e9finitif. Il ne pouvait plus \u00eatre question d\u2019accueillir la demande de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019effet de recevoir ici, comme faisant partie de l\u2019appel, le dossier de la requ\u00eate civile. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait jug\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9tendue preuve nouvelle qu\u2019elle invoquait n\u2019\u00e9tait pas concluante et que, m\u00eame si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en temps, le r\u00e9sultat n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent (art. 1177-505 C.P.C.). Sur ce point, d\u00e8s lors, il y avait chose jug\u00e9e entre les parties.\nDans les circonstances, l\u2019appelant a d\u00fb soumettre son appel sur le dossier originaire, et le r\u00e9sultat ne pouvait faire aucun doute. Il d\u00e9pendait exclusivement de la d\u00e9cision sur les faits rapport\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moignages. A la suite d\u2019une preuve contradictoire, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi furent unanimement d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations. Sans doute, nonobstant ce r\u00e9sultat, l\u2019appelant avait le droit de porter sa cause en appel devant cette cour; mais, en vertu d\u2019une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, il ne pouvait esp\u00e9rer obtenir l\u2019infirmation des deux jugements concordants \u00e0 moins de nous d\u00e9montrer dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve une erreur particuli\u00e8re et \u00e9vidente. Nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire cette d\u00e9monstration.\nIl reste cependant un moyen soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant et sur lequel nous croyons devoir faire une observation.\nA la suite de l\u2019accident, et alors que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, la compagnie lui a offert un ch\u00e8que pour la somme de $500 en \u00e9change duquel l\u2019appelant lui a consenti une quittance de toute r\u00e9clamation et droit d\u2019action et l\u2019a lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de toute responsabilit\u00e9 en dommages.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas encaiss\u00e9 le ch\u00e8que. Au contraire, il l\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 avec le rapport de son action; et, dans sa d\u00e9claration, il all\u00e8gue que la quittance a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue de lui alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop malade pour en comprendre la port\u00e9e; qu\u2019elle est donc entach\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9; et demandant acte de l\u2019offre qu\u2019il fait du ch\u00e8que, il conclut \u00e0 ce que la quittance soit annul\u00e9e. Tout en refusant d\u2019admettre que cette quittance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie dans des conditions qui la rendaient annulable, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas insist\u00e9 sur son droit de faire valoir cette quittance. Dans sa plaidoirie, elle a accept\u00e9 de reprendre le ch\u00e8que et consenti \u00e0 ce que la quittance f\u00fbt tenue pour non avenue. L\u2019appelant invoque maintenant le geste de l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme un aveu de responsabilit\u00e9 et demande que, de ce seul fait, elle soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer les dommages qu\u2019il a prouv\u00e9s.\nSur ce point, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure s\u2019est content\u00e9e de dire que, dans les circonstances, il n\u2019y avait plus lieu d\u2019adjuger sur la validit\u00e9 de la quittance; et la Cour du Banc du Roi a refus\u00e9 d\u2019y voir \u201cabsolument rien qui comporte un aveu\u201d.\nNous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. Pour qu\u2019un acte ou une d\u00e9claration puisse \u00eatre regard\u00e9 comme un aveu, il faut qu\u2019il comporte l\u2019intention de reconna\u00eetre comme l\u00e9galement av\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait auquel il s\u2019applique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la pens\u00e9e que celui au profit duquel il a eu lieu se trouvera, en l\u2019invoquant, dispens\u00e9 de prouver les faits qui en forment l\u2019objet (Larombi\u00e8re, Obligations, tome 7, sur l\u2019article 1354, n\u00b0 3; Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., tome 12, page 107, \u00a7751).\nNaturellement, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le paiement constitue une admission que la somme est due. Mais cela s\u2019entend surtout d\u2019une obligation liquide dont la cause n\u2019est pas discut\u00e9e. Il n\u2019en r\u00e9sulte cependant pas une d\u00e9duction in\u00e9luctable, puisqu\u2019un paiement fait dans certaines conditions pr\u00e9vues aux articles 1047 et 1140 du code civil est sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. En plus, le seul fait de se charger, par un motif de compassion, des frais d\u2019h\u00f4pitaux ou de m\u00e9decins de la victime d\u2019un accident ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement une admission de responsabilit\u00e9. La chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 souvent jug\u00e9e. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la quittance ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re pas aux motifs qui ont pouss\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 faire \u00e0 l\u2019appelant la remise de la somme de $500. Mais le repr\u00e9sentant de la compagnie, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage en a donn\u00e9 l\u2019explication suivante:\nI gave consideration to paying the man anything on his own request. He wanted to know if I could pay him anything to help him out. He did not have any money. His home was not here, and he had no money, and for that reason, more than anything else, I gave consideration to paying him something. It was more in the way of charity.\nEn outre, il ressort des termes de la quittance que le montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019il renonce \u00e0 tout droit d\u2019action.\nIci, l\u2019appelant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir souffert des dommages s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 au del\u00e0 de $15,000. La disproportion entre cette somme et le montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert indique en elle-m\u00eame que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019entendait pas reconna\u00eetre et payer la r\u00e9clamation. L\u2019offre qu\u2019elle a faite est plut\u00f4t compatible avec le motif pour lequel le repr\u00e9sentant de la compagnie d\u00e9clare avoir agi. Son t\u00e9moignage indique d\u2019ailleurs qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit \u00e0 agir de cette fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la sollicitation de l\u2019appelant lui-m\u00eame et que ce dernier savait \u00e0 quoi s\u2019en tenir sur l\u2019intention de la compagnie lorsque la somme lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise. L\u2019acte de la compagnie n\u2019est s\u00fbrement pas un aveu expr\u00e8s. Il pourrait tout au plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un geste ambigu susceptible de diff\u00e9rentes interpr\u00e9tations. En soi il ne constitue pas n\u00e9cessairement un aveu tacite. Les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce conduisent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu aveu de responsabilit\u00e9; et, suivant nous, la Cour du Banc du Roi a eu raison de les interpr\u00e9ter comme indiquant une offre faite \u201cpar un sentiment d\u2019humanit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la malheureuse victime et aussi en vue de s\u2019exempter les ennuis d\u2019un proc\u00e8s avec un insolvable, en d\u00e9boursant environ ce qu\u2019il devrait en co\u00fbter (\u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e) m\u00eame apr\u00e8s une contestation heureuse\u201d.\nEn se basant sur la preuve rapport\u00e9e, l\u2019acte de la compagnie a plut\u00f4t le caract\u00e8re d\u2019une transaction par laquelle les parties pr\u00e9venaient une contestation \u00e0 na\u00eetre (art. 1918 C.C.). Cette transaction ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9e de consentement mutuel, les parties se sont trouv\u00e9es remises dans la m\u00eame situation qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient auparavant. La condition du paiement \u00e9tait que l\u2019appelant renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 ses droits d\u2019action. Il a intent\u00e9 sa poursuite. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e de se d\u00e9fendre devant trois tribunaux successifs. La condition du paiement, ou, si l\u2019on veut, les conditions de l\u2019offre, n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, l\u2019appelant ne peut maintenant retirer aucun b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la transaction qu\u2019il a r\u00e9pudi\u00e9e (Galibert v. Atteaux, Cour de revision[9]). Il ne restait pas d\u2019autre alternative que de le d\u00e9bouter de son action.\nPour ces motifs, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dessaulles, Garneau & H\u00e9bert.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Foster, Place, Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett & Foster.\n[1] [1931] S.C.R. 624.\n[2] [1891] 1 Q.B. 734.\n[3] [1903] 1 K.B. 547.\n[4] (1922) 64 S.C.R. 346.\n[5] [1929] S.C.R. 503.\n[6] [1929] S.C.R. 33.\n[7] [1933] S.C.R. 44.\n[8] (1932) Q.R. 53 K.B. 568.\n[9] (1902) Q.R. 23 S.C. 429, at 435.\n"}

Under the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 238, the appellant city assessed the land on the basis of its potential value as a subdivision, and also assessed for the value of the buildings thereon and for business assessment. The assessments were upheld (with variations in amounts) by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board. The Court of Appeal for Ontario confirmed the assessment of the land alone at the amount fixed by the Board, but struck off the amounts for buildings and for business assessment. The city appealed.\nHeld: (1) The buildings should be assessed only at their value for the purpose of being wrecked and removed, as, except to that extent, they added nothing to the potential value of the land as a subdivision. It was improper to value the land as for purpose of a subdivision and then value the buildings on the basis of their being used for purposes of a race track. (Secs. 4, 40 (1) (2) (3), of the Act particularly considered).\n2. The fact that s. 9 (2) of the Act deals with clubs, and makes liable to a business assessment \u201cevery proprietory or other club in which meals are furnished * * *\u201d does not necessarily exclude all clubs from the operation of s. 9 (1) (j), making liable for business assessment every person carrying on any of certain specified businesses \u201cor any business not before * * * specially mentioned\u201d. The question of whether or not respondent came within s. 9 (1) (j) could only be determined by investigating the facts concerning its organization and its operations; and there was evidence on which the Board could properly arrive at its conclusion that respondent was occupying or using the land for the purpose of a business within the meaning of s. 9 (1) (j), in view of s. 9 (12) which excludes the application of the ejusdem generis rule.\nA corporation\u2019s liability to business assessment in connection with its lands on which it carries on its affairs does not depend on whether or not a profit is being made.\nIn the result, the judgment of the Court of Appeal, [1932] O.R. 637, was varied, by increasing the valuation for assessment purposes by a sum for the value of the buildings for wreckage purposes, and by declaring respondent liable for business assessment (based on the valuation of the property as fixed by this Court). APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which allowed an appeal by the present respondent from the judgment of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board. The Board had fixed the assessment of certain land and buildings thereon (owned by the present respondent) at $765,308, being $565,308 on the land and $200,000 on the buildings, and had fixed a business assessment of $191,325. The Court of Appeal reduced the assessment of the land and buildings to $565,308, being $565,308 (as fixed by the Board) on the land and no amount on the buildings, and also struck out the business assessment.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nC.M. Colquhoun K.C. and J.P. Kent for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and F.W. Fisher for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014This is an appeal concerning the assessment of the respondent\u2019s Woodbine Race Course, situated in the city of Toronto.\nThe Assessor of the appellant, in the year 1931, assessed the respondent, in respect of the 85.88 acres of land owned by the respondent, for $622,630, and the buildings for $202,500, making a total of $825,130. The residence of the Superintendent, with the land on which it was erected, was assessed separately for $4,000, which amount was deducted from the total of $825,130, leaving an assessment of $821,130, to which was added 25 per cent. for business assessment, amounting to $205,282.\nThe respondent appealed to the Court of Revision, which confirmed the assessment except as to the business assessment, which was reduced to $191,385.\nAn appeal was taken to His Honour Judge Denton, who confirmed the decision of the Court of Revision.\nFrom this decision the respondents again appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board, which placed the assessment of the lands used for race track purposes at $565,308, and the buildings at $200,000, making together $765,308, to which was added 25 per cent. for business assess- ment, amounting to $191,325. In addition to these items, there was added an assessment of $4,000 for land and house occupied by the Superintendent, which has not been in dispute.\nThe respondent further appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which confirmed the assessment of the land at the amount fixed by the Ontario Municipal Board, namely, $565,308, but struck off the $200,000 on buildings and the $191,325 for business assessment.\nFrom that judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe Court of Appeal held that, as the assessment on the land fixed by the Ontario Municipal Board was arrived at on the basis of its potential value as a subdivision, which would involve the destruction and removal of the buildings, nothing should be added for the value of these buildings.\nSection 4 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 238, enacts that all real property in Ontario shall be liable to taxation, subject to certain exceptions that have no application to this case.\nSection 40 (1), (2) and (3), reads as follows:\n40. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, land shall be assessed at its actual value.\n(2) In assessing land having any buildings thereon, the value of the land and buildings shall be ascertained separately, and shall be set down separately in columns 14 and 15 of the assessment roll and the assessment shall be the sum of such values. The value of the buildings shall be the amount by which the value of the land is thereby increased.\n(3) To remove doubts it is hereby declared that the cost of a building is only one of the matters which should be considered in ascertaining the amount for which a building should be assessed, and if it is found that a building, either because of its condition as to repair or of its inappropriateness to the location in which it is found or because of any other circumstances affecting its value, increases the value of the land by less than the cost of the building, or the cost of replacing it, such less sum shall be the amount for which the building shall be assessed under subsection 2; the meaning of that subsection being that buildings shall be assessed for the amount of the difference between the selling value of the whole property and the selling value of the land if there were no buildings on it.\nMr. Justice Riddell, in his reasons, says:\nThe actual value is to be determined by the evidence, and, not only the present use of the land and the benefits derived therefrom by the owner, but all the potentialities are to be taken into consideration.\nHe cites a long list of authorities for this proposition, which has been accepted and acted upon by both sides throughout and was not questioned here. On this prin- ciple the City Assessor, Mr. Harry Nixon, states in his evidence that he assessed the lands of the respondent on the basis of their potential value as a subdivision, and not on the basis of their value as now used by the respondent, as a race course; and neither he nor any other witness gave any evidence as to the value of this land for the purposes of a race course.\nThe whole evidence of both sides before the Municipal Board was directed to establishing the potential value of the land as a subdivision. It was evidently assumed throughout that the highest actual value that could be given to the land was on the basis of its potential value as a subdivision.\nThe Assessor, at p. 179, produced his plan of a subdivision, Exhibit 23, and testified that he made his estimate of the value at which he arrived for assessment on the frontage value of the various lots shown on this plan for building purposes, arriving at these values from the assessed values and sale prices of lands surrounding and in the neighbourhood of the lands of the respondent. On the same page he says, speaking of this plan:\nWe used that in the land revision work to estimate the present assessment.\nAt p. 180:\nThe information that we used, Mr. Geary, has to do with the property surrounding, north and east, of Woodbine Park.\nHe goes on to say that he got the valuations by comparing in that way, and arrived at a total lot frontage of 21,072 feet, and in that way arrived at the value of $791,175, the foot frontage value varying according to the situation of the various lots. At pages 189, 198 and 199 he refers to the use of the land for a going concern as one of the elements to be taken into consideration in arriving at the value, and says he knows \u201cof no other way of arriving at a piece of property, that is, in the city limits.\u201d Finally, however, he abandons this, as shown in the following abstract from his evidence at p. 205:\nExhibit 27. Statement of figures on proposed plan of subdividing Woodbine Park.\nQ. In this you eliminated all the buildings?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And you treat it purely as a subdivision?\nA. Yes. Q. Now, I want to ask you: did you arrive at any figures as a going concern?\nA. No.\nQ. You never adopted that?\nA. No, sir.\nThe learned Chairman of the Municipal Board in his reasons says:\nThere was considerable evidence offered, both by the appellants and by the City of Toronto, setting out the way in which the assessment of this property had been originally made, and setting out the value of the property both for race track purposes, and as a subdivision in the City of Toronto in the event of the racing being abandoned and the property sold as a subdivision.\nI am unable to find any evidence from any witness as to the actual value of this property for race track purposes, and it is evident that the value fixed by the Board was on the evidence offered as to its potential value as a subdivision, there being no evidence that would justify the finding of value arrived at on any other basis. The Board, therefore, having arrived at its valuation of these lands on the basis of a subdivision, which involved the destruction of all the buildings before the land could be used and disposed of in lots as a subdivision, the buildings added nothing to that potential value of the property beyond their value for the purpose of being wrecked and removed. On this branch of the case I am in entire agreement with the reasons clearly set out by Mr. Justice Riddell, and also with his view that the question involved is one of law.\nIt is manifestly improper to value the land for the purpose of a subdivision, which would involve the destruction of the buildings, and then value the buildings on the basis of their being used for the purposes of a race track. If the buildings were to be valued on that basis, the land would have to be valued on that basis also.\nI find that the Court of Appeal has overlooked the evidence at p. 95 as to the value of the buildings for wrecking purposes, and it was not, I think, referred to on the argument here. The witness, Joseph Teperman, called by the respondent, examined as to the cost of wrecking and removing the buildings and the value of the wreckage, says:\nWe would take the entire site and we would still be prepared to pay $5,000. Q. For all the buildings?\nA. For all the buildings, everything that is situated on the ground.\nThe CHAIRMAN: Q. So you would lose $5,000 on the one stand and you would make up on the other?\nA. Make up on the other.\nThere should therefore be added to the amount fixed by the Court of Appeal this sum of $5,000 as the value of the buildings for wreckage purposes.\nThe question of whether or not the respondent is liable for business assessment is, perhaps, not so clear. Mr. Colquhoun, on behalf of the appellant, presented a very able argument in support of his contention that the respondent was liable to a business assessment by virtue of sec. 9 of the Act, which reads in part as follows:\n9. (1) Irrespective of any assessment of land under this Act, every person occupying or using land for the purpose of any business mentioned or described in this section shall be assessed for a sum to be called \u201cBusiness Assessment\u201d to be computed by reference to the assessed value of the land so occupied or used by him, as follows:\n(j) Every person carrying on the business of a photographer or of a theatre, concert hall, or skating rink, or other place of amusement, or of a boarding stable, or a livery, or the letting of vehicles or other property for hire, or of a restaurant, eating house, or other house of public entertainment, or of a hotel or any business not before in this section or in clause (k) specially mentioned, for a sum equal to twenty-five per centum of the assessed value.\n(2) Every proprietory or other club in which meals are furnished, whether to members or other, shall be liable to a business assessment for a sum equal to twenty-five per centum of the assessed value of the land occupied or used for the purposes of the club.\nHe argues that the respondent carries on a business, and therefore comes within the language of subsection 1 (j) quoted above, although not expressly mentioned, because the ejusdem generis rule does not apply, by virtue of sec. 9 (12) which reads as follows:\n(12) Wherever in this section general words are used for the purpose of including any business which is not expressly mentioned, such general words shall be construed as including any business not expressly mentioned, whether or not such business is of the same kind as or of a different kind from those expressly mentioned.\nIt seems clear that the mere fact that an organization styles itself a club will not finally settle the question of whether or not it is liable to assessment under subsection 1 (j).\nThe Ontario Jockey Club is an incorporated company having a fixed capital represented by stock shares issued to stockholders in the ordinary method. There is in the organization a system by which people who are not stock- holders may become what is called \u201cmembers\u201d of the club, endowing them with certain privileges at race meetings, and perhaps on other occasions, not accorded to the public. These members, however, have no voice in the management of the corporation affairs. The race meetings are carried on and managed by the corporation. The moneys received for admission to the races from the parimutuel betting system and from other sources are all paid to the corporation, and are applied and paid out as the corporation directs. The earnings or profits derived from these race meetings or any other uses to which the property of the corporation may be put may be applied to payment of dividends to the shareholders if the corporation so determine. The evidence is that for the past two years there have been no profits, so that dividends could not properly be paid except out of accumulated surplus, and none have been paid during these two years. Whether any were paid in preceding years is not disclosed.\nIt is clear that the question of whether or not a corporation is liable for business assessment in connection with the lands occupied by it, upon which its affairs are carried on, does not depend on whether or not a profit is being made. A corporation, or an individual, for instance, carrying on a mercantile business in a shop, is liable to business assessment, quite regardless of whether the business is realizing a profit or not.\nIt is no doubt a question of law whether or not sec. 9 (2) quoted above, dealing with clubs, necessarily excludes all clubs from the operation of sec. 9 (1). Having concluded, as stated above, that sec. 9 (2) is not conclusive upon this point, the question of whether or not this particular club comes within the provision of sec. 9 (1) can only be determined by an investigation of the facts concerning its organization and the operations which it carries on. It seems to me that there is evidence upon which the Municipal Board could properly arrive at the conclusion which it reached, that the respondent was occupying or using the land in question for the purpose of a business within the meaning of sec. 9 (1), in view of the provisions of subsection 12, which excludes the application of the ejusdem generis rule. The appeal, therefore, upon this point must be allowed. The valuation of the land for asssessment purposes, fixed by the Court of Appeal, will be increased by the $5,000 referred to, and upon that valuation the respondent is declared liable for business assessment, as provided by the statute.\nThe appellant was obliged to come to this Court, and is entitled to its costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed, as above set forth, with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.M. Colquhoun.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ludwig, Shuyler & Fisher.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 637; [1932] 4 D.L.R. 423.\n"}

APPEAL (by special leave granted by a judge of this Court) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which reversed the judgment of Sedgewick J.[2] who made an order declaring that all salary in excess of $100 per week as may be received by or owing to the debtor (the present respondent, who had made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act) is from the time or times such excess is received by or becomes owing to the debtor, the property of the debtor divisible among his creditors and from such time or times vests in the trustee for creditors, and ordering that the debtor pay to the trustee such excess of salary forthwith after the same is received by the debtor, until the claims of his creditors and the trustee\u2019s costs have been fully satisfied. (The order also permitted to the debtor a reference as to the propriety of the amount allowed for maintenance of himself and his family, and reserved leave to the debtor and to the trustee to move at any time to vary the order in the event of a change in the debtor\u2019s situation with respect to salary.)\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was allowed and the order of Sedgewick J. restored, with costs to the appellant in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and J.H. Greenberg for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The respondent, the Assistant General Manager of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors on 3rd December, 1932, and the appellant was subsequently appointed trustee. Creditors\u2019 claims amounted to $23,033.69, and the sole asset disclosed was $100 cash on hand.\nThe respondent, under examination, stated that he is in receipt of a salary of $10,000 a year, paid to him in amounts of $196 each week. On the 2nd day of February, 1933, upon the application of the trustee, an order was made by the Hon. Mr. Justice Sedgewick in Chambers, containing the following provision:\nIT IS DECLARED that all salary in excess of $100 per week as may be received by or owing to the said debtor (until the claims of his creditors and the costs of the said trustee have been fully satisfied) is from the time or times such excess is received by or becomes owing to the said debtor, the property of said debtor divisible among his creditors and from such time or times vests in Edward Guy Clarkson as trustee for said creditors AND IT IS ORDERED ACCORDINGLY.\nAND IT is FURTHER ORDERED that the said debtor do pay to the said trustee such excess of salary forthwith after the same is received by the said debtor, until the claims of his creditors and the costs of the said trustee have been fully satisfied.\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the order with costs, and from that decision the present appeal is taken.\nThe Court of Appeal, purporting to follow its own decision in Re Rung[3], sets out that it was there held that the earnings of a bankrupt by the exercise of his personal skill are not within the Act as property to be distributed amongst his creditors. The authorities cited in the reasons for that decision are: Ex parte Benwell, In Re Hutton[4], and In re Jones, Ex parte Lloyd[5].\nIn the former case the bankrupt was a bonesetter, earning a large amount each year from fees. It is pointed out that his earnings were dependent on the accident of whether people come to consult him or not, and upon whether he chooses to be consulted, and it was held that the trustee was not entitled to any order.\nThis case was followed in the case of In re Jones, Ex parte Lloyd5, where the bankrupt was a workman employed in a colliery company, and was earning about 25s. a week. Cave, J., referring to the Benwell case4, says that\ninasmuch as he (the bankrupt) was not entitled to receive that money with respect to any particular period, such as a year or some part of a year, irrespective of the amount of work he did, the money so received was not \u201cincome\u201d, ejusdem generis with \u201csalary\u201d.\nThe reasons in Re Rung[6] show that, upon the above authorities, the case was made to turn upon the uncertainty of the earnings of the debtor, and at p. 560 there is the following statement:\nNor do I go into the wide question whether, under our Act, subsequent \u201csalary, income * * * * or compensation\u201d is ever assets for the trustee\u2014such enquiry is unnecessary. The case of Hamilton v. Caldwell[7] is expressly distinguished on the ground that in that case the bankrupt was entitled to a salary at the rate of \u00a3500 per annum, and was receiving that salary with respect to the year, irrespective of the amount of work he did, and consequently the money so received was properly to be taken by the trustee. It is therefore evident that the present case is distinguishable from the case of Re Rung[8], because here the debtor is in receipt of a definite yearly salary, as in the case of Hamilton v. Caldwell7.\nThe further reason advanced by the Court of Appeal in this case is, that we are not bound by decisions in Scotland, Ireland and the English Court of Appeal, and that our laws are to be interpreted in the sense in which, we believe from the language employed, the legislature intended; and it is pointed out that words may have a certain meaning in England and a different meaning here.\nIt is necessary, however, to examine the exact language of the Bankruptcy Act, and, by the application of the ordinary rules of construction, having regard to decisions binding on us and the reasoning of decisions not strictly binding, to determine the two neat questions raised in this appeal.\nWe have been referred to a long list of cases decided under the various English Bankruptcy Acts from time to time in force, many of which do not directly touch the precise points here in question, which are, whether or not future unearned salary passes to the trustee in bankruptcy by virtue of sec. 23 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 11, and, if they do pass, whether or not it is competent to make such an order as is in question here.\nSection 23 defines property of the debtor divisible amongst his creditors and sets out that it shall comprise\n(a) All such property as may belong to or be vested in the debtor at the date of the presentation of any bankruptcy petition or at the date of the execution of an authorized assignment, and, all property which may be acquired by or devolve on him before his discharge.\nThe corresponding section of the English Act of 1869 is 15 (3), carried into the Act of 1883 as sec. 44 (i), and into the Act of 1914 as sec. 38 (a). Sec. 15 (3) of the Act of 1869 reads as follows:\n(3) All such property as may belong to or be vested in the bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy, or may be acquired by or devolve on him during its continuance. The only change in the wording in the two later Acts is the substitution for the concluding words \u201cduring its continuance\u201d of the words \u201cbefore his discharge.\u201d Sec. 23 (a) of our Act would seem to have exactly the same meaning and effect as the corresponding section in the English Acts, unless there is something in our Act indicating a distinction.\nIn many early cases in England it is laid down that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, a bankrupt may sue for his personal earnings if the trustee does not interfere, but that any amount recovered beyond what is reasonably necessary for the support and maintenance of himself and family will belong to the trustee.\nChippendall v. Tomlinson[9]; Silk v. Oshorn[10]; Kitchen v. Bartsch[11]; Coles v. Barrow[12].\nIn the argument in Chippendall v. Tomlinson9, the following from Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, Vol. 2, p. 485, was relied on:\nThe property vested in the assignees is the whole that the bankrupt had in himself at the time he committed the first act of bankruptcy, or that has been vested in him since, before his debts are satisfied or agreed for.\nIn Kitson v. Hardwick[13], Willes J. quotes from Smith\u2019s Mercantile Law, 8th Ed., 646, language to the same effect.\nWilliams v. Chambers[14] is a case where the assignee sued for amount owing for personal earnings of the bankrupt, earned during the bankruptcy, which were claimed to be not more than sufficient for maintenance of the bankrupt and his family. On demurrer the action was dismissed on the ground that the pleading claimed the amount as a debt directly due to the assignee, and that, to hold the assignee entitled to recover,\nwe must go the length of deciding that the assignee might, in the words of Lord Mansfield in Chippendall v. Tomlinson[15], let the insolvent out to hire, and contract himself for his personal labour.\nThe reasons refer to\nthe comprehensive words of this section, which would entitle the assignee to recover any debt accruing to the insolvent before his final discharge, either for work and labour or any other cause.\nWadling v. Oliphant[16]. A bankrupt procured employment as editor of a newspaper, and, six years after the bankruptcy, and before his discharge, obtained a judgment for \u00a3104 as six months\u2019 salary in lieu of proper notice of dismissal. Held, that the trustee could claim this money before it was paid to him as against any creditors subsequent to and without notice of the bankruptcy, on the ground that the money was not the proceeds of the bankrupt\u2019s personal labour subsequent to his bankruptcy, but a compensation for the breach of a contract which became a part of his estate in bankruptcy.\nBlackburn, J., points out that Beckham v. Drake[17] decides that such a sum would pass to the assignee where the breach was before the bankruptcy. He goes on to say that it is unnecessary to decide whether, if an undischarged bankrupt were to make a large salary beyond what he could reasonably require for his support, the surplus amount in his possession is or is not protected from his assignee. And Archibald, J., says:\nNow the cases do shew that there is a rule, the extent and limit of which is not exactly defined, by which the bankrupt, after the date of his bankruptcy, may, in certain cases, keep the produce of his personal labour.\nEx parte Vine, In re Wilson[18]. The bankrupt, before his discharge, recovered judgment for \u00a3250 damages for slander, which amount was paid into court. The assignee applied for payment of the amount to him, but the application was dismissed by Bacon, C.J. On appeal, James, L.J., says in his reasons that the general principle always has been that, until a bankrupt has obtained his discharge, all his property is divisible amongst his creditors. But an exception was absolutely necessary in order that the bankrupt might not be an outlaw, a mere slave to his trustee; he could not be prevented from earning his own living.\nIn Ex parte Huggins, In re Huggins[19], the question was as to the right of the trustee in bankruptcy to receive part of the pension of a retired judge of a colony, amounting to \u00a3875 per annum. On appeal from an order made by the Registrar restraining the bankrupt from receiving the moneys payable to him in respect of the pension, the trustee offered to assent to the bankrupt receiving for his maintenance \u00a3350 per annum out of the pension. It was held that the pension was income, coming within the provisions of sec. 90 of the statute of 1869, and that property to be dealt with is not property in the abstract, but property divisible amongst the creditors under the Act, defined by sec. 15 (3), as quoted above. Lindley, L.J., then proceeds to say:\nAll money therefore to which the bankrupt may become entitled in any manner during the continuance of the bankruptcy is within sect. 15. Then, looking a little further, we find a group of sections, sects. 87 to 95, which relate to \u201cproperty devolving on the trustee\u201d. As I understand them, these sections are modifications and qualifications of sect. 15. The different kinds of property with which they deal vest in the trustee, but subject to the modifications and qualifications contained in this group of sections.\nThe reasons of Jessel, M.R., are to the same effect. According, therefore, to this decision, if secs. 87 to 95 were not in the English Act, sec. 15 (3) would vest all the salary and income in the trustee, without any modification. Sec. 90 makes special provision as to salary and income, but there is no such section in the Canadian Act.\nRe Brindle, Ex parte Brindle[20]. The bankrupt was employed as a commercial traveller at a salary of \u00a3100 per year, terminable by a week\u2019s notice. An order was made for payment by him of \u00a320 every year out of such salary. Held on appeal that the order was right, and notwithstanding that the employment was terminable by a week\u2019s notice, sec. 53 (2) of the Act of 1883, which is the same as sec. 90 of the Act of 1869, applies.\nTwo cases are cited to show that an assignment of money to be acquired in future and future debts will be enforced:\nIn re Clarke\u2014Coombe v. Carter[21], approved in the House of Lords in Tailby v. Official Receiver[22], holds that an assignment for value of all moneys which the assignor should become entitled to under a will operates as a contract which the court would enforce.\nTailby v. Official Receiver22 decided, reversing the Court of Appeal, that a security of all book debts due and owing, or which might during the continuance of the security become due or owing, was good as to future debts, though not limited to book debts of any particular business.\nIn re Rogers, Ex parte Collins[23]. The only part of this case that seems to have any bearing is the statement of Vaughan Williams, J., at p. 431, where he says: I conceive that, subject to the rule of not depriving the bankrupt of the means of livelihood, if it be shown that after providing fairly and liberally for the support of the bankrupt there would be a balance of salary, that that balance of salary, even though the salary is a salary for personal exertions, might be made the subject of an order under the 53rd section.\nIn re Shine, Ex parte Shine[24]. The bankrupt had an agreement to act at a theatre for a term of two years at a salary of \u00a330 per week, payable weekly. During the bankruptcy, and before the trustee intervened, he entered into an arrangement with the manager that the manager should buy up his debts and should reimburse himself by retaining \u00a320 a week out of the bankrupt\u2019s salary. It was held that this agreement with the manager was valid, and no order was made.\nIn re Graydon, Ex parte Official Receiver[25], holds that the principles which underlie sec. 53 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883, with respect to the salary or income of a bankrupt, are also applicable to his personal earnings. In each case it is a question of amount, and he will be allowed to retain only such sum as is sufficient for the reasonable maintenance of himself and his family, and the residue will pass to his trustee in bankruptcy. In his reasons, Vaughan Williams, J., says:\nNow it seems to me, on the authorities, that it is not true to say that no personal earnings of the bankrupt after bankruptcy pass to his trustee. The authorities are not very clear; but I think that the balance of the authorities (see Wadling v. Oliphant[26], and cases there cited) shows that it is only the personal earnings reasonably necessary for the maintenance of a bankrupt and his family which do not pass to the trustee.\nIn re Roberts[27]. The bankrupt claimed as personal earnings a quantity of billiard balls that he received under a contract to use this make of balls only in practice. It was held that the assignee was entitled to the balls. Lindley, M.R., in his reasons, says:\nThe alleged exception is not to be found in the Act itself, but is said to be an implied exception based upon a long series of authorities and well recognized for the last hundred years.\nbut he holds that these authorities have no application to the case before him. He reviews the authorities that he mentions, and concludes that the language of sec. 44, clear and express as it is, must not, therefore, be taken so literally as to deprive the bankrupt of those fruits of his personal exertions which are necessary to enable him to live. But on the other hand, the necessity is the limit of the exception. This, he says, is in entire accordance with modern decisions, quoting most of those referred to above, and ending with Benwell\u2019s case[28], which he says turns entirely on sec. 53, and is only an authority for the proposition that a prospective order cannot be made impounding the future personal earnings of a bankrupt. The bankrupt may sue for and recover his earnings if his trustee does not interfere, but what he recovers he recovers for the benefit of his creditors, except to the extent necessary to support himself and his wife and family.\nBailey v. Thurston & Co. Ltd.[29] In this case Cozens-Hardy, L.J., says:\nIt has been established for many years that, notwithstanding the generality of the language used in the Bankruptcy Acts, there are some contracts and some rights that do not vest in the trustee. For the present purpose it is sufficient to mention contracts for purely personal service. Such unexecuted contracts are not assignable by deed, and they are not, by virtue of the statute, vested in the trustee. * * * As to future services, the bankrupt can sue for his remuneration under the contract, subject only to the right of the trustee to intervene and claim the fruits of the litigation.\nAffleck v. Hammond[30]. It was held that, as the money claimed by the bankrupt was his personal earnings, it was excepted from the property passing to the trustee in bankruptcy, and as the whole or part was required for his maintenance, he was not a mere nominal plaintiff, and could not be ordered to give security for costs.\nVaughan Williams, L.J., quotes with approval the language of Cozens-Hardy, L.J., in Bailey v. Thurston[31]. Buckley, L.J., quotes the language of James, L.J., in Ex parte Vine, In re Wilson[32], and the language of Willes, J., in Kitson v. Hardwick[33]. Kennedy, L.J., says:\nBy s. 44 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, the trustee in bankruptcy has a general right to intervene. But on that general right of intervention there has been grafted an exception in favour of the personal earnings of the bankrupt, so far as those earnings are necessary for his support, and this exception has been recognized for at least a hundred years. It is true that the generality of s. 44 is emphasized by the fact that particular things are particularly excluded from its operation; but it is nevertheless clear that the Act does contemplate the possibility of the acquirement by an undischarged bankrupt of future property. Hollinshead v. Hazleton[34] merely decides that the salary of a Member of Parliament is within the meaning of sec. 51 of the Act. There is no corresponding provision in the Canadian Act.\nHamilton v. Caldwell[35]. The appellant Hamilton, at the date of the bankruptcy, was earning, and thereafter continued to earn, under a contract of service terminable on notice, a fixed salary of \u00a3500, his total annual income being \u00a3670. It was held that the instalments of salary, as they accrued from time to time, beyond what was required for his reasonable maintenance, vested in the trustee under sec. 98 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1913 as acquirenda of the bankrupt, and an order was made for payment to the trustee of the instalments of salary receivable in futuro to the extent of \u00a3150 yearly.\nSec. 98 (1) of the Scottish Act reads in part as follows:\n98. (1) If any estate, wherever situated, shall, after the date of the sequestration, and before the bankrupt has obtained his discharge, be acquired by him, or descend or revert or come to him, the same shall ipso jure fall under the sequestration, and the full right and interest accruing thereon to the bankrupt shall be held as transferred to and vested in the trustee, as at the date of the acquisition thereof or succession, for the purposes of this Act; * * *\nThe section, continuing, lays down the procedure to be followed by the trustee to obtain the after acquired property.\nThe order was opposed on two grounds, namely: (1) that the personal earnings of the appellant, after the date of the sequestration, do not pass under the sequestration to the trustee; and (2) that it was not competent to make an order against the bankrupt with reference to any instalments of the salary before they accrued due.\nIn the House of Lords, Viscount Finlay says it was admitted by the counsel for the appellant \u201cthat the personal earnings of the bankrupt would pass to the trustee under sec. 98 (1) when they accrued, subject to the beneficium competentiae;\u201d and that the second ground alone was argued, the ground advanced against the order being that nothing could be done by the court until the trustee\u2019s title had accrued when each instalment of salary had been earned and was payable, and that the trustee should then follow the procedure laid down in sec. 98 (1). He goes on to say:\nThis argument appears to me to overlook the fact that it must be open to the court to take proceedings to prevent the right of the trustee to each instalment as it falls due being defeated by the bankrupt\u2019s receiving and spending the money himself, and that, if there be no such power, there might be a most inconvenient and unseemly scramble between the trustee and the bankrupt as each instalment fell due. The trustee surely might take steps, as any one instalment was about to fall due, for the purpose of preventing the bankrupt from defeating his title by receiving 1 and spending it, and, if he can do it with regard to each particular instalment, there is no principle or law to prevent him from obtaining a general order of this kind for the protection of his title to receive each instalment as it falls due.\nViscount Cave says:\nIt is admitted that there is no precedent for such an order, and the question raised by this appeal is whether there was jurisdiction to make it.\nHe says that a terminable contract for personal services, such as that which is in question in the present case, does not vest in the trustee, and points out that the Scottish Act contains no provision similar to sec. 51 of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883, enabling the court to attach the salary or income of a bankrupt; and, after quoting sec. 98 (1), says that, so long as the bankrupt continues in his present employment, and has not obtained his discharge, each instalment of his salary as it becomes due will fall within the subsection and will be capable of being impounded by an order made under the subsection. He states that sec. 98 (1) does not, according to its terms, authorize the making of such a declaration until after the property has been acquired and notice has been given inviting persons interested, such as new creditors, to appear and object; and expresses some doubt as to the competency to make the order, and finally states that if a similar question should arise under the English Bankruptcy Act, it would be necessary, in view of the observations of Lord Lindley in In re Roberts[36] and the cases there referred to, to consider the matter afresh, with special reference to the English law and practice.\nLord Dunedin discusses the Scottish law, and says:\nI do not think that the point is without difficulty, but, on the whole I am of opinion that the order as made is a competent order. Although each periodical payment is not vested until it becomes due, yet it is known now that such periodical payments will be made from time to time. I would be an almost senseless proceeding that there should have to be a repeated application each time payment became due. He points out that precaution should be taken to guard the interests of others who may be interested in the future earnings, because the trustee\u2019s right is only an inchoate right, which may be defeated by diligence carried through by a subsequent creditor; and that therefore there should be in the order a reservation as to the rights of other persons interested.\nLord Shaw and Lord Wrenbury agree with Lord Dunedin. The latter supports the competence to make the order upon grounds similar to those stated by Viscount Finlay.\nThe language of sec. 98 (1), quoted above, is not, I think, more comprehensive than that of our sec. 23 (a) also quoted, which sets out that the property divisible among creditors is \u201call property which may be acquired by or devolve on him (the bankrupt) before his discharge.\u201d\nSection 2 (ff) of the Canadian statute reads as follows:\n\u201cProperty\u201d includes money, goods, things in action, land, * * *\nThe English decisions referred to above seem to establish beyond any question that, by the language of the English Act, \u201call such property as * * * may be acquired by or devolve on him before his discharge,\u201d the instalments of salary such as are in question here vest in and belong to the trustee as they fall due, subject to the alimentary provisions referred to.\nThis precise language is adopted in the Canadian Act and is not capable of any difference of meaning in Canada from its meaning in England.\nAs already pointed out, there is no section in the Canadian Act, or in the Scotch Act, corresponding to section 90 of the English Act of 1869 (sec. 51 (2) of the Act of 1914) which provides that the court may from time to time make such order as it thinks just for the payment of salary or income of the bankrupt or any part thereof to the trustee during the bankruptcy. As we have seen, however, it is laid down in Ex parte Huggins[37] referred to above, that sections 87 to 95 of the English Act are only modifications! and qualifications of section 15 of that Act, and that, if these sections were not there at all, salary and income would vest in the trustee without any modification, except that which (has been engrafted by the decisions referred to. The meaning and effect of the concluding portion of section 23 (a) of the Canadian Act would therefore seem to be the same as that of the same words in the English Acts, which meaning has been settled, not only by the various decisions in the English Court of Appeal referred to, but also by the decision of the House of Lords in Hamilton v. Caldwell[38]. The latter case, as mentioned above, expressly holds that the instalments of salary, as they become due, vest in the trustee, and lays it down as beyond doubt that the trustee would be entitled to an order as each instalment falls due, the only question being as to the competency to make an order covering all future instalments. While the language of the statute that was being dealt with in that case is different from the language of the Canadian statute, it is not more comprehensive.\nThe decision is that it is competent to the court to make such an order, and this decision is arrived at on the general principles of equity, and not by virtue of any special provisions in the Scottish Act.\nIn Clarkson v. White[39], Boyd, C., held that future earnings, subject to the modification mentioned, pass to the trustee, and made an order accordingly.\nSection 23 (ii) of the Canadian Act provides that the property divisible amongst creditors shall not comprise\nAny property which as against the debtor is exempt from execution or seizure under legal process in accordance with the laws of the province within which the property is situate and within which the debtor resides.\nIn Asselin and Cleghorn[40], it was held that a judgment creditor is not entitled to have a receiver appointed to receive all debts due to the judgment debtor; that section 58 of the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1897, ch. 51, is intended only to confer on the courts the former jurisdiction of equitable execution. This follows Holmes v. Millage[41].\nFuture earnings, therefore, cannot be reached by equitable execution in Ontario, but may be attached after they become due.\nBarry, C.J., K.B.D., New Brunswick, held, in In re Herbert H. James[42], that future earnings do not pass to the trustee, and are exempt within the meaning of sec. 23 (ii) quoted above. I am of opinion that this subsection refers only to property exempt from execution or seizure under legal process by virtue of the Execution Act.\nRiddell, J., is probably right in his view that the Canadian Parliament never contemplated that sec. 23 (a) would have the effect of transferring future personal earnings of a bankrupt to the trustee. The draughtsman copied this section practically verbatim from the English Act, and deliberately left out sec. 90 of the English Act\u2014sec. 51 (2) of the Act of 1914\u2014which deals specially with salary and income. It would seem to be quite probable that he and Parliament, in leaving out that section, were of the impression that they were excluding from the operation of the statute future salary or earnings, and I would willingly adopt that view, if there were proper justification for it. This, however, would be a mere speculation as to the intention of Parliament, in which we are not entitled to indulge. We have, as pointed out, the precise provisions in reference to property to be acquired in future, copied from the English Act, without its modifications, the meaning and effect of which have been settled in England for more than a hundred years. When the Parliament of Canada adopted these provisions, we must, I think, assume that the intention was to apply to them the meaning thus long established.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that it was competent for the Judge in Bankruptcy to make the order in question.\nThe amount allowed to the bankrupt by this order is $100 per week out of his salary of $10,000 per year. No question was raised by either side as to the reasonableness of this amount under the circumstances.\nThe general rule stated in the cases is that the bankrupt is entitled to the fair and reasonable amount required for the maintenance of himself and family according to their condition in life. Lord Esher, in In re Shine[43] referred to, says, at p. 532:\nI think the court ought not to cut down the bankrupt\u2019s means of livelihood too closely, but ought to leave a liberal margin for his support;\nand it will be seen that in the quotation from the reasons of Vaughan Williams, J., in In re Rogers, Ex parte Collins[44], at p. 431, set out above, he speaks of \u201cproviding fairly and liberally for the support of the bankrupt,\u201d while throughout the various judgments in the cases referred to the judges are shocked at the idea of making a slave of the bankrupt. This feeling gave rise to the engrafted rule referred to, and to the remarks of Esher, M.R., and Vaughan Williams, J., as to making the allowance to the bankrupt liberal.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the order restored with costs to the trustee here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mercer, Bradford & Co.\n[1] [1933] O.R. 519; 14 C.B.R. 329; [1933] 3 D.L.R. 422.\n[2] [1933] O.R. 147; 14 C.B.R. 205; [1933] 1 D.L.R. 675.\n[3] (1928) 62 Ont.

The respondent paid the tax computed on the actual selling price; but, claiming that it should have been computed on the current market value of the dressed furs, under the regulation quoted below, the respondent sued to recover the amount alleged to have been overpaid, i.e., it urged that it should have only paid the tax imposed on dyers and dressers who were performing that work for others.\nHeld that the sales made by the respondent were sales within the scope of section 86 of the Special War Revenue Act; and that the tax payable by the respondent should be computed on the actual selling price of the dressed furs and not on its current market value.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1933] Ex. C.R. 59) rev.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J.[1], maintaining the petition of right by the respondent asking that the amount alleged to have been overpaid to the Crown in connection with certain sales tax be refunded.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nThe following regulation was enacted under the Special War Revenue Act, 1915:\nFurriers are not to be granted a consumption or sales tax licence on and after the 1st September, 1924. Licences issued to furriers prior to that date are to be cancelled. Dressers and dyers of furs, however, are required to take out a sales tax licence and account to the Collector of Customs and Excise for consumption or sales tax on furs dressed or dyed by them. Such tax is to be computed on the current market value of the dressed furs whether the dresser or dyer is the owner of the furs or not.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and J. de M. Marler for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The respondents are a company engaged in the business of wholesale dealers in, and dyers and dressers of, raw furs. They purchase raw furs or skins from trappers and other persons, dress and dye these skins and sell them to furriers who make them into fur garments. Occasionally they sell to retailers. Other dyers and dressers in Canada it seems dress and dye furs for furriers, but, as a rule, they are not owners of the furs. The respondents, on the other hand, dress and dye their own furs and resell them. The respondents insist upon the importance of the fact that the furs, in the operations to which they subject them, are neither cut nor \u201ctrimmed\u201d by them, but that they confine themselves to cleaning, combing and dyeing the raw furs.\nThe controversy concerns the basis of taxation, under the Special War Revenue Act, in respect of furs sold by the respondents. Before and after the promulgation of Regulation 17, to which reference will be made hereafter, the respondents held a licence under the Special War Re venue Act (1915) and amendments, in which they were variously described as fur dressers and dyers, and manufacturing fur dressers and dyers. Prior to the passing of the regulation mentioned, they, being licensed in the same form, sold mainly to furriers who were licensed manufacturers, although there were sales also to persons who were not licensees. As regards the former sales, they were, by the proviso of 19BBB (1), exempt from sales tax. As regards the latter, they did not dispute their liability to pay, and did pay sales tax. After the promulgation of the regulation, their customers, the furriers, ceased to be licensees and, consequently, (assuming that s. 19BBB (1) applied to them and that they were liable to pay sales tax thereunder), they continued to pay the tax. Other dyers and dressers, however, by force of the regulation, came under another rule. They, dyers and dressers, that is to say, who performed the work of dyeing and dressing for others, were obliged by the regulation to pay a tax on the \u201ccurrent market value\u201d of the dressed furs. The respondents paid taxes under s. 19BBB (1), or duty on the sale price of the goods. A discrimination was thereby effected, the respondents complain, between them and their competitors, who, being the owners of furs, had them dyed and dressed by dyers and dressers. In practice, it appears that in these last mentioned cases, the market value of the fur was taken by the revenue department to be the cost price of the fur plus the amount paid to the dyer and dresser, and the sales tax at the statutory rate was calculated thereon. The respondents, on the other hand, who paid their tax pursuant to the provisions of s. 19BBB (1), paid upon the price which they charged the purchaser, that is to say, they paid, not only upon the cost of dyeing and dressing and the original cost of the fur, but they paid the tax rate on their profit as well.\nThere appears to be no manner of doubt about the facts, and the primary question is whether or not the respondents are right in their contention that they ought to be taxed upon the same footing as their competitors. The question does not seem to be susceptible of elaborate discussion. Perhaps the most convenient way of putting it is first of all to set out the provisions of s. 86 (a), (b) and (c) and 87 of c. 179, R.S.C. 1927, which contain the material parts of s. 19BBB (1), in respect of which there has been no substantial change:\n86. In addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Act or any other statute or law, there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of four per cent on the sale price of all goods; (a) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him; or\n(b) imported into Canada, payable by the importer or transferee who takes the goods out of bond for consumption, at the time when the goods are imported or taken out of warehouse for consumption; or\n(c) sold by a licensed wholesaler to another than a licensed manufacturer, and (if the goods were manufactured or produced in Canada) the tax shall be computed on the price for which the goods are sold by the licensed manufacturer to the said licensed wholesaler, and the said price shall include the amount of the excise duties on goods sold in bond.\n87. Whenever goods are manufactured or produced in Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for the consumption or sales tax because\n(a) a lease of such goods or the right of using the same but not the right of property therein is sold or given; or\n(b) such goods have a royalty imposed thereon, the royalty is uncertain, or is not from other causes a reliable means of estimating the value of the goods; or\n(c) such goods are manufactured by contract for labour only and not including the value of the goods that enter into the same, or under any other unusual or peculiar manner or conditions; or\n(d) such goods are for use by the manufacturer or producer and not for sale;\nthe Minister may determine the value for the tax under this Act and all such transactions shall for the purposes of this Act be regarded as sales.\nThe first contention on behalf of the respondents is that they are not producers or manufacturers within the meaning of s. 86. Although the point does not in any way govern our decision, we cannot properly proceed to the consideration of the substance of this contention without first observing that if the article sold by the respondents is not an article produced or manufactured in Canada within the meaning of s. 86, it is difficult to understand upon what ground it can be contended that it is an article \u201cmanufactured or produced\u201d within the meaning of s. 87. If the skin or fur as cleaned, \u201cmade pliable,\u201d to use the expression of one of the witnesses, and dyed by them and sold by them, as \u201cmerchantable stock-in-trade,\u201d to use an expression assented to by the principal witness on behalf of the respondents, does not fall within the description \u201c* * * goods produced or manufactured in Canada\u201d (s. 86), it is not, at all events, immediately obvious how it can fall within the description \u201cgoods * * * manufactured or produced in Canada\u201d within the meaning of s. 87.\nFurthermore, there is nothing before us to indicate that the goods, which were the subject of sales in respect of which the respondents paid the taxes now reclaimed, fall within s. 87 (c); that is to say; that they are goods manufactured under contract for labour only, and, indeed, if they are not \u201cmanufactured,\u201d it is difficult to bring them within the verbal frame of s. 87 (c).\nWe are not able to agree with the view advanced by the respondents that these articles sold by them are not within the contemplation of s. 86. The words \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d are not words of any very precise meaning and, consequently, we must look to the context for the purpose of ascertaining their meaning and application in the provisions we have to construe. S. 19BBB (1) gives us some assistance. Goods which are to be used in, or wrought into, or attached to, articles to be manufactured or produced for sale may still be \u201cgoods produced or manufactured\u201d in Canada within the meaning of the section. And the matter is further elucidated by reference to s.s. 4, which enumerates many exceptions. By that subsection, the section shall not apply to \u201csales or importations\u201d of a number of different things. Among these there is a significant item in these words,\npulpwood, tan bark and other articles the product of the forest when produced and sold by the individual settler or farmer.\nThis suggests rather pointedly that the phrase \u201cgoods produced or manufactured\u201d contemplates such things as pulp-wood and tanbark, to which it appears to be assumed the section will apply when produced and sold by others than the \u201cindividual settler or farmer,\u201d by, for example, the holder of a timber berth or licence. Light is thrown upon the meaning of the word \u201cproduced\u201d by the fact that pulp-wood and tan bark and other articles, the product of the forest, are contemplated as being produced within the meaning of the statute. We have further the item \u201cwool no further prepared than washed\u201d which seems to imply that wool still further prepared, by dyeing for example, if sold, comes within the incidence of the tax. Then we have \u201craw furs\u201d which is not without its implication. It is not easy to see why a raw fur which is separated from the animal upon which it grew, when combed, \u201cmade pliable\u201d and dyed and thereby turned into \u201cmerchantable stock-in-trade,\u201d has not become something which is \u201cproduced\u201d if the term \u201cproduced\u201d is properly applicable to such things as \u201cpulp-wood\u201d and \u201ctan bark.\u201d Nor does the case appear to be very different if the operation begins by a purchase of the fur which has already been taken from the animal and ends with the last stage of preparation which fits it to be sold as a fur that can be described as \u201cdressed and dyed.\u201d\nWe think the sales made by the respondents are sales within the scope of s. 86.\nThis seems to be sufficient to dispose of the case. It may be that in working out the statute there has been some regrettable inequality, but the respondents\u2019 claim necessarily rests upon the proposition that they were taxable only under the regulation which we think very plainly is not intended to apply to sales within the contemplation of s. 86.\nAlthough it does not strictly enter into the argument, it may not be out of place to observe that the dyer or dresser who neither owns the fur nor sells the fur, within the proper meaning of the word, is clearly not within s. 86. He may come within s. 87 and, if so, the transaction between him and the owner of the fur, which is not truly a sale at all, is deemed to be a sale for the purposes of the Act. The respondents, as we have already observd, are not shewn to be within s. 87, but, if they are a \u201cproducer\u201d or \u201cmanufacturer\u201d they are within s. 86.\nWe do not think it necessary to express any opinion upon the question of law that might arise for discussion if we had taken a different view of the statute and the regulation.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed but, in the circumstances there should be no costs.\nAppeal allowed, no costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. A. Mann.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. A. Forsyth.\n[1] [1933] Ex. C.R. 59.\n"}

Bills of Exchange Act, ss. 58, 58, 186.\nThe appellant\u2019s and respondents\u2019 mother, suffering since many years from tuberculosis and diabetes, made her will on the 11th of February, 1930, by which she made legacies, by particular title, of $10,000 and $5,000 to each of her children except the appellant, the latter to inherit only of an equal division of the residue of the estate: such partition to take place only \u201cwhen the youngest of the children in the first degree shall have attained the age of majority\u201d, which condition, according to the evidence, was postponing for a number of years the time of the division. The appellant was a widow having four young children and without any means; and, since the death of her husband, was provided for her living entirely through the care of her mother. But at the time of the will the appellant had expressed her intention to re-marry and the mother did not quite agree with her on that point, being of opinion that the wedding had better be postponed, at least for some time; this being the apparent reason for the exclusion of the appellant from the will, it happened that her fianc\u00e9 died, and the mother, being informed of the fact, changed her sentiments towards the appellant. On the 5th of December, 1930, the mother, although gravely ill and aware of her critical condition but with a perfectly sound mind, signed a promissory note in the usual form \u201cfor value received\u201d and payable on demand to the appellant or to her order for $10,000 with interest at 7 per cent; and she delivered the note to the appellant on the same day, with a verbal agreement that the latter would not claim payment before the expiration of four months from the date of the note. The appellant, in her evidence accepted by the trial judge, stated that her mother told her that the note was given to her in order \u201cto provide for her living (and that of her children) after she, herself, had passed away\u201d. The mother died on the 25th of December, 1930, and, four months later, the appellant claimed from the estate the payment of the note which was refused, and then took the present action. The trial judge maintained the action on two grounds, holding that the mother had signed the promissory note in recognition of her legal obligation to provide for her daughter and therefore there was valid consideration; and that the note was also valid as constituting a manual gift. The appellate court dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim on the ground that the transaction evidenced by the promissory note was in truth a donation \u00e0 cause de mort, and, consequently, null and void by force of article 762 C.C.\nHeld that, under the circumstances of this case, the appellant was entitled to recover from the estate of her mother the amount of the promissory note sued upon.\nHeld, also, that it is unnecessary to consider whether there was an \u201cantecedent liability\u201d, within the meaning of s. 53 of the Bills of Exchange Act, which would constitute a valid consideration for the document as a promissory note; or whether the document was enforceable as a promissory note. Rinfret J. expressing no opinion; Cannon J. contra.\nHeld, further, that the document given to the appellant by her mother is sufficient evidence of a contract to pay the sum mentioned according to the terms of it; and, upon the whole of the evidence, this was the true character of the transaction and there was sufficient \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cconsideration\u201d within the meaning of arts. 984 and 989 C.C., to support the legal obligation assumed by the promissor in the obligation naturelle to make a proper provision for her daughter. Rinfret J. expressing no opinion. Per Rinfret J.\u2014The gift which the Civil Code (art. 758) declares invalid and void is the \u201cgift made so as to take effect only after death.\u201d It follows that the gift forbidden by the article is that gift which will become effective only in the case of the death of the donor, which has no effect before such death, and whereby the donee acquires no right until such death.\nIn fact, article 758 C.C. contains a definition. Under the circumstances of this case, the gift in question does not fall within that definition and was not a donatio mortis causa.\nThe provision in article 762 C.C., whereby gifts made during the supposed mortal illness of the donor are presumed to be made in contemplation of death, creates a presumption which may be rebutted by the proof of circumstances tending to render the gifts valid. It does not mean that a real donatio mortis causa may be validated. It means that the donee is entitled to establish that, under the circumstances surrounding it, the gift is not one made in contemplation of death. The consequence is, therefore, that the presumption is completely rebutted when the gift is shewn to have the characteristics of a gift inter vivos.\nThe circumstance that a gift is made payable only after death does not necessarily imply that the gift is made in contemplation of death. Confusion should not be made between the date of payment of a cr\u00e9ance and the present right of a donee which became vested immediately upon his acceptance of the gift. C.C., arts. 755 and 777, first and last paragraphs.\nThe mother\u2019s promissory note, given as it was for a lawful consideration, \u201caccompanied by delivery\u201d and accepted by the daughter, was sufficient to meet the requirements of the second paragraph of article 776 C.C. and to constitute a valid manual gift.\nThe mother\u2019s promissory note was \u201cmoveable property\u201d within the meaning of that paragraph. The \u201cmoveable property\u201d which may become the subject of a manual gift comprises, of course, corporeal moveables, but also titres de cr\u00e9ance, the delivery of which is capable of effectually operating the transfer of ownership therein (Judgment of the Privy Council in O\u2019Meara v. Bennett, ([1932] 1 A.C. 80) discussed and applied). In such case, the negotiable document and the cr\u00e9ance which it represents are identified with one another to such an extent that the cr\u00e9ance itself is transferred by the sole delivery of the document from hand to hand, which is the characteristic of the manual gift (\u201cdon manuel\u201d).\nIn that respect, no distinction ought to be made between the promissory note of a third party and the promissory note of the donor himself.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014There was valid consideration for the note given by the mother to the appellant, and such note was not a gift inter vivos and mortis causa made by gratuitous title and was enforceable. The mother intended first to fulfill towards her daughter her \u201cobligation naturelle\u201d to make a proper provision for her daughter, which obligation was binding upon the mother during her lifetime, and, further, to discharge a duty of justice or fairness by making such provision immediately, knowing that the partition of the estate would be delayed at least for six years after her death.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 54 K.B. 38) reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, (a) appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J.[2] and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and J. C. Lamothe K.C. for the appellant.\nOscar P. Dorais K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The claim in the action out of which this appeal arises is based upon a document in the form of a promissory note by which Dame Emma Martineau, whose executor is the respondent, promised to pay on demand for value received to the appellant or order, the sum of $10,000 with interest at the rate of seven per cent.\nDame Emma Martineau died on the 25th December, 1930, and, some months later, the document was presented for payment.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench1 has held that the appellant\u2019s claim must fail on the ground that the transaction evidenced by the document was in truth a donation \u00e0 cause de mort and, consequently, invalid by force of Art. 762 C.C. The grounds of the decision of that court are very clearly stated in the following paragraphs of the formal judgment:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la demanderesse admet que sa m\u00e8re \u00e9tait consciente de la gravit\u00e9 de sa maladie et qu\u2019elle savait qu\u2019elle en mourrait;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, bien que le billet f\u00fbt fait payable \u00e0 demande, la signataire avait exig\u00e9 que le paiement n\u2019en fut demand\u00e9 que quatre mois apr\u00e8s sa signature, et que la demanderesse avait accept\u00e9 cette condition;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, de fait, la demanderesse n\u2019a fait conna\u00eetre l\u2019existence de ce billet \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs que quatre mois apr\u00e8s la date du\n(a) Reporter\u2019s note.\u2014The Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil (1933, p. 557) has commented adversely upon the decision of the appellate court. 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930; et bien qu\u2019elle ait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire de la succession fait par le notaire Isidore Coupai, n\u2019a fait aucune mention de ce billet;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il r\u00e9sulte du t\u00e9moignage de la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame, que sa m\u00e8re lui a donn\u00e9 ce billet pour assurer sa vie, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle serait partie elle-m\u00eame, et que sa m\u00e8re aurait consenti ce billet, parce que \u201celle avait des regrets de ne pas lui avoir donn\u00e9 des biens comme les autres\u201d, et qu\u2019elle aurait ajout\u00e9: \u201cSi tu veux accepter mon billet, je ne puis pas te donner autre chose pour le pr\u00e9sent.\u201d\nConsid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9funte, Madame Pesant, ne devait rien \u00e0 sa fille \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, si ce n\u2019est l\u2019obligation naturelle et l\u00e9gale qu\u2019elle pouvait avoir de lui aider dans ses besoins;\nConsid\u00e9rant que Madame Pesant, en signant ce billet de $10,000, n\u2019a pas voulu s\u2019engager elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 en faire le paiement, mais a entendu le mettre \u00e0 la charge de sa succession;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019on reconna\u00eet bien, dans les circonstances qui ont accompagn\u00e9 et pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la signature du billet, dans les d\u00e9clarations faites par la d\u00e9funte, les traits caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort; la donatrice manifestant clairement qu\u2019elle continuait de se pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la donataire, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019entendait pas payer elle-m\u00eame le montant du billet, mais qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait la donataire \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers, vu qu\u2019elle mettait le paiement de ce billet \u00e0 leur charge;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930, Madame Pesant, sachant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une maladie mortelle, ne pouvait pas faire une telle donation et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence le billet sur lequel la demanderesse fonde son action, n\u2019a aucune valeur l\u00e9gale, est nul et doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 tel par cette cour;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, par les conclusions de la d\u00e9fense, il est demand\u00e9 que le billet soit annul\u00e9, et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et de nul effet; qu\u2019il y a lieu de faire droit \u00e0 ces conclusions;\nConsid\u00e9rant, de plus, qu\u2019aux termes du testament de ladite feu Dame Pesant, ses biens ne doivent pas \u00eatre partag\u00e9s avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de majorit\u00e9 du plus jeune de ses enfants, et que jusque-l\u00e0, c\u2019est l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur-testamentaire, seul, qui en a la saisine;\nThe trial judge had taken the view that the document was given by Dame Martineau as a promissory note in recognition of a legal obligation to provide for her daughter who was without means; and that, in such circumstances, a present legal obligation arose which was enforceable against the mother\u2019s estate.\nThe question of substance upon which we have to pass is whether the findings of fact expressed in the passages quoted from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench which had the effect of reversing the findings of the trial judge can be sustained by reference to the evidence.\nI have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to consider whether in this case there was an \u201cantecedent liability,\u201d within the meaning of s. 53 of the Bills of Exchange Act, which could constitute a valid consideration for this document as a promissory note. By force of the Bills of Exchange Act, s. 58, Dame Martineau is presumed to have been a party for value to the document which bears her signature, and the learned trial judge has found that there was an \u201cantecedent liability\u201d which consisted in the obligation to make in favor of the appellant an alimentary allowance which she had been paying her. It is, no doubt, an arguable question whether, upon the testimony of the appellant, the presumption that the promissory note was given for value, in the sense of the Bills of Exchange Act, has been rebutted, and that, therefore, the document is not and never was enforceable as a promissory note. As I say, I do not consider it necessary to express any opinion upon this point.\nAssuming the document to be not so enforceable, this circumstance would be by no means incompatible with the admissibility of the document as evidence of an intention to enter into a contract to pay money for a sufficient \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cconsid\u00e9ration,\u201d within the meaning of articles 984 and 989 C.C., or, indeed, with the intention to execute and deliver a valid and enforceable promissory note. If the transaction had not the character which has been ascribed to it by the Court of King\u2019s Bench; that is to say, if it was not a donation \u00e0 cause de mort but, in intention, as well as in form, a contract to pay, presently binding as an obligation inter vivos, with a postponement of the date of payment, then I have no difficulty in holding that, in the circumstances, there was a sufficient \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cconsid\u00e9ration.\u201d (5 Planiol & Ripert 335; Legris v. Baulne[3]. Hutchison v. Royal Institution of Learning[4], 2 Pothier, p. 85, No. 173[5]; 24 Demolombe No. 351, 352, pp. 334-5).\nI come then to the critical question. Was the transaction in intent, as well as in form, the execution and delivery of a presently obligatory promissory note with an understanding that the date of payment was to be deferred?\nLet me say at once that, in my view, the document is the solid fact upon which the answer to that question rests. The trial judge found that Dame Martineau was, on the occasion of the execution of the document, although gravely ill and aware of her critical condition, in such a state that \u201cson intelligence \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e intacte.\u201d She had been accustomed to transacting business. It has not been seriously suggested that she did not understand the significance of signing a promissory note.\nI have been unable to convince myself that the evidence of the appellant reveals anything which seriously militates against the natural and logical inferences to be drawn from the fact that she executed and delivered this document. Any doubts which may exist as to the legal enforceability of the document as a promissory note do not weaken the inference that she intended to execute a valid and binding document of that character.\nThe circumstances mentioned in the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench are, no doubt, weighty circumstances, but, weighing, as best I can, the considerations which affected the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, I am forced to the conclusion that the finding of the learned trial judge that Dame Martineau intended to enter into a presently binding contract, by way of promissory note, and that she executed and delivered the document in question to her daughter, with that intention, could not properly be set aside; although, as I have already observed, I express no opinion upon the point with which the learned trial judge would appear to have dealt, viz., whether or not the consideration for the promissory note as executed and delivered was, in whole or in part, an \u201cantecedent liability\u201d within the meaning of s. 53 of the Bills of Exchange Act.\nIn a word, my view is that the document is sufficient evidence of a contract to pay the sum mentioned according to the terms of it; and, having considered the whole of the evidence, that this was the true character of the transaction, and that there was a sufficient \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cconsid\u00e9ration\u201d withhin the meaning of articles 984 and 989 C.C., to support the legal obligation assumed by the promissor, in the obligation naturelle to make a proper provision for her daughter.\nIt follows that the appeal should succeed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs of all parties throughout to be paid out of the estate.\nRinfret, J.\u2014Madame Z\u00e9phirin Pesant est morte le 25 d\u00e9cembre 1930. Elle souffrait depuis au moins deux ans de tuberculose et de diab\u00e8te. Ces maladies se sont aggrav\u00e9es graduellement; et il n\u2019y a pas de doute que ce sont elles qui ont caus\u00e9 sa mort.\nLe 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930, elle signa un billet promissoire en la forme ordinaire caus\u00e9 \u201cpour valeur re\u00e7ue\u201d et payable \u00e0 demande au bureau de la Banque de Commerce, rue Masson, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 Yvonne Pesant, ou ordre, pour la somme de $10,000, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de 7 p. 100 l\u2019an apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Puis elle remit ce billet \u00e0 Yvonne Pesant, qui est la demanderesse et l\u2019appelante en la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nYvonne Pesant est la fille de Madame Z\u00e9phirin Pesant. Au moment o\u00f9 ce billet fut souscrit \u00e0 son ordre et lui fut remis, elle \u00e9tait veuve avec quatre enfants en bas \u00e2ge, et sans aucuns moyens. Depuis la mort de son mari, c\u2019\u00e9tait sa m\u00e8re qui la faisait vivre.\nOr, Madame Z\u00e9phirin Pesant, qui avait fait son testament le 11 f\u00e9vrier 1930, bien qu\u2019elle l\u00e9gu\u00e2t des sommes de $10,000 et de $5,000, \u00e0 titre de legs particuliers et hors part \u00e0 la plupart de ses enfants, n\u2019avait fait aucun legs particulier de ce genre \u00e0 l\u2019appelante. Cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait simplement appel\u00e9e au partage du r\u00e9sidu des biens de la succession, en commun avec ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs; et ce partage ne devait avoir lieu que \u201clorsque le plus jeune (des) enfants au premier degr\u00e9 aura atteint son \u00e2ge de majorit\u00e9\u201d. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, cette condition retardait l\u2019\u00e9poque du partage de quelques ann\u00e9es. Dans l\u2019intervalle, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires avaient le pouvoir de diff\u00e9rer la distribution aux l\u00e9gataires universels des fruits et revenus des biens de la succession, et m\u00eame de les imputer en d\u00e9duction de certaines cr\u00e9ances chirographaires et hypoth\u00e9caires. D\u2019ailleurs, les legs particuliers \u00e9taient relativement consid\u00e9rables; et apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaits, malgr\u00e9 que la succession f\u00fbt assez importante, il est douteux que les revenus \u00e9ch\u00e9ant aux l\u00e9gataires universels, qui \u00e9taient nombreux, aient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour chacun d\u2019eux une somme appr\u00e9ciable.\nIl semble y avoir eu une raison pour que Madame Pesant ne trait\u00e2t pas sa fille Yvonne sur le m\u00eame pied que la plupart de ses autres enfants dans son testament. Sa fille devait se remarier, et Madame Pesant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord avec elle sur ce point. Elle pensait qu\u2019elle devait au moins retarder son mariage pour quelque temps. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait fianc\u00e9e; mais son fianc\u00e9 mourut; et, depuis le moment o\u00f9 sa m\u00e8re en fut inform\u00e9e, un changement s\u2019op\u00e9ra dans ses sentiments, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa fille. Elle se prit \u00e0 regretter de ne pas lui avoir donn\u00e9 des biens comme aux autres; et c\u2019est alors qu\u2019elle d\u00e9cida de lui donner $10,000\u2014ce qui \u00e9tait, comme on l\u2019a vu, le montant du legs fait \u00e0 plusieurs des autres enfants\u2014\"pour assurer (sa vie et celle de ses enfants) apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle serait partie elle-m\u00eame\u201d. Ce sont l\u00e0 les raisons pour lesquelles elle signa le billet de $10,000 et le remit \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\nCette version est celle de l\u2019appelante; mais nous n\u2019en avons pas d\u2019autre. Le juge du proc\u00e8s l\u2019a accept\u00e9e et en a fait une des bases de son jugement. L\u2019appelante a ajout\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage d\u2019autres d\u00e9clarations qui peuvent influer dans un sens ou dans l\u2019autre sur la d\u00e9cision de cette cause et que, pour cette raison, il est utile de mentionner. Elle ignorait les termes du testament de sa m\u00e8re; sa m\u00e8re savait qu\u2019elle mourrait de la maladie dont elle souffrait alors; sa m\u00e8re lui\na demand\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9clamer le billet avant l\u2019expiration de quatre mois de la signature du billet, chose que (l\u2019appelante) a faite.\nIl convient de noter que le billet porte la signature comme t\u00e9moin de Marie Coderre, qui \u00e9tait la garde-malade de Madame Pesant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le billet fut souscrit par elle.\nQuatre mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re, l\u2019appelante r\u00e9clama de la succession le paiement du billet. Jusque-l\u00e0, elle n\u2019en avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 personne. Le paiement lui ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9, elle intenta la pr\u00e9sente action. Les autres l\u00e9gataires universels d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 justice, et l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire seul produisit une d\u00e9fense o\u00f9 il invoque plusieurs moyens:\nD\u00e9faut de consid\u00e9ration du billet, qui \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une donation faite pendant la maladie r\u00e9put\u00e9e mortelle de la donatrice et, par cons\u00e9quent, faite \u00e0 cause de mort;\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, donation nulle parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans la forme notari\u00e9e et parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e;\nEnfin subsidiairement, donation qui devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une suggestion indue et de la captation de l\u2019appelante, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 Madame Pesant n\u2019avait pas la capacit\u00e9 mentale requise pour disposer librement de ses biens.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9cart\u00e9 l\u2019imputation de suggestion indue et de captation. Se pronon\u00e7ant sur le fait de la maladie et de la capacit\u00e9 mentale de Madame Pesant, il dit ce qui suit:\n\u201cLa preuve de cet \u00e9tat est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante. Il est vrai que Dame Martineau (Madame Pesant) \u00e9tait malade depuis longtemps d\u2019une maladie tr\u00e8s grave, dont t\u00f4t ou tard elle devait mourir; mais son intelligence \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e intacte.\u201d\nCette d\u00e9cision est justifi\u00e9e par la preuve; elle n\u2019est pas contredite dans le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi; et elle n\u2019a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e devant la Cour Supr\u00eame. Nous devons donc partir de ce point que le billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti sans fraude de la part de la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et par une personne qui \u201cavait toute sa connaissance et savait ce qu\u2019elle faisait\u201d.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que, dans les circonstances, il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une donation entre vifs, ni d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort ou, en d\u2019autres termes, d\u2019une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9.\nLa m\u00e8re devait une pension alimentaire \u00e0 sa fille sans moyens; et, en reconnaissant cette obligation l\u00e9gale, elle signa le billet en question; il y avait donc valeur et consid\u00e9ration.\nDe plus, l\u2019on pouvait\nconsid\u00e9rer ce billet comme un don manuel, parce que le titre y repr\u00e9sente la chose et a une valeur propre r\u00e9alisable par le d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier.\nIl a, en cons\u00e9quence, maintenu l\u2019action.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, au contraire, annula le billet comme constituant une donation faite pendant la maladie r\u00e9put\u00e9e mortelle de la donatrice et, par cons\u00e9quent, nulle comme r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de mort.\nC\u2019est de ce jugement qu\u2019il y a appel; et les questions que nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer sont donc de savoir\n1\u00b0 si, dans les circonstances, nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort;\n2\u00b0 si, au contraire, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une donation entre vifs qui n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans la forme exig\u00e9e par le code civil;\n3\u00b0 s\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019acquittement volontaire d\u2019une obligation naturelle que la succession de Madame Pesant est tenue de reconna\u00eetre.\nIl y a certainement beaucoup \u00e0 dire en faveur de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un acte, pour employer les expressions de Aubry et Rau (vol. 4, p. 322) \u201crentrant par le fond comme par la forme dans la classe des actes \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux\u201d, surtout si on l\u2019envisage, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la doctrine des commentateurs contemporains du Code Napol\u00e9on et de bon nombre d\u2019arr\u00eats de la Cour de Cassation. Cette d\u00e9cision peut aussi se r\u00e9clamer de plusieurs jugements prononc\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec et par des juges de la plus haute autorit\u00e9. Sans vouloir diminuer l\u2019importance des autres cas auxquels je pourrais r\u00e9f\u00e9rer, il suffit de citer sur ce point les opinions exprim\u00e9es dans les causes de Drouin v. Provencher[6], de Stephen v. Perrault, Cour de Revision[7], et de In re Ross, Hutchison v. Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning[8]. La difficult\u00e9 est de fixer la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre l\u2019obligation naturelle et le simple devoir moral, ou devoir de conscience. Pour y parvenir, la doctrine nous offre les th\u00e9ories les plus diverses. Comme on l\u2019a fait remarquer: chaque auteur a son syst\u00e8me. La Cour de Cassation la consid\u00e8re comme une question de fait qu\u2019elle laisse \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision souveraine du juge du fond, suivant les circonstances de chaque esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Dalloz, Recueil P\u00e9riodique, 1903, 2.13.\nMadame Pesant avait l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale de pourvoir aux besoins de sa fille et des enfants de cette derni\u00e8re dans la mesure de ses moyens de fortune. Cependant cette obligation l\u00e9gale cessait \u00e9videmment avec sa mort; et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019a fait remarquer la Cour du Banc du Roi. Mais Madame Pesant savait que sa fille \u00e9tait sans ressources, qu\u2019elle ne lui avait pas laiss\u00e9 dans son testament le montant qu\u2019elle l\u00e9guait \u00e0 la plupart de ses autres enfants, que le partage de la succession, \u00e0 supposer que le r\u00e9sidu serait appr\u00e9ciable apr\u00e8s l\u2019acquittement des legs particuliers, serait retard\u00e9 pendant quelques ann\u00e9es et qu\u2019elle risquait donc de rester sans moyens de subsistance. Il est naturel qu\u2019elle ait regard\u00e9 comme imp\u00e9rieux le devoir \u201cd\u2019assurer l\u2019avenir\u201d de sa fille et des enfants de cette derni\u00e8re. En vue des legs qu\u2019elle faisait aux autres enfants, le montant de $10,000 qu\u2019elle a fix\u00e9 \u00e9tait tout indiqu\u00e9, et il n\u2019est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9 en proportion de la fortune qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait. Certains auteurs contemporains voient l\u00e0 comme un prolongement de l\u2019obligation civile de fournir des aliments; et il n\u2019est pas surprenant que, dans toutes les circonstances que nous connaissons maintenant, Madame Pesant ait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 son acte comme un devoir de conscience ou une obligation morale auquel elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas libre de se soustraire. Le seul fait que la somme remise ou stipul\u00e9e pr\u00e9voit les besoins alimentaires futurs, ou, suivant l\u2019expression contenue en la preuve, pourvoit \u00e0 \u201cassurer (la) vie\u201d de la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire pour l\u2019avenir, n\u2019est pas suffisant en soi pour qu\u2019on la traite comme une pure lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9. On en trouve un exemple dans Dalloz (R\u00e9p. Prat. vo. Donations entre vifs, p. 519, n\u00b0 9). Un beau-fr\u00e8re avait consenti une constitution de rente viag\u00e8re au profit de la s\u0153ur ut\u00e9rine de sa femme, qui \u00e9tait dans l\u2019indigence. Il n\u2019y avait donc aucune obligation civile. L\u2019acte \u00e9tait sous seing priv\u00e9. La Cour de Douai d\u00e9cida que cet acte ne constituait pas une donation parce qu\u2019il avait pour cause une obligation morale et, en cons\u00e9quence, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait valable. Sur pourvoi, la Cour de Cassation refusa d\u2019intervenir en jugeant qu\u2019en interpr\u00e9tant l\u2019acte de cette fa\u00e7on, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les faits, \u201cl\u2019arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 a pu le d\u00e9clarer valable sans violer aucune loi\u201d (20 Journal du Palais, p. 830).\nOn ne peut donc \u00e9carter a priori la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui a jug\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les faits, dans cette cause-ci, il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une donation. Le code civil (art, 1140) reconna\u00eet le lien cr\u00e9\u00e9 par les obligations naturelles. Mais il ne d\u00e9finit pas ce genre d\u2019obligations. Il n\u2019est pas toujours facile de les distinguer du \u201csimple d\u00e9sir de satisfaire \u00e0 un sentiment d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, de conscience, de d\u00e9licatesse ou d\u2019honneur\u201d. La question est pleine de difficult\u00e9s. Comme je ne crois pas n\u00e9cessaire de la trancher pour d\u00e9cider la pr\u00e9sente cause, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne pas me prononcer sur ce point. J\u2019ai cru devoir m\u2019en expliquer pour indiquer qu\u2019en appuyant mes conclusions sur des motifs diff\u00e9rents, je n\u2019entends pas laisser croire que je d\u00e9sapprouve le point de vue auquel se placent mes coll\u00e8gues.\nA mon avis, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a eu raison de juger que l\u2019on pouvait du moins consid\u00e9rer la d\u00e9livrance du billet promissoire de Madame Pesant comme un don manuel; et je confirmerais son jugement pour cette raison.\nM\u00eame si on l\u2019envisage comme une pure lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, je ne puis me rendre au raisonnement de la Cour du Banc du Roi qu\u2019il y a eu, dans ce cas, donation \u00e0 cause de mort.\nHistoriquement, la donation \u00e0 cause de mort \u00e9tait celle qui ne devenait d\u00e9finitive que par la mort du donateur avant celle du donataire. Elle \u00e9tait, de sa nature, r\u00e9vocable au gr\u00e9 du donateur. Elle disposait des biens \u00e0 venir, ou d\u2019un bien pr\u00e9sent dont le donataire n\u2019acqu\u00e9rait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 compter de la mort du donateur (10 Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., p. 439; 4 Mignault, p. 2). Quand Pothier (8 Bugnet, 3e \u00e9d., p. 350) parle d\u2019un\ndonateur, qui se voit toucher \u00e0 sa fin, (et qui) pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le donataire non pas \u00e0 soi, mais \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers ou \u00e0 tout autre,\nil entend expliquer par l\u00e0 \u201cla raison des dispositions\u201d qui annulent les donations \u201cfaites par personnes gisant au lit malades de la maladie dont elles d\u00e9c\u00e8dent\u201d, mais il ne pr\u00e9tend pas donner les caract\u00e9ristiques de la donation \u00e0 cause de mort. Les raisons de Pothier ont d\u2019ailleurs singuli\u00e8rement perdu de leur force depuis que la r\u00e9serve et la l\u00e9gitime en faveur des h\u00e9ritiers sont disparues du droit de Qu\u00e9bec. Les codificateurs eux-m\u00eames font allusion \u00e0 cette transformation dans les remarques introductives de leur rapport sur les \u201cdonations entre vifs et testamentaires\u201d (5e Rapp., Liv. 3e; seconde partie). L\u2019article qu\u2019ils ont propos\u00e9 et qui est devenu loi se lit comme suit:\n758. Toute donation faite pour n\u2019avoir effet qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de mort qui n\u2019est pas valide comme testament ou comme permise en un contrat de mariage, est nulle.\nEn somme, cet article contient une d\u00e9finition. La donation qui est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle est celle \u201cqui est faite pour \u201cn\u2019avoir effet qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de mort\u201d. Et si l\u2019on analyse cette d\u00e9finition en regard de la notion historique de la donatio mortis causa, l\u2019on doit reconna\u00eetre que la donation qui est prohib\u00e9e par l\u2019article est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment celle dont l\u2019effet est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort du donateur, qui jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette mort n\u2019a aucun effet, et en vertu de laquelle le donataire n\u2019acquiert pas de droit avant cette mort. Le rapprochement avec le testament, qui est fait dans l\u2019article, rend encore plus claire la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur.\nOr, la d\u00e9livrance \u00e0 l\u2019appelante du billet promissoire de Madame Pesant n\u2019a aucun des caract\u00e8res que nous venons de mentionner. Madame Pesant a entendu donner $10,000 imm\u00e9diatement et irr\u00e9vocablement. Elle s\u2019est dessaisie actuellement, en ce sens que sa promesse de payer l\u2019a rendue d\u00e9bitrice de l\u2019appelante. Par l\u00e0, son acte rencontrait toutes les exigences du dernier paragraphe de l\u2019article 777 C.C., et l\u2019acceptation de l\u2019appelante rendait l\u2019acte irr\u00e9vocable (art. 755 C.C.). L\u2019acte a pris effet imm\u00e9diatement et son efficacit\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 en aucune fa\u00e7on subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la mort de la donatrice. Et il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un ch\u00e8que \u201cdonn\u00e9 sur une banque o\u00f9 le donateur n\u2019avait pas de fonds\u201d, comme dans le cas suppos\u00e9 par M. le juge Carroll dans la cause de Legris v. Beaulne & Chen\u00e9[9] ou comme le ch\u00e8que dont il est question dans Rochon v. Rochon[10]. Madame Pesant valait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s $150,000, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration faite au gouvernement apr\u00e8s sa mort. La cr\u00e9ance qu\u2019elle constituait contre elle-m\u00eame \u00e9tait donc absolument s\u00e9rieuse et solide.\nSans doute, la donation fut faite pendant la maladie r\u00e9put\u00e9e mortelle de la donatrice, et l\u2019article 762 C.C. \u00e9dicte qu\u2019en pareil cas \u201cles donations con\u00e7ues entre vifs sont nulles comme r\u00e9put\u00e9es \u00e0 cause de mort\u201d. Mais l\u2019article ajoute: \u201csi aucunes circonstances n\u2019aident \u00e0 les valider\u201d. Cet article n\u2019\u00e9tablit donc qu\u2019une pr\u00e9somption qui peut \u00eatre repouss\u00e9e par une preuve contraire (art. 1239 C.C.; Valade v. Lalonde[11]. Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas introduit dans le code le texte rigide de la Coutume de Paris, ni la doctrine rigoureuse de Pothier, de Ricard, ou de Bourjon. Les mots: \u201csi aucunes circonstances n\u2019aident \u00e0 les valider\u201d n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dans l\u2019article de la Coutume. Ils ne signifient pas \u00e9videmment que les circonstances peuvent valider une donation r\u00e9ellement faite \u00e0 cause de mort. Celle-ci est toujours nulle, except\u00e9 dans un testament ou dans un contrat de mariage, en vertu de l\u2019art. 758 C.C. Ces mots veulent dire: si les circonstances ne r\u00e9futent pas la pr\u00e9somption qui r\u00e9sulte de ce que la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pendant la maladie r\u00e9put\u00e9e mortelle. Ou, en d\u2019autres termes: si les circonstances ne d\u00e9montrent pas qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu donation \u00e0 cause de mort. Et la pr\u00e9somption est compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9fut\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli que la donation, comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, a les caract\u00e9ristiques de la donation entre vifs.\nUne circonstance qui a paru avoir quelque poids aupr\u00e8s de la Cour du Banc du Roi, bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait eu apparemment aucune influence sur le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, est celle-ci:\nA sa face, la cr\u00e9ance ou le billet \u00e9tait payable \u00e0 demande, Mais Mme Pesant a exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir que sa fille ne lui en r\u00e9clame pas le paiement avant l\u2019expiration de quatre mois de sa signature. Nous reconnaissons qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui pourrait peut-\u00eatre, dans certains cas, aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort. Il ne saurait jamais \u00eatre d\u00e9cisif dans tous les cas; et il ne l\u2019est pas ici. Il faut tenir compte de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de la donatrice. \u201cNous ne consid\u00e9rons pas tant \u00e0 ce sujet, disait Ricard (Donations, t. 1er, p. 22, n\u00b0 89), si (le malade) \u00e9tait actuellement proche de la mort, que s\u2019il avait la pens\u00e9e d\u2019y \u00eatre.\u201d Madame Pesant \u00e9tait malade depuis deux ans. Elle savait qu\u2019elle mourrait de la tuberculose qui la minait\u2014\"t\u00f4t ou tard\u201d, suivant l\u2019expression du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Mais rien, dans la preuve, ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle s\u2019attendait \u00e0 mourir bient\u00f4t ou, pour employer le mot de Pothier, que sa \u201cmaladie eut un trait prochain \u00e0 la mort\u201d. L\u2019on se rappelle que cet auteur donne pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment comme exemple d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 le malade s\u2019illusionne, celui de la \u201cpulmonie\u201d. Il n\u2019est pas possible d\u2019affirmer ici que Mme Pesant ne conservait pas l\u2019espoir de vivre bien au del\u00e0 des quatre mois de gr\u00e2ce qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9s \u00e0 sa fille, surtout lorsque le juge du proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 cette suggestion de la d\u00e9fense.\nEn plus, il faut se garder de confondre le terme d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la cr\u00e9ance avec le droit du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui a pris naissance d\u00e8s son acceptation (art. 755 et 777 C.C., 1er et dernier parags.). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la donation s\u2019est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e au moyen de la remise du billet souscrit par la donatrice \u00e0 la donataire, qui l\u2019a accept\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors compl\u00e8te et d\u00e9finitive. Son effet fut imm\u00e9diat. L\u2019acte de Madame Pesant ne peut pas \u00eatre caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 comme une \u201cdonation pour n\u2019avoir effet qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de mort\u201d, suivant les termes de la prohibition de l\u2019article 758 C.C. Et, comme nous le verrons, ce raisonnement s\u2019applique a fortiori au don manuel.\nSi donc la donation dont il s\u2019agit n\u2019est pas une donation \u00e0 cause de mort, mais une donation entre vifs, la question qui reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider ne s\u2019adresse plus qu\u2019\u00e0 la forme de la donation.\nIl ne nous fait gu\u00e8re de doute qu\u2019en France, \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle, une donation ainsi faite sous la forme d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et souscrit serait trait\u00e9e comme donation d\u00e9guis\u00e9e et reconnue valable (D.P. 78.1.481). L\u2019on peut dire qu\u2019il y est de jurisprudence constante que les donations faites sous forme de contrats \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux par des personnes capables, sans fraude et sans pr\u00e9judice du droit des tiers, sont valables nonobstant l\u2019inaccomplissement des formalit\u00e9s prescrites pour les donations entre vifs. (Voir Dalloz\u2014Code civil annot\u00e9\u2014sous-art. 931\u2014nos 172, 186, 239, 240, 243, 302, etc.) On trouve \u00e9galement des traces de cette th\u00e9orie dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (Cardinal v. Landes[12]; Leblanc v. Porlier[13]. Mais je mentionne la question simplement pour indiquer qu\u2019elle ne nous a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9, car comme elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e devant nous par les avocats des parties, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019en parler davantage dans cette cause-ci. Et d\u2019ailleurs, cela n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la solution que nous cherchons, puisque, ainsi que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019acte de Mme Pesant est valable \u00e0 titre de don manuel.\nNous avons ici un billet promissoire ayant une cause int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ou une consid\u00e9ration juridiquement suffisante, dont la donation, \u201caccompagn\u00e9e de d\u00e9livrance\u201d, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par Madame Pesant et accept\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante. C\u2019est l\u00e0 tout ce qu\u2019il faut pour rencontrer les exigences du deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 776 du code civil. Il y a eu donation: nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 revenir sur la discussion de ce point. Il y a eu d\u00e9livrance: c\u2019est l\u00e0 un fait \u00e9tabli. Il y a eu acceptation: cela ne fait pas de doute. La seule h\u00e9sitation peut porter sur la question de savoir si le billet promissoire entre dans la cat\u00e9gorie des \u201cchoses mobili\u00e8res\u201d qui peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une donation en la forme autoris\u00e9e par ce paragraphe. Par d\u00e9finition traditionnelle, il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un objet dont la \u201cd\u00e9livrance\u201d peut s\u2019op\u00e9rer par transmission de la main \u00e0 la main. De l\u00e0, l\u2019appellation de \u201cdon manuel\u201d. Mais la loi parle de donation. Il faut donc, de la part du donateur, l\u2019intention de se d\u00e9pouiller \u00e0 titre gratuit, actuellement et irr\u00e9vocablement, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose et, de la part du donataire, il faut l\u2019intention d\u2019accepter dans le m\u00eame esprit. Il est suffisant que les deux intentions se manifestent \u201cpar convention verbale\u201d; ce qui est essentiel, c\u2019est que la tradition qui s\u2019op\u00e8re soit faite de telle fa\u00e7on qu\u2019elle ait pour effet, par elle-m\u00eame et sans plus, de transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose d\u2019une fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te et d\u00e9finitive. Ainsi comprises, les \u201cchoses mobili\u00e8res\u201d qui peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un don manuel sont celles dont la. \u201cd\u00e9livrance\u201d est susceptible de transmettre effectivement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce sont tout d\u2019abord les choses corporelles, parce que leur \u201cpossession vaut titre\u201d (art. 2268 C.C.); mais ce sont \u00e9galement, et entre autres choses, les titres de cr\u00e9ance dont la remise est effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 celui qui les re\u00e7oit le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le titre et dans la cr\u00e9ance qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sente. Dans ce cas, \u201cla cr\u00e9ance fait corps avec le titre et sa nature incorporelle, ainsi mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9e, cesse de cr\u00e9er un obstacle \u00e0 une livraison de main \u00e0 main\u201d (Fuzier-Herman, vo. Don Manuel, n\u00b0 101). Alors, comme le font remarquer Baudry-Lacantinerie et Colin (vol. 10, p. 539, n\u00b0 1188), \u201cla possession de l\u2019effet implique vraiment \u201cla qualit\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire\u201d. (Voir 32 Laurent, nos 568 et 569.)\nEt nous ne comprenons pas autrement le passage, auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 si souvent r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, du jugement de Lord Buckmaster, parlant au nom du Conseil priv\u00e9, dans la cause de O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[14]. Il ne faut pas perdre de vue la question que discutait Lord Buckmaster. (\u201cA case is an authority only for what it actually decides\u201d, disait Lord Halsbury dans Quinn v. Leathern[15].) Dans O\u2019Meara v. Bennett14, Mrs. Thomas voulait, semble-t-il, donner \u00e0 Mrs. O\u2019Meara des actions d\u2019une compagnie industrielle. Mrs. Thomas d\u00e9tenait les certificats de ces actions. Dans le but de mettre son projet \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, elle fit ce qui suit (je laisse parler Lord Buckmaster lui-m\u00eame):\nIn order to carry out this intention, Mrs. Thomas communicated through her husband with the company, informing them of her desire that the shares should be regarded as held by her in trust for the appellant, but that the dividends should be forwarded to her as usual, and in accordance with their directions the certificates were sent to the company with an indorsed transfer on the back in these words: \u201cFor value received I hereby sell, assign and transfer unto Mary M. Thomas in trust for Gertrude Mary O\u2019Meara shares of the capital stock represented by the within certificate, and do hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint attorney to transfer the said stock on the books of the within-named Company with full powers of substitution in the premises\u201d; and this was duly signed by Mrs. Thomas and also by her husband. The original certificates were cancelled and in their place two new certificates were issued, dated January 15, 1913. The one as to the ordinary shares was in this form: \u201cThis certifies that Mrs. Mary M. Thomas, in trust for Mrs. Gertrude M. O\u2019Meara, is the registered holder of 33 common shares\u201d; and the one for the preference shares was in similar terms. These certificates again contained transfers in blank upon their back, but neither of these transfers was ever executed. The certificates were handed to Mrs. O\u2019Meara some time afterwards and have remained in her custody ever since, but the dividends were received by Mrs. Thomas during her life. The question is whether in these circumstances a valid gift of the shares was made in favour of the appellant.\nLord Buckmaster se demande donc si une pareille \u201cd\u00e9livrance\u201d constitue un don valable des actions de la compagnie et il arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par Mrs. Thomas ne vaut ni comme constitution de trust en vertu de l\u2019article 981a du code civil, ni comme don manuel en vertu de l\u2019article 776 C.C. La question du trust ne nous int\u00e9resse pas en ce moment, mais il importe de suivre son raisonnement en ce qui concerne celle du don manuel. Il cite le deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019art. 776 C.C. Puis il dit:\nApart from the question as to the effect of the trust, the gift in this case can only be established if it were made by delivery. Now the share certificates were not negotiable documents.\nEn effet, les formules de transfert au dos des certificats d\u2019actions n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies ni sign\u00e9es par Mrs. Thomas; et Mrs. O\u2019Meara d\u00e9tenait seulement des certificats non endoss\u00e9s. Lord Buckmaster fait donc remarquer qu\u2019une simple remise de ce genre n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des parts: \u201cIn fact, in this case, there was no transfer of ownership.\u201d Et c\u2019est l\u00e0 la ratio decidendi de son jugement dont il a clairement pos\u00e9 le principe dans une phrase ant\u00e9rieure:\nGifts of moveable property accompanied by delivery in art. 776 C.C. must, in their Lordship\u2019s opinion, be read as relating solely to gifts of such moveable property as is capable of passing by delivery, for delivery has no value, apart from being evidence, unless it can effect a change of ownership, etc.\nEt ce jugement laisse bien voir que si les certificats d\u2019actions eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 endoss\u00e9s par Mrs. Thomas \u201cso as to effect a change of ownership\u201d, la situation e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente. Le sens de la d\u00e9cision est qu\u2019il ne faut pas mettre sur le m\u00eame pied un titre n\u00e9gociable et un titre qui ne l\u2019est pas. (Voir, au bas de la page 84, la remarque sur l\u2019opinion dissidente de M. le juge Cross, en Cour du Banc du Roi.) Sans doute, Lord Buckmaster approuve la distinction faite par M. le juge Pelletier entre l\u2019expression \u201cchoses mobili\u00e8res\u201d et le mot \u201cbiens\u201d; mais on voit par son jugement comment il l\u2019interpr\u00e8te et de quelle fa\u00e7on il l\u2019applique.\nLa livraison d\u2019un titre au porteur transf\u00e8re la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il en est de m\u00eame d\u2019un titre \u00e0 ordre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement endoss\u00e9. Mais la simple remise de certificats d\u2019actions, sans la signature des formules de transfert, ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une d\u00e9livrance des actions. C\u2019est ce que dit Lord Buckmaster et c\u2019est exactement ce qu\u2019avait dit, dans la m\u00eame cause, M. le juge Lamothe, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. (Voir Corby Distillery Company v. Dame O\u2019Meara and The Royal Trust[16].)\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la \u201cd\u00e9livrance\u201d du billet de Madame Pesant \u00e0 l\u2019appelante a eu pour effet d\u2019en transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Madame Pesant a donc fait un don manuel valable.\nCette solution ne se heurte en rien \u00e0 la doctrine ou \u00e0 la jurisprudence, en France ou dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le don manuel de billets au porteur \u00e9tait valable dans l\u2019ancien droit (Bressolles, p. 58). Le don manuel des effets au porteur ou des effets endoss\u00e9s en blanc est parfaitement reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle en France. Le principe est que la tradition en soit effectu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 conf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne fut pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Richer v. Voyer[17] o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un certificat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent remis par la donatrice au donataire, certificat n\u00e9gociable par endossement. Mais la preuve de la donation elle-m\u00eame fut trouv\u00e9e \u00e9quivoque et il fut jug\u00e9 qu\u2019elle indiquait plut\u00f4t un mandat. Le principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 dans Darling v. Blakely (C. de R\u00e9v.)[18] o\u00f9 cependant le billet du donateur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au donataire \u201cwith an expression of his wish that the note should not be presented for payment until after his death, and the donee complied\u201d), dans Br\u00fbl\u00e9 v. Br\u00fbl\u00e9[19], dans Ch\u00ean\u00e9 v. Ch\u00ean\u00e9[20] confirm\u00e9 en appel sous le nom de Legris v. Beaulne & Ch\u00ean\u00e9[21]; dans Cardinal v. Landes[22]; dans Harvey v. Harvey[23]. Le principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis encore dans Brochu v. Brochu[24]; dans Rochon v. Rochon[25] et dans Malartre v. D\u00e9cary[26], quoique, dans ces trois derni\u00e8res causes, le don ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations. Dans la cause de O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[27], la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e favorablement \u00e0 ce principe, et l\u2019opinion personnelle diff\u00e9rente de M. le juge Pelletier (\u00e0 laquelle, soit dit en passant, le rapporteur a fait fortune) se termine quand m\u00eame par cette conclusion: \u201cLa question reste donc ouverte.\u201d Ce qui a fait d\u00e9cider la cause contre Mrs. O\u2019Meara, en Cour du Banc du Roi, fut le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019acceptation du don, l\u2019absence de possession publique et la r\u00e9serve de l\u2019usufruit (voir le bas de la page 348 et le haut de la page 349)\u2014toutes questions qui ne se posent pas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nPar ailleurs, nous ne voyons pas qu\u2019il y ait de distinction \u00e0 faire, sous ce rapport, entre le don du billet d\u2019un tiers et le don du billet du donateur. Du point de vue d\u2019o\u00f9 se placent la doctrine et la jurisprudence, il n\u2019y a pas de diff\u00e9rence juridique entre les deux op\u00e9rations. Dans le premier cas, le titre de cr\u00e9ance (le billet du tiers) est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en circulation; dans le second cas, le donateur cr\u00e9e d\u2019abord le titre, puis le met en circulation. On admet que le don manuel d\u2019un ch\u00e8que est valable. Le billet promissoire du donateur est sur le m\u00eame plan l\u00e9gal. Dans la plupart des causes que nous avons cit\u00e9es, l\u2019effet de commerce \u00e9manait du donateur lui-m\u00eame, et l\u2019on n\u2019a pas song\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9carter le don pour cette raison.\nIl ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 ajouter que si, comme je le pense, il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable don manuel, \u00e0 plus forte raison, comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9, doit-on \u00e9carter l\u2019imputation de donation \u00e0 cause de mort, car, dit Troplong (Donations, vol. II, p. 423, n\u00b0 1053):\nLa tradition qui fait le don manuel est absolue, irr\u00e9vocable, pleine et enti\u00e8re; au lieu que la tradition de la donation \u00e0 cause de mort est pr\u00e9caire et r\u00e9vocable.\nA quoi l\u2019on peut ajouter, pour terminer, la remarque de Bressolles (p. 167):\nPar la fa\u00e7on dont il se r\u00e9alise et les effets qu\u2019il produit (le don manuel) forme la plus \u00e9nergique des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s au point de vue du d\u00e9pouillement du donateur.\nJe ferais donc droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et je maintiendrais l\u2019action contre l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, pour le plein montant de la r\u00e9clamation, et subsidiairement contre tous les l\u00e9gataires universels en cause conjointement; mais, dans les circonstances, les frais du proc\u00e8s dans toutes les cours devraient \u00eatre support\u00e9s par la succession et par l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9. Cannon, j.\u2014A Montr\u00e9al, le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930, Dame Emma Martineau, veuve de Z\u00e9phirin Pesant, a consenti et sign\u00e9 un billet promissoire \u00e0 demande, pour valeur re\u00e7ue, par lequel elle promettait payer au bureau de la Banque Canadienne du Commerce, rue Masson, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 la demanderesse, sa fille, ou \u00e0 son ordre, la somme de $10,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 7 p. 100 Fan apr\u00e8s \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Ce billet fut livr\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour \u00e0 la demanderesse. Le 25 d\u00e9cembre 1930, la signataire de ce billet mourut apr\u00e8s avoir fait un testament, en date du 11 f\u00e9vrier 1930, ainsi que deux codicilles, instituant Z\u00e9phirin Pesant son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et les autres d\u00e9fendeurs, ses enfants, l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires universels avec la demanderesse. La succession ayant refus\u00e9 de payer le billet, la demanderesse a poursuivi l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire et les l\u00e9gataires universels, tant personnellement qu\u2019\u00e8s-qualit\u00e9.\nLes h\u00e9ritiers s\u2019en sont rapport\u00e9s \u00e0 justice, et l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire a contest\u00e9, pr\u00e9tendant que le billet en question n\u2019est pas d\u00fb, ne repr\u00e9sentant aucune consid\u00e9ration valable ou l\u00e9gale, a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pendant la maladie r\u00e9put\u00e9e mortelle de la signataire, constituant une donation \u00e0 cause de mort, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu sous de faux pr\u00e9textes; que d\u2019ailleurs cette donation, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas dans la forme notari\u00e9e et n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e dans la m\u00eame forme et n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e, n\u2019a aucune valeur, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait faite que pour n\u2019avoir effet qu\u2019\u00e0 cause de mort; qu\u2019en outre, lors de la signature du billet, Dame Emma Martineau \u00e9tait physiquement et intellectuellement incapable de consentir valablement \u00e0 une donation semblable et ne pouvait r\u00e9sister aux suggestions indues, \u00e0 la captation et aux fausses repr\u00e9sentations de la demanderesse; qu\u2019\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, si elle consentit ce billet \u00e0 demande, ce ne fut que sur la repr\u00e9sentation et entente que ce montant de $10,000 serait \u00e0 prendre sur le total de sa succession lors du partage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019action est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e.\nEn r\u00e9ponse, la demanderesse a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par sa m\u00e8re pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration; que cette derni\u00e8re, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, lui payait une pension alimentaire pour l\u2019aider comme veuve charg\u00e9e de quatre enfants; il est vrai que la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e une des l\u00e9gataires universels r\u00e9siduaires de la succ\u00e8ssion de sa m\u00e8re, mais que le partage ne doit se faire que dans environ six ans, savoir \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 du plus jeune des enfants; que sa m\u00e8re, quelque temps avant la date du billet, apr\u00e8s la mort du fianc\u00e9 de la demanderesse, constata que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019avait rien et serait dans le besoin, si sa m\u00e8re ne pourvoyait pas \u00e0 lui payer un montant raisonnable pour sa subsistance et celle de ses enfants, surtout durant l\u2019intervalle qui devait s\u2019\u00e9couler avant le partage des biens de ladite succession. Ce billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti volontairement, en parfaite connaissance de cause, pour acquitter une obligation morale et naturelle envers la demanderesse de la part de sa m\u00e8re qui savait parfaitement qu\u2019elle s\u2019engageait \u00e0 payer la somme de $10,000, puisqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 sa fille de ne pas r\u00e9clamer le billet avant l\u2019expiration de quatre mois de la signature du billet.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que:\n1\u00b0 dans les circonstances, il ne s\u2019agit ni d\u2019une donation entre vifs, ni d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort;\n2\u00b0 la m\u00e8re devait une pension alimentaire \u00e0 sa fille sans moyens, et en reconnaissant cette obligation l\u00e9gale, elle signa le billet en question; il y avait donc valable consid\u00e9ration;\n3\u00b0 l\u2019on peut consid\u00e9rer ce billet comme un don manuel parce que le titre y repr\u00e9sente la chose et offre une valeur propre r\u00e9alisable par le d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier;\n4\u00b0 il est vrai que Dame Martineau \u00e9tait malade depuis longtemps, d\u2019une maladie tr\u00e8s grave dont, t\u00f4t ou tard, elle devait mourir; mais son intelligence \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e intacte.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement cass\u00e9 ce jugement pour les consid\u00e9rations suivantes:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930, lors de la signature du billet qui fait la base de Faction, Madame Z\u00e9phirin Pesant \u00e9tait gravement malade depuis plusieurs mois, qu\u2019elle gardait le lit depuis longtemps, que la maladie dont elle \u00e9tait atteinte \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme mortelle, et que, de fait, elle est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 25 d\u00e9cembre 1930;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la demanderesse admet que sa m\u00e8re \u00e9tait consciente de la gravit\u00e9 de sa maladie et qu\u2019elle savait qu\u2019elle en mourrait;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, bien que le billet f\u00fbt fait payable \u00e0 demande, la signataire avait exig\u00e9 que le paiement n\u2019en fut demand\u00e9 que quatre mois apr\u00e8s sa signature, et que la demanderesse avait accept\u00e9 cette condition;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, de fait, la demanderesse n\u2019a fait conna\u00eetre l\u2019existence de ce billet \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs que quatre mois apr\u00e8s la date du 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930; et bien qu\u2019elle ait assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire de la succession fait par le notaire Isidore Coupai, elle n\u2019a fait aucune mention de ce billet; Consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il r\u00e9sulte du t\u00e9moignage de la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame, que sa m\u00e8re lui a donn\u00e9 ce billet pour assurer sa vie, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle serait partie elle-m\u00eame, et que sa m\u00e8re aurait consenti ce billet, parce que \u201celle avait des regrets de ne pas lui avoir donn\u00e9 des biens comme les autres\u201d, et qu\u2019elle aurait ajout\u00e9: \u201cSi tu veux accepter mon billet, je ne puis pas te donner autre chose pour le pr\u00e9sent.\u201d\nConsid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9funte, Madame Pesant, ne devait rien \u00e0 sa fille \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, si ce n\u2019est l\u2019obligation naturelle et l\u00e9gale qu\u2019elle pouvait avoir de lui aider dans ses besoins;\nConsid\u00e9rant que Madame Pesant, en signant ce billet de $10,000, n\u2019a pas voulu s\u2019engager elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 en faire le paiement, mais a entendu le mettre \u00e0 la charge de sa succession;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019on reconna\u00eet bien, dans les circonstances qui ont accompagn\u00e9 et pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la signature du billet, dans les d\u00e9clarations faites par la d\u00e9funte, les traits caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une donation \u00e0 cause de mort; la donatrice manifestant clairement qu\u2019elle continuait de se pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la donataire, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019entendait pas payer elle-m\u00eame le montant du billet, mais qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait la donataire \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers, vu qu\u2019elle mettait le paiement de ce billet \u00e0 leur charge;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930, Madame Pesant, sachant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une maladie mortelle, ne pouvait pas faire une telle donation, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, le billet sur lequel la demanderesse fonde son action, n\u2019a aucune valeur l\u00e9gale, est nul et doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 tel par cette Cour;\nConsid\u00e9rant que, par les conclusions de la d\u00e9fense, il est demand\u00e9 que le billet soit annul\u00e9, et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul et de nul effet; qu\u2019il y a lieu de faire droit \u00e0 ces conclusions;\nConsid\u00e9rant, de plus, qu\u2019aux termes du testament de ladite feu Dame Pesant, ses biens ne doivent pas \u00eatre partag\u00e9s avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de majorit\u00e9 du plus jeune de ses enfants, et que jusque-l\u00e0, c\u2019est l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur-testamentaire, seul, qui en a la saisine;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019en regard des termes de ce testament, les actions qu\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier peut avoir contre la succession, ne peuvent \u00eatre institu\u00e9es que contre l\u2019ex\u00e9cuteur-testamentaire, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, en mettant en cause les autres l\u00e9gataires;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les conclusions de l\u2019action telles que formul\u00e9es contre les d\u00e9fendeurs conjointement et tant personnellement qu\u2019\u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, ne sauraient \u00eatre accueillies;\nSur la question de la capacit\u00e9 mentale de la d\u00e9funte, les deux cours sont d\u2019accord pour repousser les pr\u00e9tentions des intim\u00e9s. La Cour du Banc du Roi consid\u00e8re qu\u2019en signant ce billet Madame Pesant savait parfaitement ce qu\u2019elle faisait, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas voulu s\u2019engager elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 en faire le paiement, mais aurait entendu le mettre \u00e0 la charge de sa succession et aurait manifest\u00e9 clairement cette volont\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu pour nous d\u2019intervenir, et nous devons consid\u00e9rer ce moyen de d\u00e9fense comme non \u00e9tabli.\nIl n\u2019y a aucune preuve de captation; et la seule question qui reste \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est celle-ci:\nSommes-nous en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une donation, de sa nature, essentiellement gratuite, ou la d\u00e9funte a-t-elle li\u00e9 ses h\u00e9ritiers par une obligation civile ordinaire constat\u00e9e par billet promissoire qui en fait preuve?\nJusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mort, Madame Pesant pouvait s\u2019endetter et, en ce faisant, elle est cens\u00e9e avoir stipul\u00e9 pour elle-m\u00eame et ses h\u00e9ritiers ou repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, \u00e0 moins que le contraire ne soit exprim\u00e9 ou ne r\u00e9sulte de la nature du contrat (art. 1030 C.C.). Sa promesse de payer est-elle une dette recouvrable en vertu de la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 cette promesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, devait \u00eatre remplie, et, au besoin, poursuivie. Voir: Hutchison v. Royal Institute for the Advancement of Learning[28].\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 982 C.C.,\nil est de l\u2019essence d\u2019une obligation qu\u2019il y ait une cause d\u2019o\u00f9 elle naisse, des personnes entre qui elle existe, et qu\u2019elle ait un objet.\nEt cette cause, nous dit l\u2019article 984 C.C., doit \u00eatre licite. Nous avons vu plus haut qu\u2019il nous faut consid\u00e9rer que les parties au contrat intervenu \u00e9taient capables et que leur consentement a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 l\u00e9galement.\nQuelle est la cause ou consid\u00e9ration, ce qui, dans l\u2019esprit de la d\u00e9funte, contre-balan\u00e7ait le fardeau qu\u2019elle assumait? Est-ce une pure lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9? Est-ce le d\u00e9sir de s\u2019acquitter d\u2019un devoir?\nEn vertu des articles 186 et 58 de la Loi des Lettres de change, toute partie dont la signature appara\u00eet sur le billet est prima facie cens\u00e9e devenue partie contre valeur. Les intim\u00e9s ont voulu prouver que l\u2019\u00e9mission en \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. La fraude, la captation et l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9es, les intim\u00e9s ont-ils prouv\u00e9 que la cause \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale ou illicite en vertu de notre code civil? C\u2019est le probl\u00e8me \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre.\nDans la cause de Larraway v. Horsey[29], les honorables juges Jett\u00e9, Ouimet et Pagnuelo,. si\u00e9geant en revision, ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sous l\u2019ancien article 2285 C.C.:\nIn the case of cheques and other negotiable instruments the presumption of law is that they are given for value received, though it be not so expressed in the instrument, and the burden of rebutting such presumption is on the party who denies that value was given. The evidence adduced to rebut the presumption of value must be clear and convincing: mere improbability of the existence of a debt is not sufficient.\nLes savants juges citent \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur d\u00e9cision le Septi\u00e8me Rapport des Codificateurs, comme suit:\nTo these authorities let us add that of the codifiers of our civil code, who, following the English rule, intended clearly, from their report, that value should be implied in every negotiable instrument, acceptance and endorsement, although the words \u201cvalue received\u201d were not inserted in it. Here is what they say in their 7th report on Commercial law; speaking of art. 7 of their draft on bills of exchange (art. 2285 C.C.), they say: \u201cThe only question which can arise under the article, when no value is expressed, is whether the onus of proving value should rest upon the holder of the bill or upon the party from whom payement is demanded. The prevailing opinion is that as a general rule, the value will be presumed, subject of course, to be disproved by the party having an interest in doing so. This is the rule of the English law, which is derived as a consequence from the other rule, that value need not be expressed.\u2019\u201d\nThe wording of art. 2285 C.C. does not, however, convey properly this intention, and was interpreted differently; the report, however, correctly gave the English law, which is summed up by Kent, Comm. vol. 3, p. 77, in these words: \u201cIt is usual to insert the words value received in a bill or note, but they are unnecessary, and value is implied in every negotiable bill, note, acceptance or endorsement; the burden of proof rests upon the other party, to rebut the presumptions of validity and value, which the law raises for the protection and support of negotiable paper.\u201d\nL\u2019article 58 de l\u2019Acte des Lettres de change est au m\u00eame effet. Les intim\u00e9s, d\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019ont compris de la sorte en assumant le fardeau de la preuve de leur plaidoyer.\nPouvons-nous dire qu\u2019ils ont repouss\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re claire et convaincante la pr\u00e9somption militant en faveur de l\u2019appelante? S\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un billet commercial, et non primitivement d\u2019une obligation civile ordinaire, devons-nous appliquer les r\u00e8gles du droit anglais ou celles de notre code civil dans la mati\u00e8re, en tenant compte de l\u2019article 2340 C.C. qui se lit comme suit:\nDans tout mati\u00e8re relative aux lettres de change pour laquelle il ne se trouve pas de disposition dans ce code ou dans les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, on doit avoir recours aux lois d\u2019Angleterre qui \u00e9taient en force le trente mai mil huit cent quarante-neuf.\nCette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e par la Cour de Revision, compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Loranger, Davidson et Tellier, dans la cause de Guy v. Par\u00e9 et al[30]. L\u2019honorable juge Davidson, dans un jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9, se s\u00e9para de ses coll\u00e8gues et refusa d\u2019accepter les \u201cConsid\u00e9rants\u201d suivants, que nous trouvons \u00e0 la page 454 du rapport:\nConsid\u00e9rant que les obligations civiles qui r\u00e9sultent du contrat intervenu sous forme de billet promissoire sont r\u00e9gies par le droit civil en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec; que c\u2019est une erreur de dire que notre code civil ne contient aucune disposition sur la mati\u00e8re qui fait l\u2019objet du litige; qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par l\u2019article 2340 du code civil, ainsi que l\u2019a jug\u00e9 la cour en premi\u00e8re instance;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019article 2340 du code civil tire sa source de la 12e Victoria, c. 22, et du c. 64, section 30 des Statuts Refondus du Bas- Canada, qui ne concernent que la forme, la n\u00e9gociabilit\u00e9 et la preuve des lettres de change et des billets promissoires; que la base de notre droit, en ce qui concerne ces effets de commerce, est, ainsi que le d\u00e9clarent les codificateurs dans leur septi\u00e8me rapport, l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, dont les dispositions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9es quant au fond et \u00e0 la substance du contrat, par nos lois statutaires ni par le code civil;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le billet promissoire est un contrat dont les effets civils sont soumis aux principes et aux r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le titre des obligations, et n\u2019est pas, comme le soutiennent les d\u00e9fenderesses, r\u00e9gi par des lois d\u2019exception quant \u00e0 sa substance;\nCette d\u00e9cision qui se rapportait \u00e0 une cause r\u00e9gie par les dispositions du code civil qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite abrog\u00e9es par la Loi des Lettres de Change (1890) a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie par les honorables juges Lafontaine, Weir et Panneton dans Stephen v. Perrault[31], confirmant en revision l\u2019honorable juge Coderre. Dans cette cause, l\u2019honorable juge (maintenant l\u2019ex-juge-en-chef) Lafontaine disait ceci, d\u00e9cidant qu\u2019une dette morale peut \u00eatre la consid\u00e9ration d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre:\nL\u2019affirmative, dans l\u2019opinion des membres de ce tribunal, semble certaine, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s qui sont concluantes.\n\u201cLa cause, en effet, nous dit Bigot-Pr\u00e9amenu, Expos\u00e9 des motifs, n\u00b0 27, r\u00e9sumant la doctrine de Domat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par les codificateurs, est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat r\u00e9ciproque des parties, ou * * *.\u201d On sait que cet int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre p\u00e9cuniaire ou mat\u00e9riellement appr\u00e9ciable, et que, suivant des auteurs, et de Larombi\u00e8re, vol. 1, n\u00b0 11, entre autres, on peut trouver la cause des conventions \u201cdans l\u2019intention de faire quelques sacrifices \u00e0 sa tranquillit\u00e9, \u00e0 sa consid\u00e9ration, \u00e0 la paix de sa conscience\u201d.\nC\u2019est aussi le langage d\u2019Aubry et Rau, vol. 4, p. 322: \u201cOn doit, disent ces auteurs si recommandables, m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre que le simple d\u00e9sir de satisfaire \u00e0 un sentiment d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, de conscience, de d\u00e9licatesse, ou d\u2019honneur, constitue dans les cas pr\u00e9vus au par. 297 une cause suffisante d\u2019engagement rentrant, par le fond comme par la forme, dans la classe des actes \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux.\u201d\n* * *\nA plusieurs reprises, les tribunaux de cette province ont fait l\u2019application de cette doctrine. Ainsi dans la cause de K\u00e9rouac v. Maltais[32], M. le juge Casault, en pronon\u00e7ant le jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la remise faite \u00e0 un failli par ses cr\u00e9anciers, dans un concordat, est compl\u00e8te comme dans toute autre remise, et ne laisse subsister aucune obligation naturelle, fait cependant ses r\u00e9serves quant au point qui nous occupe, et admet avec les auteurs que la promesse de paiement faite en ob\u00e9issance \u00e0 un simple sentiment d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, de conscience, de d\u00e9licatesse ou d\u2019honneur, est valide comme ayant une cause suffisante.\nTelle est la d\u00e9licatesse du droit fran\u00e7ais qui est le n\u00f4tre.\n* * *\nIl ne fait pas de doute, que, bien que la loi des lettres de change et billets soit une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale tir\u00e9e en grande partie de la loi anglaise, c\u2019est tout de m\u00eame notre droit fran\u00e7ais qui s\u2019applique en la mati\u00e8re, en vertu d\u2019une disposition expresse de cette loi, la clause 53 qui dit que toute cause suffisante pour donner validit\u00e9 \u00e0 un simple contrat est une cause suffisante d\u2019une lettre de change. Aussi les autorit\u00e9s du droit anglais qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es sur ce point n\u2019ont pas d\u2019application.\nEt Falconbridge (1929), Banking and Bills of Exchange, commentant la section 10 de la Loi des Lettres de change, qui se lit comme suit:\nThe rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, shall apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques.\ncontinuait\nThus it appears that notwithstanding the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act which purports to make the common law of England applicable to bills, notes and cheques, in cases not expressly provided for by the Act itself, effect is given to this provision in Canada only within the limits of what may be called the law of bills and notes in a strict sense, including of course the form, issue, negotiations and discharge of bills or notes, but not including all the consequences of, or all the rights or liabilities resulting from, the contracts entered into by parties to bills or notes. Beyond these limits there is a large field of law in which the rights and liabilities of parties to a bill or note transaction are governed by the; law of a particular province in accordance with the ordinary rules of conflict of laws.\nIl se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la cause de Guy v. Par\u00e9[33], cit\u00e9e plus haut, et \u00e0 celle de Cook v. Dodds[34]\nIl ne faut pas oublier d\u2019ailleurs qu\u2019en t\u00eate du livre IV du code civil, contenant les lois commerciales, l\u2019une des dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du code civil, l\u2019article 2278, dit que les principales r\u00e8gles applicables aux affaires commerciales qui ne sont pas contenues dans le pr\u00e9sent livre, sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les livres qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et nomm\u00e9ment dans les titres du troisi\u00e8me livre, entre autres, celui Des Obligations.\nDans Rawlings v. Galibert[35], cette cour semble avoir appliqu\u00e9 sans h\u00e9sitation les r\u00e8gles du code civil pour fixer l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019engagement pris par le signataire d\u2019un billet; et, de nouveau, dans la r\u00e9cente cause cit\u00e9e plus haut de Hutchison v. Royal Institute for the Advancement of Learning[36].\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment de la signature du billet la m\u00e8re devait et payait des aliments \u00e0 sa fille. Avait-elle aussi le sentiment d\u2019une obligation naturelle de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ceux de ses petits-enfants, apr\u00e8s que cette obligation l\u00e9gale cesserait? La demanderesse l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 sans \u00eatre contredite, et son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par le premier juge. D\u2019ailleurs, la jurisprudence et la doctrine reconnaissent l\u2019existence de cette obligation naturelle entre personnes li\u00e9es par l\u2019obligation alimentaire dans la mesure o\u00f9 la prestation fournie exc\u00e8de par sa nature ou par son importance ce que le droit civil permet d\u2019exiger. 7 Planiol & Ripert, p. 295.\nIl faut, en outre, tenir compte de l\u2019intention de celui qui agit sous l\u2019impulsion de sa conscience; car, en fait, la question de savoir s\u2019il y a obligation naturelle ne se pose qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019ex\u00e9cution volontaire ou la reconnaissance volontaire par le d\u00e9biteur; c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il a la pens\u00e9e d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 un devoir que l\u2019acte juridique qu\u2019il accomplit est rattach\u00e9 \u00e0 une id\u00e9e d\u2019obligation et non de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9. La croyance au devoir moral dans la pens\u00e9e de celui qui agit est donc aussi importante \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que sa r\u00e9alit\u00e9 m\u00eame. Idem, p. 290.\nOn pourrait donc dire, pour exprimer le syst\u00e8me de la jurisprudence moderne, rest\u00e9e fid\u00e8le aux id\u00e9es du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle, que l\u2019obligation naturelle comprend tout ce qui n\u2019est ni une obligation civile munie d\u2019action, ni une pure lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9; toutes les fois que ce qui est promis ou donn\u00e9 en dehors de toute obligation civile ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une donation inspir\u00e9e par une pure id\u00e9e de bienfaisance ou de gratification, la jurisprudence admet une obligation naturelle.\nLes m\u00eames auteurs nous disent, \u00e0 la page 294, que ce n\u2019est que dans les cas o\u00f9 le devoir d\u2019assistance prend une rigueur et une pr\u00e9cision particuli\u00e8res, qu\u2019il se traduit en obligations naturelles. C\u2019est ce qui se rencontre notamment dans les rapports de parent\u00e9 o\u00f9 l\u2019obligation naturelle appara\u00eet le plus souvent dans le prolongement de l\u2019obligation civile; et ils concluent en disant:\nLe moyen le plus d\u00e9cisif de reconna\u00eetre l\u2019existence de l\u2019obligation naturelle est de rechercher si l\u2019individu s\u2019est senti, au regard de sa propre conscience, ou devait se sentir, au regard d\u2019une conscience normale, d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 agir comme il l\u2019a fait par le sentiment d\u2019un devoir, et non pas enti\u00e8rement libre \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 d\u2019agir ou de ne pas agir.\nEn appliquant ce crit\u00e8re aux circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause, je crois que la m\u00e8re a senti cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019agir et a voulu remplir ce qu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait une obligation de conscience envers sa fille et ses petits-enfants. Elle ne pouvait lui payer le montant imm\u00e9diatement. Si ce paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, les h\u00e9ritiers ne pourraient certainement pas en exiger le remboursement; car, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 1140 du code civil:\nLa r\u00e9p\u00e9tition n\u2019est pas admise \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des obligations naturelles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement acquitt\u00e9es.\nL\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation naturelle peut faire l\u2019objet, non seulement d\u2019un accomplissement r\u00e9gulier par le paiement, mais aussi d\u2019une promesse valable et efficace. La promesse de payer engage civilement le d\u00e9biteur, de telle sorte qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019engagement d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de contrainte qui existait jusqu\u2019alors elle substitue un engagement qui pr\u00e9sente tous les caract\u00e8res de l\u2019obligation civile. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019exprime la jurisprudence en disant que les obligations naturelles peuvent servir de cause valable \u00e0 des obligations civiles. 7 Planiol & Ripert, page 301.\nEn dehors de toute obligation naturelle, on ne peut nier l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une promesse que fait une personne \u00e0 une autre. L\u2019existence de l\u2019obligation naturelle caract\u00e9rise la nature de la prestation promise. C\u2019est \u00e0 un paiement, et non \u00e0 une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 que s\u2019engage le promettant. La promesse peut donc \u00eatre faite sous une forme quelconque, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par un acte sous seing priv\u00e9. Planiol & Ripert, vol. 7, page 303.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a bas\u00e9 son jugement sur l\u2019article 762 du code civil:\nLes donations con\u00e7ues entre vifs sont nulles comme r\u00e9put\u00e9es \u00e0 cause de mort, lorsqu\u2019elles sont faites pendant la maladie r\u00e9put\u00e9e mortelle du donateur suivie ou non de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, si aucunes circonstances n\u2019aident \u00e0 les valider.\nEt l\u2019article 755 C.C. d\u00e9finit la donation entre vifs:\nLa donation entre vifs est un acte par lequel le donateur se d\u00e9pouille \u00e0 titre gratuit de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une chose, en faveur du donataire dont l\u2019acceptation est requise et rend le contrat parfait.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la donation, savoir la gratuit\u00e9, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9. Gratuit\u00e9 suppose l\u2019absence d\u2019obligation d\u2019agir et l\u2019id\u00e9e que le donateur ne recevra rien en retour. Or,\nun acte de disposition ne constitue pas une donation quand il a pour objet d\u2019acquitter une dette, soit civile, soit naturelle.\nAux actes contenant reconnaissance d\u2019une obligation naturelle, il faut assimiler les actes ayant pour objet l\u2019accomplissement d\u2019une obligation morale. C\u2019est ainsi, par exemple, que la constitution de rente viag\u00e8re consentie par un beau-fr\u00e8re, au profit de la s\u0153ur ut\u00e9rine de sa femme, qui \u00e9tait clans l\u2019indigence, ayant pour cause une obligation fond\u00e9e sur les lois morales de la d\u00e9licatesse et de l\u2019honneur, ne constitue pas une donation entre vifs; aussi a-t-elle pu \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e valable, quoique faite par acte sous seing priv\u00e9 (Douai, 6 mai 1825, et sur pourvoi, Req. 22, ao\u00fbt 1826, R, 1311). Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire, Vo. Donations entre vifs, p. 519, nos 8 et 9.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de Legris v. Beaulne[37], a \u00e9tabli les principes suivants:\n1. L\u2019obligation naturelle et la simple obligation morale suffisent pour faire de la donation un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux;\n2. Les engagements ainsi contract\u00e9s en vue de satisfaire \u00e0 une obligation naturelle ou morale sont valables sans l\u2019accomplissement des formes sp\u00e9ciales que la loi exige pour les donations;\n3. Le p\u00e8re qui promet de payer le prix d\u2019un terrain que son fils d\u00e9sire acheter, et aussi de payer le co\u00fbt de la construction de la maison que ce m\u00eame fils d\u00e9sire y construire, contracte un engagement suffisant pour engendrer une obligation civile, et le contrat qui se forme \u00e0 ce sujet est un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux;\n* * *\n5. L\u2019acte d\u2019un p\u00e8re qui, deux jours avant sa mort, donne \u00e0 son fils, deux ch\u00e8ques qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la banque et que cette derni\u00e8re refuse de payer, faute de fonds, ne constitue pas un don manuel.\nEt l\u2019honorable juge Carroll disait:\nUne telle reconnaissance constituerait, suivant nous, non pas une donation entre vifs, qu\u2019il faudrait soumettre aux formes solennelles et aux autres conditions que la loi a exig\u00e9es pour cette esp\u00e8ce d\u2019acte, mais seulement une obligation civile ordinaire, qui devrait \u00eatre, de tous points, r\u00e9gie par le droit comme des obligations. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019une gratuit\u00e9, d\u2019un don, mais d\u2019un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux.\nDans la cause de Drouin v. Provencher[38], le savant juge-en-chef Casault disait:\nL\u2019obligation naturelle et la simple obligation morale suffisent pour faire de la donation un contrat on\u00e9reux et lui \u00f4ter le caract\u00e8re de gratuit\u00e9 qui en fait une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et un don, soumis pour sa validit\u00e9, aux formes sp\u00e9ciales que la loi exige pour les donations.\nDu moment que les circonstances de la cause \u00e9cartent l\u2019id\u00e9e de donation gratuite, le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi manque de base. Je crois que Madame Pesant a voulu remplir vis-\u00e0-vis de sa fille:\n1\u00b0 son obligation alimentaire, qui la liait l\u00e9galement de son vivant;\n2\u00b0 un devoir de justice en pourvoyant \u00e0 ses besoins avant le partage de sa succession, qu\u2019elle avait retard\u00e9 par son testament jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 du plus jeune de ses enfante, ce qui d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, constitue un d\u00e9lai de six ans.\nPour remplir ce devoir de justice, li\u00e9e \u00e0 son obligation l\u00e9gale alimentaire, elle s\u2019est engag\u00e9e, sous la forme d\u2019un billet promissoire qui, \u00e0 sa face m\u00eame, la liait de son vivant. Cette obligation passe \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers.\nLe fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la demanderesse que sa m\u00e8re lui aurait demand\u00e9 de ne pas exiger paiement avant quatre mois ne change pas la nature de l\u2019obligation. M\u00eame si l\u2019appelante a consenti \u00e0 ne pas exercer son droit de se faire payer de ce billet promissoire avant quatre mois de sa signature, ceci n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019obligation contract\u00e9e par le billet payable \u00e0 demande.\nC\u2019est ce que cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 re Lacaille v. Corporation de Lacaille[39]; et, tout r\u00e9cemment, dans la cause de West-cott v. Luther[40], mon coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019honorable juge Lamont, s\u2019exprimait comme suit, au nom de la cour, au sujet de la pr\u00e9tention que le billet promissoire sign\u00e9 par le d\u00e9funt, payable \u00e0 un an de date, \u00e9tait vici\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 par une promesse,\u2014r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du billet,\u2014que ce dernier ne devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la mort du promettant:\nIt will be observed that nowhere did the deceased suggest that the note was not to be a present obligation in favour of the respondent. All he does is to request the respondent not to enforce his rights until after he himself has passed away. The acceptance by the respondent of these requirements amounts, as the Court of Appeal held, to no more than a collateral engagement on his part not to enforce his rights until the request had been complied with. That does not make the document any the less an unconditional promise in writing by the deceased to pay at a fixed time a certain sum of money to the respondent. There is no embiguity in the note itself. Its terms import a present and unqualified obligation and there is nothing in the evidence to justify the conclusion that the delivery of the note by the deceased was made conditional upon the fulfilment of his requests.\nLes circonstances de cette cause ressemblent beaucoup \u00e0 notre esp\u00e8ce, sauf que, ici, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une promesse de pr\u00e9senter le billet apr\u00e8s la mort de la d\u00e9funte, mais simplement d\u2019attendre quatre mois apr\u00e8s la signature du billet.\nLes intim\u00e9s nous disent que Madame Pesant savait, lors de la signature du billet qu\u2019elle mourrait avant l\u2019expiration de ce d\u00e9lai. C\u2019est une affirmation gratuite. Lors de la signature du billet, la d\u00e9funte \u00e9tait mieux de la crise dont elle avait souffert au mois de novembre et pouvait parfaitement avoir l\u2019espoir, comme bien des tuberculeux, de prolonger sa vie ind\u00e9finiment. En tout cas, il est s\u00fbr que rien au dossier ne prouve que la d\u00e9funte a stipul\u00e9 que le billet ne serait pay\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s sa mort, et ce contrairement aux faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s dans la cause de Rochon v. Rochon[41], o\u00f9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du ch\u00e8que avait admis qu\u2019il ne devait le pr\u00e9senter pour paiement qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la mort du d\u00e9funt.

In 1924 the appellant corporation, the \"Synod\", purchased for the purposes of a college certain blocks of land in the city of Edmonton, containing a little over eight acres, and erected college buildings on a portion thereof, and these have since been used by the Synod for the purposes of the college. In 1930 the Synod acquired, six other lots, now in question, which were not contiguous to the lands on which the college buildings were situated, and erected thereon four residences, or dwelling-houses, for the use of the professors of the college. No rent was charged or collected from the professors occupying these residences by the Synod, but the professors were entitled to occupy these residences only while engaged as professors of the college in the service of the Synod, and a condition of their engagement was that residence accommodation would be furnished them rent free. The professors had some duties to perform in the college at night, such, for instance, as superintendence and assistance to the students in their studies, and inspection of dormitories, and meetings of the faculty of the college. The six lots in question had an area of \u00b7572 acres and with 3\u00b7428 acres comprising the sites of the college and buildings, formed just 4 acres. Section 320 of the Edmonton Charter provides that \"All lands in the city shall be liable to assessments and taxation for both municipal and school purposes, subject to the following exceptions: * * *\n(5) The land not exceeding four acres of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any * * * college, * * * so long as such land is actually used and occupied by such institutions, but not if otherwise occupied.\"\nHeld, Cannon and Crocket JJ. dissenting, that the appellant was not exempted from taxation as to the lots upon which the residence of its professors were situated.\nPer Duff C.J. and Lamont and Hughes JJ.\u2014Assuming in the appellant's favour that the professor's residences were \"bona fide used in connection with and for the purpose of\" the college, it has not been established from the facts as disclosed in the special stated case, (and the onus was on the appellant to bring itself strictly within the provision of the statute granting immunity) that these residences were \"actually used and occupied by\" the appellant institution, and \"not otherwise occupied\".\nPer Duff C.J. and Lamont and Hughes JJ.\u2014Section 320 does not give to an institution to which an exemption is granted the right to select the various pieces of property up to four acres to which the exemption would apply; under the Act, in the absence of any statutory provision indicating that the selection of the exemptions under the section may be made by the donee thereof and for giving notice of the same to the assessor, it is the assessor's duty to select the exemptions.\nThe other portion of the appellant's land, i.e., the site of the college buildings and the land immediately surrounding them, was assessed as a block described as 8\u00b7107 acres with the added words \"4\u00b7107 taxable, 4 acres exempt\".\nPer Duff C.J. and Lamont and Hughes JJ.\u2014Such an assessment is invalid as it is impossible to ascertain from that description which particular piece of land is assessed and which is exempt.\nPer Cannon J. dissenting.\u2014According to the facts disclosed in the special stated case, the land and the professors' residences erected thereon were exempted from taxation under section 320 of the Edmonton charter. These facts and the plans fyled in the case established that the residence of the principal of the institution was a building used and occupied by him in connection and for the purposes of the college; and there is no difference in the present case, between the nature of the occupation of the principal's residence and that of the professors'. Their presence was required and their residence in close proximity was necessary for the due carrying out of the purposes for which the appellant institution has been established.\nPer Crocket J. dissenting (concurring with Cannon J.).\u2014Whatever may be the meaning of the words \"attached to,\" the alternative words \"or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of\" point to other lots and buildings than those which may be contiguous or, to use the words of the enactment, \"attached to\" one another, and whether the lots and buildings are contiguous or not, the alternative words above quoted extend the statutory exemption to them if they are in fact bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any of the institutions designated.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1933] 2 W.W.R. 310) aff. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Ford J.[2], which was in favour of the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the head-note, in the statement below and in the judgments now reported.\nThe case was a special case stated by leave of the trial judge, of which the principal paragraphs are as follows:\n3. Section 320 of the charter of the plaintiff provides in part as follows:\n320. All lands in the city shall be liable to assessment and taxation for\nboth municipal and school purposes, subject to the following exemptions:\n* * *\n(5) The land not exceeding four acres of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any university, college, high school, public or separate school, seminary of learning or hospital owned by a corporation, whether vested in a trustee or otherwise, and of the association known as \"The Young Men's Christian Association\" and \"The Young Women's Christian Association\" so long as such land is actually used and occupied by such institution but not if otherwise occupied;\n(6) The land exempted under the two preceding clauses shall nevertheless be liable to be assessed for local improvements.\n15. In the year 1930 the said Synod caused to be erected four residences or dwelling houses for the use of the professors of the said college on the lots enclosed in red upon the said plan being lots 14, 15 and 16, in block 13, and lots 9, 10 and 11, in block 18, Bellevue subdivision aforesaid.\n16. The defendant acquired said lots enclosed in red and erected said residences under the belief that such lots and sufficient land upon which the college buildings were erected to the extent in all of four acres were exempt from taxation except local improvement taxes.\n17. The four buildings mentioned in paragraph 15 are residences or dwelling houses and are used solely and exclusively as residences or dwelling houses for the professors of the said college in the service of the said Synod; no rent is charged to or collected from the said professors occupying the said residences or dwelling houses by the said Synod and the said professors are entitled to occupy said residences or dwelling houses only while engaged as professors of the said college in the service of the said Synod as aforesaid and a condition of the engagement of the said professors is that residence accommodation be furnished to them rent free.\n17a. That the professors who reside in the said residences have duties to perform in the said college at night, such for instance as supervision and assistance of students during study periods in the evening, the supervision of student activities, the inspection of the dormitories at retiring time and the inspection of the college buildings, meetings of the faculty of the college and such other duties as may be assigned to such professors.\n25. The question submitted for the opinion of this Court is: is the said Synod by reason of the provisions of said Section 320 of the Edmonton charter entitled to the exemption from taxation except for local improvements, of the said lots 14, 15 and 16, block 13, and said lots 9, 10 and 11, block 18, and 3\u00b7428 acres containing the site of the said college buildings and immediately surrounding said college buildings, or is the said City of Edmonton entitled to assess the said Synod in the manner in which it is assessed on the Assessment Roll of 1931 and 1932?\nS. Bruce Smith for the appellant.\nGeo. B. O'Connor K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff C.J., Lamont and Hughes JJ.) was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be dismissed. The question which we are called upon to answer is set out in the special case in these words:\n25. The question submitted for the opinion of this Court is: is the Synod by reason of the provisions of said section 320 of the Edmonton charter entitled to the exemption from taxation except for local improvements, of the said lots 14, 15 and 16, block 13, and said lots 9, 10 and 11, block 18, and 3\u00b7248 acres containing the site of the said college buildings, or is the said city of Edmonton entitled to assess the said Synod in the manner in which it is assessed in the assessment Roll of 1931 and 1932?\nThe material facts are briefly as follows:\nIn 1924 the appellant corporation (hereinafter called the \"Synod\") purchased for the purposes of the college block X, and block 33, as shewn on plan 2677-Q, of the city of Edmonton, containing a little over eight acres, and erected college buildings on a portion thereof, and these have since been used by the Synod for the purposes of the college.\nIn 1930 the Synod acquired the six lots now in question which are not contiguous to the lands on which the college buildings are situated, and erected thereon four residences, or dwelling-houses for the use of the professors of the college. No rent is charged or collected from the professors occupying the said residences by the Synod, but the professors are entitled to occupy these residences only while engaged as professors of the college in the service of the Synod, and a condition of their engagement is that residence accommodation shall be furnished them rent free.\nThe professors have some duties to perform in the college at night, such, for instance, as superintendence and assistance to the students in their studies, and inspection of dormitories, and meetings of the faculty of the college.\nThe six lots in question have an area of \u00b7572 acres and with 3\u00b7428 acres comprising the sites of the college and buildings, form just 4 acres. Whether the six lots in question are exempt from taxation depends upon the provisions of the exempting statute, which is section 320, subsection(5), of the Edmonton charter, the material portion of which reads as follows:\n320. All lands in the city shall be liable to assessments and taxation for both municipal and school purposes, subject to the following exceptions:\n(5) The land not exceeding four acres of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any * * college, * * * so long as such land is actually used and occupied by such institutions, but not if otherwise occupied.\nUnder this statutory provision, before the Synod is entitled to have its lands to the extent of four acres exempt from taxation, it must be shewn that\n1. the land is bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of the college; and\n2. the land is actually used and occupied by the institution. Without deciding the point I will assume in the Synod's favour that the professors' residences are bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of the college. That, however, is not the only condition of the exemption: to be entitled to the exemption they must be \"actually used\" and \"occupied\" by the institution, and not otherwise occupied. On the facts as disclosed in the special case is it possible to conclude that the college actually used and occupied these residences? That is the condition imposed by the legislature, and the onus is on the Synod to shew that the condition has been complied with. The Act grants immunity from a burden which most other inhabitants are called upon to bear, and those who claim the benefit of that immunity must bring themselves strictly within the purview of the statute granting it, and shew that the facts, as set out in the case, construing the words in their ordinary sense, do justify the conclusion that the institution did occupy the residences within the meaning of what is ordinarily understood as \"occupying\" a residence.\nIt was a term of a professor's engagement that \"residence accommodation be furnished\" him \"rent free.\" It is, therefore, to be inferred that his occupation was in accordance with the terms of his engagement. The facts disclosed in the special case leave no room for an inference that a professor in his occupation is not to enjoy all the independence and all the control of the residence which he occupies that a tenant of his class would be entitled to enjoy if he rented the premises. Although he does not pay any rent it cannot be supposed that the furnishing of a free dwelling-house did not constitute a part of the remuneration which the Synod, when it engaged him, agreed to allow him for his services. Had the Synod not agreed to furnish residence free, the remuneration which it would have had to pay its professors would have been increased by the value of the occupation of their dwelling-houses. So that while it may be that the Synod did not collect rent for these residences qua rent it reached the same result by agreeing to furnish residence with a smaller monetary remuneration.\nThere is nothing in the statement of fact to justify even a suggestion that the professors occupied their residences as servants of the Synod. Yet, if they were not the servants of the Synod, how can it be said that the dwellings were occupied by the \"institution,\" and not \"otherwise occupied\"? In my opinion the dwellings were occupied by the professors, who exercised all the rights and all the independence of an ordinary householder. It is not shewn that the Synod had any right to interfere in any way with a professor's occupation of his house so long as he occupied the position of professor in the college. The Synod was, therefore, not entitled to exemption in respect of the six lots.\nIt was also argued on behalf of the Synod that the effect of section 320 was to give to the institution to which an exemption was granted the right to select the various pieces of property up to 4 acres to which the exemption would apply. Along with the members of the court below I am unable to see any authority for the proposition that the party claiming the exemption has the right of selection. The right to make the selection, in my opinion, is governed by the same principle as the claim for exemption itself. It is a benefit which is allowed to only a few of His Majesty's subjects and, in order to be entitled to it, the onus rests on the claimant to shew clearly that it was the intention of the legislature that such right of selection should exist. I find absolutely nothing in the legislation from which an inference can reasonably be drawn that such was the legislative intention. In fact if that had been the intention it is surprising that no provision is to be found in the statute by which the Synod would be able to give notice to the assessor that the selection had been made. The assessment roll should shew definitely what property is exempt, and what property has been assessed. To set these out is the duty of the assessor. In the absence of any statutory provision indicating that the selection of the exemptions under the section may be made by the donce thereof and for giving notice of the same to the assessor, I am of opinion that it is the assessor's duty to select the exemptions.\nAs to the assessment of the property of the Synod other than the six lots, I agree with the court below that it is invalid. The land is assessed as a block which is described as containing \"8\u00b7107 acres\" with the additional words \"4\u00b7107 acres taxable 4 acres exempt \". It is impossible to ascertain from this description which particular piece of land is assessed and which is exempt.\nCANNON J. (dissenting).\u2014The dwellings built for the professors are occupied by them not as ordinary tenants, but are placed at their disposal, rent free, while they are in service for the purposes set forth in the stated case which require their residence in close proximity in order to perform some of their duties at night. The education of the students requires from the teachers close supervision, assistance and inspection at night and this has as much importance as the bare teaching given during the day. The exemption is granted to lands (a) owned and attached to, or (b) owned by and otherwise used in connection with and for the purposes of any seminary of learning.\nThese are the important words\u2014which are not, to my mind, nullified by the redundance found at the end of the exemption clause. As long as the land is actually used and occupied bona fide in connection with and for the purposes of the school, it should be exempt, if within the four acres selected. The selection was made, with the knowledge and consent of the city authorities, and we are not called upon to decide, in the abstract, who, under the statute, is entitled to segregate for exemption the four acres of land\u2014including the buildings erected thereon\u2014by and for the purposes of the school. The only question is: the selection having been made, is the site of these four residences entitled to exemption under the statute? A college cannot exist without professors in close touch with the students and the principal. It is common ground that under the statute the residence of the principal is used and occupied for the purposes of the college and therefore exempt. The blue print shewing the situation of the properties involved in the case includes, enclosed in green, the residence of the principal to which reference is made as follows in the special case.\n21. The portions of block \"X\" and block 33 enclosed in green are bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of the said college and such land is actually used and occupied by the said college.\n24. The building marked \"A\" upon the said plan has been demolished and the orange coloured figure upon block \"X\" represents the residence of the principal of the said college which is used and occupied by him upon the same terms and conditions as the other residences are used and occupied by the professors of the said college.\nTherefore, for the decision of the case, this building is used and occupied by the principal in connection and for the purposes of the college and such land (including buildings) is actually used and occupied by the said college.\nI cannot differentiate, in the present case, between the nature of the occupation of the principal's residence and that of the professors'. Their presence is required, their residence in close proximity is necessary, according to the facts agreed upon, for the due carrying out of the purposes for which the appellant has been established. I do not say that there is any finding on that point in the judgment of the Appellate Division, but I base my reasoning on the facts agreed upon by the parties which, to my mind, have been ignored by the court a quo.\nI agree with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Ford and would allow the appeal with costs before this Court only, as there seems to be an understanding between the parties that no costs were to be given in the lower courts.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of a stated case and raises the question as to what portion of the defendant corporation's land in the city of Edmonton, if any, is entitled to exemption from taxation under s. 320, ss. 5 of the city of Edmonton charter. That subsection provides for the exemption from all municipal and school taxes, except taxes for local improvement, of\nThe land not exceeding four acres of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any university, college, high school, public or separate school, seminary of learning or hospital owned by a corporation, whether vested in a trustee or other wise, and of the association known as \"The Young Men's Christian Association\" and \"The Young Women's Christian Association\" so long as such land is actually used and occupied by such institution but not if otherwise occupied.\nIt is agreed in the stated case that the defendant in the years 1931 and 1932, with the assessments for which this action was concerned, was and still is the owner of several parcels of land in the city of Edmonton containing a combined area of more than eight acres. Two of these parcels of land are contiguous, and when acquired by the defendant in the year 1924 constituted the whole of what were then designated in the town plan of Edmonton as blocks X and 33. Block X extended northerly from Jasper St. past what was then the end of 111th Ave. to 112th Ave. Block 33, abutting it on the east, extended only from Jasper St. to 111th Ave. and was bounded on the east by the westerly line of 71st St. The defendant erected its college buildings partly in the centre of block 33, and partly in the southern portion of block X, the principal's residence being placed near the southwesterly corner of block X, 150 ft. or more from the college buildings proper.\nIn the year 1930 the defendant conveyed to the city a strip off the northerly portion of block X measuring approximately on 112th Ave. 375 ft. by 125 ft., which was afterwards subdivided into building lots, in exchange for several building lots conveyed to it by the city in the southern half of blocks 18 and 13, lying between Jasper St. and 111th Ave. The defendant had previously proposed in 1929 to erect four houses for the use of its professors on that portion of block X, which it subsequently conveyed to the city, but as the result of the exchange of the lots referred to, it erected in the year 1930 two residences for the purpose indicated on lots 9, 10 and 11 of block 18, and two others on lots 16, 15 and 14 of block 13. The lots 9, 10 and 11 in block 18 occupy the southwesterly part of that block and are separated from block 33 and block X, upon which the college buildings are situated, by five apparently vacant building lots, and by 71st St., running north and south, while lots 16, 15 and 14 in block 13 occupy the southwesterly portion of the latter block, and are separated from blocks 33 and X by 70th St., the whole southerly half of block 18 and 71st St. The six lots upon which the professors' residences were built contain a combined area of \u00b7572 acres, while block 33 and the southerly portion of block X lying between the southerly line of 111th Ave. and its prolongation westerly across the width of block X, upon which the college buildings proper and the principal's residence are situated, it is admitted, does not exceed three acres in area.\nIn the years 1931 and 1932 the city assessors assessed the six lots on which the professors' buildings were erected and all that portion of block X remaining in the possession and ownership of the defendant after the exchange with the city, and the whole of block 33\u2014a total in the last two blocks of 8\u00b7107 acres\u2014of which the assessment roll marked \"4\u00b7107 acres taxable\" and \"4 acres exempt,\" without indicating in any way what portion or portions of blocks X and 33 were included in the exemption otherwise than by setting against them $6,080 as the value of the land, and $3,000 as the land exemption, and $81,000 as the value of the buildings and $81,000 as the buildings exemption, leaving $3,080 as the net taxable value of the two blocks.\nThe defendant claimed that it was entitled to include within the exempted area of four acres the six lots on which the professors' houses were constructed, together with that portion of blocks X and 33 upon which the college buildings proper and the principal's residence are situated, and sufficient land around these buildings to make up the complement of the four-acre exemption, contending that the lots upon which the professors' houses were situated was its land bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of the college, within the meaning of s. 320, ss. 5, and that it was entitled to select the four acres to which the exemption should apply.\nThe question submitted on the stated case to Mr. Justice Ford of the Supreme Court of Alberta was, therefore, as follows:\nIs the Synod by reason of the provisions of said section 320 of the Edmonton charter, entitled to the exemption from taxation except for local improvements, of the said lots 14, 15 and 16, block 13, and said lots 9, 10 and 11, block 18, and 3\u00b7428 acres, containing the site of the said college buildings and immediately surrounding the said college buildings?\nHe answered this question in the affirmative, but on appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, his decision was unanimously reversed. The decision of the majority of the Appellate Division, Harvey, C.J.A.; Mitchell, Lunney and McGillivray, JJ.A., was based upon the ground that the land upon which the professors' residences are located is used and occupied by men who are in the employ of the institution, and that this does not constitute occupation by the institution, within the meaning of the section, and consequently that it does not come within the exemption. Clarke J. A., held that the defendant was not entitled to any exemption so long as its land used and occupied by it for the purposes of the college exceeds four acres in area, and that the city was entitled to assess the whole property without exemption.\nTwo paragraphs from the special case regarding the occupation of the residences by the professors and the latter's duties in connection with the college appear to be necessary to a full consideration of the question involved. These are paragraphs 17 and 17A, which read as follows:\n17. The four buildings mentioned in paragraph 15 are residences or dwelling houses and are used solely and exclusively as residences or dwelling houses for the professors of the said college in the service of the said Synod; no rent is charged to or collected from the said professors occupying the said residences or dwelling houses by the said Synod and the said professors are entitled to occupy said residences or dwelling houses only while engaged as professors of the said college in the service of the said Synod as aforesaid and a condition of the engagement of the said professors is that residence accommodation be furnished to them rent free.\n17a. That the professors who reside in the said residences have duties to perform in the said college at night, such for instance as supervision and assistance of students during study periods in the evening, the super-vision of student activities, the inspection of the dormitories at retiring time and the inspection of the college buildings, meetings of the faculty of the college and such other duties as may be assigned to such professors.\nThe respondent in its factum relies upon the following four grounds:\n1. The professors' houses are separated from the main college site and the right of selection of exemption up to four acres if in the appellant is confined to the main college site.\n2. The professors' houses being used solely and exclusively as residences are not \"bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of the college\" within the meaning of subsection(5).\n3. The lots and residences are not \"actually used and occupied by the institution\" within the meaning of said subsection(5).\n4. In any event the exemption is confined to land and the houses are not exempt.\nThe fourth point is the one which naturally first arises, and it will, therefore, be convenient to consider this first, although neither the trial judge nor the Appellate Division appear to have considered it in their reasons. It is not questioned that it is open to the respondent.\nThis contention is based upon the fact that the Edmonton charter, as amended by c. 23, statutes of Alberta, 1913, did not contemplate the taxation of buildings, except in the case of special franchises, as clearly appears by s. 3 of part I and the whole statute. It is argued that the meaning of the words \"the land not exceeding four acres,\" etc., of s. 320, ss. 5, as it then stood in the charter, was not affected by the amendment which was made to the charter in the year 1918, c. 52, statutes of Alberta, s. 44, which provided for the assessment of buildings.\nIt appears, however, that in 1917 an amendment was enacted to the charter by c. 46, statutes of Alberta, providing for a plebiscite on the question of assessing buildings and business incomes. By this Act, s. 321 of the charter, which then provided that\nland shall be assessed at its fair actual value exclusive of the value of buildings and improvements thereon,\nwas amended by inserting immediately after these words the words\nunless the buildings and improvements shall become assessable as hereinafter provided,\nand by adding two subsections to the same section, ss. 2 providing for the plebiscite on the question of the assessment of buildings, and ss. 3 providing for a plebiscite on the question of the assessment of business incomes. The words, \"unless the buildings and improvements shall become assessable as hereinafter provided,\" clearly referred to the event of the adoption as a result of the plebiscite of the proposal to assess buildings, and are still retained in s. 321 of the charter as it stands to-day, making the first sentence thereof read as follows:\nLand shall be assessed at its fair actual value exclusive of the value of buildings and improvements thereon unless the buildings and improvements shall become assessable as hereinafter provided; thus clearly contemplating that whenever buildings and improvements become assessable, they become so as part of the land.\nThe provision for the assessment of buildings in 1918 was made by the addition to s. 321 of a new section\u2014321A, reading as follows:\nIn the year 1918 and in each subsequent year all buildings and improvements on the land within the city shall be assessed at sixty per centum of their actual value, which shall be the amount by which the value of the land is thereby increased;\nThis added section, as it appears in the printed consolidated charter of 1931, filed in this case, contains, in addition to the main section just quoted, three subsections, nos. 2, 3 and 4, ss. 4 reading in part as follows:\nIn assessing land having any buildings thereon, the assessment value of the land and buildings as hereinbefore defined shall be ascertained separately and shall be set down separately in the assessment roll either in the same or separate columns, and the assessment shall be the sum of such values.\nThe underlined words of the main section\u2014321A\u2014and of ss. 4 thereof, quite as plainly indicate, I think, as those of the amended sec. 321, that, although the value of the land and buildings is to be ascertained separately and that they shall be set down separately in the assessment roll, the assessment shall be treated as an assessment of the land, inclusive of the buildings. The effect of these amendments, therefore, must be to render entirely inoperative the words \"but in no other cases,\" in clause (d) of s. 12, following the words \"in case of special franchises,\" and thus to give the word \"land\" the meaning which but for these words it would, undoubtedly, bear, including buildings and improvements. The city itself, by its assessors, seems to have consistently acted upon that interpretation in its assessment of the college from the beginning. I find it, therefore, impossible, to accede to the proposition that the words \"land not exceeding four acres,\" as it now reads in s. 320, ss. 5, do not apply to land, whose value has been increased by the erection upon it as part of the freehold of buildings and permanent improvements.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the word \"land\" in the exemption subsection includes all buildings affixed thereto.\nAlthough the four points relied upon by the respondent in its factum do not seem to include the ground taken by Clarke J.A., in his reasons for judgment, the respondent's counsel explicitly took it upon this appeal, viz: that because the college lands exceed in area the four acres to which the exemption is limited, they are not entitled to exemption at all.\nIt is true that the Act does not indicate how or by whom the area of exemption is to be selected, but this in my opinion is not a sufficient reason for limiting the exemption to cases where the college or other institution owns and occupies no more than four acres of land and thus construing the ownership and use of no more than four acres as a condition without which the exemption is not to apply at all. If that were the true construction, no college or seminary of learning or hospital could extend its land holding beyond four acres without entirely forfeiting its right to the exemption which the legislature, in my opinion, clearly intended to give it. I think the more reasonable view is that the words \"land not exceeding four acres,\" etc., mean land to the extent of four acres.\nIn the Mayor, etc., of Whanganui v. Whanganui College Board[3], the Court of Appeal of New Zealand considered a clause in the New Zealand Rating Act, which excepted from the payment of rates \"land and buildings used for a school * * * but so that within any borough or town district not more than four acres be used and occupied by or for the purpose of any such school.\" The Court unanimously held that the effect of these words\u2014which appear on their face to point much more directly to a condition than the enactment now under consideration\u2014was, if more than four acres were so held, to exempt up to four acres and not to destroy the exemption entirely. Any other construction, it was pointed out by two of the three judges taking part, would lead to such a manifest absurdity and repugnance as to justify the Court in ignoring the strict grammatical meaning of the language of the enactment.\nIn the present case the interpretation of the words \"not exceeding four acres\" in the sense indicated does no violence to the grammatical construction of any language used in the enactment.\nOnce the selection of the four acres to which the exemption is to apply is made, either by the city assessors or by the owner, as it must be, the difficulties suggested by Clarke, J.A., as to the description and identification of the excess in case of a sale for non-payment of taxes, disappears. Counsel for the respondent conceded that if the view taken by Clarke, J.A., were erroneous, the defendant had the right to select the exempted area. This, I think, is true, for the reason that the exemption is intended for the benefit of the college. The other points relied upon by the respondent all concern the construction of the words \"of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any university, college,\" etc., and the concluding words of the subsection, \"so long as such land is actually used and occupied by such institution but not if otherwise occupied.\"\nThe subsection is certainly not a model of good phrasing, as will be seen when one tries to link the words \"the land * * * of and attached to\" with the various institutions named, whether as a group or separately or as buildings or bodies corporate. Whatever may be the meaning of the words \"attached to\" it is manifest that the alternative words \"or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of\" point to other lots and buildings than those which may be contiguous or, to use the words of the enactment, \"attached to\" one another, and that, whether the lots and buildings are contiguous or not, the alternative words above quoted extend the statutory exemption to them if they are in fact bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of any of the institutions designated. These words must be construed severally with reference to these various institutions. In the case of a university or a college which is a corporate institution, as the defendant's college is, they must be read as meaning lots and buildings, which are bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of a university or college as such an institution and in the ordinary and popular sense of the language the legislature has employed. There is nothing in the context to indicate otherwise. What then is the ordinary and popular meaning of the words \"bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of\" a university or a college as a corporate institution? Obviously they cannot refer to a physical connection of lots or buildings. They must, therefore, mean a use in connection with and for the purposes of the corporate institution in the wider sense. Whether the words \"in connection with\" qualify the words \"the purposes of\" or the words \"any university, college,\" etc., the result is the same. Subject to the four-acre limitation and to the concluding words of the section they embrace any use of lots and buildings made for legitimate university or college purposes, and would, in my opinion, include a resi- dence building provided by the college for its principal as they would a residence provided by and managed and controlled by the college for its students, whether physically attached to the college building proper or not, as they would also include, in the case of a hospital, a nurses' home for the use of its nurses. I can see no distinction between the case of a principal's residence and the case of professors' residences. The only suggested distinction is that the professors' residences are separated from the particular lots on which the college buildings are situated, and this fact, as I have already pointed out, does not exclude them from the exemption provision. As a matter of fact, the professors' houses, which were erected, are nearer to and more conveniently situated with reference to the college buildings proper than if they had been erected on the site first intended at the extreme northerly end of block X.\nThere remains the question as to the effect of the concluding words of the subsection, viz: \"so long as such land is actually used and occupied by such institution, but not if otherwise occupied\" Are these words intended to alter the scope of the exemption as indicated by the preceding words \"bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of\" the university, college, etc.? It is contended that they limit the exemption to land which is actually used and occupied by the institution. That the concluding words must be interpreted in the light of the preceding words can hardly be denied. The preceding words indicate the character and scope of the use which must be made of the land of the college to entitle it to exemption, viz: that it be bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of the college. Do the words \"actually used and occupied by the institution,\" etc., mean anything more than the words \"bona fide used and occupied in connection with and for the purposes of\" the institution? In my opinion they do no more than define the duration of the exemption already created, and the residences cannot fairly, in the circumstances stated, be said not to be actually used and occupied in connection with and for the purposes of the college. They are used for the purposes of housing, rent free, professors of the college only while engaged in the service of the college as such professors\u2014professors who, in addition to their daytime duties, have duties to perform in the college at night, such as assist- ing the students during study periods and inspecting the dormitories at retiring time, as the stated case sets forth, and who are subject at all times to the orders of the principal. Although in a sense the residences may be said to be used and occupied by the professors, they are none the less bona fide used, as the learned trial judge has found, by the institution in connection with and for the purposes of the college, and are, in my opinion, actually used and occupied by it within the contemplation of the subsection, their use having a direct reference to the aims and objects of the college as a corporate institution.\nA number of English, Canadian and American cases were cited on the argument dealing with exemption claims under various rating statutes. In none of them is the language of the exemption provision involved identical with that of s. 320 of the Edmonton charter, or the facts the same as in the present case. These cases, therefore, are of little assistance in construing the provision here in question. For instance the respondent's counsel relied strongly on the decision of this Court in Ruthenian Catholic Mission v. Mundare[4], where the Court divided evenly on an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta holding that a building used by the appellant as a seminary was not a building used for church purposes within the meaning of s. 24 (d) of the Alberta School Assessment Act. It will at once be seen that there is no analogy between the words \"any building used for church purposes\" and the words \"land bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of\" any university or college as a corporate institution. In the Nova Scotia case, Catholic Corporation of Antigonish v. Municipality of Richmond[5], the exemption words were \"Every church and place of worship and the land used in connection therewith and every churchyard and burial ground.\" There were no such words as \"bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of\" a church in the sense of a corporate institution, or a religious denomination. The word \"church\" clearly meant a building used as a church or place of worship.\nThe case, which seems to me most nearly to approach the present case, is The Trustees of Phillips Academy v. Andover(1), in which the Supreme Court of Massachusetts considered the question as to whether the occupation of; resiliences belonging to the Academy by the president and professors and the officers of the institution and their families was necessarily inconsistent with the intent of the provision of a taxing Act exempting the real estate of educational and charitable institutions, \"occupied by them or their officers for the purposes for which they were incorporated.\" All of the judges agreed that the exemption contemplated an occupancy which \"must have or be supposed to have direct reference to the purposes for which the institution was incorporated and must tend directly to promote them,\" and further, that \"the occupancy does not lose what may be termed its institutional character and purpose because as incidental to it, the president and professors and other officers and their families are provided with homes, for the possession and enjoyment of which by them compensation is allowed or taken into account in some manner.\" It was contended that the inclusion of the words \"or their officers\" in the Massachusetts exemption provision, distinguished the Phillips Academy[6] case from the present. These words, I think, make no real difference inasmuch as a corporate institution cannot occupy land otherwise than by its officers or servants. It is a question in every case, having regard to all the facts and circumstances, and the intentions and purposes of those in charge of the institution, whether the dominant, controlling consideration of the use or occupancy of the buildings is really the enhancement of the educational advantages of the institution, or the private benefit and convenience of the professors and their families. The words \"bona fide used\" in the exemption clause in the present case point unmistakably to such a consideration as the determining factor.\nI should perhaps also refer to a passage used by Lord Davey in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Commissioners of Taxation v. Trustee of St. Mark's Glebe[7]. His Lordship, discussing the effect of the words \"for and in connection with,\" said:\nThe words \"for or in connection with\" (say) a hospital or a church are probably intended to include, not only the actual site of the hospital or church, but also other buildings or land occupied in connection with the principal building, as, for example, land used for a residence for the head or Minister, or a room for church meetings or other similar purposes.\nThis is doubtless a mere dictum, as contended by the respondent's counsel, but it is a dictum of very high authority, and one which, so far as I have been able to discover, has never been authoritatively challenged in a case where identical words were considered.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the decision of the learned trial judge with costs of this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1933] 2 W.W.R. 310.\n[2] [1932] 3 W.W.R. 275.\n[3] (1906) N.Z.L.R. 1167.\n[4] [1924] S.C.R. 620.\n[5] [1911] N.S.R. 320.\n[6] (1900) 55 N.E.R. 841.\n[7] [1902] A.C. 416.\n"}

It paid the sales tax on all cards sold, said tax being computed on the sale price of the cards exclusive of the excise tax imposed by section 82 of the Act. The Crown contended that the sales tax should have been computed on the sale price including the excise tax.\nHeld, Crocket J. dissenting, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1933] Ex. C.R. 204), that the excise tax should have been included in the sale price of such cards for the purpose of calculating the sales tax. The definition of \u201csale price\u201d in the Act (s. 85, ss. (a)) is very comprehensive: \u201csale price\u201d is inclusive of every item entering into the price just before the consumption or sales tax is added and must therefore include the excise tax.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting).\u2014A taxing statute is always to be construed strictly against the taxing authorities and a tax upon a tax ought not to be held to be imposed in the absence of language which leaves no doubt whatever as to the intention to impose it. The omission from the definition which the statute gives of the term \u201csale price\u201d of any mention of excise taxes, together with its inclusion of excise duties when goods are sold in bond and its express provision making the excise tax part of the duty paid value and of the sale price in the case of imported playing cards leaves the intention of Parliament in such doubt that the trial judge was fully warranted in resolving the question against the taxing authorities.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.[1], dismissing an action brought by the Attorney General of Canada to recover the sum of $2,611.58, which it was claimed was owing by the respondent as sales tax in respect of the sale of playing cards made from December 1st, 1931 to July 31, 1932.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and J. de M. Marler for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon and Hughes JJ.) was delivered by\nHughes J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Angers of the Exchequer Court of Canada dismissing an action brought by the Attorney-General of Canada to recover the sum of $2,611.58, which it was claimed was owing by the respondent in respect of sales of playing cards made from December, 1931, to July 31, 1932.\nDuring the period in question each pack of cards manufactured was subject to an excise tax imposed by Part XII of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 179, section 82, of which reads as follows:\u2014\nS. 82. There shall be imposed, levied and collected, an excise tax on playing cards for every fifty-four cards or fraction of fifty-four in each package, of ten cents per pack\n2. The excise taxes imposed by the preceding subsection shall be payable at the time\n(a) of importation or removal from warehouse for consumption in addition to the duties of customs; or\n(b) of sale by the Canadian manufacturer. Regulations 1 and 2 pertaining to Part XII are as follows:\u2014\n1. The tax of ten cents per pack shall be payable by means of excise tax stamps issued by the department of National Revenue.\n2. Excise tax stamps on playing cards manufactured in Canada shall be affixed to the individual packs and be cancelled, before the playing cards are removed from the premises of the manufacturer.\nBy section 86 (1) of the Act the respondent was liable to pay a consumption or sales tax of four per cent on the sale price of all goods (a) produced or manufactured in Canada payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof. On April 7th, 1932, a new subsection was substituted whereby the tax became six per cent.\nIt is conceded that the respondent paid sales tax during the period in question on its sales exclusive of the excise taxes imposed by virtue of section 82 of the Act. The appellant contends that the sales tax should have been computed on the sale price including the excise taxes. Two copies of invoices of the defendant were produced. Invoice exhibit 1 mentioned the excise tax separately from the remainder of the price, and the sales tax was computed on the total. Invoice exhibit 2 indicated the price, including the excise tax, in a lump sum. The respondent had charged its customers sales taxes on the prices including excise taxes, but explained that this was only as a protection in case the contention of the Crown were correct.\nIt is agreed that the amount in question is $2,611.58.\nSection 85 subsection (a) of the Special War Revenue Act defines the expression \u201csale price\u201d as follows:\u2014\n(a) \u201csale price\u201d, for the purpose of calculating the amount of the consumption or sales tax, shall mean the price before any amount payable in respect of the consumption or sales tax is added thereto, and shall include the amount of other excise duties when the goods are sold in bond; in the case of imported goods the sale price shall be deemed to be the duty paid value thereof.\nSubsection (b) of section 85 defines the words \u201cduty paid value\u201d as follows:\n(b) \u201cduty paid value\u201d shall mean the value of the article as it would be determined for the purpose of calculating an ad valorem duty upon the importation of such article into Canada under the laws relating to the customs and the customs tariff, whether such article be in fact subject to ad valorem or other duty or not, and in addition the amount of the custom duties, if any, payable thereon: Provided that in computing the \u201cduty paid value\u201d of tea purchased in bond in Great Britain the amount of the customs duty payable on tea for consumption in Great Britain shall not be included in the value of such tea for purposes of this Part; and that in the case of matches or playing cards, the excise taxes imposed by Parts X and XII of this Act shall be included in the duty paid value.\nThe respondent urged strongly that since excise taxes were expressly mentioned in the definition of \u201cduty paid value\u201d and not mentioned in the definition of \u201csale price\u201d except that the latter should include the amount of other excise duties when the goods were sold in bond, there was no intention on the part of the legislature that the sales tax should be imposed upon the sale price including excise tax. It must be kept in mind, however, that \u201cduty paid value\u201d has reference only to imported goods where there may not be a price at all, as for example, where there are being brought into Canada goods such as an automobile or painting purchased abroad. In the case of goods sold in bond, there may again be special circumstances requiring specific mention in the statute that \u201csale price\u201d shall include the amount of other excise duties. For example, a distiller sells a consignment of spirits to a purchaser such as a provincial liquor board, which purchaser has a bonded warehouse. The goods in such a case are sold in bond and the excise duty is not payable by the distiller at the time of sale, but is payable only when the purchaser removes them. The mention of excise duties by way of definition in respect of these special cases should not in the absence of plain language be held to cut down the wide definition of \u201csale price\u201d as given. The earlier part of section 85, subsection (a) provides that for the purpose of calculating the amount of the consumption or sales tax, \u201csales price\u201d shall mean the price before any amount payable in respect of the consumption or sales tax is added thereto. Now, as already indicated, regulation 2 pertaining to Part XII provides that the excise tax stamps on playing cards manufactured in Canada shall be affixed to the individual packs and be cancelled before the playing cards are removed from the premises of the manufacturer. Therefore the amount of the excise tax must truly be a part of the price of every package of cards leaving the premises of the manufacturer. The definition of \u201csale price\u201d in the statute is very comprehensive. \u201cSale price\u201d is inclusive of every item entering into the price just before the consumption or sales tax is added and must therefore include the excise tax. In Partington v. Attorney General[2], Lord Cairns said, page 122:\nI am not at all sure that, in a case of this kind\u2014a fiscal case\u2014form is not amply sufficient; because, as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: if the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed and that judgment should be entered for the appellant for $2,611.58 and costs throughout.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Angers of the Exchequer Court dismissing an information brought by the Attorney-General of Canada to recover the sum of $2,611.58, which it was claimed the defendant became liable to pay to His Majesty as sales tax in respect of the sale of playing cards from December 1st, 1931, to June 30th, 1932.\nThe defendant is a Canadian licensed manufacturer of playing cards, and, as such, paid sales tax on playing cards manufactured and sold by it during the period mentioned to the amount of $6,808.56. This amount represented 4 per cent on its sales down to the time of the coming into force of the amendment which was made in 1932 to the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, increasing the sales tax rate to 6 per cent, and 6 per cent on all sales subsequent to that date, but the sales prices on which the tax was paid did not include the special tax of ten cents per pack, imposed by s. 82 of the Act, though the invoice prices at which the playing cards were billed to its customers did include it.\nThe Crown contends that the defendant was not entitled to deduct the excise tax of ten cents per pack from the invoice price at which it billed its playing cards to its customers, and the $2,611.58 claimed in the information represents the additional amount the defendant would be required to pay on its sales during the period mentioned if the excise tax forms part of the sale price for the purpose of computing the sales tax. This is the whole question involved in the case, whether the excise tax is to be included in or excluded from the sale price for the purpose of computing the sales tax.\nThe excise tax is imposed, as already stated, by s. 82 of the Act. Ss. 2 of this section is as follows:\nThe excise taxes imposed by the preceding subsection shall be payable at the time\n(a) of importation or removal from warehouse for consumption in addition to the duties of customs; or\n(b) of sale by the Canadian manufacturer.\nSection 86 is the section which imposes the sales tax. Prior to the amendment of 1932, it read, in so far as is here material:\u2014\nIn addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Act or any other statute or law, there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of four per cent on the sale price of all goods.\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the times of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof.\nThe amendment of 1932 substituted for these words the following:\nThere shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of six per cent on the sale price of all goods,\n(a) produced or manufactured, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof.\nIt will be observed that the only change which the amendment effected beyond the substitution of the six per cent for the four per cent rate was the omission of the opening words, \u201cin addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Act or any other statute or law Whatever the significance of these words and their omission from the substituted section may be, I agree with the learned trial judge that the solution of the question with which he was concerned is to be found in the definitions which the Act itself gives of the words \u201csale price\u201d, and \u201cduty paid value\u201d in s. 85. \u201c \u2018Sale price\u2019,\u201d says this section,\nfor the purpose of calculating the amount of the consumption or sales tax shall mean the price before any amount payable in respect of the consumption or sales tax is added thereto, and shall include the amount of other excise duties when the goods are sold in bond; in the case of imported goods the sale price shall be deemed to be the duty paid value thereof.\n\u201cDuty paid value\u201d shall mean the value of the article as it would be determined for the purpose of calculating an ad valorem duty upon the importation of such article into Canada * * * Provided * * * that in the case of matches and playing cards the excise taxes imposed by Parts X and XII of this Act shall be included in the duty paid value. The definition of \u201csale price\u201d, as pointed out by the learned judge, excludes the sales tax and includes the amount of other excise duties when the goods are sold in bond, but makes no mention of excise tax, while in the case of imported goods it is provided that the sale price is to be deemed the duty paid value thereof, and in the case of matches and playing cards expressly enacts that the duty paid value shall include in addition to any customs duties payable thereon the excise tax imposed by s. 82.\nHad the statute itself not defined the term \u201csale price\u201d, it might well be argued that the sale price was what the purchaser paid to the vendor as consideration for the object of the sale and that since the purchaser had to pay the excise tax to the vendor, such excise tax should be treated as part of the purchase price. Since the statute, however, itself states not only what the term \u201csale price\u201d means, but what it includes and does not include, I am of opinion that the tax which Parliament has imposed as a sales tax upon the sale price of goods produced or manufactured in Canada ought not to be held to be imposed upon another special tax as part of such sale price, as in the case of the excise tax on playing cards, unless that special tax is clearly indicated in the statutory definition as part of the sale price upon which the sales tax is imposed. A taxing statute is always to be construed strictly against the taxing authorities, and, in my opinion, a tax upon a tax ought not to be held to be imposed in the absence of language which leaves no doubt whatever as to the intention to impose it. The omission from the statutory definition of any mention of excise taxes, together with its inclusion of excise duties when goods are sold in bond and its express provision making the excise tax part of the duty paid value and of the sale price in the case of imported playing cards, leaves the question in such doubt that I think the learned trial judge was fully warranted in resolving the question against the taxing authorities.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. A. Forsyth.\n[1] [1933] Ex. C.R. 204.\n[2] (1869) L.R. 4 H.L. 100.\n"}

Co. and Canadian National Ry. Co. of January 29, 1929 (schedule \u201cC\u201d to Northern Alberta Railways Act, c. 48 of Statutes of Canada, 1929)\u2014Construction\u2014Comparison of freight traffic for purpose of equal division between the parties to said agreement\u2014Grain shipped from stations on Northern Alberta Railways for export\u2014\u201cOutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d (article 7 of agreement).\nUpon the agreement made between the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. and the Canadian National Ry. Co. dated January 29, 1929, being schedule \u201cC\u201d to the Northern Alberta Railways Act, Statutes of Canada, 1929, c. 48, and upon the facts and circumstances existing with regard to traffic, rates and carriage, grain shipped from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways to Prince Rupert (reached by the Canadian National alone) or to Victoria (reached by the Canadian National by transporting loaded cars of grain on barges, but not so reached by the Canadian Pacific) for export, and exported from either of those ports (to, say, the United Kingdom), is \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d within the meaning of article 7 of said agreement, and is not to be excluded from the comparison of freight traffic for the purpose of the equal division to be made under said article 7. In the light of the objects of the agreement as ascertained from it as a whole, and the conditions the parties must necessarily have had in view, the words \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d should not be construed as limited to points on the lines of the parties or their connecting rail carriers to which the parties are prepared to handle traffic offered at equal rates.\nJudgment of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, 41 Can. Ry. Cas. 214, reversed.\nCrocket J. dissented.\nAPPEAL by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada) from the judgment (Order No. 50139) of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada[1] declaring that Prince Rupert is not a competitive point within the meaning of clause 7 of the agreement dated January 29, 1929, between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railway Company (which agreement is schedule \u201cC\u201d to the Northern Alberta Railways Act, ch. 48 of the Statutes of Canada, 1929), and that, until such time as the Canadian Pacific Railway Company files a, through tariff for export wheat to Victoria, the latter point is not competitive within the meaning of the said agreement.\nThe question of law upon which the Board granted leave to appeal, and to which the Board\u2019s judgment was, in effect, an answer in the affirmative, was as follows:\nWhether upon the agreement made between the Canadian National Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company on the 29th day of January, 1929, and the facts and circumstances hereinafter set forth, grain shipped from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways to Prince Rupert or to Victoria for export, and exported from either of those ports to, say, the United Kingdom, is to be excluded from the comparison of freight traffic for the purpose of the equal division to be made under article 7 of the agreement as not being \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d as the expression is used in said article.\nThe agreement is schedule \u201cC\u201d to ch. 48 of the Statutes of Canada, 1929. Clauses 2, 6, 7 and 11 (as being especially important) of the agreement are set out in the judgment of Duff C.J. now reported.\nThe facts and circumstances are set out in the order of the Board granting leave to appeal as follows:\n1. The Northern Alberta Railways comprise lines of railway situated in the northern part of the Province of Alberta, connecting with the Canadian Pacific Railway at Edmonton and with the Canadian National Railway at Edmonton and Morinville.\n2. They are the property of the Northern Alberta Railways Company, the capital stock of which is held by the Canadian National Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, jointly acquired by them under the authority of and pursuant to chapter 48 of the Dominion Statutes of 1929, and the agreements which form schedules \u201cA\u201d and \u201cC\u201d to that Act * * *\n3. The chief industry of northern Alberta is agriculture, and the principal traffic on the Northern Alberta Railways consists of grain shipped for export from Canada, which each of the railways, the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific, has at all times been desirous of securing for transport over its lines from the Northern Alberta Railways to the seaboard.\n4. The Pacific coast seaports from which grain is exported from Canada were and are Vancouver, New Westminster, Victoria and Prince Rupert, in the Province of British Columbia. Of these, Vancouver and New Westminster are reached by both the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway, and Prince Rupert by the Canadian National alone. Victoria is reached by transporting the loaded cars of grain on barges from Port Mann on the Canadian National Railway near Vancouver, the distance thereto being 78 miles. The Canadian Pacific does not undertake the carriage of grain to Victoria by such a service. The bulk of the grain carried by each railway to these ports for export is taken to and exported from Vancouver.\n5. The Canadian National\u2019s line to Prince Rupert was originally part of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and its line to Vancouver was originally part of the Canadian Northern Railway System. On September 2, 1925, coincidentally with the construction of the Government elevator at Prince Rupert, the Canadian National Railways issued a tariff of export grain rates from stations on its railway to Prince Rupert and these rates were the same as the export grain rates from the same stations to Vancouver (tariff No. W. 135-C, C.R.C. No. W. 357, Supplement No. 15). Under the same date export grain rates from points on the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway to Prince Rupert via the Canadian National Railways were also put into effect on a parity with similar rates via Canadian National Railways to Vancouver (A.G.W. No. 123, C.R.C. No. 105, Supplement No. 7). Upon the termination of the Alberta Government Agreement in 1926 the Canadian National published to Prince Rupert from points on the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia, Alberta and Great Waterways and Central Canada Railways, export rates on the Vancouver basis. (C.N. tariff No. W. 135-D, C.R.C. No. W. 432, Supplement No. 8). On October 12th, 1927, the Canadian National Railways published similar rates from points on the Pembina Valley Railway to both Vancouver and Prince Rupert, as shown in Supplement 1 to C.N. Rys. tariff W. 135-F, C.R.C. W. 546.\n6. At the time of their acquisition in 1929 the Northern Alberta Railways were owned or controlled by the Government of Alberta; part of them, known as the Pembina Valley Railway, having been constructed by the Government, and the remainder, consisting of the railways of The Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway Company, the Central Canada Railway Company and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, having come into its hands through the insolvency of those companies.\n7. From 1920 to 1926, as the result of the agreement set out in chapter 56 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1921, joint rates on grain shipped for export from stations on the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia and Central Canada Railways were established and maintained exclusively in connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway, and joint rates from stations on the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company in connection with both the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National companies. In 1926 the Government terminated the agreement and all joint tariffs in connection with the Canadian Pacific were cancelled, and from that time until the acquisition of the lines by the Northern Alberta Railways Company in 1929, under agreement dated November 11, 1926, * * * joint rates were maintained in connection with the Canadian National Railway Company exclusively.\n8. Since 1929 joint rates on grain have been published by the Northern Alberta Railways Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from stations of the former to Vancouver and New Westminster for export, and by the Northern Alberta Railways Company and the Canadian National Railway Company to Vancouver, New Westminster, Victoria and Prince Rupert for export (present C.N.R. Tariff No. W. 135-F, C.R.C. No. W-546 and supplements 36 and 42 thereto, and C.P.R. Tariff No. W-5769, C.R.C. No. W-2847 and supplements 37, 41 and 43 thereto). The rates in the foregoing tariffs from Canadian National and Canadian Pacific points to Vancouver were made under Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners No. 448 of August 26, 1927. The mileage from Edmonton to Vancouver via the Canadian National Railways is 765 miles, and via the Canadian Pacific is 836 miles. The mileage from Edmonton to Prince Rupert is 957 miles. In the calculation of the rates to Vancouver, the Canadian National mileage from Edmonton to Vancouver is taken by the Canadian Pacific as its mileage from Calgary to Vancouver. By reason of competition, the Canadian Pacific accepts for carriage via its line from Edmonton to Vancouver the same rate as the Canadian National receives for carriage via its shorter mileage. In order to place Prince Rupert on an equality with Vancouver, the Canadian National published the same rates to Prince Rupert as were effective over its own line to Vancouver, thus extending lower rates to Prince Rupert than required by General Order No. 448.\n9. These rates, and the terms and conditions of rail carriage, are the same from any Northern Alberta Railways station to all these seaports whether routed via Canadian National Railway or Canadian Pacific Railway.\n10. Export rates are lower than the domestic rates.\nFor example: The rates on grain and grain products, in carloads, from Grande Prairie on the Northern Alberta Railways to New Westminster and Vancouver via either the Canadian Pacific or the Canadian National, and to Victoria and Prince Rupert via the Canadian National, for export is 28 cents per one hundred pounds, while the domestic rate via either the Canadian Pacific or Canadian National is 52\u00bd cents per one hundred pounds to New Westminster and Vancouver, 55\u00bd cents per one hundred pounds to Victoria, and via the Canadian National to Prince Rupert 58 cents per one hundred pounds.\n11. Ocean rates on grain are not uniform, but by force of competition tend to equality.\n12. Grain shipped to any of the above mentioned ports for export is discharged by the railway into elevators at the said ports and there stored with grain of the same grade, and is no longer earmarked as grain of that shipment. When the shipper desires to export his grain an equivalent amount of grain of the same grade is subject to his order. The same practice is followed in all cases where grain is milled or stored in transit.\n13. The port of Churchill on the Canadian National Railways is a port of export on the Atlantic coast to which grain from points on the Northern Alberta Railways may be carried under C.N. tariff No. W-485A, C.R.C. No. W. 757. Outbound freight traffic to Churchill for export is dealt with by the Northern Alberta Railways Company for the purposes of article 7 of the agreement as being in the same category as similar traffic to Prince Rupert and Victoria.\n14. The question of law above stated came before the Board for determination upon the application of the Canadian National Railway Company. * * *\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nI. C. Rand K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Duff C.J. and Smith and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The appellants, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, obtained leave to appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners on the following question of law:\nWhether upon the agreement made between the Canadian National Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company on the 29th day of January, 1929, and the facts and circumstances hereinafter set forth, grain shipped from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways to Prince Rupert or to Victoria for export, and exported from either of those ports to say the United Kingdom, is to be excluded from the comparison of freight traffic for the purpose of the equal division to be made under article 7 of the agreement as not being \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d as the expression is used in said article.\nThe articles of the agreement requiring strict examination are those numbered 2, 6, 7 and 11. We quote them literally:\n2. Each of the parties hereto shall assume the payment of and be liable for one-half of the purchase price payable (with interest), and one-half of the obligations to be assumed by the purchasers under the said agreement, and shall be entitled to one-half of the benefits to be derived therefrom, it being the intention of the parties that the said agreement shall be for their equal benefit and advantage.\n6. Neither party shall directly or indirectly solicit the routing of outbound competitive traffic over their respective lines.\n7. The new company shall be required to route outbound freight traffic (including grain milled or stored in transit) originating on the lines of the new company and destined via Edmonton or Morinville to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties, in such a way that each of the parties shall receive on a revenue basis one-half the outbound freight traffic orgiinating and destined as aforesaid, including such freight traffic routed by the shipper as well as such freight traffic routed by the shipper. Comparisons on a revenue basis of the traffic so received by each of the parties shall be made monthly, and any inequality of division in any month shall be rectified in succeeding months. The foregoing provisions in respect to Freight Traffic shall apply also to outbound Express Traffic and Telegraph Traffic respectively, originating on the lines of the new company and destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties. For the purpose of the division of traffic in this paragraph provided for, Freight Traffic, Express Traffic and Telegraph Traffic shall be divided and dealt with separately.\n11. The parties agree to co-operate with fairness and candour toward each other, and to give effect to this agreement in the most liberal and reasonable manner to the intent that each of them shall receive its full and equal share of the benefits of the joint undertaking, subject to the provisions of clause 4 hereof.\nThe question for decision is by no means free from difficulty, although the relevant considerations lie in a rather limited field. The Board answered the question in the negative. We think the pith of the reasons delivered by the learned Chief Commissioner is in the extracts now quoted:\nThe rates and conditions of carriage of grain shipped for export from points on the Northern Company to all three of the ports above referred to are identical. The question is, what did the parties mean by the use of the words \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d? I have always understood \u201ccompetitive points\u201d in railway parlance to mean points in respect to which two or more lines compete for traffic. In other words, a point at which two or more railways have facilities and are prepared to handle traffic offered at equal rates. Reading the words in the ordinary way, I think there can be no doubt that \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d means points on the lines of the parties or their connecting carriers, and have no reference to any point other than one on a railway.\n* * *\nThe word \u201ccompetitive\u201d as used in the agreement must have reference to competition between railways. The parties were only interested in securing the carriage of grain to a port. What becomes of it afterwards did not in the least interest them. If the parties intended what Mr. Tilley now contends they did, they should have said so, and this is particularly true when one considers the meaning which both parties had, long prior to the agreement, given to the words \u201ccompetitive traffic\u201d.\nIn the Board\u2019s General Order No. 252, re interswitching, it is set out that \u201cnothing herein contained shall prevent the line carrier from absorbing the entire toll, or tolls, charged for interswitching competitive traffic, provided that the traffic and movements so treated are clearly defined in its tariffs.\u201d Turning to the tariffs of the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National as in effect in both Eastern and Western Canada, covering rules and regulations governing interswitching charges, they are found to all contain the following definition of competitive traffic:\u2014\n\u201cdefinition of competitive traffic\nAt point of Origin.\u2014When the railway performing the switching service can handle the shipment in road-haul movement from the origin station at equal rate.\nAt Destination.\u2014When the railway performing the switching service could have handled the shipment in road-haul movement into the destination station at equal rate.\u201d\nAnother definition found in the tariff of the Canadian Pacific, Western Lines, having to do with absorption of cartage charges rather than the question of interswitching, concerning competitive carload traffic, reads:\u2014\n\u201cCompetitive traffic is defined as having both its origin and destination at points reached by other railroads, which may also be reached by the lines of this company or its connections.\u201d\n* * *\nIt will be seen then that the Canadian National prior to the making of the agreement had certain exclusive rights with regard to the carriage of traffic routed to Victoria or to Prince Rupert. If the contention of the Canadian Pacific is right the Canadian National deliberately abandoned these exclusive rights. I can find nothing in the agreement to justify such a position.\n* * * I would give the words in the agreement the meaning which those words are ordinarily understood to convey among railway men, and hold that Prince Rupert is not a competitive point within the meaning of the agreement. I hold further that until such time as the Canadian Pacific files a through tariff for export wheat to Victoria, the latter point is not competitive within the meaning of the agreement.\nThe statement of facts and circumstances referred to in the question as stated by the Board and quoted above contains the following paragraph:\n12. Grain shipped to any of the above mentioned ports for export is discharged by the railway into elevators at the said ports and there stored with grain of the same grade, and is no longer earmarked as grain of that shipment. When the shipper desires to export his grain an equivalent amount of grain of the same grade is subject to his order. The same practice is followed in all cases where grain is milled or stored in transit.\nOn behalf of the appellants it is contended that the Board has erred in ascribing too much weight to their meaning in \u201crailway parlance,\u201d to use the phrase of the learned Chief Commissioner, in interpreting certain phrases in the agreement. We have quoted rather fully from the reasons of the learned Chief Commissioner because we think it appears pretty clearly from these reasons that, in construing what he regards as the critical expressions of article 7, he considers himself governed by the common usage in speech and writing among \u201crailway men\u201d concerning matters of railway operation, such, for example, as interswitching arrangements and the incidence of cartage charges.\nThe learned Chief Commissioner says:\nThe word \u201ccompetitive\u201d as used in the agreement must have reference to competition between railways. The parties were only interested in securing the carriage of grain to a port. What becomes of it afterwards did not in the least interest them.\nThere can be no doubt that the traffic the parties had in view consisted almost entirely of grain and products of grain for export. The ultimate destination of the articles shipped was not the Pacific sea-board but places in Asia, Europe and America beyond the Pacific sea-board. The real question is whether or not the returns from the whole of this traffic, originating on the Northern Alberta Railway Company\u2019s lines, carried by rail to the seaboard for export, were to be subjected to articles 6 and 7 of the agreement, or whether these articles were to be limited in their application to traffic destined to points which are competitive in the sense ascribed to the word by the learned Chief Commissioner. The parties had joined in a common enterprise with a view to sharing equally in its benefits and they declare their intention in very explicit words in article 11 to\ngive effect to this agreement in the most liberal and reasonable manner to the intent that each of them shall receive its full and equal share of the benefits of the joint undertaking * * *\nWe think article 11 lays down a principle which does not contemplate that the construction of the cardinal stipulations of the contract are to be controlled by the meaning attached by the usage of \u201crailway men,\u201d in \u201crailway parlance,\u201d to particular expressions when those expressions are employed exclusively with reference to the operation of railways. The words of the agreement are, of course, to be given their ordinary scope, but we think this article is intended as a direction that the objects of the agreement as ascertained from the instrument as a whole, together with the conditions the parties must necessarily have had in view, are to be factors of exceptional weight and importance in its interpretation. From this point of view, we find ourselves unable to concur with the view of the learned Chief Commissioner that the phrase \u201ccompetitive points\u201d in article 7 is to be read as limited to points \u201cat which two or more railways have facilities and are prepared to handle traffic offered at equal rates.\u201d\nThe learned Chief Commissioner observes:\nThe parties were only interested in securing the carriage of grain to a port. What becomes of it afterwards did not in the least interest them.\nWe do not agree that the ultimate destination of grain shipped to the seaboard did not \u201cin the least interest\u201d the railway companies. It is not disputed, as already observed, that in great part, such grain is export grain, and that this was the condition of things contemplated by the parties to the agreement. Nor is it disputed that, in point of practice, tariffs of export rates, on grain and grain products, from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways for export to Africa, Asia, Australia, Central America and Europe are published by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (to Vancouver, North Vancouver and New Westminster) and by the Canadian National Railway Company (to Vancouver, North Vancouver, Victoria and Prince Rupert) for export to the same countries. The ultimate destination of the grain is to points reached by both railways, either directly, or through rail or inland or ocean water connections. Giving the words of the agreement their natural sense, it would seem to make no difference whether such ultimate destination is reached by land or water.\nNor do we think that the language of article 6 should be overlooked. \u201cCompetitive traffic\u201d is, perhaps, not a very precise phrase; but it seems, clearly enough, to mean here traffic in respect of which the railways would be competing. In its natural meaning it would apply to the traffic in export grain. It is quite true, of course, that article 6 is not to be read as dominating the agreement. It must be read with article 7, but it does point to the conclusion that what the parties had in mind is competitive traffic in export grain. It is not seriously disputed that, but for the agreement, there would be competition between the railway companies in respect of all this traffic.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the question submitted answered in the negative.\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners declaring that Victoria and Prince Rupert in British Columbia are not competitive points within the meaning of section 7 of an agreement, dated January 29th, 1929, between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (hereinafter called the \u201cPacific\u201d) and the Canadian National Railway Company (hereinafter called the \u201cNational\u201d).\nThe question submitted to us by the Board and the relevant provisions of the agreement have been set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice and need not be repeated here.\nBefore attempting to interpret the language of section 7, which is the crucial section, it may not be inadvisable to see what were the relations which, prior to the agreement, existed between these two railway companies and the four railway companies which, as a result of the agreement, were merged into one company\u2014the Northern Alberta Railway. These railways- were the Edmonton, Dun-vegan and British Columbia Railway, the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway, the Central Canada Railway and the Pembina Valley Railway, all of which were local railways running northerly from Edmonton to points in Northern Alberta. At the date of the agreement the Pembina was owned by the Alberta Government, and the other three had come under its control through insolvency of their respective companies. At Edmonton these railways connected with both the Pacific and the National which carried their traffic from Edmonton to the Pacific Coast. The principal traffic from these local railways was grain\u2014chiefly wheat\u2014which they brought down to Edmonton to be shipped to ocean ports for export from Canada. The National had three ports at which delivery of overseas traffic could be made to ocean-going vessels: Vancouver (including New Westminster), Prince Rupert and Victoria (the cars to this latter place being carried by barge from Port Mann), while the Pacific could make delivery only at Vancouver.\nBoth the Pacific and the National had been desirous of securing a monopoly of the carrying of this grain from Edmonton to tide water and, at different periods, prior to the date of the agreement, a monopoly of the traffic had been enjoyed by one or other of these railways to the exclusion of the other. As the carriage of grain from Edmonton to the Coast was profitable, each railway was desirous that the exclusive control should not fall into the hands of the other, so they agreed to combine and purchase the four local railways and form them into a single system to be called the Northern Alberta Railway. This they carried out by the agreement in question in which it was provided that a new company should be formed to take over and operate the four railways forming the Northern Alberta system (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cNorthern Alberta\u201d). Each party was to provide one half of the purchase price and become responsible for one half the liabilities; and each party was entitled to appoint one half of the directors. The object of each of the parties in entering into this agreement was not the revenue which they hoped to derive from the operations of the Northern Alberta, for it is admitted in the respondent\u2019s factum that \u201cthe operation of the lines had been carried on in deficit.\u201d The consideration which appealed to both the Pacific and the National was the collateral benefit which their individual lines of railway would receive from carrying the grain gathered by the Northern Alberta and turned over to them for carriage to ocean ports. Therefore in the agreement the parties set out not only the terms and conditions on which they became partners in the Northern Alberta but also the principle in accordance with which they were to share in this collateral benefit. That principle was one of equality of benefit, it being declared that the intention was that the agreement should be \u201cfor their equal benefit and advantage\u201d (s. 2). This equality of benefit and advantage was emphasized in section 11, which reads as follows:\n11. The parties agree to co-operate with fairness and candour toward each other, and to give effect to this agreement in the most liberal and reasonable manner to the intent that each of them shall receive its full and equal share of the benefits of the joint undertaking, subject to the provisions of clause 4 hereof.\nIn addition the agreement provided that all officers and employees of the new company should be impartial between the Pacific and the National and that neither party should, directly or indirectly, solicit the routing of outbound competitive traffic over their respective lines. By section 7 the new company is required\nto route outbound freight traffic (including grain milled or stored in transit) originating on [its] lines and destined via Edmonton or Morinville to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties, in such a way that each of the parties shall receive on a revenue basis one-half [of such traffic].\nThe question for determination is, what did the parties mean by \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines\u201d of the railways?\nThe contention of the Pacific is that the word \u201cdestined\u201d in section 7 means \u201cintended for delivery not to the actual point to which the traffic is billed over the Pacific or National lines as it comes from the Northern Alberta, but to the ultimate destination which may be intended or contemplated by the person controlling its movements\u201d; and that the words \u201ccompetitive points\u201d include points beyond the lines of the Pacific or the National and their rail connections, such as all foreign points which are accessible to shipping from ocean ports reached by either railway or their connecting rail carriers; for instance, grain having Liverpool as its ultimate destination could be carried by either the Pacific or the National to the Pacific Coast, and there forwarded by ocean-going vessels to Liverpool. Any of these ports to which it may have been brought by either railway and from which it is shipped to Liverpool, are, according to the interpretation placed upon the section by the Pacific, \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the line of the railway.\u201d The contention of the National is that these words include and apply only to outbound traffic which, received from the Northern Alberta, is undertaken by the Pacific or the National to be carried to a point then named as its destination, and that such point must be one common to both lines or their connecting, rail carriers to which rates from shipping points by either the Pacific or the National, with or without connecting carriers, are equal.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners held that \u201ccompetitive points,\u201d in railway parlance, meant \u201cpoints in respect to which two or more lines compete for traffic.\u201d\nIn his judgment the Chief Commissioner said:\u2014\nReading the words in the ordinary way, I think there can be no doubt that \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d means points on the lines of the parties or their connecting carriers, and have no reference to any point other than one on a railway.\nThis was his interpretation of the words used and he supported it by two other arguments.\nThe first was:\nIt will be seen then that the Canadian National prior to the making of the agreement had certain exclusive rights with regard to the carriage of traffic routed to Victoria or to Prince Rupert. If the contention of the Canadian Pacific is right the Canadian National deliberately abandoned these exclusive rights. I can find nothing in the agreement to justify such a position.\nThe second was as follows:\nTrue, under the agreement the parties are to have equal benefits because they are taking equal shares in the new company, but equal benefits in what? Surely the benefits referred to are the benefits to be derived from the operation of the new company. * * *\nDealing with this latter argument first, I am of opinion that, if the language means, as I think it does, that the benefits which the Pacific was to receive were simply the dividends on its stock in the new company, the benefits were illusory, for, as I have already pointed out, the Northern Alberta was being operated at a loss. Further, if Prince Rupert and Victoria are held not to be competitive points within the meaning of section 7, the result will be that the Pacific and National, under the agreement, will share equally in the revenue derived from the carriage of outbound freight from Edmonton to Vancouver; but the National will have, in addition, the entire revenue from the grain carried to Prince Rupert and Victoria. This, in my opinion, is inconsistent with the equality of benefit in the joint undertaking provided for in section 11. It would also mean that the representatives of the Pacific, as business men, agreed to pay one half the purchase price of the joint undertaking and assume one half of its financial obligations; hold one half the shares in the company and divide the collateral advantage\u2014which was the chief inducement to enter into the agreement\u2014on a basis which would allow the National the lion\u2019s share of the profit. That the representatives of the Pacific, or any other business corporation or person, would agree to that kind of arrangement seems to me highly improbable.\nThe Chief Commissioner stressed the argument that the National, prior to the making of the agreement, had certain exclusive rights with regard to the carriage of traffic routed to Prince Rupert and Victoria, and that they would be giving these up if the contention of the Pacific was right.\nIt was common knowledge at the date of the agreement that the railways that were taken over by the Northern Alberta\u2014with the exception of the Pembina\u2014were in an insolvent condition, and that the Pacific might purchase them.\nIf the Pacific had purchased them it would have had the exclusive control; and, undoubtedly, would have routed everything it possibly could over its own line to Vancouver. The same would have happened had these lines been purchased by the National. Therefore, so far as export traffic was concerned, neither railway would have had much to hope for if the railways comprising the Northern Alberta system became the property of the other. Furthermore, if the National did relinquish any exclusive right which it had with respect to grain routed to Prince Rupert and Victoria, might it not have considered that it was being compensated therefor, (1) by sharing on equal terms in the revenue from grain attracted to Vancouver over the Pacific by reason of its storage and shipping facilities, which it is well known are greatly superior to those of the National, and (2) by the Pacific\u2019s relinquishment of its right to solicit the routing of grain over its line which is now routed by the Northern Alberta over the National to Prince Rupert and Victoria? It was to avoid the possibility of one of the parties to the agreement getting exclusive control over the local railways that the Pacific and the National agreed to share equally in the obligations and advantages which would accrue from taking over these lines. As equality of obligation and advantage is expressly declared in the agreement to be the intent of the parties, effect should be given to that intent in construing section 7, unless the adoption of that principle is inconsistent with the language there used.\nThe construction placed by the Board of Railway Commissioners on the words \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties,\u201d namely, \u201cpoints on the lines of the parties or their connecting carriers,\u201d limits the application of the words \u201cpoints beyond\u201d to some point on a connecting railway. Now the only railways at the Pacific Coast which connect with either the Pacific or the National are railways running south to the United States. This was well known to the men who made and drafted the agreement. These men, however, also knew that the market for Alberta grain was not in the United States, but in Europe or the Orient; therefore, when they required the new company to route outbound freight destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the Pacific and the National, they must have had in contemplation the points to which the grain would be exported in order to find a market; and these certainly would not be points on a railway running to the United States. In my opinion no reasonable meaning can be given to the words \u201ccompetitive points on or beyond the lines of the railway\u201d which would give effect to what the parties had in contemplation as a business enterprise, other than the overseas points as contended by the Pacific. To give to the words the construction placed upon them by the Board of Railway Commissioners seems to me to nullify the very object which the parties intended to effect. Further, although that intention might have been put in language which would have obviated our present difficulty, yet I think the words used, taken in their ordinary sense, are not inconsistent with the intent of the parties, and are a sufficient expression of it. That construction of \u201ccompetitive points\u201d should, therefore, be adopted which gives effect to the intention of the parties, rather than the narrower meaning which has been adopted from the definitions of \u201ccompetitive traffic\u201d and \u201ccompetitive rates\u201d as given effect to in the decision of the Board. Crocket J. (dissenting).\u2014The question of law submitted for decision on this appeal is whether upon the agreement, the material provisions of which are set forth in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, and the facts and circumstances stated in the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners granting leave to appeal, grain shipped from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways to Prince Rupert or to Victoria for export and exported from either of those ports, say to the United Kingdom, is to be excluded from the comparison of freight traffic for the purpose of the equal division to be made under article 7 of the agreement as not being \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties,\u201d as the expression is used in that article.\nAs grain so shipped to either of the two named ports is admittedly outbound traffic shipped \u201cto points on (or beyond) the lines of the parties\u201d it will be seen at once that the whole question with which we are concerned is as to whether it is grain \u201cdestined to competitive points,\u201d as that term is used in article 7 of the agreement, and that, if it is, the whole question is concluded. We have nothing to do in the latter event with its shipment to points \u201cbeyond the lines of the parties.\u201d\nThe Railway Commission held that both ports named were not competitive points within the meaning of article 7, for the reason that Prince Rupert is reached and served only by the C.N.R. and that only the C.N.R. undertakes the carriage of export grain to Victoria, although both railways have terminal facilities there. In so deciding it is clear from the written opinion of the learned chairman that the Board construed the term \u201ccompetitive points\u201d in the sense in which it is ordinarily used with reference to the operation of railways, or, as he expressed it, in the sense which it is ordinarily understood to convey among railway men, i.e., points at which, as he particularly explained, \u201ctwo or more railways have facilities and are prepared to handle traffic offered at equal rates.\u201d\nI have no doubt, and indeed it is not seriously disputed, that this is the ordinary signification of the term as it is used in connection with the operation of railways. The appellant, however, contends that this is not the sense, in which either the term \u201ccompetitive points\u201d or the words \u201cdestined to\u201d immediately preceding it, is used in article 7, and this is really the crux of the controversy between the parties as it comes before us.\nFor my part I can see no reason why such words as \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d should be interpreted in any other sense than the ordinary, usual sense which they bear in the conduct and operation of railways. The whole agreement is on its face essentially a railway agreement, concluded between two railway companies as such, and one which deals entirely with railway administration and operation, railway traffic and railway revenue.\nThe contention that the critical words \u201cdestined to competitive points\u201d are not used in article 7 in their usual railway operating sense is primarily based on the inclusion in the limitation clause of the words \u201cor beyond.\u201d It is argued that in the case of freight shipped to the seaboard for export these words must necessarily denote points beyond the seaboard, and that their inclusion in the phrase contemplates a through joint rail and ocean transit. This is, no doubt, a possible construction if we were dealing with the carriage of outbound freight billed for a through joint rail and ocean transit to a point in an overseas country, but this is not the question which the Railway Commission considered or the question which is now submitted to us for decision. The question we have to decide is, not whether freight so billed is to be excluded from the equalization comparison provided for, but whether upon this agreement \u201cand the facts and circumstances set forth\u201d in the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners granting leave to appeal,\ngrain shipped from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways to Prince Rupert or to Victoria for export, and exported from either of these ports to say the United Kingdom, is to be excluded * * * as not being \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points on or beyond the lines of the parties\u201d as the expression is used in said article (article 7).\nThere is not the slighest suggestion in the Board\u2019s order that the grain is billed for a through joint rail and ocean transit to any particular point overseas or indeed to any country overseas. On the contrary the statement of facts shews that it is not. It states that\ngrain shipped to any of the above mentioned ports (Vancouver, New Westminster, Victoria and Prince Rupert, the two first named being points to which both railways carry grain over their own lines to their own terminals) for export is discharged by the railway into elevators at the said ports and there stored with grain of the same grade, and is no longer ear-marked as grain of that shipment. When the shipper desires to export his grain an equivalent amount of grain of the same grade is subject to his order. The same practice is followed in all cases where grain is milled or stored in transit.\nIt may be added that it is stated in the reply of the Northern Alberta Railways Co. that it is required to shew clearly on the waybills that the grain is for export and the name of the elevator in care of which the grain is shipped.\nHow grain thus shipped from stations on the Northern Alberta Railways to any of these ports, and discharged into the particular elevator in care of which it is shipped, and there stored to await an order of the owner when he desires to export it to the overseas market in which he has decided to sell it, for delivery into an ocean steamer for a separate ocean transit, with which the railway company as such has no concern, can be considered as not being \u201cdestined\u201d to the particular port on the Pacific seaboard to which it is shipped, but \u201cdestined\u201d to an unnamed point in an unnamed country, I confess I am completely at a loss to comprehend. The very suggestion of \u201ca competitive point\u201d beyond the seas in such an agreement demonstrates to me that the words \u201cor beyond the lines of the parties\u201d were never intended to cover an ocean transit with reference to which the railway undertakes no responsibility and with which it has as such nothing whatever to do.\nNotwithstanding that the principal traffic of the Northern Alberta Railways consists of grain shipped to the seaboard for export, and this traffic must therefore have been the dominating consideration in the negotiation of the agreement, it is apparent that the parties had in contemplation outbound domestic freight traffic as well as export traffic and that article 7 was framed to embrace both. The limitation \u201cdestined to competitive points\u201d must be held to apply to both classes in some sense. Is it to be supposed that it was intended to apply in one sense to one class and in an entirely different sense, or not to apply at all, to the other?\nThe only conceivable ground on which such a supposition can rest is that the word \u201con\u201d refers exclusively to domestic shipments or shipments of freight not intended ultimately to be exported overseas, and the word \u201cbeyond\u201d exclusively to shipments to the seaboard for export, and that a clear distinction between the two descriptions of outbound freight traffic is thus indicated by the words \u201con or beyond.\u201d Such a construction obviously reads out the words \u201cor beyond\u201d in respect of all outbound freight traffic which is not intended for export, notwithstanding that there may be competitive, as distinguished from noncompetitive, points, either \u201con\u201d the lines of the parties themselves, or \u201cbeyond\u201d the lines of the parties on the lines of other connecting railways in Canada or the United States, to which such outbound freight traffic may be shipped. It also casts aside the word \u201con\u201d in respect of all shipments of export freight to the seaboard, notwithstanding that such freight may be destined to points \u201con\u201d the lines of the parties and indeed must be held to be so destined in a railway carrying sense unless it is billed to some named point overseas for a through, continuous joint rail and ocean transit. Moreover, it renders the words \u201ccompetitive points\u201d themselves entirely meaningless with reference to all such shipments of freight to the seaboard for export, for assuredly, where no overseas destination point is in any way indicated, it becomes quite impossible to apply the quoted words to an overseas point at all.\nApart from these considerations, the collocation of the words \u201con or beyond\u201d in relation both to \u201coutbound freight traffic destined to competitive points\u201d and to \u201cthe lines of the parties\u201d itself appears to me to entirely preclude such a construction as is contended for and to make it clear that the whole limitation was intended to apply to all outbound traffic in the same sense. Reading all these words together in the order in which they are placed, the whole purpose of the clause on its very face is to prescribe destination to competitive, as distinguished from non-competitive, points, as a condition of the inclusion of any outbound freight traffic, export or otherwise, in the revenue apportionment provided for in the article. The truth is that it is only when one endeavours to read the language of the clause in any other than its ordinary railway sense, that any difficulty whatever arises upon the construction of the article itself.\nOne suggestion is that all freight shipped to the seaboard for export is \u201ccompetitive traffic\u201d in the sense that it is entitled to \u201ccompetitive rates,\u201d and that what the parties meant was not \u201ccompetitive points,\u201d but \u201ccompetitive traffic.\u201d To give effect to this suggestion one must not only substitute for the term the parties have chosen to use another term of an equally well recognized and entirely different import in railway usage, but to re-cast the entire clause, and thus completely disregard its application to export traffic.\nAnother suggestion is that all ports on the seaboard are competitive ports, and that what the parties meant was, not \u201ccompetitive points\u201d in a railway carrying sense, but \u201ccompetitive ports.\u201d This suggestion pre-supposes that the limitation clause does not apply to export traffic at all, for manifestly all freight intended for export overseas must be shipped to ports on the seaboard, and if all ports are alike competitive, the limitation is entirely meaningless as regards shipments to the seaboard for export.\nIndeed, the whole gist of the appellant\u2019s contention is that the limitation does not apply at all to outbound traffic shipped to the seaboard for export. Yet neither the word \u201cexport\u201d nor \u201cseaboard\u201d is mentioned anywhere in the text of article 7. One would naturally think, if such had been the intention, the parties would have said so instead of hitting upon a clause which on its face comprises both export and non-export outbound freight traffic alike. In my opinion, this clause must be read in the context in which it appears in article 7 in the sense in which the Board of Railway Commissioners has construed it, and constitutes a definite and specific limitation upon the outbound freight traffic intended to be included in the fifty-fifty apportionment provided for by that article in respect of such outbound freight traffic.\nThe object of the agreement as a whole must, of course, be ascertained, and I have no doubt, having regard to the provisions of articles 2 and 11, that the underlying intention was that, as far as practicable, the parties should share fully and equally in the benefits accruing from their joint acquisition and operation of the Northern Alberta Railways system, and that the joint undertaking should be conducted with fairness and candour between them. Once, however, it is seen that a definite and specific exception is made in clear and unambiguous language as regards a particular branch of traffic in an article obviously inserted for the purpose of dealing exclusively with that particular branch of traffic, the special article must be held to be the governing article in relation to the particular branch of traffic which it has thus singled out from all other branches. No other conclusion, it seems to me, is possible without entirely ignoring the special article, which surely must be considered in order to determine the object and intent of the agreement as a whole. That intent, I think, is clearly shown, viz: that both parties are to share equally in the benefits accruing from the joint undertaking in the manner above stated subject to the condition expressly provided in article 7 with regard to outbound freight traffic, that only the revenues accruing from such outbound traffic as is destined to competitive points on or beyond their own lines, is to be included in the equalizing revenue comparison. Articles 2 and 11 may both be read in perfect consistency with such an intent. They cannot over-ride or negative the plain, unequivocal words of article 7.\nFor these reasons I would affirm the decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and question submitted answered in the negative.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

(daughter of the son), and the remainder \u201cto be divided equally between\u201d three named daughters of the testatrix. By clause 6 the residue of the estate was given equally amongst E. and the said three daughters. Clause 7 read: \u201cIn the event of [E.] or any of my said daughters predeceasing me or predeceasing my said son, leaving issue, I direct that the child or children of the person so dying shall take the interest to which their mother would have been entitled had she survived.\u201d All said beneficiaries survived the testatrix.\nHeld: The legacies directed under clause 5 to be paid to E. and said three daughters upon the death of the son, did not become vested upon the testatrix\u2019 death. The fair and literal meaning of the words used in clause 5 in giving the capital of the fund is that the testatrix gives when she divides\u2014that the operation of the gift is postponed until the period of distribution; and this meaning found support in the form and nature of the prior directions in clause 5, in contrasting the wording of the gift in question with that of other gifts in the will where immediate vesting was indicated, and in the wording of clause 7 (\u201cwould have been entitled had she survived\u201d indicating that the \u201cmother\u201d\u2014i.e., any one of E. and said three daughters\u2014should take no title to the interest conferred in clause 5 unless she survived both the testatrix and her son).\nThe fundamental principle to guide in interpreting wills is that effect must be given to the testator\u2019s intention ascertainable from the expressed language of the will. So far as possible the will itself must speak. If, after careful consideration of the language used, in the particular passage in question and consistently with the context of the document, the intention remains doubtful, then resort may be had to certain rules which have been generally adopted, upon the strength of which courts are enabled to draw a certain conclusion as \u201cmore nearly corresponding\u201d with the testator\u2019s intention. (Busch v. Eastern Trust Co., [1928] Can. S.C.R. 479, explained. That case should not the \u201ccited as deciding more than was actually determined\u201d; there was no intention of laying down a rule of general application, far less of \u201ceffecting a radical change in the law and creating some new principle governing the question of vesting\u201d).\nAPPEAL, directly to the Supreme Court of Canada (by leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario), from the judgment of Rose C.J.H.C.[1], against that part only of the judgment which declared that the legacies directed by the testatrix, Katherine Hamilton Browne, deceased, under paragraph 5 of her will, to be paid to Enid Browne, Florence Yoda Moody, Constance Emma Kinnear and Helen Smith, named therein, upon the death of the life tenant, William George Hamilton Browne, did not, nor did any of such legacies, become vested upon the death of the said testatrix. The said judgment was rendered on questions submitted, on an originating notice of motion, for the adjudication of the court, with respect to the construction of the will of the said testatrix.\nA special case was settled for the purpose of the present appeal to this Court. The material facts of the case, the material provisions of the will in question, and the questions submitted on the present appeal, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed.\nA. J. Russell Snow K.C. and N. B.

A. Urquhart K.C. for the executors of the estate of the deceased.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is an appeal per saltum from part of the judgment rendered in Weekly Court, at Toronto, on an originating notice of motion submitting for determination certain questions (among others not relevant to the present appeal) arising out of the interpretation of the will of Katherine Hamilton Browne bearing date the 16th day of December, 1929.\nThe will begins, as usual, by revoking all former testamentary dispositions and by directing the executors to pay all debts, funeral and testamentary expenses.\nSpecific bequests are made unto the son, William George Hamilton Browne; and then follow the main provisions which form the subject of the submission:\n5. Whereas I have now the sum of $100,000 invested in the name of E. H. Watt, of the said firm of Watt & Watt, in trust in the form of a call loan, I HEREBY DIRECT that the said fund is to be continued to be invested in call loans by the said E. H. Watt during the lifetime of my said son, William George Hamilton Browne, and the income arising therefrom is to be paid to my said son during his lifetime. In the event of the death of the said E. H. Watt during the lifetime of my said son, I DIRECT that the fund now invested by him in the form of a call loan shall be invested by my executors in such securities as are authorized by the laws of the Province of Ontario as trustee investments, and the income therefrom is to be paid to my said son during his lifetime. On the death of my said son, William George Hamilton Browne, I DIRECT that the said fund of $100,000 is to be divided as follows:\nOne-half of the said fund to my grand-daughter Enid Browne, daughter of my son, William George Hamilton Browne, and the remainder of the said fund to be divided equally between my daughters, Florence Yoda Moody, wife of Robert E. Moody, now of Los Angeles, California; Constance Emma Kinnear, wife of Harold Kinnear, of the City of Detroit, in the State of Michigan, and Helen Smith, wife of Herbert P. Smith of Jamaica. Long Island, New York, share and share alike.\n6. All the rest and residue of my estate, both real and personal, of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situate, I GIVE, DEVISE and BEQUEATH unto my grand-daughter, Enid Browne and my daughters, Florence Yoda Moody, Constance Emma Kinnear and Helen Smith, to be divided amongst them equally, share and share alike.\n7. In the event of my grand-daughter, Enid Browne or any of my said daughters predeceasing me or predeceasing my said son, leaving issue, I DIRECT that the child or children of the person so dying shall take the interest to which their mother would have been entitled had she survived.\nThe final provisions of the will deal with the powers of the executors and appoint as such the son, William George Hamilton Browne, and Thomas Cameron Urquhart, barrister-at-law, of Toronto.\nFor the purpose of the appeal, a Special Case was settled by a judge of the Court appealed from, and the questions to be determined are stated thus:\n(a) Whether or not the legacies directed by the said testatrix, Katherine Hamilton Browne, deceased, under paragraph 5 of her said Will, to be paid to Enid Browne, Florence Yoda Moody, Constance Emma Kinnear and Helen Smith (the Appellants herein), upon the death of the life tenant, William George Hamilton Browne, became vested upon the death of the said testatrix;\n(b) And should this Honourable Court find that such legacies did become vested upon the death of the testatrix, then, whether or not the legacy of any of such Appellants is liable to be divested under or otherwise affected by paragraph 7 of the said Will.\nThe relevant facts are set out in the Special Case:\nThe testatrix died at Toronto on the 17th March, 1930.\nProbate of her will was granted to the executors appointed therein.\nAll the beneficiaries indicated by name in the will survived the testatrix and are still living.\nAll of them are now adults. Enid Browne, who was an infant represented by the Official Guardian at the date of the application, has since attained the full age of twenty-one years and is now represented by counsel for the appellants.\nFlorence Yoda Moody is the mother of three infant children, and Constance Emma Kinnear is the mother of one infant child, and these children are represented by the Official Guardian who also represents any unborn children of the said Florence Yoda Moody and Constance Emma Kinnear, and of the other two named beneficiaries, Enid Browne and Helen Smith.\nHelen Smith is the mother of one child, Nedra Caroline Smith, an adult, whose interest under the will is the same as that of the said infants.\nThe judgment appealed from, and which was pronounced by the Honourable the Chief Justice of the High Court for Ontario, declared that the legacies directed under paragraph 5 of the will to be paid to Enid Browne, Florence Yoda Moody, Constance Emma Kinnear and Helen Smith \u201cdid not, nor did any of such legacies become vested upon the death of the said testatrix.\u201d\nThe beneficiaries just named appeal from that judgment.\nIn answering the questions submitted, our endeavour must be to give effect to the testator\u2019s intention. And the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will (Auger v. Beaudry[2]). If we approach from that viewpoint the will now under consideration, the first thing to be noted is that, throughout paragraph 5, there are to be found no words of present gift. The testatrix states that she has now a sum of $100,000 invested in the name of E. H. Watt, in trust, in the form of a call loan. Her direction is that \u201cthe said fund is to be continued to be invested in call loans\u201d. A feature perhaps not to be overlooked is that this direction is not given to the executors,\u2014at least, it is not primarily so given. The direction is that the investments are to be made \u201cby the said E. H. Watt\u201d, who is not appointed executor. So that the fund is really treated as separate and distinct from the estate disposed of in the will. And it is to be looked after in this way \u201cduring the life-time of my said son, William George Hamilton Browne\u201d, that is to say: during the whole period extending up to the time fixed by the testatrix for the distribution to the appellants. Only indirectly, \u201cin the event of the death of the said E. H. Watt during the lifetime of my said son\u201d, are the executors to be entrusted with the power of investing the fund. Moreover, there is nothing in paragraph 5 necessarily indicating that, except in the event mentioned, the executors are to have anything whatever to do with the fund. In terms, it is not given to them either in trust or otherwise. The testatrix merely says that she has that sum of $100,000 invested in a certain form in the name of E. H. Watt. The income arising therefrom is to be paid to the son. The principal itself is not given, but is to remain in the form in which it is, until the death of the \u201csaid son\u201d. Only then, when the testatrix comes to refer to her son\u2019s death, and for the first time in the clause, does she make use of expressions apt to dispose of the capital or in any way connecting the appellants with the fund itself. According to the words she uses, grammatically and literally, the testatrix gives when she divides, and there is no apparent intention that the gift should take effect at any date prior to the time she fixes for the division.\nIn contradistinction to the language of clause 5, must we point to the wording of every other clause of the will where the testatrix makes a bequest with the evident intention that it should become vested at once. Invariably and in each case without exception, the testatrix says: \u201cI Give, Devise and Bequeath\u201d. That is the expression used in clause 6 (above set out) where she disposes of the rest and residue of her estate. Such is also the expression in clauses 3 and 4, which it is not necessary to quote in full, and which are the other clauses of the will containing the specific bequests.\nThe contrast between clause 5 and these other clauses is so striking as to lead to the logical\u2014if not the almost inevitable\u2014conclusion that, while all the other bequests were intended to vest immediately upon the death of the testatrix, the language in clause 5 was purposely chosen to indicate a contrary intention. It evidences a desire to postpone the operation of the gift to the appellants until the period of distribution. That view is further confirmed by clause 7. The direction there is that in the event of the grand-daughter, Enid Browne, or any of the daughters predeceasing the testatrix or predeceasing her son, leaving issue, \u201cthe child or children of the person so dying shall take the interest to which their mother would have been entitled had she survived\u201d. The interest there referred to, and \u201cto which the mother would have been entitled had she survived\u201d, is the interest conferred in clause 5. In the premises, the fair and literal meaning of those words is that the mother (i.e., any of the appellants) takes no title to that interest unless she survives both the testatrix and her son, and that is to say: till the time of distribution.\nIt follows that our view accords with the judgment pronounced by the learned Chief Justice of the High Court of Ontario.\nWe feel, however, that we should not part with this case without adding yet one more observation.\nIn support of his argument before this Court\u2014and apparently also before the learned judge of first instance\u2014counsel for the respondents as well as the Official Guardian strongly relied upon our judgment in Busch v. Eastern Trust Co.3.\nThe Busch case[3] ought not to be \u201ccited as deciding more than was actually determined\u201d (Re Gilmour[4]). There was no intention in that case of laying down a rule of general application, far less of \u201ceffecting a radical change in the law and creating some new principle governing the question of vesting (Re Moore[5]). It is unnecessary to repeat that the golden rule, the fundamental principle whereby the courts must be guided in the interpretation of testamentary documents, is that effect must be given to the testator\u2019s intention ascertainable from the expressed language of the instrument. So far as possible, the will itself must speak. If, after careful consideration of the language used, in the particular passage immediately under examination and consistently with the context of the document, the intention remains doubtful, then resort may be had to certain rules which have been generally adopted. Upon the strength of those rules, the courts are enabled to draw a certain conclusion \u201con the ground that this must more nearly correspond with (the) intention\u201d of the testator. It was one of those rules which this Court thought applicable to the particular language of the will under consideration in the Busch case[6]. But Mr. Justice Newcombe, in delivering the reasons of the court, was careful in recalling at the outset the cardinal principle that \u201cone must decide according to the intent appearing upon the will\u201d (p. 483); and, in Singer v. Singer7, speaking for the majority of the court, he had further occasion of pointing out the limited application of the rule acted upon in the Busch case6. The rule itself, as stated in Williams (12th Ed., p. 795), is made subject to many qualifications.\nEach will must be construed according to the apparent intention of the testator (Williams on Executors, 12th ed., p. 726). While the well known rules or the decided cases are no doubt helpful in ambiguous matters or in affording illustrations, \u201cin every case it is the testator\u2019s intention, if it can be gathered from the will, which must govern (Singer v. Singer[7]).\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.* The new questions submitted in the Special Case will be answered as follows:\nQuestion (a): The legacies referred to did not become vested upon the death of the testatrix.\nQuestion (b): In view of the answer to the first question, the point submitted here does not arise.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

He had finished one window on the outside, sitting on its sill and facing towards the inside of the building. He then proceeded to clean the other window on the outside by reaching over from the sill of the finished window, and, in doing so, changing from his former posture, when the outside sill of the finished window, from which he was reaching, gave way and he fell and was injured. Respondent was sued for damages, and the claim was treated, in the questions put to the jury, as one under ss. 119-121 in Part II of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 179. The jury found that the accident was caused by defect in the window sill, being owing to its \u201cdecayed condition\u201d; that at the time of the accident L. was acting within the scope of his employment; and that he was not guilty of contributory negligence; and judgment was entered for the damages found. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1933] O.R. 595) set aside the judgment and dismissed the action, on the ground that the case was not brought within the statute, L. being the author of his own injury by exposing himself to an unnecessary risk (Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co. v. Highley, [1917] A.C. 352). On appeal to this Court:\nHeld: The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set aside; and the jury\u2019s findings sustained (as being not unwarranted on the evidence) in all respects except as to the amount of damages awarded, which were excessive, and as to which there should be a new trial. On the facts in evidence and the jury\u2019s findings, the injury was \u201ccaused\u201d by a \u201cdefect\u201d in the sill\u2019s condition, within s. 119(1) of the Act.\nPer Duff C.J.: The exposition of \u201cdefect\u201d (within such a statute) in Walsh v. Whiteley, 21 Q.B.D. 371, at 378, and Nimmo v. Connell, [1924] A.C. 595, at 606, is (subject to exclusion, under the Ontario Act, of negligence as an essential element of the cause of action) reasonably applicable to the present case. \u201cIt is the use to which a thing is intended to be put and is being put which must be considered when the question whether or not there is a defect in its condition has to be determined\u201d (Nimmo v. Connell, supra, at 606). When the employer permits a particular use, that shews conclusively that such is the intended use of the thing to which \u201cdefect\u201d is imputed within the meaning of this principle (Jones v. Burford, 1 T.L.R. 137). The jury\u2019s findings established that the sill was being used in a reasonable way for a purpose for which its use was permitted, when, owing to its condition, it gave way and so caused the fall. These facts brought the case within s. 119 (1) of the Act.\nPer Lamont J.: As respondent permitted, and therefore intended, that the sill be used as a base of operations for window washing, it was, within the meaning of the Act, \u201cintended for or used in the business of his employer\u201d. If it was, in its condition, unfitted for such use, or if its condition made it dangerous when reasonably so used, that condition constituted a \u201cdefect\u201d within the Act; and the jury had, by their findings, said that L.\u2019s manner of use was reasonable.\nPer Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ.: Having regard to the object of s. 119(1) (reading it with the enactments following it in the Act), as a special enactment to extend the employer\u2019s liability in the workman\u2019s favour, and one, therefore, not to be narrowly construed against the workman, it cannot be said, if the workman is in fact injured by reason of a defect in the condition or arrangement of any portion of the building (the building being \u201cconnected with, intended for or used in\u201d the employer\u2019s business), that he is not to recover unless the defect be one which concerns the particular duties which his contract of service requires him to perform. That consideration may bear upon the question of the causation of the injury, but does not justify annexing to the ordinary meaning of \u201cdefect\u201d in its context, as applicable to a building or any of its parts, a condition or meaning which the language of the enactment does not express or necessarily imply. No significance to the contrary can be safely taken (in construing the Ontario Act) from the words in Walsh v. Whiteley, 21 Q.B.D. 371, at 378 (and supported in the dictum in Nimmo v. Connell, [1924] A.C. 595, at 606), that \u201cit must be a defect in the condition of the machine, having regard to the use to which it is to be applied or to the mode in which it is to be used\u201d, as those words proceeded rather from the consideration of the negligence of the employer as a necessary element in the existence of the defect causing the injury. Under the enactment now in question, all that is necessary is that the workman is injured by any defect in the building in which he is employed.\nUnder s. 119 (1) (and reading ss. 120 and 121 in connection therewith) it is sufficient to entitle the workman to recover, if the injury be in part directly attributable to the defect (and though the defect has arisen without negligence of the employer or his servants or agents); the fact that some negligence of the workman may have operated with the existence of the defect to produce the injury makes no difference as to the employer\u2019s liability, except (s. 121) as to assessment of the quantum of damages. The jury\u2019s finding that the accident was caused by defect in the sill (its decayed condition) was conclusive as to respondent\u2019s liability.\nThe question as to whether L. voluntarily and unnecessarily assumed a new and added risk independently of that attaching to his employment as janitor and caretaker and different in kind therefrom or whether he was simply doing something within the sphere of his employment in an improper or negligent manner, does not arise upon the special provisions of s. 119(1). The principle, or test, affirmed in Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co. v. Highley, [1917] A.C. 352, has no application to that enactment.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff, Mary Jane Lewis as administratrix of the estate of John Lewis Lewis, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which set aside the judgment of Kerwin J. (given in favour of the plaintiff on the findings of a jury) and dismissed the action.\nThe action was for damages because of injuries suffered by the said John Lewis Lewis by his falling while cleaning windows in the office building of the defendant (respondent). The action was begun by the said John Lewis Lewis and his wife, Mary Jane Lewis, the latter claiming for loss of consortium and loss of support, which claim she abandoned at the trial. After the action was begun the plaintiff John Lewis Lewis died (from a cause not connected with the accident) and the action was revived and continued by his wife as administratrix of his estate, the present appellant.\nThe material facts of the case, the findings of the jury, and the questions in issue on this appeal, are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported (in more particular detail in the judgment of Crocket J.) and are indicated in the above headnote.\nJ. Keiller Mackay K.C. for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson, K.C. for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur fully in the conclusions of my brother Crocket; and I think there is little, if any, real difference between us in relation to the actual grounds of the decision.\nIt is advisable, perhaps, to say something upon the meaning of the statutory phrase:\nWhere personal injury is caused to a workman by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises connected with, or intended for or used in the business of his employer.\nIt is, of course, a hazardous thing to attempt an exhaustive definition of the phrases used in a statute like this; and it must be understood that judicial expositions and paraphrases of the language of such a statute cannot properly be regarded as of universal application. They must not be applied as substitutes for the words of the statute.\nIn the case before us, the man who was injured was cleaning windows, and, in doing so, was sitting upon the window sill, the greater part of his body being outside the window and his weight resting largely, if not mainly, upon the sill. He was using the sill in that way and for that purpose. The evidence shewed that the sill had \u201cbecome rotted\u201d and the jury in effect found that, by reason of this, part of it broke away under pressure of the workman\u2019s weight and that this was the cause of his fall. So far as presently relevant, the language of s. 119 (1) of the Ontario statute differs from that of s. 1 (1) of the Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 1880, in this that the words \u201carrangement\u201d, \u201cbuildings or premises\u201d and \u201cintended for\u201d are not to be found in the English Act.\nThis is a case in which the workman was making use of part of the building, of which he was caretaker, as a support for himself while engaged in the course of his duty in cleaning windows. And, I think, that for the purposes of this case, subject to one qualification, the exposition of \u201cdefect\u201d in Walsh v. Whiteley[2] by Lopes, L.J., and Lindley, L.J., correctly expressed the effect of the statute. Under the English Act the negligence of the employer is an essential element of the cause of action, and in Walsh v. Whiteley2 that was held to be an essential term in the definition of \u201cdefect\u201d. In Ontario this condition has been abrogated and it, therefore, no longer enters into the concept of the statutory \u201cdefect\u201d. But, I think, in other respects, the definition holds, for cases to which it can be reasonably adapted.\nThis exposition in Walsh v. Whiteley2 was expressly approved by the majority of the House of Lords in Nimmo v. Connell[3] per Lord Atkinson whose reasoning was adopted by Lord Shaw (at p. 607) and Lord Dunedin (at p. 623). Indeed, in Connell\u2019s case[4] there was an authoritative adoption of the judgment of Lopes and Lindley, L.JJ., in Walsh v. Whiteley[5]. At p. 606, Lord Atkinson (with, as I have mentioned, the concurrence of Lord Shaw and Lord Dunedin) said: In Walsh v. Whiteley2, Lopes LJ. (delivering the judgment of himself and Lindley LJ.), in considering s. 1, sub-s. 1, and s. 2, sub-s. 1, together, said: \u201cIt must be a defect in the condition of the machine, having regard to the use to which it is to be applied or to the mode in which it is to be used.\u201d He previously had said: \u201cThe negligence of the employer appears to be a necessary element without which the workman is not to be entitled to any compensation.\u201d And then he gives a definition of a defect to satisfy both of these sections, thus: \u201cIt must be a defect in the original construction or subsequent condition of the machine rendering it unfit for the purposes to which it is applied when used with reasonable care and caution, and a defect arising from the negligence of the employer.\u201d This judgment supports completely my contention that it is the use to which a thing is intended to be put and is being put which must be considered when the question whether or not there is a defect in its condition has to be determined.\nIt will be observed that this view of the meaning of \u201cdefect\u201d was applied in Connell\u2019s case[6] where the \u201cdefect\u201d in the \u201cways\u201d and \u201cworks * * * connected with or used in the business\u201d of the employer consisted in an accumulation of inflammable gas in a section of a mine which \u201cwas being worked and traversed by workmen\u201d.\nThere are two separate conditions, one of which is that there must be a \u201cdefect\u201d in the condition of the thing, \u201chaving regard to the use to which it is to be applied or to the mode in which it is to be used.\u201d That is a distinct condition imposed by the use of the word \u201cdefect\u201d which has nothing to do with the negligence of the employer, which is another distinct condition. Lord Atkinson\u2019s last sentence, the basis of the judgment of the House of Lords, ought to be emphasized,\nThis judgment supports completely my contention that it is the use to which a thing is intended to be put and is being put which must be considered when the question whether or not there is a defect in its condition has to be determined.\nIt may be added that this view has been the generally accepted view of the profession in England, as is evidenced by Ruegg (8th Ed.) at pp. 118 et seq., 20 Halsbury, 142.\nIt should, perhaps, be observed that when the employer or his deputy permits a particular use, that shews conclusively that such is the intended use of the thing to which \u201cdefect\u201d is imputed within the meaning of this principle. (Jones v. Burford)[7]. I do not think I need delay upon a discussion of the applicability of this to the case of buildings. If an employee is properly in the vicinity of his employer\u2019s plant, works or buildings, and owing to some defect in condition something falls upon the workman and injures him, that would, of course, be a consequence of a defect in condition within Lord Atkinson\u2019s language, because plant, works or buildings are not intended to fall to pieces or to collapse.\nThe language of the judgments in Connell\u2019s case6 and in Walsh v. Whiteley[8] seems reasonably applicable to the case before us. There is here no question of the arrangement of the \u201cworks, ways, etc.\u201d; the matter complained of is the condition of the window sill. Therefore, the plaintiff, if he was in truth using the sill upon which his body was resting for a purpose authorized by his employer, and the condition of the sill was such that it gave way and so caused him to fall, these facts bring the case within the purview of the enactment.\nOn the other hand, although he was engaged in cleaning windows, if, nevertheless, he was using the sill for a purpose not authorized, for example, for indulging in acrobatic feats, and it was this unauthorized and wrongful use of the sill which caused it to give way, then I should agree that his injury was not \u201ccaused\u201d by the condition of the sill within the contemplation of the statute.\nI do not think it necessary to proceed further in the discussion of the statute. The jury found that the appellant was engaged in executing the duties of his employment and they negatived contributory negligence.\nNow, in form, these findings do not aptly comprehend the points I have discussed; but when you add the finding that the injury was, in substance, \u201ccaused\u201d by the defect, they do so. They negative by necessary implication the suggestion that the cause of Lewis\u2019 fall was some prank unconnected with his duties; and they establish that the sill was being used in a reasonable way for a purpose for which its use was permitted.\nI shall add an observation as to the word \u201ccaused\u201d. The sole question is whether the injury was \u201ccaused\u201d within the intendment of the statute. The jury\u2019s finding that Lewis was acting reasonably, necessarily, if there was evidence to support it, disposes of the contention that what he did was nova causa interveniens; that is so, because his case is, on that assumption, precisely the kind of case envisaged by the statute.\nIf \u201ccause\u201d is to be paraphrased or qualified, I prefer the paraphrase adopted by Lord Esher, M.R., in The Bernina case[9]:\n(5) If, although the plaintiff has himself or by his servants been guilty of negligence, such negligence did not directly partly cause the accident, as if, for example, the plaintiff or his servants having been negligent, the alleged wrongdoers might by reasonable care have avoided the accident, the plaintiff can maintain an action against the defendant. (6) If the plaintiff has been personally guilty of negligence which has partly directly caused the accident, he cannot maintain an action against anyone;\nand chiefly for the reasons mentioned in the following passage in Lord Sumner\u2019s judgment in Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[10]:\nEverything that happens, happens in the order of nature and is therefore \u201cnatural\u201d. Nothing that happens by the free choice of a thinking man is \u201cnecessary,\u201d except in the sense of predestination. To speak of \u201cprobable\u201d consequence is to throw everything upon the jury. It is tautologous to speak of \u201ceffective\u201d cause or to say that damages too remote from the cause are irrecoverable, for an effective cause is simply that which causes, and in law what is ineffective or too remote is not a cause at all. I still venture to think that direct cause is the best expression. Proximate cause has acquired a special connotation through its use in reference to contracts of insurance. Direct cause excludes what is indirect, conveys the essential distinction, which causa causans and causa sine qua non rather cumbrously indicate, and is consistent with the possibility of the concurrence of more direct causes than one, operating at the same time and leading to a common result as in Burrows v. March Gas & Coke Co.[11] and Hill v. New River Co.[12]\nSee Long v. Toronto Ry. Co.[13]; Canada & Gulf Terminal Ry. Co. v. Levesque[14].\nOn the findings, since there was no nova causa interveniens, it is clear that the fall of Lewis was directly caused by the condition of the sill.\nAs to the evidence, I will not discuss it in detail. The questions were pre-eminently for a jury, and I think the evidence was sufficient.\nWhat I have said will indicate with sufficient clearness why, with great respect, I am unable to agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. If Lewis\u2019s acts constituted a reasonable use of the sill, as the jury (as I think, on sufficient evidence) have found, then, as I have just said, I find it too difficult to hold that his fall was not \u201ccaused\u201d, within the intent of the statute, by the condition of the sill.\nLAMONT, J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed with costs and that there should be a new trial for the assessment of damages upon the basis of the findings referred to by my brother Crocket in his judgment.\nThe first question to be considered in this appeal is, were the injuries which Lewis received caused by a \u201cdefect\u201d in the condition of the building or premises used in the business of his employer? The \u201cdefect\u201d alleged was that the window-sill was rotten and not properly attached to the building, and that, as a consequence thereof, it gave way when Lewis, whose duty it was to wash the window, was in the act of performing that duty, and he was precipitated to the roof of a building two storeys below, and was severely injured. That the window-sill was intended to be used as a seat, upon which the window cleaner might sit while actually washing the window, is not denied. The usual manner of washing the windows was for the washer to sit on the sill with his head and body outside of the window, facing inside, his feet on the inside and the window pulled down to his lap. Lewis had for many months washed the windows in this manner, to the knowledge of Gibson Brothers, who looked after the building for the respondent. Thus the respondent, through its representative, permitted, and therefore intended, the window-sill to be used as a base of operations from which the washing of the window might be carried on. It was, therefore, \u201cintended for or used in the business of his employer\u201d within the meaning of the statute. If it was, in its condition, unfitted for such use, or if its condition made it dangerous to the workman when reasonably so using it, that condition constituted a \u201cdefect\u201d within the contemplation of the statute. That the window-sill in question was being used at the time of the accident as a base of operations from which to clean the window is clear. Was the manner in which it was being used by Lewis a reasonable one? The jury have said that it was, because they found that, at the time of the accident, Lewis was acting within the scope of his employment and was not guilty of any negligence which contributed to the accident. On the argument before us it was strongly contended that the evidence of Lewis taken on examination for discovery, and put in by counsel for the respondent, established that the accident was the result of the reckless conduct of Lewis himself in attempting to clean the window in a manner different from that usually adopted. It was pointed out that, in his examination, Lewis admitted that on this occasion he was not on the window-sill in a sitting posture, but had his right foot and left knee on the sill, and that this was not a reasonable position to take in washing windows and that, therefore, the accident must be attributed to his own recklessness.\nWhether Lewis was sitting or kneeling on the sill at the time of the accident, the sill had to bear the entire weight of his body and it was a question for the jury whether, if the wood in the sill had been sound and it had been properly attached to the building, it would have supported his weight in either of these positions. Whether the position adopted by him was a proper one to take was also a question solely for the jury, and the jury by their verdict have, as I have said, found that it was. Lewis had not been instructed how he was to wash the windows, that was left entirely to his own judgment. He could, therefore, perform the operation in any manner he chose, provided that manner was a reasonable one. And, in determining its reasonableness, the jury might properly have regard to the fact that Lewis did not know of any \u201cdefect\u201d in the condition of the sill.\nIn my opinion, there was evidence upon which the jury were entitled to find that the injuries of Lewis were \u201ccaused\u201d, within the meaning of the statute, by a \u201cdefect\u201d in the condition of the window-sill.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014The respondent, a wholesale dealer in woollen and other goods, purchased an office building adjoining its business premises on Wellington Street West, Toronto, in 1929, the management of which it delegated to a real estate agency. In November of that year the husband of the appellant administratrix was employed by this agency as janitor and caretaker of the newly acquired building at a wage of $65 a month with living quarters provided in the building for himself and his family. His employment in- cluded, among other things, attending the furnaces and the cleaning of the halls and windows.\nOn May 21st, 1930, he went to clean two windows in the hall on the fourth floor, which is the top floor of the building. These windows, it appears, are placed side by side in the sloping Mansard roof of the building but are separated from each other by a pillar 12 inches wide. The two windows are the same size, each measuring in width 2 feet 8 inches from one side of the window frame to the other, and containing an upper and lower sash which are moved up and down by pulley ropes and weights. Although the evidence throughout is most confusing with its references to the two windows as one window and to the sill of the window frame proper as the subsill, it appears from the explanations made during the argument that the sill of the window frame proper rested partly at least upon a piece of wood about 4 inches thick which was inserted in a recess in the top of the outside brick wall to which the sill of the window frame proper was nailed. The sill of the window frame proper extended about 4 inches beyond the outside of the lower window sash when closed. The finished inside sill from its inner edge to the window stop was 9\u00bc inches wide, so that, allowing for the width of the window stop and the thickness of the window sash, there was a width of 18\u00bd inches from the inner edge of the finished inside sill to the outer edge of the sill of the window frame proper. The inside sill was 20 inches above the hall floor.\nLewis, it seems, had cleaned the upper and lower sashes of one of these windows on the outside while sitting on the window sill facing towards the inside of the building, and was reaching over to clean the other window to his right, when the outside sill, upon which he had been sitting while cleaning the first window and from which he was then reaching, gave way and he fell to the roof of a shed two stories below, sustaining serious injuries to his back and spinal cord for which he was under treatment in an hospital for nearly eight months. Ten days after his discharge as a patient for these injuries he returned to the hospital for a mastoid operation and remained as a patient again for several weeks. This trouble, however, had no connection with the injuries suffered from the fall from the window.\nThis action was brought by himself and his wife on November 23rd, 1931, the latter claiming damages for loss of consortium and loss of support. Lewis died of pneumonia on December 3rd, 1932, his death, according to the medical evidence, having no connection whatever with the fall. The action was revived in February, 1933, and tried soon afterwards before Mr. Justice Kerwin and a jury, Mrs. Lewis during the trial abandoning her claim.\nAlthough the plaintiffs in their statement of claim alleged that the window sill broke away owing to the negligence of the defendant, its agents, workmen or servants \u201cin that the said window sill was rotten and was not firmly attached to the said building and was neglected by the said defendant while in a dangerous condition which was known or ought to have been known by the defendant,\u201d and the whole action was apparently based upon negligence, no question was submitted to the jury by the learned trial judge touching any negligence upon the defendant\u2019s part, the plaintiff having apparently abandoned that branch of his case and relied entirely upon Part II of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 179, ss. 119 and 120.\nThe questions put to the jury with their answers were as follows:\n1. Q. Was the accident caused by any defect in the window sill? Answer fully, giving particulars.\nA. Yes. Owing to decayed condition of window sill.\n2. Q. At the time of the accident was Lewis acting within the scope of his employment?\nA. Yes.\n3. Q. Was Lewis guilty of negligence contributing to the accident? Answer fully, giving particulars.\nA. No.\n4. Q. If so, to what degree in per cent. was he so negligent?\n(No answer.)\n5. Q. What is entire amount of damages to which Lewis would have been entitled had there been no contributory negligence on his part?\nA. $12,000.\nThe verdict was accordingly entered for the plaintiff administratrix for $12,000.\nOn appeal by the respondent the Appeal Court set this verdict aside and ordered that the action be dismissed with costs upon the ground, as appears by the written reasons of Middleton, J., that the case had not been brought within the statute, the deceased being the author of his own injury by exposing himself to an unnecessary risk on the principle of the case of Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co. v. Highley[15]. No one other than Lewis himself witnessed the accident and the only evidence as to what actually happened on the occasion in question which is to be found in the record are those portions of his discovery examination which the defendant\u2019s counsel offered on the trial. I have already sufficiently set forth the deceased\u2019s statement as to how he cleaned the two sashes of the first window and the position in which he was when he reached over to clean the second one. The only further questions and answers which appear in the record and which bear upon the precise position in which he was when the window sill collapsed are as follows:\nQ. Were you still sitting on the window sill?\nA. I was still partly sitting, like one knee.\nQ. You were on one knee and one foot?\nA. Yes, one foot and one knee, and holding on this first half and reaching with the right hand, and everything went down.\nQ. Do I understand that you were wholly outside the window?\nA. No, not wholly.\nQ. The window was up a little from the bottom?\nA. My left foot was inside and the knee and the right foot outside, and I was reaching for the right hand half.\nWhether Lewis, when reaching with his right hand for the second window, was straddling the sill in a sitting position or kneeling with his right knee on the outside portion of the sill, his statement does not make clear, but it would seem to be quite evident that, whether he was sitting or kneeling, his principal weight would be on the outside part of the sill and that he was bending or leaning over from the sill of this window to the other when he went down with the giving way of the sill.\nIt is not disputed that the deceased\u2019s contract of service created the relationship of employer and workman between the defendant and the deceased and brought the latter within the class of workmen for whose benefit ss. 119-121 of Part II of the existing Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act were enacted. Neither is it disputed that s. 119 (1) imposes on the employer a liability to make good the damages sustained by the deceased in consequence of his injuries if such injuries were in fact caused by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the window sill, whether the existence of such defect at the time the accident occurred was or was not due to any negligence on the part of the employer. The jury\u2019s answer to question 1 is, therefore, decisive of the whole question of the respondent\u2019s liability if there is sufficient evidence to warrant it and no error in law in connection therewith.\nTwo objections are relied upon by the respondent as errors in law: 1st, that s. 119 (1) contemplates only a defect in respect of the purpose for which the thing is provided, whether it be a way, a machine or any part of a building, and that, the purpose of an outside window sill having no relation to the deceased\u2019s work as a janitor or caretaker, there was no defect within the meaning of the section; and, 2nd, that if the sill did constitute a defect within the meaning of the enactment, the deceased\u2019s injuries cannot rightly be attributed upon the evidence to such defect as their immediate or direct cause.\nAs the solution of the questions raised by these two objections depends entirely upon the construction of ss. 119 and 120, it is perhaps well that the material provisions should here be set out. In so far as the language of s. 119 (1) bears on these questions, it is as follows:\u2014\nWhere personal injury is caused to a workman by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of his employer or by reason of the negligence of his employer or of any person in the service of his employer acting within the scope of his employment the workman * * * shall have an action against the employer, and * * * shall be entitled to recover from the employer the damages sustained by the workman by or in consequence of the injury.\nThen, as pointed out by Middleton, J., in the judgment appealed from, the common law defences of common employment, voluntary assumption of risk, negligence of fellow-servants and contributory negligence are done away with by the following subsections and by s. 120, as bars to the right of action and recovery which 119 (1) expressly gives to the workman, though s. 121 provides that contributory negligence is to be taken into account in assessing the damages.\nIt will be seen at once that the enactment is a special one which was clearly passed to extend the liability of the employer in favour of the workman. It is an enactment, therefore, which ought not to be narrowly construed against the workman. No court has any right to add to it any condition which its language does not clearly express or necessarily imply. Rather is it the duty of a court, as said by Brett, M.R., in Gibbs v. Great Western Ry. Co.[16], in construing a section of the Imperial Employers\u2019 Liability Act (1880) to construe it \u201cas largely as reason enables one to construe it in their [the workmen\u2019s] favour and for the furtherance of the object of the Act.\u201d\nApproaching then the construction of s. 119 (1) from the standpoint of the object of the whole enactment, what is there in its language to suggest that the words \u201cany defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of his employer\u201d necessarily implies a defect in respect of the purpose for which the way, machine, plant, or building was provided? Assuming that the building in which the deceased was employed as janitor and caretaker comes within the provisions of the statute as a building \u201cconnected with, intended for or used in the business of his employer,\u201d as the Appeal Court has held, and as the respondent\u2019s counsel has not here questioned, can it be said, if the workman is in fact injured by reason of a defect in the condition or arrangement of any portion of the building, that he is not to recover for his injuries, unless the defect be one which concerns the particular duties which the workman\u2019s contract of service required him to perform? I do not think so. That consideration may bear upon the question of the causation of the injury, but it has no sound basis as an argument for ignoring the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cdefect\u201d in the context in which it is used, as applicable to a building or to any of its parts, and annexing to it a condition or a meaning which the language of the enactment itself in no manner expresses or necessarily implies.\nThe learned counsel for the respondent in support of this contention depended largely on dicta from the judgment of Lopes, L.J., concurred in by Lindley, L.J., in Walsh v. Whiteley[17], a case involving the construction of the words \u201cdefect in the condition of the machinery\u201d as used in s. 1 (1) of the Imperial Employers\u2019 Liability Act. The first thing that judgment pointed out was that to determine the meaning of the words quoted it was necessary to look not only at s. 1 (1), but also at s. 2 (1). The latter expressly provided, as the Ontario statute, ch. 146, R.S.O., 1914, form- erly did also, that the workman should not be entitled to any right of compensation or remedy against the employer by reason of any such defect as mentioned in s. 1 (1) unless that defect arose from, or had not been discovered or remedied owing to, the negligence of the employer or of some person entrusted by him with the duty of seeing that the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, building or premises was proper. His Lordship then immediately proceeded:\u2014\nReading those sections and subsections together we think there must be a defect implying negligence in the employer. The negligence of the employer appears to be a necessary element without which the workman is not to be entitled to any compensation or remedy. It must be a defect in the condition of the machine, having regard to the use to which it is to be applied or to the mode in which it is to be used. It may be a defect either in the original construction of the machine, or a defect arising from its not being kept up to the mark, but it is essential that there should be evidence of negligence of the employer or some person in his service entrusted with the duty of seeing that the machine is in proper condition.\nTheir Lordships concluded that \u201cthe defect in the condition of the machinery must be such as to shew negligence on the part of the employer\u201d and that \u201cthere was no evidence of negligence to go to the jury.\u201d The cases of Heske v. Samuelson[18], and Cripps v. Judge[19], and others were referred to in this judgment, and it was pointed out that they were all cases where there was evidence of a defect shewing negligence of the employer.\nMr. Robertson stressed the words I have underlined as applying to the meaning of the word \u201cdefect\u201d as used in the English statute. The whole quotation and the whole judgment, however, make it perfectly clear, I think, that these words cannot safely be given the significance contended for but proceed rather from the consideration of the negligence of the employer as a necessary element in the existence of the defect causing the injury for which the statute gives the remedy to the workman. Indeed it is obvious, quite apart from the quoted context, that no court or jury could at all determine whether a defect in a machine was a defect arising from negligence of the employer without considering the use to which the machine is intended to be applied and the mode in which it is intended to be used. It can hardly be said that such an expression could in any view be similarly applied to an entire building or to a window frame or window sill or other piece of wood or metal placed in the foundation or wall or roof of a building as a permanent fixture. Once such a fixture is permanently placed, whether it be to strengthen the foundation or the walls or support the roof or to make an opening for light or ventilation, or to shed water off the walls, as was suggested was the purpose for which the window sill in question was provided, no question could possibly arise as to any use or mode of use of such a fixture by or for the occupying employer. Yet the fixture may none the less be a defective fixture and constitute a defect by reason of which personal injury is caused to a workman employed by the employer in or about the building. If a portion of a wall or of the roof fell in by reason of the unsoundness or defective condition of any of its parts and a workman should thereby be injured, is he to be excluded from the benefit of the statute because the defect existed in a portion of the building which his contract of service did not require him to use? To my mind it was the clear purpose of this part of the enactment to entitle the workman to recover damages from his employer for any personal injuries caused to him by reason of any defect in any part of the building in which he is employed. If the workman is injured by reason of any defect in the building in which he is employed, that is all that is necessary. No other condition is expressed or implied by the language of the section.\nWe were referred to British Columbia Mills Co. v. Scott[20], Wood v. Can. Pac. Ry. Co.[21], and other cases in this court and in Ontario in support of the proposition which it was contended was laid down in Walsh v. Whiteley[22], but all these cases will be found, in so far as they concern the question of injuries caused by defective plant or machinery, to have dealt with that question, as in Walsh v. Whiteley22, from the standpoint of defects arising from the negligence of the employer, as provided by the former Ontario and other similar Acts containing the same provisions as the English Employers\u2019 Liability Act, and the decisions to have been based on the same grounds. My attention has been called to a dictum of Lord Atkinson in Nimmo v. Connell[23], commenting on the decision in Walsh v. Whiteley22, which emphasizes the importance of the use to which a thing is intended to be put and is being put in determining whether or not there is a defect in its condition. An examination of this case shews that the decision was based on considerations of the defect there relied on arising from negligence, precisely as in Walsh v. Whiteley22, though in the earlier case it was held there was no defect arising from negligence and in the later case that there was. In the Nimmo case[24] the majority of the Law Lords held that the accumulation of inflammable gas in a section of a mine which was being worked and traversed by workmen in such quantities as to become explosive if a light were applied to it was a defect in the condition of the way within the meaning of s. 1 (1) of the Employer\u2019s Liability Act of 1880. As I read his judgment, the point of Lord Atkinson\u2019s dictum was that the word \u201cdefect\u201d as used in the English Act of 1880 does not refer solely to a material defect in the structure or substance of the way, but covers as well such a development as the accumulation of poisonous gas or the development of any other dangerous condition which might have been detected by the exercise of due care on the part of the Coal Mining Co. Indeed His Lordship distinctly held that the neglect of the company\u2019s inspector to do his inspection duty was the main cause of the accident in that case. The dictum, in my judgment, goes no further than that already quoted from Walsh v. Whiteley[25].\nAs to the second ground of alleged error in law, viz: that the injury claimed for was not caused by the alleged defect, there is no doubt that, in order to entitle the workman to recover from the employer under the first part of s. 119 (1), it must be proved that the injury was caused by reason of the defect. That this does not mean that the injury was solely attributable to the defect is conclusively shewn by the express provision of s. 120 that contributory negligence on the part of the workman shall not afford a defence to the action \u201cfor the recovery of damages for an injury sustained by * * * the workman while in the service of his employer for which the employer would otherwise have been liable,\u201d though s. 121 enacts that contributory negligence on the part of the workman shall be taken into account in assessing the damages in any such action. Reading sections 120 and 121 in connection with 119 (1), the clear intention is that the workman shall be entitled to recover from the employer for a personal injury sustained by him while in the service of his employer, whether the injury be caused by reason of a defect arising without negligence on the part of the employer or his servants or agents, or whether the injury be caused by reason of the negligence of the employer or of any person in his service acting within the scope of his employment, notwithstanding that the injury may have been in part brought about by some negligence on the part of the workman. All that is necessary, therefore, to entitle the workman to recover, is that the injury be in part directly attributable to the defect. The fact that some negligence of the workman may have operated with the existence of the defect to produce the injury makes no difference so far as the liability of the employer is concerned except as to the assessment of the quantum of the damages.\nNo other conclusion is possible upon the evidence, I think, than that if the window sill had been sound and securely fastened to the wall of the building the accident would not have happened. It may, of course, be said with equal truth that had Lewis not applied his weight to it while washing the first window and reaching over from it to wash the second the accident would not have happened either. Obviously the two facts\u2014the defective condition of the sill, which the evidence shews was not visible on superficial inspection, and the deceased\u2019s placing his weight upon it\u2014combined to cause it. The jury found that it was caused by the decayed condition of the sill and that the deceased was not guilty of any negligence contributing to it. That there was ample evidence to warrant the finding that the sill was decayed and that the accident was caused, at least in part, by that fact, I have no doubt. The fact of a section of the sill of the window frame proper breaking away with the piece of wood underneath in the recess at the top of the brick wall to which it was nailed, and dropping to the shed roof when the deceased himself fell, itself affords strong evidence of its defective and insecure condition. In addition to this, however, there was positive testimony that the sill was dozy or rotten and that it was insecurely nailed to the piece of wood which was inserted in the wall as its support. The jury\u2019s first finding, in my view, is conclusive upon the question of the respondent\u2019s liability under the special provisions of the statute, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, whether the deceased in making use of the sill for the purpose of washing the windows was guilty of contributory negligence or not.\nThe question as to whether the deceased voluntarily and unnecessarily assumed a new and added risk independently of that attaching to his employment as janitor and caretaker of the building and different in kind therefrom, or whether he was simply doing something within the sphere of his employment in an improper or negligent manner, does not arise, in my opinion, upon the special provisions of s. 119. The principle affirmed in Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co. v. Highley[26], upon which the Appeal Court relied, and other cases cited on the argument, is applicable only to claims for compensation for personal injuries caused to a workman \u201cby accident arising out of and in the course of the employment,\u201d which are the governing words giving the right to compensation under the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The same words are used in Part I of the Ontario Act. The test, as it is called, has no application to the enactment here in question, which gives a right of action to a workman for personal injury caused to him \u201cby reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, * * * buildings or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of his employer,\u201d while in the service of his employer.\nI feel bound to say, however, that had the deceased been a workman in any of the industries to which Part I of the Act applies, and the question been whether his injuries were caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment within the meaning of these words as used in Part I, I should not have been able to recognize any analogy between the facts in any of the English cases cited in support of the respondent\u2019s contention and those in the present case, where Lewis had not moved from the defective window sill, which almost at the very moment when it broke down under him he was quite properly using in the washing of the outside glass of the window of which the defective piece was a part. I should have thought the case of Pepper v. Sayer[27], decidedly more applicable.\nAs to the finding that the deceased was not guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, this finding, as already pointed out, affects only the assessment of damages. We are not prepared to hold that it was a finding which was not warranted in any reasonable view of the evidence, and are of opinion, therefore, that it must stand.\nWe think, however, that the damages awarded by the jury are so manifestly excessive as to entitle the respondent to a new trial, but that in the circumstances such new trial should be limited to the assessment of damages only and upon the basis of the findings expressed in the answers to questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3, which are left undisturbed.\nThe order will therefore be that the appeal be allowed, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal be set aside and that there be a new trial, limited to the assessment of damages on the basis of the findings above mentioned. There will be no costs on the appeal to the Court of Appeal to either party. The costs of the former trial shall abide the event of the new trial, and the appellant administratrix shall have the costs of the appeal to this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs. New trial ordered, limited to assessment of damages.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mackay & Matheson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Crabtree & McKee.\n[1] [1933] O.R. 595; [1933] 3 D.L.R. 414.\n[2] (1888) 21 Q.B.D. 371, at 378.\n[3] [1924] A.C. 595, at 606.\n[4] [1924] A.C. 595.\n[5] (1888) 21 Q.B.D. 371.\n[6] [1924] A.C. 595.\n[7] (1884) 1 T.L.R. 137.\n[8] (1888) 21 Q.B.D. 371.\n[9] (1887) 12 P.D. 58, at 61.\n[10] [1920] A.C. 956, at 983-4.\n[11] (1872) L.R. 7 Ex. 96.\n[12] (1868) 9 B. & S. 303.\n[13] (1914) 50 Can, S.C.R. 224, at 242-248.\n[14] [1928] Can.

The fire brigade of respondent, the City of Chatham, came to the fire but feared to cut the wires (for which they had certain appliances), or to fight the fire until the electric current was shut off. Telephone calls were sent to the operator at the Commission\u2019s sub-station, who refused to switch off the current without the Commission manager\u2019s instructions, and by the time the manager arrived and the current was shut off and the wires cut, the fire had spread and the mill could not be saved. Appellants claimed damages from the respondent City, alleging that the destruction of the mill was owing to negligence of it or its servants or agents.\nHeld, Crocket J. dissenting, that the City was not liable. Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1933] O.R. 305, affirmed,\nPer Duff C.J., Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.: There appeared no adequate reason for rejecting the findings of the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances, the Commission\u2019s officials or servants had not acted unreasonably or negligently. (As to the governing rule in regard to the questions of fact in the appeal, Johnston v. O\u2019Neill, [1911] A.C. 552, at 578, was cited). (The questions, whether the Commission, and whether the City, would have been liable for negligence of the Commission\u2019s servants, were not decided, decision thereon being unnecessary). As to the complaint that the firemen failed to take proper measures to stop the fire\u2014the City was not liable in damages for what was merely inactivity on the part of the firemen. (Duff C.J. and Smith J. agreed with the reasons of Davis J.A. in the Court of Appeal who so held and who was further of opinion that in any case the firemen were not negligent under the circumstances.) Per Crocket J., dissenting: It was the Commission\u2019s duty to provide for the promptest action in such an emergency, by having competent men always in charge of its substations, clothed with sufficient authority to extinguish promptly a short circuit threatening destruction of property or endangering firemen\u2019s lives in their efforts to save property. The Commission, in its failure to shut off the current when first requested to do so by the fire department, was guilty of negligence causing damage to plaintiffs; and its negligence was chargeable against the City, of which it was the statutory agent (the principle affirmed in Young v. Town of Gravenhurst, 24 Ont. L.R. 467, being applicable).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C., dismissing their action.\nThe action was brought against both the City of Chatham and the Chatham Public Utilities Commission (established under the Public Utilities Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 204), but upon the hearing of the appeal to the Court of Appeal the plaintiffs abandoned their appeal as against the latter (\u201crecognizing * * * that there was no cause of action against the Commission, it being merely a statutory agent of the municipality\u201d, per Davis J.A. in his judgment in the Court of Appeal) and the present appeal was against the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as it dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal as against the City of Chatham.\nThe action was for damages for alleged negligence in failing to prevent the spread of a fire which, on spreading, destroyed the entire mill building of the plaintiffs in the city of Chatham.\nThe fire was started by lightning striking the electric wires by which power was supplied to the mill by the Commission, and setting up an electric arc or short circuit at a point where the wires entered the conduit pipe running down the outside corrugated iron covered wall of the building. The fire brigade of the City feared to cut the wires (for which they had certain appliances) or, until the electric current was shut off, to turn on the water, and telephone calls were made to the operator in charge of the Commission\u2019s power sub-station to shut off the current. Plaintiffs complained of delay, in shutting off the current after demands made, and in fighting the fire, which, they claimed, was negligence for which the defendant City was responsible.\nThe trial judge, Rose, C.J.H.C. dismissed the action. He was of opinion that it could not be found that the firemen acted negligently or improperly in not cutting the wires in the conditions existing; but, in any case, he held that the City was not liable for the alleged failure in this regard complained of, expressing his opinion as follows:\nThe liability of the city, if any, in this regard must be for failing to put out, or to take proper measures for putting out, the fire. The action, in other words, is an action, not for damage caused to somebody by the negligent doing of something undertaken, but for damages for not acting. The firemen sat down and waited. The action is against the city for its inactivity, not for something positive done wrongly; * * * For this nonfeasance on the part of the city I think there is no liability to the individual who suffers.\nHe held also, in effect, that upon the evidence and upon the conduct of the officials of the Commission under all the circumstances in question, the plaintiffs had not established negligence on their part causing the damage complained of.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, Fisher J.A. dissenting.\nRiddell J.A., after remarking generally on the duty of the City in such a case and referring to certain aspects of the present case which tended to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, stated that, upon the evidence, he could not say \u201cthat there was necessarily negligence either in the system or in the conduct of the servants of the City\u201d.\nDavis J.A. (with whose reasons Duff C.J. and Smith J., in their judgment now reported, agreed) said (inter alia) in the course of his judgment:\nIt is plain that the firemen did not attempt to cut the wires and that it was between twenty minutes and a half hour before the electric current wa9 cut off at the Hydro station. Had the current been cut off within a few minutes after the lightning struck the wires, there can be no doubt that the loss of the plaintiffs would have been much less than it was; it is not unlikely that the whole building might have been saved.\n* * *\nHaving read the evidence carefully, I am convinced that the firemen in this case, confronted with the sudden and unusual emergency, and the extreme danger of the situation, were not negligent if there is, as a matter of law, any duty upon them or the Municipal Corporation to cut electric wires, or in fact do anything at a fire, in circumstances more common and less dangerous.\n* * * * * * It is true that they had ladders and rubber boots, a pair of rubber gloves and a pair of shears, but the firemen considered the situation too dangerous for them to deal with, and I think they were justified.\n* * *\n* * * While [the trial judge] could not find on the evidence that the firemen failed in doing what firemen ought to do, in abstaining from any attempt to mount the pole and cut the wires, he considered that discussion altogether unnecessary in his view of the law that the action was one not for something positive done wrongly, but for inactivity. With that statement I entirely agree.\nThere is no obligation upon a municipality in this province to maintain a fire brigade, and no obligation on a municipality to take charge of and extinguish fires that occur within the municipality. * * *\n* * *\nNowhere in the statute is there any obligation imposed upon the municipality to provide fire protection\u2014it is merely permissive.\nThe City of Chatham did, however, establish a fire department, and passed certain by\u2011laws, rules and regulations (put in at the trial as exhibits), governing the organization, pay and management of the firemen, and sufficient equipment for ordinary purposes was furnished to the firemen for their work.\nAfter referring to Hesketh v. The City of Toronto[2] (which he distinguished), he said:\nIn the case before us the complaint of the plaintiffs is that the firemen abstained from doing something that it is contended they ought to have done, and that it was negligence in law in that having taken control of the fire, they did not take proper and immediate steps to cut the electric wires that were on fire, so as to disconnect the current and make the use of water efficient to stop the spreading of the fire.\nHe thought that the principle of law applicable to this case is to be found in the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Sheppard v. Glossop Corporation[3] (which he discussed at length) and that that case \u201ccompletely answers the plaintiffs\u2019 submission that there was a negligent breach of duty on the part of the Municipality\u201d. He referred also to certain Ontario cases.\nThen, dealing with the allegation of negligence of the local Hydro Commission, he pointed out that any attack upon the \u201csystem\u201d of the local Commission was not open upon the pleadings, and stated that, upon the complaint against it as pleaded, he agreed with the trial judge\u2019s conclusions on both the facts and the law. His judgment in this regard is quoted from at length in the judgment of Duff C.J. now reported.\nFisher J.A. dissented in a lengthy judgment, holding that there was a clear case of misfeasance; that the City, having established and maintained a fire department, was liable for damages if guilty of negligence in the performance of the duties undertaken; that the damage which ultimately arose from the initial escape could have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care and courage on the part of the municipality or its statutory agents or in the proper actions of the fire department; and that there was negligence for which the City was liable in damages.\nThe plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and A.L. Hanna for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and J.A. McNevin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Smith J. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed. The negligence charged is stated in two paragraphs of the statement of claim, paragraphs 10 and 11, which I quote:\n10. The fire department of the defendant, the Municipal Corporation of the City of Chatham, were unable to fight the said fire, or in any event did not, for a long period after the arrival of the said department at the scene of the fire, by reason of the negligence of the defendants, or one of them, in that the defendants\u2019 servant in charge of the power at the Hydro station, operated by the defendant, the Chatham Public Utilities Commission, failed, neglected and refused to comply, with the demands made, by the officers of the fire department, operated by the defendant, the Municipal Corporation of the City of Chatham, to shut off the power, supplying the electrical energy, to the said building belonging to the plaintiffs.\n11. The plaintiffs allege, as the fact is, that the fire department of the defendant, the Municipal Corporation of the City of Chatham, refused, failed and neglected to fight the said fire, until the power supplying the electrical energy to the said building, was shut off by the defendant, the Chatham Public Utilities Commission.\nAt the trial, the issues were strictly confined to those raised by these paragraphs, and the evidence directed to those issues; although the trial judge, upon a not ill-iberal reading of paragraph 10, treated that paragraph as raising the issue whether a duty rested upon the Commission (as distinguished from the officer in charge of the substation) to respond to the alleged demands by the officers of the fire department by opening the switch. These are, therefore, the only issues which could properly be examined in the Court of Appeal, or can properly be examined here. Chatterton, who was in charge of the substation, says that, upon receipt of information that there was a fire near the appellants\u2019 premises, he telephoned first the line superintendent and then the manager. The manager proceeded at once to the scene of the trouble by motor; the superintendent had first to get his truck and appliances. The manager says that, arriving before the superintendent, and not having the necessary appliances for cutting the wires, he, after observing the situation, directed the proper switch to be opened; and, the wires having been cut, directed it to be closed. I mention these facts for the purpose of indicating what the officers of the Commission actually did. It is probable that if the line superintendent had not been accidentally delayed, he, being furnished with the necessary equipment, would at once have cut the wires, and that the switch would not have been opened. The manager\u2019s reasons for not directing the opening of the switch before reaching the scene of the fire are fully explained by him; and I perceive no adequate reason for rejecting the findings of the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances, the Commission is not chargeable with failure to exercise proper energy and reasonable judgment because of the conduct of the manager or superintendent or that of the operator at the substation.\nRose C.J. says:\nThen as to the Public Utilities Commission. * * * The action against the Commission, as stated in the statement of claim, paragraph 10, is an action for damages resulting from the failure, neglect and refusal of the Commission to comply with demands made by officers of the fire department to shut off the power from the line supplying power to the plaintiffs\u2019 building. For the purposes of the case I treat the Commission as an entity, a corporation supplying power to consumers for purposes of light and other purposes, and having no special statutory privileges; and I treat information given to the man for the time being in charge of the Commission\u2019s substation as information given to the Commission, and requests made to that man as requests made to the Commission; and I judge of the duty of that man to act by attributing to him all the knowledge that the Commission by any of its officers possessed. I treat the case, then, as being a case against the Commission for failure, neglect and refusal upon the part of the Commission to comply with demands made to the Commission, and I ask myself what the liability is.\nI assume also that it is the obligation of such a corporation as for the purposes of the case I am treating the Commission as being, to use the utmost care in the handling of anything so dangerous as electricity under high voltage, and I assume, without the necessity of deciding, that if it is brought to the notice of such a corporation that its wires have become, without any default on its part, a source of danger to the public in general or to some person in particular, it is the duty of the corporation to take adequate and prompt steps to remove the danger. Making all these assumptions, which are the strongest assumptions that can possibly be made against the Commission, I ask what the duty of the Commission was in the particular case.\nFirst of all, one must ask what information the Commission had. The Commission had information that there was a fire near the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, and that, in the opinion of some persons\u2014first a private individual, later a policeman, later a fireman, and later still the chief of the fire brigade\u2014the wires of the Commission were in some manner a source of danger, and perhaps were in some way obstructing the efforts of the firemen; but, as far as the evidence here goes, no precise information as to the state of affairs existing was conveyed to the Commission. There was no statement, so far as I am aware, that the trouble was in the power wires rather than in the lighting wires or the other way around, or as to the manner in which the trouble, whatever it was, on the wires was either endangering the building or obstructing the firemen. I suppose that the persons who telephoned were telephoning under a good deal of stress and in more or less excitement. No doubt they made known their desire that, as they expressed it, the power should be cut off, but the reasons for that desire or the conditions which had given rise to that desire were not conveyed, so far as the evidence goes, to the Commission.\nWell, what was the Commission to do upon getting that kind of information? In my opinion the proper action was to investigate as quickly as possible and to take such action as investigation by a competent person showed to be necessary. Investigation might show the necessity or the desirability of opening a certain switch or certain switches or it might show that the proper action was the cutting of the wires, or it might show that the thing to do was to open the switches for a very short time while the wires were being cut and then to close them; but it was a case in which I think the Commission could not know what action was necessary or desirable until investigation had been made, and so, as I say, I think the duty of the Commission was to investigate with the least possible delay. The Commission did investigate. There was some delay, of course, and it is suggested that the delay was greater than it need have been. I do not think, however, that it is shown that the delay was excessive, or that, if there was any excess, the excess was the cause of the damage of which the plaintiffs complain. When the manager of the Commission arrived on the scene he caused the power to be cut off. Soon thereafter he was in a position to have the wires leading into the plaintiffs\u2019 premises cut, and the wires were cut, and the power was again turned on. I think there is no evidence upon which it can be found that there was unnecessary delay in communicating with the manager or unnecessary delay on the part of the manager in betaking himself to the scene of the trouble.\nI need not go into all the reasons why I think that this investigation, rather than some blind action from the power house, was the proper action on the part of the Commission. The reasons are pretty obvious, and have been stated by witnesses and elaborated by counsel. The Commission owes a duty, not only to the person whose property is supposed to be in danger, but to all its customers. It cannot unnecessarily shut off power; great inconvenience may be caused by an unnecessary shutdown, and danger of one sort or another may be created. If the power is cut off, except upon the instructions of someone on the spot who knows what lines ought to be switched, no one in the office of the Commission can by any means tell how long the switches ought to be kept open. The Commission in its office, with such information as this Commission had, would be acting blindly, I think improperly, in opening switches upon the type of information or at the requests that were made in the particular case. So I think that there is no liability on the part of the Commission for not acting.\nI pause here to call attention to the nature of the three findings of fact which the learned trial judge has enunciated in his judgment.\nAfter weighing the evidence of the various witnesses, and examining the facts disclosed by the evidence, he concludes, first, that, in the special circumstances, it was not unreasonable on the part of these officers, that is to say, on the part of the Commission, not to open the switch at once, in compliance with the suggestions or demands made, without first taking proper steps to obtain a more exact knowledge of the circumstances. Second, he finds that there was no \u201cexcessive\u201d delay in taking such steps, or in acting upon the information obtained; and third, that it is not shewn, if there was excessive delay, that such delay was the cause of the damage of which the appellants complain.\nIt was pressed upon us during the argument with a good deal of vigour that the learned trial judge omitted to take into account the contention of the appellants that the operator at the substation, if he had acted with reasonable energy, would have ascertained from the chief of the fire brigade, or from others who telephoned him, the fact in respect of which the Commission was not informed, as the learned Chief Justice says, through the communication received by the operator. I think the learned Chief Justice cannot justly be supposed to have overlooked this contention.\nDuring the course of the cross examination of the operator the witness stated that the chief of the fire brigade, when requesting him to \u201ccut off the service\u201d, did not tell him where the fire was. The witness proceeded:\nQ. You swear that positively? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. All right; what did he say? A. He asked me to cut the power off.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Q. What power? A. The power; he did not specify any power at all.\nThe learned Chief Justice then asked the witness:\nQ. Well, why didn\u2019t you ask him? A. It was all done so hurriedly, and I had had so many calls in a few minutes, that I didn\u2019t ask him anything at all before he hung up. The operator, no doubt, had already been told approximately where the fire was, but this and many other passages in the evidence must have impressed the learned Chief Justice as well as the Court of Appeal as indicating the difficulties he must have encountered, owing to the state of confusion and excitement of those who were urging him to \u201ccut off the power\u201d, in attempting to obtain from them more exact and reliable information. The learned Chief Justice seems to have proceeded upon the view, this, I think, is plainly implied in his judgment, that such efforts on the part of the operator would have been fruitless; and that the Commission cannot be charged with any lack of due diligence in obtaining information by reason of the conduct of the operator.\nThe appreciation of the situation in this aspect was peculiarly a matter for the trial judge who, having all the parties concerned before him, was in a specially advantageous position to pass upon the question whether or not, in this respect, there was any lack of diligence.\nThe learned Chief Justice then proceeds:\nIf that is so, I need not consider another of the difficulties in the plaintiffs\u2019 way. If the Commission was required to act upon the information received on the telephone from some of the persons who did telephone, one ought to be able to fix the time at which the action ought to have taken place, the state of affairs at the fire at the moment, and all the other conditions, and ought to be able to say before the plaintiffs have judgment that action at that particular time would have prevented the loss which the plaintiffs have sustained. It would be very difficult indeed, upon the evidence here, to fix the moment at which action ought to have taken place, or to say what the result of action at that moment would have been, although there is some evidence upon which perhaps it could be found that if the Commission had opened the switch controlling the 550-volt circuit at the moment when the chief of the fire brigade telephoned, the firemen would have been able to save the building. The building of course would have been damaged to some extent, but, if the opinion of the two firemen who were inside is correct, perhaps at that time the building as a whole could have been saved. However, it would be necessary to fix either the time of the first message by the chief of the fire brigade or some other time as the time at which the Commission ought to have acted, and to say, before giving judgment for the plaintiffs, that if there had been action at that moment the loss would not have occurred or would have been diminished.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Davis, J.A., says:\nThe complaint in respect of the local Hydro Commission as pleaded was that it refused to comply with the demand of the fire department to shut off the power and reliance was had by the plaintiffs upon secs. 21 and 22 of a by-law of the municipal council making provision for preventing fires. Sec. 21 requiring obedience to the demands of the fire chief applies only to inhabitants of the city \u201cbeing present at a fire\u201d, and sec. 22 providing that no person shall prevent or obstruct the fire chief, has no application to the officials of the local Hydro Commission on the facts of this case.\nThe learned trial Judge very carefully reviewed the evidence on this branch of the case, and I entirely agree with his conclusions on both the facts and the law. There is no doubt a duty upon anyone generating and distributing electricity under high voltage, to use the utmost care and to take prompt and adequate steps within a reasonable time to remove any danger of which it has notice or knowledge. But having regard to the unusual emergency that occurred, upon the facts of this case, and the confused and uncertain information that was telephoned in to the night operator at the station,\u2014(first a private individual, later a policeman, later a fireman, and later still the chief of the fire brigade),\u2014the lack of anything definite as to the nature or extent or location of the fire,\u2014the immediate telephone communication of the night operator, who had not himself the knowledge or information to cope with the situation, to the manager of the Commission; the manager\u2019s arrival at the place of the fire as quickly as he could possibly get there; his personal investigation of the situation and his immediate order and direction to the night operator, to turn off the power, and the prompt compliance with that order, all seem to me to amply justify the conclusion of the trial Judge that there was no negligence on the part of the Commission. In any event the case pleaded, and to which the plaintiffs were properly confined at the trial, and should be confined in this Court, was merely an alleged neglect or failure on the part of the Commission to comply with the fire chief\u2019s demand. It was in fact complied with, and under all the circumstances, without any unreasonable delay.\nAs regards the questions of fact involved in the appeal, we must not overlook the settled rule which governs us in Johnston v. O\u2019Neill[4]. Lord Macnaghten there stated the rule which is proper here:\nThe appeal is in reality an appeal from two concurrent findings of fact. In such a case the appellant undertakes a somewhat heavy burden. It lies on him to shew that the order appealed from is clearly wrong. In a Scotch case, Gray v. Turnbull[5], where there was an appeal from two concurrent findings of fact in a case in which the evidence was taken on commission and neither Court saw the witnesses, Lord Westbury, after referring to the practice in Courts of Equity to allow appeals on matters of fact, makes this observation: \u201cIf we open the door to an appeal of this kind, undoubtedly it will be an obligation upon the appellant to prove a case that admits of no doubt whatever.\u201d In an English case, Owners of the P. Caland v. Glamorgan Steamship Co.[6], Lord Watson expressed himself as follows: \u201cIn my opinion it is a salutary principle that judges sitting in a court of last resort ought not to disturb concurrent findings of fact by the courts below, unless they can arrive at,\u2014I will not say a certain, because in such matters there can be no absolute certainty,\u2014but a tolerably clear conviction that these findings are erroneous.\u201d Nothing has been advanced which produces in my mind such \u201cconviction\u201d.\nAs to the issue raised by paragraph 11\u2014here again I find myself in entire agreement with the views expressed by Rose C.J. and Davis J.A., and am quite content to rest my judgment in respect of this branch of the appeal upon those reasons. I add a reference to Orfila\u2019s case[7].\nTwo other questions were considered in the Court of Appeal. First, the question whether the Commission is answerable in legal proceedings for the negligence of its servants, in such a situation as that presented here, where negligence is established. It may be that\u2014by reason of the pertinent decisions and the re-enactment, more than once, of the pertinent legislation after the decisions were pronounced, and the acceptance of the decisions as expressing the effect of the legislation, and, consequently, as giving an authoritative guidance in the conduct of municipal affairs\u2014it may be that, for these reasons, these decisions are not now open to review. I express no opinion on that, or on the effect of the legislation. Neither do I discuss the question whether, by force of the legislation, the Corporation is responsible for the collateral negligence of the servants of the Commission in the execution of the duties of the Commission under the by-law and the statutes. On these questions it is better, I think, to say nothing, until a case arises in which a decision on one or more of them is necessary.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRINFRET, J.\u2014I concur with my Lord the Chief Justice.\nThe city is not legally responsible in damages, in this case, for mere inactivity on the part of its firemen. It is a question whether it is answerable for the negligence of the servants of the Public Utilities Commission, but assuming the point against the city, I do not feel warranted in disturbing the concurrent findings of fact made in this respect by the Honourable the Chief Justice of the High Court and by the majority of the Court of Appeal. LAMONT, J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, and I do so because I am convinced that the law of Ontario does not impose responsibility upon a municipality for mere inactivity on the part of its servants.\nIn so far as the Public Utilities Commission is concerned two questions were involved: 1. Was the Commission, or its servants, guilty of any negligence which contributed to the loss sustained by the appellants? And 2. If so, was the Commission the statutory agent of the municipality?\nThe learned trial judge held that the course pursued by the officials and servants of the Utilities Commission was a reasonable one and was justified under the circumstances. He, therefore, absolved the Commission from any blame in connection with the burning of the appellants\u2019 mills. This finding was affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal, and I am not prepared to differ from it. As the Utilities Commission was not guilty of any negligence contributing to the appellants\u2019 loss, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not the Commission was the statutory agent of the municipality, and that question I wish to leave open for future consideration. In view of the finding of fact just referred to, the dropping of the Commission from the action as a separate defendant had no effect upon the rights of the plaintiffs.\nThe case against the municipality is different. As pointed out by the trial judge it is not an action for something positive done wrongly, but one for damages for inactivity. The allegation against it is: \u201cthat its fire department refused, failed and neglected to fight the fire until the power supplying the electricity to the building was shut off by the Utilities Commission\u201d. The truth of that allegation is admitted. The firemen arrived at the scene of the fire promptly after it commenced, and they saw an arc or ball of fire about three feet wide at the point where the wires entered the conduit pipe leading into the mill. This point was about sixteen feet from the ground and about four to six inches from the side of the metallic covered building, and was the place where the lightning had struck the wires. This arc or ball of fire gave forth what is described as a \u201csputtering noise\u201d, a \u201chissing sound as from an acetylene torch\u201d, a \u201csizzling ball of flame which sounded like a lot of fire crackers or fuses exploding\u201d. Before this unusual sight the firemen quailed. They annexed the hose to the hydrant but did not turn on the water because they did not know what the water would do. They were afraid to do anything until the power was shut off, although they had in their possession the necessary equipment for cutting the wires and the evidence shews that they could have cut them and could have turned the water on the fire with perfect safety to themselves. This they did not do but stood milling around in helpless confusion until the fire had melted the conduit pipe and entered the building and got such a start that when, some twenty-five minutes after the fire commenced, the manager of the Utilities Commission arrived, shut off the power, cut the wires and got the water turned on, it was then too late to save the mill from destruction. It does appear to me not to be open to doubt that had the firemen, when they first arrived, cut the wires and turned on the water, very little damage would have been done to the mill. Their failure to act resulted from ignorance on their part as to what firemen should do in circumstances there existing. It seems to me to be too obvious for argument that at the present day, in a city where the lighting is derived from electricity and the power for most industries comes from the same source, the fire chief, or some person on the force, should know where and how to cut the wires leading into a burning building even if a short circuit has occurred. However, granting that this may be so, it does not affect the liability of the municipality, for, under the authorities referred to by the trial judge and the judges of the Court of Appeal, the law of Ontario seems undoubtedly to be that a municipality cannot be held liable for mere inactivity on the part of its servants.\nThe conclusion at which we have been forced to arrive in this case is to me very unsatisfactory, but the reason for its unsatisfactory character rests on the state of the law and not on the courts.\nCROCKET, J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs commenced this action against the respondent Corporation of the City of Chatham and the Chatham Public Utilities Commission to recover damages to the amount of $26,363.15 for the destruction by fire on September 15, 1931, of their flour mill in that city through the negligence, as they alleged in their statement of claim, of both the defendants or of one or other of them. The action was tried before Rose, C.J.H.C, without a jury, by whom it was dismissed against both defendants, His Lordship holding that the negligence complained of against the city consisted merely of nonfeasance for which a municipal corporation was not liable and that there was no negligence upon the part of the Chatham Public Utilities Commission.\nDuring the hearing of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the trial judgment their counsel, acting upon the suggestion of the court that the Public Utilities Commission was the statutory agent of the City Corporation on the principle affirmed in Young v. Town of Gravenhurst[8] and other cases and was therefore an unnecessary party to the action, abandoned their appeal against that corporation, though maintaining that the City of Chatham was liable for the negligence, if any, of the Utilities Commission. The Appeal Court accordingly considered the appeal upon that assumption and dismissed it on a division of opinion, Riddell and Davis, JJ.A., supporting the judgment of the learned trial judge, while Fisher, J.A., dissented.\nThe fire in question started between 1.30 and 2 o\u2019clock a.m. and was admittedly caused by lightning striking the electric wires by which the Utilities Commission supplied power to the plaintiffs\u2019 mill, and setting up an electric arc or short circuit at a point where the wires entered the conduit pipe running down the outside corrugated iron covered wall. The arc was noticed immediately by a witness (Whitely), who lived across the street from the mill, and who at once telephoned an alarm to the fire department. A fire brigade of eight men under charge of Captain Johnston arrived within a few minutes. The fire chief arrived on the scene some minutes later, possibly ten minutes according to the fire captain. The conduit pipe attached to the building was still aflame, while the wires about 20 to 25 feet away at the pole, from which they were carried to the conduit pipe, were throwing out sparks and sputtering. Both Captain Johnston and the fire chief decided that the water should not be turned on the arc or on the inside of the building until the electric current was shut off. Before the chief\u2019s arrival the operator in charge of the Commission\u2019s power substation had been informed of the fire over the telephone by Whitely and asked to switch off the current in that district; in fact Whitely telephoned him immediately after telephoning the alarm to the fire station, when he was told this could not be done until the manager came. The operator had also received a message to the same effect from a fireman acting on the instructions of the fire captain before the fire chief\u2019s arrival on the scene, when he said a man would be sent to the mill at once to open the line. The fire chief himself called up the substation operator within a few minutes of his arrival, requesting that the current be shut off in that section of the city, and was told that he could not cut off the current until he got hold of the manager. The fire chief called again two or three minutes later when he was told that the manager was on his way. In the result, the power was not shut off until the lapse of nearly half an hour after the arrival of the fire brigade, all efforts on the part of the firemen to save the building from destruction having been suspended until the current had thus been shut off. In the meantime the fire had broken out in the interior of the building and made such progress that the whole mill with its equipment was practically destroyed.\nThe evidence shews that the fire brigade upon their arrival were equipped with shears with rubber insulated handles for cutting electric wires but that no attempt was made to cut the wires because of the belief on the part of the fire chief and Captain Johnston that the situation was such as to involve too much danger to anyone making such an attempt.\nThese were the two main specific grounds of negligence which the plaintiffs sought to establish at the trial: first, the failure to open the switch at the hydro substation; and, second, the failure of the fire brigade, in the circumstances, to fight the fire until the electric current was shut off. The first primarily involves the Commission and the second the fire department.\nEvidence was tendered by the plaintiffs for the purpose of proving that the Commission\u2019s system was insufficient and defective for want of an automatic expulsion fuse, which would have at once opened the circuit in the area where the fire occurred, but the learned trial judge, on objection being made by the Commission\u2019s counsel, rejected it as irrelevant on the ground that plaintiffs had made no allegation of a defective plant or system against the Commission in their statement of claim, and that the Commission was, therefore, not prepared to meet it. His Lordship held that the plaintiffs had based their claim of negligence against the Commission entirely on the ground of its or its servants\u2019 failure to comply with the request of the fire department to shut off the power.\nIn dealing with the case against the Commission he accordingly considered it solely from this standpoint. His decision that there was no negligence on the part of the Commission was clearly based on his finding that the messages to the Commission\u2019s operator at the substation did not convey sufficiently precise information of the emergency to warrant the Commission in shutting off the power without further investigation, having regard to the duty it owed to all its customers in the area affected; and that, although the information which these messages did convey imposed upon the Commission the duty of investigating the situation with the least possible delay, it was not shewn in the circumstances that there was any excessive delay, or, if there was, that it was the cause of the damage the plaintiffs sustained.\nBy their abandonment of their appeal against the Commission the plaintiffs have staked their whole case, in so far as it concerns the negligence which they charge against the Commission or its servants, upon the assumption that the Commission, though a separate corporation, is the agent of the municipality for the management of its light and power system, and that the present respondent, the City of Chatham, is therefore quite as fully responsible for any negligence on the part of the Commission or its servants as it is for the negligence of any other department of the civic government.\nThis at once raises the question as to whether the Commission is in fact the statutory agent of the respondent in the sense that its negligence is the negligence of the respondent and, if so, whether it is now open to the plaintiffs to impeach the finding of the learned trial judge that the Commission was guilty of no negligence in the circumstances.\nThe respondent contends that the question of negligence on the part of the Commission is res adjudicata, the plain- tiffs having abandoned their appeal against that corporation. We think in the circumstances that it cannot well be so held and that the whole question as to whether there was any negligence on the part of the Commission for which the respondent municipality would be liable as the Commission\u2019s principal is now open to review as it was in the Court of Appeal. The intention of the court and of the parties plainly was that the plaintiffs\u2019 case, in so far as it was based upon charges of negligence on the part of the Commission, should be dealt with in the same way as if it had been charged against the municipality as being responsible for the negligence of its statutory agent.\nConsidering this branch of the case from this standpoint, the first question which naturally arises is as to whether the Commission is in fact the statutory agent of the respondent for the management of its light and power plant. As to this we think the Court of Appeal were right in holding that it was. All three of the Appeal Judges concurred in this view, though differing upon the question of negligence. It was argued by the learned counsel for the respondent that Young v. Town of Gravenhurst[9], on which the Appeal Court\u2019s decision was based, was not correctly decided. We think it was and that there is no substantial difference between the provisions of R.S.O., 1897, caps. 234 and 235, upon which that case was decided, and the provisions of the Public Utilities Act, R.S.O., 1914, cap. 204, in pursuance of which the Public Utilities Commission of the Corporation of the City of Chatham was constituted. The provisions of subs. 2 of s. 38, introduced into the Act in 1917, making the salaries of the commissioners as fixed by the various municipalities throughout the province subject to the approval of the Provincial Hydro-Electric Power Commission, cannot affect the question of agency as between the several municipalities and their local commissions; neither do any of the provisions of the provincial Power Commission Act relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent authorizing the Provincial Commission to make rules and regulations regarding the construction, installation, repair, extension or alteration of all municipal works for the distribution of electrical power or energy throughout the province. It is further contended that in any case the employees of the Commission are not subject to the direction or control of the municipality and that the latter consequently cannot properly be charged with a loss caused by the negligence of the Commission\u2019s employees. This may be true as regards a loss directly attributable to a particular act of negligence on the part of a particular employee unless that act of negligence can be directly brought home to the Commission itself. The respondent claims that the act with which it was sought on the trial to charge the Commission was the failure or refusal of the operator at the Commission\u2019s substation to comply with the request of the fire department to shut off the power. It is true that this was the specific negligence charged in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim which seems to treat the operator as the servant of both the municipality and the Commission, and that the learned trial judge confined his consideration of the question of negligence on the part of the Commission solely to this allegation and the question as to whether there was any unnecessary or excessive delay in investigating the situation so as to see if the emergency was such as to warrant the current being shut off in the district in which the fire was burning. But he distinctly stated in his reasons that he treated \u201cinformation given to the man for the time being in charge of the Commission\u2019s substation as information given to the Commission, and requests made to that man as requests made to the Commission\u201d, and that he judged \u201cof the duty of that man to act by attributing to him all the knowledge that the Commission by any of its officers possessed\u201d. He added:\nI treat the case, then, as being a case against the Commission for failure, neglect and refusal upon the part of the Commission to comply with demands made to the Commission.\nAnd again:\nIf it is brought to the notice of such a corporation that its wires have become, without any default on its part, a source of danger to the public in general or to some person in particular it is the duty of the corporation to take adequate and prompt steps to remove the danger.\nI am not at all prepared to say that, if it were sought to charge the municipality with liability for the consequences of the specific act of the operator in charge of the Commission\u2019s substation in failing in such circumstances to shut off the power without reference to any duty on the part of the Commission itself to provide for such an emergency, I would not agree with the respondent\u2019s argument. It must be borne in mind, however, that the appellants in paragraph 13 of their statement of claim allege that they suffered the loss claimed for by reason of the negligence and want of care of the Commission and the municipality \u201cor one or both of them\u201d. And it seems to me that, apart from the specific act charged against the operator at the Commission\u2019s substation in failing or refusing to comply with the request of the fire department, there is evidence which points very strongly to the fact that the operator\u2019s failure had its real origin in a failure of duty on the part of the Commission itself. I cannot but think that it was the clear duty of the Commission to provide for the promptest action in such an emergency as occurred by seeing to it that competent men were always in charge of its substations, clothed with sufficient authority to promptly extinguish a short circuit threatening the destruction of property or endangering the lives of firemen in their efforts to save property of the ratepayers of the city for whom the Commission had undertaken the management of the city\u2019s light and power distribution system, instead of allowing their hands to be tied with instructions that they must not, apparently in any emergency, shut off the power without the express authority of the manager or superintendent of the Commission.\nIt is quite apparent that the charge of negligence against the substation operator as alleged in paragraph 10 itself necessitates an investigation of the conduct of the manager and superintendent of the Commission in relation thereto. Indeed, as already intimated, the learned trial judge in making his finding considered the conduct of both the substation operator and the Commission\u2019s manager and superintendent. It is equally apparent that the consideration of the substation operator\u2019s conduct involves the question of his authority and instructions regarding the shutting off of the power as well as his knowledge and competency to take the appropriate steps in such an emergency. The learned trial judge, however, failed to deal with these features of the case, his finding, as already stated, resting solely upon his view that there was no excessive delay in investigating the situation after the request was made to open the switch. The members of the Appeal Court apparently considered the whole question of negligence on the part of the Commission open for review upon the evidence before them with the exception of the suggested negligence regarding the non-provision of automatic expulsion fuses which the trial judge refused to consider because that had not been complained of in the plaintiffs\u2019 pleading.\nWe agree with the Appeal Court that the appellants are precluded from availing themselves of this ground of negligence against the Commission or the Municipality. It was open to them to ask for an amendment on the trial which undoubtedly would have been granted upon the usual terms but they made no application therefor.\nIf the evidence in the appeal book satisfies us that there was any negligence upon the part of the Commission or of the Municipality which would entitle the plaintiffs to recover damages against the Municipality there can be no doubt that it is the right and the duty of this court to pronounce judgment accordingly notwithstanding that that negligence was not specifically complained of in the plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim.\nIn my opinion, there cannot be any doubt upon this evidence that the loss which the plaintiffs sustained by the destruction of their mill would have been entirely prevented if the power had been shut off at the Commission\u2019s substation when the operator was first informed of the fire and requested to open the switch or if the fire brigade upon its arrival at the scene of the fire had used the implements with which they were provided and cut the electric wires. Moreover, I think there can be no doubt that had either of these things been done, even after the arrival of the fire chief, the plaintiffs\u2019 loss would have been, if not wholly avoided, confined to but a very small proportion of the loss which the plaintiffs sustained.\nWith all deference, I cannot agree that the information telephoned to the substation operator was not sufficient to warrant the immediate shutting off of the power and merely imposed upon the Commission the duty of investigating the situation without unnecessary delay. He had been called up by three different persons and asked to shut off the power before the fire chief himself asked him in the most urgent terms to do so: first, by Whitely, who informed him that the Kent Mills were on fire on Wellington Street East; second, by a member of the fire department at the instance of the fire captain then in charge of the fire brigade, who told him he was a member of the fire department, that there was a fire in the Kent Mill and asked if he could turn off the power; and third, by the police sergeant in charge of the city police, who told him who was calling, exactly where the fire was, that it was a dangerous looking fire, one he thought was very bad, and made the same request that Whitely and the fireman had already made, that he cut off the line. All these calls had been made. Then five or six minutes after the police sergeant\u2019s call, the fire chief, on his arrival at the scene, himself called the substation, asked the operator to shut the power off and told him it would burn up the whole east end if they didn\u2019t. The fire chief called the substation a second time a few minutes later, and was heard asking \u201cwhat the hell was the matter with them, they would burn up the whole town.\u201d\nSurely these five calls conveyed sufficient information to do more than merely impose upon the Commission the duty of undertaking an investigation to ascertain whether the power should really be shut off. If the information conveyed by the first call was not sufficiently precise to justify the shutting off of the power, one would think that it would, on the receipt of the second request, made by a member of the fire department, who had just come to the telephone from the scene of the fire, have at once occurred to a man of ordinary prudence and intelligence, that he could instantly have ascertained from the fireman then at the telephone what the exact situation was, so as to be able to report it by telephone to the Commission\u2019s manager or superintendent and receive the necessary authorization instantaneously and thus avoid the fatal delay of awaiting the latter\u2019s personal arrival on the scene.\nMoreover, if the explanation of the delay is to be found in the failure of the firemen to communicate sufficiently precise information, and the Commission is to be exonerated of all negligence upon that ground, is not the fire department thereby fixed with the responsibility as for misfeasance for the Commission\u2019s failure to shut off the power? In any event, if the municipality is responsible for the negligence of the Commission as well as for the negligence of the fire department, it makes no difference in the result whether the failure to shut off the power at the substation is attributable to one or to the other as the real cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss.\nOn the other hand, the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of the Appeal Court\u2019s decision dismissing their appeal against the Commission on the ground stated has produced the anomalous situation of the municipality, as the only respondent in the present appeal, now challenging, as the very basis of its legal position on this appeal, the correctness of the Appeal Court\u2019s decision that the Commission was improperly joined with it as a co-defendant in the action, while the plaintiffs support on that crucial point the judgment against which they are appealing. The practical result is that, if the Commission was guilty of the real negligence which caused the plaintiffs\u2019 loss, as I think it was, and it, as an independent corporation, and not the municipality as its principal, was legally responsible for such negligence, as the municipality now contends, the Commission has escaped its legal responsibility for its own negligence, on a mere question of misjoinder of parties; the plaintiffs\u2019 action is wholly defeated and this Court rendered powerless to correct the error because the Commission is not before us as a party to this appeal.\nI am glad therefore, convinced, as I am, that the judgment of the Appeal Court ought not to be affirmed on the question of the negligence of the Commission, that a careful comparison of the statutory provisions under which the Public Utilities Commission of the City of Chatham was constituted with those upon which Young v. Town of Gravenhurst[10] was decided, has firmly assured me that the Appeal Court was fully justified in holding that the Commission is the statutory agent of the respondent municipality and that any negligence, of which it may be guilty, is properly chargeable against the municipality as its principal. The principle affirmed in Young v. Gravenhurst10 has indeed been so consistently followed by the courts of Ontario in so many other cases that it may well be said to be the established law of that province.\nIt is obviously unnecessary, in the view I take of the case, to discuss the question as to whether there was any negligence on the part of the fire department either in the nature of non-feasance or misfeasance, in waiting upon the Commission to shut off the power before taking any active steps, other than the laying out of its hose, to prevent the spread of the fire. I shall only say that it seems to me in the circumstances that the fire department did the natural and prudent thing in first requesting the substation to shut off the current rather than subjecting any of its men to the danger which it appeared might attend any attempt to cut the wires at the pole.\nIn my opinion, this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the action referred to the local master in accordance with the terms of the agreement between counsel for the determination of the quantum of the damage sustained by the plaintiffs as a result of the failure of the Commission to promptly shut off the power when the operator was first requested to do so by the fire department.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.L.

Co. The lease required the lessees to keep the premises clean. On the last day of the lease plaintiff was cleaning up for S.H. Co. While taking refuse on to, as he thought, a freight elevator, he fell down the elevator shaft and was injured. The elevator had previously been standing there with the safety gate up, in which case mechanical devices were supposed to lock the machinery so that the elevator could not be moved until the gate was lowered, but in some way the elevator had been moved up to the next floor, the gate remaining raised. Plaintiff sued for damages. The jury found that the elevator (its interlocking safety device on that floor) was in a defective condition, causing the acci- dent; that this condition could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care prior to the accident, by G., but not by S.H. Co.; that plaintiff could by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident, his degree of fault being 10% of the whole fault. The trial judge gave judgment against G. for 90% of plaintiff\u2019s damages as found by the jury, with costs, dismissed the action as against S.H. Co. without costs, and dismissed the action as against certain other defendants (by whom plaintiff had alternatively alleged that he was employed) with costs, but directed that plaintiff should recover these costs from G. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the judgment, subject to disallowing plaintiff recovery of the costs last mentioned, and subject to a deduction in an item of damages.\nHeld: The judgment of the Court of Appeal aforesaid ([1933] O.R. 543) should be affirmed.\nPlaintiff was a licensee with an interest; the work at which he was employed was in pursuance of the lease which required removal of the refuse.\nHolmes v.

Pollak, [1927] A.C. 732).\nThe costs (in the appeals) payable by plaintiff to S.H. Co. should not be added to his judgment against G.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Greisman from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming in the result, subject to certain variations, the judgment of Wright, J.1\nThe action was brought against Greisman, Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co. (a partnership) and certain other defendants, and was for damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff (by reason, so it was alleged, of negligence of defendants) when he fell down an elevator shaft in the building owned by the defendant Greisman, while employed in cleaning up for the Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co. the latter\u2019s premises in the building, which premises they had leased from Greisman under a lease which was terminating.\nThe action was tried by Wright, J., with a jury and the findings of the jury on questions submitted to them are set out in the judgment now reported. By the judgment at trial, the plaintiff recovered against the defendant Greisman $8,856.63 and his costs of the action, the plaintiff\u2019s claim as against Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co. was dismissed without costs, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim as against the other defendants (by whom plaintiff had alternatively alleged that he was employed) was dismissed with costs, but costs paid by plaintiff to these defendants were to be recovered by plaintiff against the defendant Greisman; third party proceedings between the defendant Greisman and the defendant Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co. were dismissed without costs.\nBy the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the amount to be recovered by plaintiff against the defendant Greisman ($8,856.63 in the judgment at trial) was reduced to $8,406.68, and plaintiff was not allowed to recover from the defendant Greisman the costs paid to the other defendants as aforesaid; otherwise the judgment at trial was not disturbed.\nThe defendant Greisman appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment in favour of the plaintiff against him; and alternatively he claimed indemnity against the defendant Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co., as claimed in third party proceedings, or for contribution from the latter pursuant to the provisions of the Negligence Act (Ont., 1930, c. 27). The plaintiff cross-appealed against the variations made by the Court of Appeal in the judgment at trial and further contended that, should the defendant Greisman be held not liable, the defendant Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co. should be found liable to plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nR.H. Greer, K.C. for the appellant.\nN.A. Keys, K.C. and A.J. Doane for the respondent (plaintiff) Gillingham.\nI.F. Hellmuth, K.C. and J. Singer for the respondent Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014This action was brought by David Gillingham and his wife, Beatrice May Gillingham, to recover damages for injuries sustained by David Gillingham on the 29th of April, 1930, when the former fell into an elevator shaft at the fifth floor of the Spadina Building, in the City of Toronto, owned by Henry Greisman, one of the defendants. The claim of Beatrice May Gillingham was abandoned at the trial.\nFor a short time before the accident, the plaintiff had been in the employ of the Balfour Building Company, a partnership composed of the last five defendants. At the time of the accident, the fifth floor of the Spadina Building was still under lease from Henry Greisman to Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company, a partnership composed of two of the owners of the Balfour Building Company. The lease provided, among other things, that the lessees would not allow any refuse, garbage or other loose or objectionable material to accumulate in the demised premises, and that they would at all times keep the premises in a clean and wholesome condition. The lease further provided that the lessees, their clerks, employees, servants and agents, should have the use in common with the lessor, his tenants and others entitled thereto, of the passenger and freight elevators in the building giving access to the fifth floor between the hours of 7.45 a.m. and 6.15 p.m. on all ordinary working days but not including Sundays and holidays, and that the lessees and their clerks, employees, servants and agents and all others permitted to use such elevators should do so at their own risk and that the lessor should under no circumstances be held responsible for any damage or injury happening to any person by such elevators or their appurtenances or by the operation thereof, whether such damage or injury happened by reason of any act or omission of the lessor, his clerks, employees, servants or agents. The accident happened on an ordinary working day between one and two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nOn the morning of the day of the accident, Benjamin Hillman requested Cecil Hayes, superintendent of the Balfour Building Company, to procure some men to clean up the fifth floor of the Spadina Building. Hayes took over the plaintiff and Charles Flick, both employees of the Balfour Building Company. The freight elevator in question was at the southeast corner of the building. There were two fire doors on each floor at the elevator entrance. On each floor there was also a safety gate. This gate could be raised and, when raised, mechanical devices were sup- posed to lock the machinery so that the elevator could not be moved until the gate was lowered. It appears, however, that the mechanical catches at times became worn, possibly due to pulling of the propelling cables from other floors. There was evidence that some of these catches had been out of order previously and that repairs had been made in December and April. Just previous to the accident in question, the elevator was standing at the fifth floor and the gate was up. Gillingham was, as he thought, in the act of carrying or pulling a bundle of refuse on to the elevator, but in some way the elevator had moved up to the sixth floor, although the gate on the fifth floor remained raised, as a result of which, Gillingham stepped into space, fell down the elevator shaft and was seriously injured.\nThe action was tried before the late Mr. Justice Wright and a jury. The following are the questions and answers of the jury:\n1. Was the elevator in question in a defective condition at the time of the accident? A. Yes.\n2. If so, state wherein it was defective? A. The interlocking safety device on fifth floor was in a defective condition.\n3. Could the defective condition of the elevator have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care prior to the accident? (a) By the defendant Greisman, the owner of the building? A. Yes. (b) By the defendants Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Co.? A. No.\n4. Was the accident to the plaintiff caused by the defective condition of the elevator? A. Yes.\n5. If your answer to number 4 is yes, then state if the plaintiff could by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident. A. Yes.\n6. If your answer to 5 is yes, then state what the plaintiff could and should have done which would have avoided the accident. A. By being a little more careful in looking before stepping, presumably, on the elevator hoist floor.\n7. At what sum do you assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages?\u2014A. See below. $9,840.75.\n8. If your answer to number 5 is yes and to number 4 is also yes, then do you find it practicable to apportion the respective degrees of fault as between the plaintiff and the parties responsible for the condition of the elevator? A. Yes.\n9. If your answer to number 8 is yes, then state the respective degrees of fault. A. The plaintiff 10 per cent. The defendants 90 per cent.\nRe Question No. 7. Damages $9,840.75.\nOut of pocket expenses\u2014As per expenses (Exhibit 3)........................................\n$1,840 75\nSubject to the recommendation that Dr. Wilson and Dr. McCormack be approached to reduce their bills 50%.\nDamages for wages up to date and for wife....................................\n$2,000\nCompensation.....................................................................................\n5,000\n7,000 00\nPain and suffering...............................................................................\n1,000 00\n$9,840 75 The learned trial judge reserved judgment and later gave judgment against Henry Greisman and dismissed the action against Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company without costs. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the learned trial judge had dismissed the action against the last five defendants with costs and in his judgment he directed that the plaintiff should recover these costs from Henry Greisman.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario deducted $500 from the allowance of $2,000 made by the jury as \u201cdamages for wages up to date and for wife,\u201d answer No. 9, upon the ground that the jury had apparently included something for the wife, although her claim had been abandoned. The Court of Appeal further held that Greisman should not be liable for the costs of the last five defendants as he was not responsible for the joining of them in the action. In other respects the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal with costs.\nFrom this judgment the defendant, Henry Greisman, appealed to this Court, and the plaintiff cross-appealed in respect of the changes made by the Court of Appeal in the judgment of the learned trial judge and asked judgment against Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company if Henry Greisman should not be considered liable by this Court.\nIt was contended before us by counsel for the appellant that the respondent, David Gillingham, at the time of the accident, was a bare licensee and not an invitee as far as the appellant was concerned.\nHolmes v. The North Eastern Railway Co.[2] In this case it was the habit to unload coal wagons at the defendants\u2019 station at C. by shunting them and tipping the coal into cells; it was also the practice for the consignees of the coal, or their servants, to assist in the unloading, and for that purpose to go along a flagged path by the side of the wagons. The plaintiff was consignee of a coal wagon, which could not be unloaded in the usual way on account of all the cells being occupied. With the permission of the station master, he went to his wagon, which was shunted in the usual place, took some coal from the top of the wagon, and descended on to the flagged path. The flag he stepped on gave way, and he fell into one of the cells and was injured.\nIt was held, that, although not getting his coal in the usual mode, the plaintiff was not a mere licensee, but was engaged, with the consent and invitation of the defendants, in a transaction of common interest to both parties, and was therefore entitled to require that the defendants\u2019 premises should be in a reasonably secure condition.\nChannell B., at page 258, said:\nI quite concur in the rule laid down by the cases, that where a person is a mere licensee he has no cause of action on account of dangers existing in the place he is permitted to enter. Now in one sense the plaintiff was a licensee, but he was not a mere licensee, and the word mere has a very qualifying operation. * * * In the delivery and receipt of the coal there was a common interest in them and in the plaintiff, since they were bound to deliver it; and this prevents the case from being that of one who is a mere licensee.\nWright v. The London & North Western Railway Co.[3] In this case the plaintiff sent a heifer, which was put into a horse-box, by defendants\u2019 railway, to their station at P. On the arrival of the train at the station there were only two porters available and so the plaintiff assisted in shunting the horse-box, and while he was so assisting he was run against and injured by a train which was negligently allowed by the defendants\u2019 servants to come out of a siding. There was evidence that the station-master knew that the plaintiff was assisting in the shunting.\nIt was held that the plaintiff was not a mere volunteer assisting the defendants\u2019 servants, but was on the premises with their consent for the purpose of expediting the delivery of his own goods and the defendants were liable to him for the negligence of their servants. Lord Coleridge, C.J., at page 255 refers with approval to the statement of Channell B., above quoted, and goes on to state that the Holmes case[4] is one of the greatest authority.\nMersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Proctor[5]. In this case the defendants owned two floating docks called the East and West Floats. A boiler maker, who was working for a contractor on a ship lying in the East Float, left the ship at 4.45 on a December afternoon to go to the latrine and was never seen alive again, His body was found in the West Float opposite the point where there was a gap in the line of chains, the chain having been taken down for the convenience of some men working on the quay, and having been left down for several days.\nIt was held by Viscount Cave, L.C., Lord Sumner and Lord Carson; Lord Shaw of Dunfermline and Lord Buckmaster dissenting; that in the circumstances, the failure of the defendants to keep the chain in position was not a breach of any duty owed by them to the deceased and that the action failed.\nViscount Cave, L.C., said at p. 259:\nThe respondent\u2019s case is rested on the well-established principle that where a landowner invites or induces a person to go upon his land, not as a bare licensee but for some purpose in which both have an interest, he must make reasonable provision for that person\u2019s safety. This rule was clearly stated in the judgment of Willes J. in Indermaur v. Dames[6], where that learned judge summed up the law as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe class to which the customer belongs includes persons who go not as mere volunteers, or licensees, or guests, or servants, or persons whose employment is such that danger may be considered as bargained for, but who go upon business which concerns the occupier, and upon his invitation, express or implied. And, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger, which he knows or ought to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question whether such reasonable care has been taken, by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise, and whether there was contributory negligence in the sufferer, must be determined by a jury as matter of fact.\u201d\nIn the present case it is not disputed that the deceased man came within the class described by Willes J. He came upon the dock property and passed to and from the vessel where he was engaged upon business which concerned both the dock company and himself; and he was entitled, subject to using reasonable care on his part, to expect that the dock company should use reasonable care to protect him from any unusual danger known to the company and not known to or reasonably to be expected by him. If so, the questions of fact which arise or may arise are three\u2014namely, (1) Were the appellants guilty of negligence or want of reasonable care for the safety of the deceased? (2) If so, was their negligence or want of care the cause of his death? and (3) Was there any contributory negligence or want of reasonable care on his part for his own safety?\nLord Sumner, at page 272, said:\nThe leading distinction between an invitee and a licensee is that, in the case of the former, invitor and invitee have a common interest, while, in the latter, licensor and licensee have none. The common interest here is that ships in the docks should, when necessary, be able to employ boilermakers on board of them. In the other case, the licensee has an individual interest in being allowed to pass, while the licensor, the leave being gratuitous, has no interest in the matter at all, so long as the licensee does not get into trouble or into mischief. Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Building Society[7]. In this case, the defendants owned a block of flats which they let to various tenants, the defendants keeping possession and control of the common staircase giving access to the flats. The stairs were made of cement reinforced by iron bars embedded in the cement and running along the whole length of the tread. Owing to the wearing away of the cement, in some cases irregular depressions were scooped out behind the iron bars. The plaintiff, who lodged with her sister in a flat on the fourth floor, of which the sister\u2019s husband was tenant, whilst descending the stairs, caught her heel in a depression so formed, and fell and was injured.\nIt was held in the House of Lords that the only duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiff was not to expose her to a concealed trap.\nLord Atkinson said at page 86:\nThe plaintiff, being only a licensee, was therefore bound to take the stairs as she found them, but the landlord was on his side bound not to expose her, without warning, to a hidden peril, of the existence of which he knew, or ought to have known. He owed a duty to her not to lay a trap for her. But even if the plaintiff was in the position of an invitee of the defendants, her rights and duties in that character would be those described and measured by the well-known passage from Willes J.\u2019s judgment in Indermaur v. Dames[8].\nLord Wrenbury at page 95 said:\nIt is well to define at the outset what, in my judgment, is the relation between the plaintiff and the landlord in respect of which she can sue. There was no contractual relation. She was a person who, as between herself and the landlord, was entitled to use the landlord\u2019s staircase, because she was there rightly for the purpose of gaining access to premises which he had demised to a tenant with an implied right of use by the tenant and all persons lawfully resorting to the tenant\u2019s premises. She was, I think, the invitee of the tenant, and, in consequence, the licensee of the landlord.\nThe position as between the owner of premises and a licensee is that permission is given to come upon the premises, such as they are, and the licensee must take them as they are. The owner of dilapidated premises may demise them as they are: Cavalier v. Pope[9]: \u201cA landlord who lets a house in a dangerous state, is not liable to the tenant\u2019s customers or guests for accidents happening during the term; for, fraud apart, there is no law against letting a tumble-down house.\u201d Per Erle C.J.: Robbins v. Jones[10], approved by Lord Macnaghten in Cavalier v. Pope9. The licensee must take the premises as he finds them; but this is apart from and subject to that which follows as to concealed dangers. The owner must not expose the licensee to a hidden peril. If there is some danger of which the owner has knowledge, or ought to have knowledge, and which is not known to the licensee or obvious to the licensee using reasonable care, the owner owes a duty to the licensee to inform him of it. If the danger is not obvious, if it is a concealed danger, and the licensee is injured, the owner is liable.\nIn Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) Ltd. v. Dumbreck[11], a boy four years of age was killed by machinery belonging to a colliery company. The field was surrounded by a hedge which was inadequate to keep out the public and it was known to the colliery company that it was used as a playground by young children. Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor, page 365, said:\nIn the case of persons who are not there by invitation, but who are there by leave and licence, express or implied, the duty is much less stringent\u2014the occupier has no duty to ensure that the premises are safe, but he is bound not to create a trap or to allow a concealed danger to exist upon the said premises, which is not apparent to the visitor, but which is known\u2014or ought to be known\u2014to the occupier.\nThe Court of Appeal of Ontario considered that the case most nearly analogous was Sutcliffe v. Clients Investment Company[12]. In that case, the owners of a flat let it to a tenant and agreed to contribute to the cost of decorating and repairing it at the commencement of the term. The tenant employed a firm of builders to do the work. The firm\u2019s advertisement board was fixed to a balcony with a balustrade projecting from the front wall of the flat. The judge at the trial found that the balcony was not part of the demised premises, but was part of the exterior of the premises which the lessors were bound to repair. The jury found that the balcony was dangerous and that the lessors knew or ought to have known this. When the work was completed, the firm\u2019s foreman went on to the balcony to remove the advertising board. The balustrade gave way and the man was killed. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the widow was entitled to recover, as the plaintiff was more than a bare licensee and was at least a licensee with an interest, with the same right as an invitee, and that there was evidence to support the finding of the jury that the defendants ought to have known the balcony was dangerous. Banks, L.J., said that the responsibility of the occupier of premises towards a bare licensee was merely not to set a trap for him, and that, apart from dangers of which the occupier knows and the licensee does not know, the licensee must take the premises as he finds them. He doubted if Lord Atkinson or Lord Wrenbury in the Fairman case[13] intended to make any alteration in the law. Scrutton, L.J., also considered that the plaintiff was a licensee with an interest and referred to the judgment of Hamilton, L.J., in Latham v. Johnson[14]. See also Hillen v. I.C.I. (Alkali) Ltd.[15]\nAs already stated, the lease provided that the lessees would not allow any ashes, refuse, garbage, or other loose or objectionable material to accumulate in the premises, and would at all times keep the premises in a clean and wholesome condition. On the morning of the accident, Cecil Hayes, Superintendent of the Balfour Building Company, was summoned by Benjamin Hillman who directed Hayes to send all the men available to clean up the premises on the fifth floor of the Spadina Building. Hayes had only two men available, the plaintiff, and one, Flick, and he took them over and shewed them their duties to clean up and take the debris and rubbish downstairs into the stokehole of the Balfour Building. The work had to be finished that day.\nThe plaintiff testified that he was told by Hayes to clear the garbage up and get the room cleared up as the lease was up that day and that the floor had to be cleared up. Before the accident, he had taken some of the loose material down and thrown it into the Balfour Building.\nCharles Flick testified that immediately before the accident there was a lot of garbage there, old clothes, coats, pants, lumber, partitions, boxes and cardboards. There was a lot of stuff left there that had to be cleaned up.\nIt seems clear, therefore, that it would have been a breach of the lease if the lessees had left the debris and rubbish, referred to, on the premises subsequent to the termination of the lease. The work, therefore, must have been done in pursuance of the lease, and I am of opinion that the plaintiff was a licensee with an interest, as found by the Court of Appeal.\nAs to the condition of the elevator, Wilfrid Howson said that sometimes the elevator worked properly before the accident and sometimes it operated with the gates up. He thought that a change was made as a result of complaints which he made. Jack Rogers testified that the gates, especially the first floor gate, would remain up after the elevator had moved away. He had last observed the condition six or seven days before the accident.\nJohn O\u2019Driscoll, a police constable, testified that within an hour or two after the accident he saw a government inspector making tests and the elevator would move up or down with the gates raised on the fifth floor.\nJ.W. Dayes testified that on December 10th previously, he found the interlocks out of order and repaired them. He reported to Henry Greisman\u2019s superintendent. He did not inspect again until the day following the accident, when he found the interlocks again out of order, especially on the fifth floor. He found that the constant pulling by a person at another floor, who wanted to get the elevator, had worn the lock to such an extent that the key would turn around in its keeper and could be forced right around. On April 30th, he and Superintendent Norton operated the elevator with the gate up. That had been the condition on one or more of the floors on December 10th previously, and Dayes had given Norton a blank recommendation to have all put in shape. It was just a case of wear and tear. On the day following the accident, the lock on the fifth floor was worn very considerably. He said that there would not have been any difficulty in discovering the condition if the lock had been inspected regularly. It should have been replaced as soon as it gave evidence of wear and tear.\nArthur Norton, Superintendent, testified that he had inspected the elevator five days before and that it was in perfect working order. He produced an account from OtisFensom Elevator Company Limited for adjustments on freight elevator as of February 11th, 1930.\nThere was therefore ample evidence to support the finding of the jury that the elevator was in a defective condition and that the defective condition could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care.\nIt was also contended in behalf of the appellant, Henry Greisman, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover because there was negligence upon his part; but we agree with the Court of Appeal that the contributory negligence of the plaintiff was not a bar to his right to recovery in the Province of Ontario. The appeal of Henry Greisman should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff cross-appealed against the deduction by the Court of Appeal of $500 above referred to, and urged that the wages alone would have amounted to more than $1,500, the amount allowed by the Court of Appeal in lieu of the sum of $2,000 allowed by the jury as \u201cdamages for wages up to date and for wife\u201d. The jury, however, did not make any separate finding of the amount of the wages, and there was no assurance that the plaintiff would have received steady employment at the same rate of wages if he had not been injured.\nThe plaintiff cross-appealed also against that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which varied the judgment of the learned trial judge which required the appellant, Henry Greisman, to pay to the plaintiff the costs of the last five defendants who constituted the Balfour Building Company.\nAs the Court of Appeal varied the judgment of the learned trial judge, this Court should not interfere with the disposition of costs made by the Court of Appeal. Donald Campbell & Company & Pollak[16].\nThe cross-appeal will, therefore, be dismissed without costs.\nThe appeal of the respondent against Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company will be dismissed, and the third party proceedings taken by the appellant, Henry Greisman, against Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company, will be dismissed. Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company will be entitled to one set of costs in this Court, of which the respondent, David Gillingham, should pay three-quarters and the appellant, Henry Greisman, one-quarter.\nThe only question remaining is whether the costs payable by the respondent to Shiffer\u2011Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company should be added to the judgment of the respondent against the appellant, Henry Greisman. In my opinion, they should not be added.\nFraser v. Payne[17]. Besterman v. British Motor Cab Co. Ltd.[18]\nIt may have been reasonable for the respondent to join Henry Greisman and Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufac- turing Company in the original action, but the jury found that the defective condition of the elevator could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company, and it cannot very well be said to have been reasonable to continue the joinder of Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Company to this Court, particularly after the finding of the jury had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae & Greer.\nSolicitors for the respondent Gillingham: Butters & Doane.\nSolicitors for the respondent Shiffer-Hillman Clothing Manufacturing Co.: Singer & Kert.\n[1] [1933] O.R. 543; [1933] 3 D.L.R. 134.\n[2] (1869) L.R. 4 Ex. 254.\n[3] (1876) 1 Q.B.D. 252.\n[4] (1869) L.R. 4.

Co. Under the arrangement, appellants sold the shares and, after the sale of them, remained accountable for $2,250 as part of the proceeds. Respondent sued appellants for said sum. His action was dismissed at trial, on the ground that the certificates of shares were delivered by respondent, who was president of G. Co., to appellants as the property of G. Co., having been lent by respondent to G. Co. for that purpose, to carry out a G. Co. transaction, and that appellants were accountable to G. Co. only (against which company they had an alleged, but disputed, counterclaim, not connected with the transaction now in question). The Manitoba Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, holding that respondent personally held the shares, personally dealt with appellants, and was entitled to recover from them.\nHeld: The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed.\nFrom the documents, the course of dealing, and the broad features of the situation as disclosed by the evidence (to which matters, it was held, in view of his reasons, the trial judge had failed, in respect of the\n[Page 389\ncardinal issues of the case, to give sufficient weight), the dealings between respondent and appellants were with respondent personally.\nEven assuming (as appellants contended) that the moneys for which appellants were accountable were to be paid to respondent as president of G. Co., in other words, to G. Co., to be applied by it in payment of shares to be issued to respondent to replace respondent\u2019s shares delivered to appellants, then such moneys, being moneys to be devoted to the payment of the purchase price of shares to be issued to respondent, were impressed with a trust in favour of respondent; and the implication arose (applying the principles enunciated in The Moorcock, 14 P.D. 64, at 68, and Hamlyn v. Wood, [1891] 2 Q.B. 488, at 491) that it would be a violation of respondent\u2019s rights, a breach of the trust under which the moneys were held, to apply them in payment of any claim of appellants against G. Co., arising, at all events, out of matters not connected with the transaction in question. Appellants, by their long retention of these moneys under a claim of right to apply them against their alleged counterclaim, had repudiated the trust. Also, by reason of appellants\u2019 wrongful retention, the trust had become impossible of fulfilment because, before the trial, G. Co. went into liquidation. The moneys which, under the arrangement, were to be paid to respondent, whether as president of G. Co. or not, could no longer be applied in execution of the trust. The legal result was that, the object of the original trust having failed in consequence of repudiation by appellants and present impossibility of performance, a resulting trust attached to these proceeds of the sale of respondent\u2019s property, in favour of respondent.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which, reversing the judgment of Adamson J., held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $2,250 as being the balance owing for shares of stock in the Gem Lake Mines Ltd. placed by the plaintiff in the hands of the defendant under an arrangement, the nature of which in certain respects was in dispute. The material facts of the case and the questions in dispute are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nA. M. S. Ross K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The appellants are brokers in Winnipeg. They appeal from a judgment against them, pronounced by the Manitoba Court of Appeal, in an action brought by the respondent, claiming $2,250 as moneys payable to him by them, under an arrangement by which he put in their hands certain shares of the Gem Lake Mining Company; one term of the arrangement being that 15 cents per share of the proceeds received from the sale of the shares should be paid to the respondent. The Court of Appeal upheld the claim, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, who had dismissed the action.\nIt is not open to question on the evidence that the shares placed by the respondent in the hands of the appellants were the property of the respondent. It is not disputed that the whole of these shares (75,000), so placed in the appellants\u2019 hands, were sold by them; or that the appellants have not paid the sum of $2,250, for which, in July, 1930, and in November, 1930, they admitted they were accountable, as part of the proceeds of such sales.\nIn their defence, the appellants contented themselves with what must now be treated as a denial of the allegations in the statement of claim; although, strictly read, the defence would involve an admission of the primary facts alleged with the single exception of an averment that the appellants held the money in their hands in trust for the respondent.\nThe defence to which the trial judge gave effect is not hinted at. That defence was this: that the shares\u2014(75,000) \u2014delivered to the appellants, were the property of the Gem Lake Mining Company; and were delivered by the respondent in his capacity as the president of that Company; that they were accountable for the proceeds of sales to the Company only; and that as against the Company they had a counterclaim. The view upon which the learned trial judge acted was that the shares were the property of the Mining Company as well as the proceeds of the sale of them.\nThe proper inferences from the documents in evidence and the admitted facts appear to be that the Court of Appeal rightly reversed the judgment of the trial judge.\nIt will be convenient, at the outset, to outline the facts as they are admitted, or indubitably established, by the evidence. As early as January, 1930, the people interested in the Mining Company, which included the two members of the appellant firm (an incorporated company) and the respondent, were concerned to find that the market for the Company\u2019s shares was very dull. While they had hoped to sell them at not less than 20 cents a share, the shares were then offering at a price as low as 11 cents, in considerable quantities. In the latter part of February and the beginning of March, the respondent and Mr. Anderson, of the appellant firm, in the absence of the other directors, decided to secure the services of one Lott, a share salesman, in order to endeavour, as the witnesses say, \u201cto make a market\u201d for the Company\u2019s shares. It was accordingly arranged with Lott that, if he would devote himself to procuring purchasers of the Company\u2019s shares through the appellants as brokers, the Company would undertake to \u201cprotect\u201d him to the extent of 75,000 shares to be paid for by him at 15 cents a share, the shares to be allotted and delivered upon payment. The two directors had no authority to bind the Company to this arrangement; but, as it appeared to be necessary in the common interest, they felt assured that their action would be approved and ratified; as it was.\nWe pause to point out the precise character of this arrangement with Lott. It is evidenced by several documents; the first in which it is explicitly recognized being this letter of the 19th of March, 1930,\nMarch 19, 1930.\nMessrs. Anderson, Greene & Company, Limited,\nNotre Dame Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nGentlemen,\u2014This is to advise that we are protecting Mr. Lloyd Lott up to seventy-five thousand (75,000) shares of Gem Lake Mines Limited stock at fifteen cents (15c).\nYours very truly,\nGEM LAKE MINES LIMITED.\n\u201cW. S. Kickley\u201d\nPresident.\nThe arrangement was ratified at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Mining Company, held at the office of the appellants on the 10th day of April, 1930, the respondent and Mr. Anderson being present, as well as two other directors, Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Roe. The arrangement which had been made by the respondent and Mr. Anderson, without the concurrence of the other directors, who, as already mentioned, were then absent from Winnipeg, was, as the minutes disclose, reported to the meeting by the respondent thus:\nAccordingly on the 3rd of March, 1930, an arrangement was made by the President and Mr. Anderson with R. E. Lloyd Lott of Winnipeg under which Mr. Lott undertook if given a position, to create a market provided the Company would make delivery to him of 75,000 shares of stock on payment by him to the Company of 15 cents per share. A resolution was passed which is recorded in the minutes, in these terms:\nOn motion of Mr. Roe seconded by Mr. Donaldson it was unanimously resolved that 75,000 shares be allotted and delivered to R. E. Lloyd Lott or his nominee or nominees on payment into the treasury of 15 cents per share.\nIt is most important to notice and to emphasize the fact that the arrangement with Lott, to which Mr. Anderson was a party, as reported by the respondent to the directors, of whom Mr. Anderson was one, was to the effect that Lott was to receive 75,000 shares of stock, on payment by him to the company of 15 cents a share; and that, under the resolution sanctioning the arrangement, allotment and delivery were both to be conditional upon payment.\nThen there is this letter in evidence, dated the 17th of November, 1930, from the Mining Company to the appellants:\nNovember 17, 1930.\nAnderson, Greene Company, Limited,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nGentlemen,\u2014This will confirm once more arrangements made by us last winter with R. E. Lloyd Lott where he was to have a call on 75,000 shares at 15 cents and a call on a further amount at 19\u00bd.\nThese arrangements were confirmed at Directors\u2019 Meeting and there has been no other arrangement made.\nYours very truly,\nGEM LAKE MINES LIMITED.\nW. S. KICKLEY,\nPresident.\nThe arrangement between the Company and Lott in respect of the 75,000 shares, with which alone we are concerned, was that confirmed at the Directors\u2019 meeting of the 10th April set forth in the passage quoted above from the minutes. There is no evidence of any authority to the respondent to vary this arrangement by placing the Company\u2019s \u201ctreasury stock\u201d in the hands of Lott or the appellants before receiving payment for it. The respondent says he had no such authority; and there he is plainly right.\nNow, the terms of this arrangement with Lott\u2014the only terms authorized\u2014were never, in fact, carried out. Lott admittedly had no money, and the respondent says that the appellants were unable to furnish the funds necessary to pay for the shares in advance of the sale of them. At all events, the 75,000 shares delivered to the appellants were the personal property of the respondent, and were delivered by the respondent to the appellants to enable them in turn to make delivery to purchasers. What is most significant is that, in fact, they were not paid for by the appellants on delivery, but, as to the 15 cents a share of the purchase price, were only accounted for after sale on receipt of the purchase money by them. Apart altogether from the oral evidence, the documentary evidence leaves no doubt that this was the invariable course of business and, indeed, that is not disputed.\nThe appellants\u2019 account with the respondent in connection with this transaction is in the appellants\u2019 books, and was produced in evidence. The entries are on two pages. On one page there is a series of entries under the caption \u201cStock received from Mr. W. S. Kickley\u201d; on the second page there are entries under the heading \u201cAccount with Mr. W. S. Kickley.\u201d These entries show that, on the 12th March, five certificates for 25,000 shares in the aggregate, were received by the appellants. Deliveries were made at various dates down to the 21st of March; and payments to \u201cW. S. Kickley\u201d were made by cheque on succeeding dates. On the 7th of April the appellants had completely accounted to the respondent for his share of the proceeds of the sales between the 12th and 21st of March inclusive. This course of business continued until the end.\nThe respondent used the term \u201cloan\u201d in describing the transaction between himself and the appellant. The learned trial judge was much impressed by the use of this term, and his judgment largely turns upon it. It is clear enough, however, that the word was used without reflection, and, when the learned trial judge suggested that the transaction was rather in the nature of a sale, the respondent agreed that \u201csale\u201d would be the better term.\n\u201cSale\u201d does not, however, give a true picture of the transaction as carried out. It is evident that the respondent did not intend to say that the appellants had purchased these shares from him on delivery; but that they were placed in their hands to enable them to fulfill their contracts of sale, and that, out of the proceeds of sales, they were to pay him 15 cents a share. Greene, who is the manager of the appellants, in a letter to which we shall have to refer, describes the arrangement as an \u201coption.\u201d It was, in a sense, an option, because it is clear that the appellants were only bound to pay for shares as they were sold, and the purchase money received. From another point of view, the transaction might, in layman\u2019s language, be described as a \u201cloan\u201d; since unsold shares would, of course, be returned to the respondent.\nNomenclature is really of no importance. The critical point is that the arrangement between the respondent and the appellants, as evidenced by the conduct of the parties, and the delivery of shares pursuant to it, was, in its essence, inconsistent with the essential terms of the Company\u2019s arrangement with Lott. The respondent says that this arrangement was concluded between himself and Greene, a partner and the manager of the appellants; who proposed it with the very object of enabling the appellants to complete sales made by them without being obliged first to pay to the Company the purchase price in order to obtain allotment and delivery of certificates, as the undertaking of the Mining Company required. This view of the nature of the arrangement was accepted by the Court of Appeal. It may be added that the profit, which proved to be a little over $3,000, on the sale of the 75,000 shares, was to be, and was, divided between the appellants and Lott, in the proportion of two-thirds and one-third. It was understood, no doubt, that $11,250 (15 cents a share for 75,000 shares) was to pass into the treasury of the Mining Company from the respondent, as the price of certificates to be delivered to him by the Company, in recoupment for the shares placed in the hands of the appellants by him, or to enable him to provide such shares.\nThe respondent produces two cheques of $10,000 and $5,000, both of which were paid to the Mining Company, as the Court of Appeal finds, as the price of shares purchased by him to carry out this understanding.\nAt this point, it is not without interest to consider the position taken by the appellants. They have sold the respondent\u2019s shares and received payment for them, and the sum of $2,250, the balance of the purchase money, has been in their hands since July, 1930, when they sent the respondent a statement of account showing that balance due to him. They have refused to pay the respondent, and counsel for the appellant stated explicitly that they deny liability to the Mining Company. They have retained this money in their hands. Their excuse for refusing to pay the Mining Company is based on a claim against it arising out of matters which occurred after the sum of $2,250 became payable, and which, the evidence seems to show, has little substance.\nThus, from the respondent\u2019s point of view, he delivered his shares under this arrangement, by which Lott and the appellants were to divide the profits over 15 cents a share, and 15 cents a share was to be paid to him out of the proceeds of his shares sold by the appellants; and to this day he has received neither money nor shares. The appellants have refused to pay him his share of the proceeds, and they have refused to pay it to the Company as the price of shares to be allotted to him by the Company. The appellants have kept both shares and money; the respondent, having given up his shares, has received neither shares nor money in return.\nIt is admitted by the appellants that it was one of the terms of the arrangement between the parties that the 15 cents a share, for which, after the division of profits between themselves and Lott, they would be accountable, was to be paid to the respondent. The appellants contend it was to be paid to the respondent only in his character as president of the Company; in other words, it was to be paid to the Company. The respondent said it was to be paid to him personally, as part of the proceeds of the sale of shares which were his property, and which had been sold by the appellants under the arrangement with him already indicated.\nThe learned trial judge has found, as already mentioned, that the shares delivered by the appellants were the shares of the Company, that is to say, shares \u201cloaned\u201d by the respondent to the Company for the purpose of enabling the Company to give effect to their agreement to protect Lott; and he held, notwithstanding the evidence of the respondent and of the documents, that the moneys paid and to be paid to the respondent were paid and to be paid to him for the Mining Company. These two findings can be most conveniently discussed together.\nEx facie, the dealings between the respondent and the appellants were dealings with the respondent personally. We have already mentioned the account kept by the appellants. The first part of the account shows a list of share certificates received from \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d. These share certificates admittedly were \u201cstreet certificates\u201d in the personal possession of the respondent, and his own private property. The other part of the account headed \u2018\u2018Account with Mr. W. S. Kickley\u201d shows a list of cheques. In this account \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d is charged with these cheques. Each of the cheques is payable to \u201cW. S. Kickley\u201d. Each of them was deposited in the respondent\u2019s own private banking account, as the appellants must have known. It should be observed, in passing, that the Mining Company had a banking account of its own, into which the sum of $10,000 was paid to the Company by the respondent by cheque for the purchase of shares on the 29th of March. The learned trial judge says that the Company had no authorized banking account, treating that, apparently, as an explanation of the fact that the respondent had paid these moneys into his own personal account. But the truth is that there was an account with the Bank of Toronto during all this time, and there is not the slightest evidence to show that the account was not authorized. In point of fact, Mr. Anderson, a member of the appellants\u2019 firm, countersigned cheques drawn upon it.\nThen, for each lot of share certificates delivered by the respondent to the appellants, there is a receipt which, in every case but one, is addressed to \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d personally. Again, there is an account of the 29th of July delivered to the respondent by the appellants in response, as the respondent says, to a request by him, in which there is an acknowledgment of a balance of $2,250 due to \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d in respect of the \u201cpurchase\u201d of these 75,000 shares. At this date, it should be noted, the shares had all been disposed of, and the completed transaction might, very naturally, be treated by a book-keeper as a purchase. Then, there is the latter of November 20, 1930, written by Mr. Greene, the manager of the appellants, and addressed to \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d in which there appears this sentence:\nReference our conversation we beg to state that at the present time we owe you for 15,000 shares of Gem Lake Mines Ltd. at 15 cents, a total of $2,250 in relation to our option.\nComment perhaps naturally arises from the use of the term \u201coption\u201d. That has already been sufficiently discussed. On the face of it, this letter affords substantial corroboration of the respondent\u2019s account of the arrangement.\nTurning for a moment to the finding by the learned trial judge that the certificates received by the appellants from the respondent had been lent by the respondent to the Mining Company, and, as the property of the Company, delivered by him as its president, to the appellants. First of all, as already observed, the respondent had no authority on behalf of the Company to vary the terms of the arrangement with Lott as set forth in the minutes of the Directors\u2019 meeting of the 10th of April. He had no authority from the Company to deliver any shares, the property of the Company, to the appellants, or to anybody, except upon the terms of payment on delivery. The arrangement between him and the appellants, as to the delivery of shares, and as to the terms of payment, as actually carried out, was not authorized by the Company, and he speaks with substantial accuracy when he intimates that, if he had been delivering the Company\u2019s shares, he would have been acting illegally.\nThen, Mr. Anderson was a director of the Company, was a party to the arrangement with Lott, was present at the Directors\u2019 meeting at which the terms of the arrangement were reported and ratified. He and the respondent both knew that the actual course of dealing between the appellants and the respondent was not in compliance with anything authorized by, and that it had not, in fact, been authorized by the Company. That, no doubt, is the reason why the transaction appears in the books of the appellants, and in all the communications between the appellants and the respondent, not as a transaction between the appellants and the Mining Company, but strictly, in its proper form, as a transaction between the appellants and the respondent personally.\nThen, there is no trace of authority, disclosed or suggested, under which the respondent could have been empowered to enter into an agreement, as president of the Company, with himself personally, for lending his shares to the Company. It could hardly be suggested that he was making a gift of his shares. If there was not a gift, there must have been some consideration. He had no authority to agree, on the part of the Company, to give to himself any consideration for handing over these shares. Turning to the observations of the learned trial judge upon the evidence. First of all, he accepts the explanation of the book-keeper of the appellant firm as to the manner in which the account was kept. We do not think it necessary to dwell upon that, because we agree with the Court of Appeal that the explanation, so-called, does not really meet the point. It does not account for the fact that the account, instead of being kept in the name of the president of the Mining Company, or of W. S. Kickley as president of the Mining Company, was kept in the name of \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d. This same observation applies to the attempts to explain the receipts, the statement, the letter written by Greene, and, above all, the cheques. The book-keeper says the cheques were made payable to the respondent as president of the Company. In point of fact, they were payable to \u201cW. S. Kickley\u201d with no addition, and we have already pointed out how they were dealt with. The book-keeper says she knows they were payable to the respondent as president because they were given in payment for \u201ctreasury shares\u201d. It is plain enough that she was speaking with no knowledge of the facts bearing upon the ownership of the shares; and, indeed, with no very precise appreciation of the words she was using. We agree with the Court of Appeal that no great weight can be ascribed to these explanations.\nThere is another point which influenced the judgment of the learned trial judge. He says, in effect, that the significance of the course of business between the respondent and the appellants, which, as we have seen, on the face of it indicates so plainly that the respondent was considered by all parties as acting for himself, and not for the Company,\nis quite nullified as evidence of a debt due him by the defendants by what took place later. Kickley made no claim, or demand, for his money until March, 1932.\nHis view is: the fact that the respondent made no claim during two years, justifies the inference that he had no belief in the existence of such a claim; or so little belief in it, as to destroy the value of all the documentary evidence pointing to the recognition by the appellants of the validity of the claim.\nNow, as we have already observed, at the end of July, an account was delivered showing a debt due to \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley\u201d in respect of the \u201cpurchase\u201d of these 75,000 shares by the appellants. The respondent says that account was delivered in response to a request from himself.\nAgain, on the 20th of November, there is the letter from which we have already quoted, which the respondent likewise says was sent at his request; the terms of the letter itself corroborate this statement.\nThen there is the evidence of the respondent and of his solicitor, Mr. Hart Green. The respondent says that in the spring of 1931 he instructed Mr. Green to sue the appellants. There is a telegram from Mr. Green to the respondent, at that time, which corroborates this statement. The evidence of Mr. Green, whose veracity is not attacked, is that he received instructions from the respondent to press for payment of the claim; that he interviewed Mr. Anderson and Mr. Greene in respect of it, and that he finally advised the respondent against proceeding, for the reason that, if he recovered judgment, it was improbable that the judgment could be collected.\nThe learned trial judge deals with this last mentioned evidence in this fashion. He says,\nIt is true he communicated with his own solicitor at this time about this claim, but this is not evidence against the defendants. The significant fact is that he did not say anything to the defendant at the time concerning this claim.\nHere, in the first place, the learned trial judge quite overlooks the evidence of Mr. Hart Green that he had interviewed the appellants\u2019 manager with respect to this claim; and, in the second place, it seems difficult to understand the view that, in answer to the contention that the respondent\u2019s forbearance to press his claim established his disbelief in the existence of it, he was not entitled to prove that he had instructed his solicitor to sue. In this matter, we think, with great respect, that the learned trial judge has based conclusions that greatly influenced his decision upon serious misconceptions of the evidence adduced.\nAt the end of his judgment he reiterates his statement about the absence of any claim. He says,\nIt is unfortunate that this claim was not made * * * before Greene went to South Africa.\nThis seems to be irreconcilable with the evidence of Mr. Hart Green.\nWe have said sufficient to show that the findings of the learned trial judge were not necessarily binding on the Court of Appeal. With respect, in our opinion, his reasons afford solid grounds for thinking that he has failed, in respect of the cardinal issues of the case, to give sufficient weight to the documents, the course of dealing, and the broad features of the situation as disclosed by the evidence.\nThere is a matter of some importance which, probably, to some extent, affected the view of the learned trial judge in respect of the relative weight of Mr. Anderson and the respondent as witnesses. As we have pointed out, the appellants have failed to account to the Mining Company. The learned trial judge says that if the Mining Company \u201care the proper plaintiffs, the defendants would have a counterclaim.\u201d\nNow, as regards the so-called counterclaim, it appears to be set up first in a letter of the 10th of July, 1930, addressed to \u201cMr. W. S. Kickley, Gem Lake Mines Ltd.\u201d by \u201cAnderson, Greene & Co. Ltd.\u201d It is a letter in respect of expenses incurred by Lott in connection with a certain transaction described as the \u201cMinneapolis Deal,\u201d which had nothing to do with the 75,000 shares we have been discussing. That letter was answered, the respondent says, by the Company, on the 15th of July, in which letter the appellants are told that no authority was ever given for charging these expenses to the Company. The letter proceeds,\nThe Minutes of the Gem Lake Mines Limited Directors\u2019 Meeting provide for the payment of 10% on the Minneapolis deal provided it goes through, to be divided equally between Mayor Webb and Lloyd Lott and the assumption was that they would stand their own expenses. That, I think, would be the usual practice.\nAnderson denies that this letter was ever received by his Company. The denial is not very convincing; but, however that may be, there was a further letter of the 17th of November, already quoted, the receipt of which is not disputed, that negatives the claim made in the appellants\u2019 letter of the 10th of July. Moreover, there is no suggestion that the respondent had any authority to vary the arrangement authorized by the directors, which admittedly was that Lott was to receive 10 per cent, of the proceeds of \u201cthe deal\u201d if it was effectuated; under such an arrangement no valid claim for expenses could arise.\nSome attempt was made on the argument to cast doubt on the evidence of the respondent that the cheque of $10,000, paid into the Mining Company\u2019s account on the 29th of March, was in payment of shares acquired for the purpose of effectuating the arrangement between the respondent and the appellants. These suggestions were not put to the respondent in cross-examination. They are based on inferences drawn by a witness from the examination of the books, and there appears to be exceedingly little, if any, admissible evidence in support of them. We accept the view of the Court of Appeal with regard to this cheque as well as the cheque for $5,000.\nThere is another point of view from which this appeal should be considered.\nThe respondent in his statement of claim stated the basis of his claim thus:\n3. Between the said months of February and December, 1930, the Defendants were selling to the public shares of the capital stock of said Mining Company at a price in excess of 15 cents per share, and not having a sufficient number of shares for delivery, requested the Plaintiff to deliver to them 75,000 shares of the Plaintiff\u2019s holdings in said Mining Company in blocks as required from time to time, to enable them to make delivery of shares which they had contracted, or would contract to sell, upon the terms that the proceeds of said shares up to the extent of 15 cents per share would be held by the Defendants in trust for the Plaintiff and paid over to him.\nCounsel for the appellants admitted he could not dispute the contention advanced by the respondent that the shares represented by the share certificates delivered by the respondent to the appellants were the private property of the respondent. The substance of his argument was that they were treated as shares belonging to the Company, made available to the Company by loan from the respondent for the purpose of enabling Anderson to carry out sales made under Lott\u2019s option; and that, consequently, any moneys for which the appellants were accountable were to go to the Company, in payment of shares, to be allotted and delivered to the respondent, to replace the shares lent by him.\nIt is quite obvious that rational people, entering into such an arrangement, would have regarded it as essential that the respondent should be protected, and that delivery to him of shares, in return for shares advanced by him, would be secured. In the view advanced by the appellant, one form of security would be to have the appellants account to him, as president of the Company, on the understanding that the moneys received were to be applied in payment for shares to be allotted and delivered to him; and this is what the appellants contend was contemplated. In view of the facts, that seems to be the only intelligible and plausible form in which the appellants\u2019 case could be put.\nLet us assume, then, that the moneys owing by the appellants were, as the appellants contend, to be paid to the respondent as president of the Company; in other words, to the Company; to be applied in payment of shares to be issued to him.\nSuch an arrangement might not unnaturally be referred to by laymen as a loan of shares from the respondent to the Company; and it would follow, as a consequence, as the appellants\u2019 counsel put it in his reply, that these shares were to be returned to the respondent. If this was the arrangement, then there is no substantial inconsistency with the facts in the respondent\u2019s pleading, because the moneys for which the appellants were accountable were moneys to be devoted to the payment of the purchase price of shares to be issued to the respondent. In other words, they were moneys impressed with a trust, which, in that sense, was a trust in favour of the respondent.\nIt is perfectly obvious, looking at the matter from this point of view, that the parties could never have contemplated that the moneys received by Anderson in respect of these shares were to be paid to the Mining Company to be used as it might see fit,\u2014to pay its creditors, for example. It is equally implied that it would be a violation of the rights of the respondent, a breach of the trust under which the moneys were held, to apply these moneys in payment of any claim by the appellants against the Company, arising, at all events, out of matters not connected with these 75,000 shares. This follows from an application of the principles enunciated by Bowen, L.J., in The Moorcock[1], and by Lord Esher in Hamlyn v. Wood[2]. And yet, ever since July, 1930, these appellants have kept these moneys under a pretense that they were entitled to apply them in satisfaction of the claim for expenses already mentioned.\nThe action was tried in September, 1932. For three and one-half years they have held these moneys without any right to them which can be even plausibly stated. What, then, is the legal result? In the first place, the appellants repudiated the trust when they retained these moneys under a claim of right to apply them in the liquidation of their so-called counterclaim. In the second place, and this is the critical point, by reason of their wrongful detention of the moneys, the trust has become impossible of fulfilment, because of the fact that, before the trial, the Company went into liquidation. The moneys which, under the terms of the arrangement, were to be paid to the respondent, whether as president of the Company or not, can no longer be applied in execution of the trust. The legal result is beyond controversy. The object of the original trust has failed in consequence of repudiation by the trustee and present impossibility of performance; a resulting trust, therefore, attaches to these proceeds of the sale of the respondent\u2019s property, in favour of the respondent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. M. S. Ross.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. F. McCallum.\n[1] (1889) 14 P.D. 64, at 68.\n[2] [1891] 2 Q.B. 488, at 491.\n"}

Then, after certain directions and gifts of annuities, the will provided, par. 14, that \u201con the death of my said wife or when my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of 25 years whichever event shall first happen\u201d the trustees should divide the net residue into two equal parts, and one part (subject to a charge) \u201cshall be equally divided between my said two sons\u201d (with provisions for gifts over in events which did not happen); then, par. 15, that the \u201cother half\u201d of the said residuary estate (subject to charges) \u201cupon the death of my said wife * * * shall subject as hereinafter be distributed in equal shares amongst\u201d certain named beneficiaries, including B., with provisions that should any of them \u201cpredecease my said wife or die before the period of distribution with reference to this half of my residuary estate leaving a child or children surviving, such child or children living at the date of such distribution * * * shall take the share which the parent * * * would have received if living at the time of such distribution\u201d and that the share of any of said named beneficiaries \u201cwho shall die before the period of distribution aforesaid without leaving any child or children who shall be living at the date of distribution shall belong to my said two sons in equal shares\u201d; and that, in the event (which did not happen) of the wife dying before the youngest son \u201cshall or would have attained the age of 25 years\u201d, then the period of distribution with regard to this half of the residuary estate should be delayed until the latter event.\nThe testator died in 1909, leaving his widow and two sons. The widow is still living. The younger son attained the age of 25 years in 1912, and conformably to (and subject to) par. 14 of the will, the trustee then divided the net residue of the estate into two equal parts and divided one part between the two sons. The older son died in 1915 and the younger son in 1930. In 1922, B., one of the said named beneficiaries in par. 15 of the will, died without issue. The present question was concerned with her share.\nHeld: Upon the words in par. 15 (a construction supported by comparison of language in other parts of the will) both sons took, on the testator\u2019s death, a vested interest in equal shares in the \u201cother half\u201d (of the residuary estate) disposed of in par. 15 (subject to charges there mentioned), subject to partial defeasance in favour of any of the said named beneficiaries (or, alternatively, their issue) who might be living at the time fixed for distribution; and therefore the sons\u2019 estates took the benefit of the aliquot part of the residuary estate which B. would have received under par. 15 had she lived until the time therein fixed for distribution; but that aliquot part was not payable until the testator\u2019s wife\u2019s death.\nBusch v. Eastern Trust Co., [1928] Can. S.C.R. 479, distinguished.\nAPPEAL by The Royal Trust Company, executor and trustee of the last will and testament of Herbert R. Hammond, deceased, one of the sons of Herbert Carlyle Hammond, deceased (the construction of whose will was in question), from the judgment of Kingstone J., delivered on an originating motion made in the Supreme Court of Ontario for the determination of certain questions affecting the rights of certain persons under the will of the said Herbert Carlyle Hammond, deceased.\nAn appeal was taken by the present appellant to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, but such appeal never came on for argument before that court. Upon the consent of the solicitors for all interested parties who had taken any part in the proceedings, an order was made by the Court of Appeal granting leave to appeal direct from the judgment of Kingstone J. to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe said Herbert Carlyle Hammond died on January 26, 1909, and by his will he appointed the National Trust Company Ltd. executor of his estate. He left him surviving his widow, Fannie Hammond, and two sons, Frederick S. Hammond and Herbert R. Hammond. The widow is still living.\nThe older son, Frederick S. Hammond, died on May 7, 1915, having made a will, whereof he appointed the National Trust Company Ltd. the executor. By it he bequeathed the whole of his estate to his wife, Kathleen Saunders Hammond. The latter died on September 22, 1919, having made a will. Letters of administration with the will annexed of her estate was granted to the National Trust Company Ltd. Subsequently, by The Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission Amendment Act, 1922, Ontario, 12-13 Geo. V, c. 40, it was enacted that the Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario should be the beneficiary as to one-half of the residue of her estate.\nThe younger son, Herbert R. Hammond, died on August 12, 1930, and by his will appointed The Royal Trust Company executor.\nThe terms of the will of the said Herbert Carlyle Hammond, deceased, material on the present case, and the questions for determination, are sufficiently set out in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note.\nG.M.

They provide for several specific bequests, with which we are not concerned. The clauses material to the present submission are those which deal with the residue of the estate. Paragraph 8 begins in this way:\u2014\n8. I give devise and bequeath all the rest residue and remainder of my estate to my executors and trustees in trust to realize such portions thereof from time to time as it may be necessary to realize * * *.\nThen follow directions as to the realization of the estate and the administration by the trustees.\nParagraph 9, amongst other bequests, directs the trustees, \u201cout of the income and profits of my estate,\u201d to pay to the widow the sum of $12,000 per annum during her life and to pay certain other annuities to named beneficiaries during their lives, subject to a provision for final distribution referred to in paragraph 15 presently to be set out. One of the beneficiaries so named is \u201cJessie Butler of Toronto.\u201d\nThe main provisions are to be found in paragraphs 14, 15 and 16, and, in order to grasp this case, it is necessary that they should be read in full:\n14. On the death of my said wife or when my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years whichever event shall first happen my trustees shall divide the net residue and remainder of my estate into two equal parts and one of such equal parts subject and charged as hereinafter shall be equally divided between my said two sons and In Arriving at the net residue and remainder of my estate for the purposes of division there shall be taken into account such sums as may have been given to my sons in my lifetime by way of advancement and such advances as may have been made after my death not exceeding twenty thousand dollars each to my said two sons or either of them out of the Principal of my estate and the shares of each of my said two sons in the said one-half of my Estate shall be charged with such sums by way of advancement and such advances after my death out of the principal as shall have been made to them respectively.\nOne-half the annuity of twelve thousand dollars to my said wife shall be charged upon and be payable out of the half of my residuary estate to be divided between my said two sons as aforesaid and on the period of distribution arriving and my said wife being then living my trustees shall retain from such one-half of my residuary estate in equal proportions from each son\u2019s share if both then be living a Capital sum sufficient to provide for the payment to my said wife of six thousand dollars per annum during her life. If either of my said sons shall die before the period of distribution and without having disposed of his share by his last will and testament and leaving lawful issue him surviving the share of such son so dying charged as aforesaid shall go to his said issue and if more than one in equal shares and in the event of either of my said sons dying before the period of distribution without leaving lawful issue him surviving and not having disposed of the same by his last will and testament the whole of the said half share reduced and charged as aforesaid shall go to the survivor of my said sons.\n15. The other half of my said residuary estate shall be charged with the payment to my said wife of one half of the annuity of twelve thou- sand dollars given to her as aforesaid and with all the other annuities and annual charges above mentioned and I will and direct that upon the death of my said wife the said other half of my residuary estate subject to all the existing annuities or annual charges above mentioned and after making provision for the said annuities continuing thereafter shall subject as hereinafter be distributed in equal shares amongst the following persons namely: Fannie Parker, Georgina Bogert, Edward R. Crombie, Ethel Butler, Jessie Butler, Charlotte Scougall, Belle Marks, Mona Wily and Thomas W. Butler.\nShould any of them the said Fannie Parker, Georgina Bogert, Edward R. Crombie, Ethel Butler, Jessie Butler, Charlotte Scougall, Belle Marks, Mona Wily and Thomas W. Butler predecease my said wife or die before the period of distribution with reference to this half of my residuary estate leaving a child or children surviving such child or children living at the date of such distribution (and in equal shares if there be more than one) shall take the share which the parent respectively of such child or children would have received if living at the time of such distribution.\nThe share of any of them the said Fannie Parker, Georgina Bogert, Edward R. Crombie, Ethel Butler, Jessie Butler, Charlotte Scougall, Belle Marks, Mona Wily and Thomas W. Butler who shall die before the period of distribution aforesaid without leaving any child or children who shall be living at the date of distribution shall belong to my said two sons in equal shares.\nIn the event of my said wife dying before my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years then the period of distribution with regard to this half of my residuary estate shall be delayed and such distribution shall not take place until my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years.\nFrom the time the said Fannie Parker, Georgina Bogert, Edward R. Crombie, Ethel Butler, Jessie Butler, Charlotte Scougall, Belle Marks, Mona Wily or Thomas W. Butler receive their share of the principal under this my will the said annuities in their favour respectively shall no longer be paid to them.\n16. If both my said sons shall die before the period of distribution to them as aforesaid and without lawful issue him or them surviving and not having disposed by will of the share of my estate to which they or the survivor of them are entitled the same shall be divided in the same way as is directed in reference to the other half.\nThere are other passages of the will which may be helpful in determining the matters involved, but it will be sufficient to refer to them as we proceed.\nThe pertinent facts are:\nHerbert Carlyle Hammond, the testator, died on the 26th January, 1909. In his will, National Trust Company, Limited, was appointed executor and trustee.\nHe left him surviving his widow, Fannie Hammond, and his two sons, Frederick S. Hammond and Herbert R. Hammond.\nThe widow is still living. The youngest son, Herbert, attained the age of twenty-five on the 19th December, 1912.\nAs a consequence, and conformably to paragraph 14 of the will, the trustee then divided the net residue and remainder of the estate into two equal parts and one of these parts, subject to the other conditions and charges therein provided, was divided between the two sons.\nThe older son, Frederick, died on the 7th May, 1915. He left a will appointing National Trust Company, Limited, executor and bequeathing the whole of his estate to his wife, Kathleen Saunders. She has also died leaving a will. Her estate is now represented by National Trust Company Limited and by The Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario (under c. 40 of Statutes of Ontario, 12-13 Geo. V).\nHerbert Hammond, the younger son, died on the 12th August, 1930. He left a will appointing The Royal Trust Company executor.\nBut, at a prior date, to wit, on the 30th April, 1922, and, therefore, while Herbert Hammond was still living, one of the beneficiaries named in paragraph 15 of the will, Jessie Butler, died without issue.\nAnd the present submission is really concerned with the question: In the events that have happened, what becomes of the share of Jessie Butler?\nThe questions were submitted to the court in the following form:\n1. Is the interest of the said Herbert R. Hammond, deceased, one of the residuary legatees of the said deceased, in the share of Jessie Butler deceased, also one of the residuary legatees of the said testator, now payable to the estate of the said Herbert R. Hammond, deceased, the period of distribution mentioned in said paragraph 15 of the Will of the Testator not yet having arrived?\n2. Did Frederick S. Hammond, deceased, one the residuary legatees of the said testator, have a vested interest in the share of the said Jessie Butler now deceased, and if so is such interest now payable to the estate of the said Frederick S. Hammond, deceased?\n3. If the interest of the said Herbert R. Hammond, deceased, and the interest of Frederick S. Hammond, deceased, if any, in the share of the said Jessie Butler, deceased, are now payable to their respective estates, on what basis should the assets constituting the one-half of the residuary estate of the said testator out of which such interests are payable be apportioned to effect such payments?\nKingstone J., before whom the motion was returned, held that, Jessie Butler having died without issue prior to the death of the widow, Fannie Hammond, neither son of the testator had, at their respective deaths, a vested interest in the share directed to be distributed to her; that the share did not pass to any other person under the will and it should be distributed as upon an intestacy. He adjudged accordingly.\nThe appeal is from that judgment, per saltum, pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe learned judge of first instance based his decision on the rule \u201claid down in Williams on Executors, 11th Ed., p. 981\u201d (now: 12th Edition, p. 795) and referred to our judgment in Busch v. Eastern Trust Company[1], where, applying the rule to the peculiar circumstances of that case, we held that the vesting was postponed until the time of distribution. But while, for wills as well as for other documents, there are no doubt recognized canons of construction, the cardinal principle\u2014to which any rule is always subservient\u2014is that effect shall be given to the testator\u2019s intention ascertainable from the actual language of the will. Indeed, the rule itself relied on by the learned judge, as stated in Sir Edward Vaughan Williams\u2019 treatise, contains the qualifying words: \u201cunless, from particular circumstances, a contrary intention is to be collected.\u201d\nIn this case, the expressed language of the testator indicates plainly the intention that no part of the residuary estate should remain undisposed of; and, in particular, does it negative intestacy with regard to the share of Jessie Butler. Provision having been made for special bequests, the \u201crest, residue and remainder\u201d of the estate is given to the executors and trustees in trust for the purposes defined in the will. Until certain events happen, the trustees are to pay fixed annuities to a number of named beneficiaries. On the death of the testator\u2019s wife, or when the \u201cyoungest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years whichever event shall first happen,\u201d the trustees must divide the net residue and remainder into two equal parts. And, as already seen, upon the youngest son attaining the specified age, this division was actually made.\nThe testator then proceeds to declare who shall be the beneficiaries of each of the two equal parts of the residuary estate. For one part, they are to be his two sons, charged however with half the annuity payable to the widow. With regard to that one part, we do not think, upon the language of paragraph 14, any doubt could be entertained as to its immediate vesting in the two sons, subject to being divested in the event of certain contingencies which have not happened. It is unnecessary further to follow the possible incidence under the will of that part of the estate, in respect of which there is no controversy.\nThe disposition of the other part of the residuary estate is made in paragraph 15. That particular part is charged with the payment of one-half the annuity due to the widow and with all the other annuities and annual charges mentioned in the will. Upon the death of the testator\u2019s wife or when the youngest son \u201cshall or would\u201d have attained the age of twenty-five years, whichever event happens last, the trustees, \u201cafter making provision for the annuities continuing thereafter,\u201d are directed to make a distribution in equal shares between the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries who may then receive a share are certain named persons (or, alternatively, their children) and the two sons of the testator.\nThere is, however, a material difference between the language used to express the bequests to the named beneficiaries or to their surviving children and that used to express the bequest to the two sons. The named beneficiaries do not constitute a class. They are, each of them, independent legatees. The direction is that the distribution to any of them is to be made only \u201csubject as hereinafter\u201d and that is to say: only to \u201cany of them\u201d who shall not \u201cpredecease my said wife or die before the period of distribution with reference to this half of [the] residuary estate.\u201d So as to be entitled to a share, they must be \u201cliving at the time of such distribution.\u201d That is a condition precedent to the very existence of their right, for, if they be not living at the period mentioned, the share goes to their children then living and, if no children are then living, it belongs to the two sons. It is therefore apparent that the testator, in this case, meant to annex the time to the gift of the legacy and not merely to the payment of it. And, for the same reasons, the rights of the surviving children of the named beneficiaries stand upon exactly the same footing. But when it comes to deal with the legacy to the \u201ctwo sons\u201d the language of paragraph 15 is essentially different. It says that \u201cthe share * * * shall belong to my said two sons in equal shares.\u201d The words \u201cshall belong\u201d are words of gift, by force of which the \u201ctwo sons\u201d take independently of the direction to divide. Nor is that gift made to depend upon the contingency of the \u201ctwo sons\u201d having survived the period of distribution. On the contrary, the language rather contemplates that the sons\u2019 estates will share in the distribution, notwithstanding the possibility of their death prior to the specified period, for such is the natural and logical meaning to be given to the subparagraph prescribing that\nin the event of my said wife dying before my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years then the period of distribution * * * shall be delayed and such distribution shall not take place until my youngest son shall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years.\nThere would seem to be no possible ground under paragraph 15, upon which it could be said that the gift to the sons was not intended at least to vest immediately upon the death without issue of one of the named beneficiaries. And it would follow that, when Jessie Butler died without leaving children, the share which she \u201cwould have received if living at the time of distribution\u201d vested, at least from the date of her death, in one of the sons, Herbert Hammond, who survived her.\nWe are, however, led to the view that the intention of the testator, as it appears from the particular words he has used in paragraph 15, was that the two sons, and not only the survivor, should get the benefit of the legacy. Such is, it seems to us, the fair and literal meaning of the expression: \u201cshall belong to my said two sons in equal shares.\u201d That becomes still more apparent when the expression is compared with the language in other parts of the will. When he desired to make a bequest primarily vesting in both his sons, but subject to being divested in favour of the survivor, the testator was not lacking in words explicitly to indicate his intention. The last part of paragraph 14 and the whole of paragraph 16, already set out, afford illustrations of the almost meticulous manner in which he expresses his wish in such cases. Other examples are furnished by paragraph 18, where the testator first disposes of a house and lot on the southwest corner of Beverly and Cecil streets. The use thereof is given to Ethel Butler and to Jessie Butler for the purpose of personal occupation by them so long as they remain unmarried. If one should marry, \u201cthe right of occupation shall continue to the other and after each shall have either married or died I give and devise the said house and lot to my sons and the survivor of them.\u201d The testator then bequeaths an insurance policy on his life \u201cto my sons in equal shares to be divided between them by my trustees when the distribution to them above mentioned takes place or if only one son living the whole shall go to him.\u201d\nOn the contrary, in paragraph 5, the testator is dealing with his residence in Toronto. He gives the use thereof to his wife and devises that, after her death, the residence \u201cshall go to my two sons equally.\u201d Then, in paragraph 23, he refers again to it and he directs that his\nTrustees may at any time sell the residence owned by [him] at the time of [his] death with the consent of [his] wife and with her consent purchase another house to be held on the same terms and if she does not require another house to be purchased then she shall be entitled to the income received from the proceeds of the house sold during her life and these proceeds at her death shall go to my two sons equally.\nBoth in paragraphs 5 and 23 the unmistakable intention appears that the beneficial interest in the residence or in the proceeds of the sale thereof shall, immediately upon the death of the testator, vest finally and definitely in the two sons. We will be following the course of authority in holding that a similar expression used in paragraph 15 ought to carry a similar meaning and to be given the same effect.\nOur interpretation is therefore that both sons took at once a vested interest \u201cin equal shares\u201d in the \u201cother half of the residuary estate\u201d disposed of in paragraph 15, charged with one-half of the annuity provided for the widow and with all the other annuities and annual charges there mentioned, subject to partial defeasance in favour of any of the named beneficiaries (or, alternatively, their issue) who might be living at the time fixed for distribution.\nOn the other hand, we are unable to find in paragraph 15 any language indicating that, upon the death without issue of any of the named beneficiaries, the aliquot part which he would have received if living at the time stated, shall immediately become payable to the two sons. For the purpose of this discussion, we may disregard the pro- vision postponing the division, in any event, until the youngest son \u201cshall or would have attained the age of twenty-five years,\u201d for this condition no longer stands in the way. But there is nothing in the whole clause to alter the explicit intention of the testator that the distribution of that part of the estate shall take place only \u201cupon the death of [his] said wife\u201d; and, on the contrary, there is every indication that the trustee is not empowered to distribute until that time has arrived, if, indeed, it were possible to do so before the exact number of shares into which the division is to be made has been definitely ascertained.\nWe must give full effect to the testator\u2019s intention.\nThe appeal will be allowed and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario set aside, costs of all parties throughout to be paid out of the estate, and to the Executor and Trustee on a solicitor and client basis. The questions will be answered as follows:\nTo Question No. 1: No.\nTo Question No. 2: Frederick S. Hammond, deceased, took a vested interest in the aliquot part of the residuary estate which Jessie Butler might have received under paragraph 15 of the will, if she had lived till the time therein fixed for distribution; but such interest is not \u201cnow payable.\u201d\nQuestion No. 3 does not arise.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors of National Trust Company Ltd., Executors of Herbert Carlyle Hammond Estate: Aylesworth, Garden, Stuart & Thompson.\nSolicitors for The Soldiers\u2019 Aid Commission of Ontario: C.M.

The city assessment commissioner wrote P. enclosing a copy of the by-law, and a correspondence ensued between the assessment commissioner and respondents\u2019 solicitors as to compensation. The City Council, on December 14, 1931, passed a resolution adopting a report of the Board of Control recommending the adoption of a report submitted by the assessment commissioner as to agreement with P. as to compensation and possession and conveyance of the land; and this fact was communicated by the assessment commissioner to respondents\u2019 solicitors. Early in 1932 the by-law of November 2, 1931, was repealed. Respondents sued the City for the amount of compensation as having been agreed upon and as owing by the City under a valid and binding contract.\nHeld: (1) Upon the actions of the City Council and the communications which took place, and even apart from the point of law next mentioned, the respondents had failed to prove that an agreement was concluded in fact.\n(2) Assuming, contrary to this Court\u2019s finding, that the Council acting on the City\u2019s behalf did profess to assent to an agreement having the effect (alleged by respondents) that the City was to pay $25,000 as compensation for the expropriation of respondents\u2019 part of the property described in said by-law, and that respondents were to execute and deliver a conveyance to the City together with vacant possession, a resolution of the Council, authorizing and embodying the terms of such an agreement, was not sufficient to bind the City in the circumstances; a by-law under the seal of the City was essential. Secs. 5, 9, 258 (1), 267 (1), 342 (1), (2), 351 (1), (2), 396 (45), of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 233, particularly considered. Mackay v. City of Toronto, [1920] A.C. 208, at 210, 213, 214, cited.\nThe \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d of November 2, 1931, did not constitute in itself a sufficient compliance with the enactments of ss. 396 (45), 5, and 258 (1), so as to commit the City to take the property or to pay compensation. Reading s. 5 with s. 351, it sufficiently appears that, where the municipality is proceeding under its compulsory powers alone, the distinction between an \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d and a by-law which, in addition to being an \u201cexpropriating by-law,\u201d authorizes entry upon the property or the making use of the property to be taken, is a practical distinction of great importance; where the initiating by\u2011law is an \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d simply (and, on its proper construction, the said by-law of November 2 was such), no act or proceeding on the part of the persons interested in the property can have the effect of binding the municipality to acquire the land (such a by-law has not the effect of a notice to treat under other systems of expropriation, e.g., under the provisions of the English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845); there must, in addition, be an \u201centry on\u201d or use made of the property, as contemplated by s. 351, under the authority of by-law, or a further by-law adopting an award, or an agreement between the municipality and the parties interested settling the amount of compensation.\nThe \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d of November 2 did not operate to empower the Council to fasten upon the City an obligation to acquire the land, or to effect an acquisition thereof, by resolution alone, because (1) the magnitude of the compensation to be paid is so radical a matter and the settlement of it so important a step in the process of acquiring land under s. 396 (45) as to justify the conclusion that the authority to assent to such an agreement must proceed from a by-law enacted under that clause; to hold that a simple \u201cexpropriating by-law,\u201d where there is no express or implied authority by by-law to settle the compensation, creates such authority by force of the statute, would postulate an intention out of harmony with that manifested by the enactments of s. 351; and (2) the power to settle compensation by agreement is one of those powers contemplated by s. 258 (1); the power to create a binding contractual obligation fixing the amount of compensation to be paid in circumstances such as in the present case, is clearly ejusdem generis with the power to acquire by purchase; a power which (ss. 396 (45), 5, 258 (1), of the Act; Mackay v. City of Toronto, supra) can only be executed by by-law.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1933] O.R., 442, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (by a majority) the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Wright J.[2] holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $25,000, as being the amount agreed upon as compensation for land expropriated by the defendant. The plaintiff Mrs. Prince was owner, and the plaintiff Whirlwind Carpet Cleaners Ltd. was tenant, of the land in question. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, as are also the questions (indicated in the above headnote) arising for determination. The appeal was allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs throughout. C.M. Colquhoun K.C. and J.P. Kent for the appellant.\nN. Sommerville K.C. and R. Bigelow for the respondents.\nTHE COURT: The primary facts in this appeal are not in dispute. On November 2nd, 1931, the appellant Corporation, by its Council, passed by-law No. 13405, entitled\nA by-law to acquire certain lands for park purposes as an addition to Bickford Ravine.\nOn November 9th, the City Assessment Commissioner wrote to Mrs. Prince, enclosing a copy of the by-law, and informing her that the expropriated land included property owned by her, and asked her to advise him\nthe lowest amount you would be prepared to accept in full settlement for the conveyance to the City, free of all encumbrances, easements and other rights whatsoever of the property expropriated, as above described, vacant possession to be given to the City, free of any tenancies, upon the payment of the compensation.\nA correspondence ensued which sufficiently appears from the discussion which follows.\nOn the 18th December, the Commissioner of Parks and the Assessment Commissioner were requested to appear before the Board of Control to explain why it was necessary to acquire additional lands for the improvement of Bickford Ravine Park property. At the first regular meeting of the City Council for the year 1932 the \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d was repealed. After this repeal the respondents brought this action and claimed that the passing of the by-law and the resolution of the City Council adopting a report of the Assessment Commissioner fixing the amount of the compensation to be paid, constituted a valid and binding contract between the appellant Corporation and the respondents. On the other hand, the Corporation contends that there was no binding agreement in fact, and could be none in point of law until the Corporation, by by-law, had expressed its willingness to take the property and pay the compensation agreed upon; conditions admittedly not fulfilled.\nThe trial judge gave judgment in favour of the respondents for $25,000[3], holding that an enforceable contract had been entered into. On appeal, this was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal (Latchford C.J.A. and Magee J.A. dissenting)[4]. The first question is the question whether, in point of fact, the parties entered into an agreement fixing the compensation. The respondents rely upon the resolution of the Council, already adverted to, as evidencing such an agreement. The resolution adopts the following report of the Board of Control and was passed 14th December, 1931:\nThe Board recommend the adoption of the appended report submitted by the Assessment Commissioner, re the above, viz:\nMrs. Elizabeth L. Prince is the owner of premises No. 779 Bloor Street West, the land having a frontage of 20 feet by a depth of 120 feet, upon which is erected two storey brick buildings. She also owns a parcel of land in rear of No. 781 Bloor Street West, having a frontage on Montrose Avenue of 50 feet by a depth of 20 feet, the property being occupied for business purposes by The Whirlwind Carpet Cleaners Limited. This property was expropriated as an addition to Bickford Ravine by By-law No. 13405, passed by Council on November 2nd last.\nI have arranged with Mrs. Elizabeth L. Prince, subject to the approval of your Board and Council, through her solicitors, Norman Sommerville & Company, a settlement of the compensation and the amount agreed upon is $25,000 in full of all claims, which includes business disturbance and the moving of plant and equipment, the owner to be allowed occupation of the property until April 15th, 1932, upon which date the City is to receive vacant possession. I therefore recommend that the City Solicitor be instructed to pay to Mrs. Elizabeth L. Prince, or whomever he may find to be entitled to receive it, the sum of $25,000 upon the receipt of which the property in question, as above described, is to be conveyed to the City, free from all encumbrance, easements and other rights whatsoever, vacant possession to be given to the City, free of any tenancies, upon payment of the compensation.\nThe property in question is assessed for the sum of $5,400.\nCERTIFIED a true copy of an extract of Report No. 29 of the Board of Control adopted in Council 14th day of December, 1931.\nThere are several points raised on behalf of the Corporation, in connection with this resolution, which must be examined. The duties of the Assessment Commissioner, on whose report the resolution proceeded, are set forth in a by-law relating to the officials of the Corporation, passed in 1904, of which the pertinent provisions are these:\n31. In addition to all duties imposed upon the Assessment Commissioner under any Act or Statute, or under any By-law of the Corporation, the said Assessment Commissioner shall perform the following duties and be subject to the following regulations:\u2014\n1. To have charge of the renting and leasing of all properties belonging to the Corporation, except as otherwise provided (B.4597, sec. 2), and to carry on all necessary negotiations in connection therewith, and to advertise the said properties, with the approval of the Chairman of the Committee on Property; to advise on the rentals to be received, and, if a sale or purchase by the Corporation is proposed, to advise on the price to be received or paid, as the case may be, and make such recommendation in respect of the proposed transaction as he may deem advisable, and to advise as to the laying out and handling of the Corporation property to the best advantage; no final disposition of any property, except properties bought in by the Corporation at sales of lands for taxes, is to be made except upon the report of the Committee on Property, adopted by Board of Control and Council, in accordance with the by-laws of the Council;\nIt will be observed that the duties so described are in addition to duties imposed upon the Commissioner under any Act or statute or any by-law of the Corporation. The Commissioner, therefore, obviously had no authority to enter into an agreement on behalf of the Corporation determining the amount of compensation payable in respect of land expropriated under a municipal by-law. Nor had the Council any power to confer such authority upon him by resolution. Moreover, when the correspondence between the Commissioner and the solicitors for the respondent is examined, the material parts of which are set out in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the statement of claim, it will be seen that the Commissioner is not professing on behalf of the Corporation to enter into an agreement with the respondents settling the compensation to be paid for the property in question or for the purchase of the property. On the one hand, the Commissioner is notified of the amount of the compensation that the respondents will accept and the terms under which the property and possession of it will be handed over to the City; and, on the other hand, the Commissioner advises the respondents that he will recommend the payment of the amount of compensation named by them, and the terms also upon which the payment is to be made and the property is to be taken over.\nWhen the Commissioner, in his report, speaks of having arranged a settlement of the compensation, and says that the amount agreed upon is $25,000 in full of all claims, etc., it is not fair to read his report as a statement that he has entered into an agreement in the legal sense on behalf of the Corporation, even subject to the approval of the Council. The fairer construction is that, as the correspondence shews, the respondents have declared their willingness to accept the sum of $25,000, and that the Commissioner had informed them he would recommend to the proper authority the payment of that sum upon the terms set forth by him. (See per Parker J. in Pollard v. County Council of Middlesex[5]). Then, in fact, the respondents had not expressed their assent, or their willingness to agree, to the terms stated in the report. The respondents\u2019 express proposal was that they should retain possession for three months after the payment of compensation. The proposal in the report is that the respondents shall retain possession until the 15th of April and that on the delivery up of vacant possession on that date, and the delivery of a conveyance, the compensation shall be paid.\nIt is impossible to regard the resolution as the acceptance of an offer to enter into an agreement made by the respondents to the Corporation settling the compensation; because, if the letter of the respondents can properly be construed as such an offer, the resolution is most assuredly not an acceptance of it. Nor can the resolution properly be regarded as a ratification of an agreement in the legal sense between the Assessment Commissioner, on behalf of the Corporation, and the respondents, for the settlement of compensation because: first, the correspondence shews that the Assessment Commissioner was not professing to enter into any such agreement, or into any agreement on behalf of the Corporation, which, moreover, would have been entirely outside his functions; and, on a fair reading, his report ought not to be construed as stating he had made such an agreement; and, in the second place, in point of fact, there had been no assent by the parties to common terms.\nThen, the respondents rely upon the communication made by the Assessment Commissioner to them of the terms of this resolution. Now, the Assessment Commissioner had no general authority to make a communication to the respondents of either a binding acceptance by the Corporation of an offer made by the respondents, or of a binding offer on behalf of the Corporation to the respondents of a settlement of compensation upon the terms of the resolution. If the Assessment Commissioner\u2019s letter was intended by him to operate in either of these characters, he was exceeding his duty. The letter cannot properly be treated as a communication made by the Corporation in either of these senses, nor was it a communication authorized by the Council. The resolution declares that the Board recommends the adoption of the appended report. The only recommendation made by the report is that the City Solicitor be instructed to pay to Mrs. Elizabeth L. Prince, or whomever he may find to be entitled to receive it, the sum of $25,000 upon the receipt of which the property in question, as above described, is to be conveyed to the City, free from all encumbrance, easements and other rights whatsoever, vacant possession to be given to the City, free of any tenancies, upon payment of the compensation.\nThe resolution itself gives the City Solicitor authority to act upon it by doing certain specified acts; the payment of $25,000 to the respondents or \u201cwhomever he may find to be entitled to receive it\u201d, upon the receipt of which the property is to be conveyed to the Corporation and possession delivered up on the 15th of April. It is plain the 15th of April is fixed as the date of taking possession and that upon the delivery of a conveyance by all the parties interested and of possession, the compensation is to be paid.\nThe resolution does not in terms authorize the City Solicitor to enter into an agreement with respondents nor does it in terms express an intention to enter into such an agreement. He is to pay the compensation to the persons who may be entitled to it. Contemporaneously with payment, the property is to be conveyed and delivered to the Corporation by, of course, those who are interested in it.\nThen, if the resolution of the Council could be considered as authorizing the communication of an offer to settle the compensation, or to purchase the property on the terms stated, that offer was never communicated by the Corporation to the respondents.\nThe City Solicitor did not communicate the resolution to the respondents or any notice of an intention of the Corporation to enter into an agreement for acquiring the property or for the settlement of compensation. His letter of the 4th of January states explicitly that the matter is under consideration by the Board of Control and his letter of the 15th of January states that the Board of Control has made a recommendation to the Council. Both of these communications are incompatible with the notion that he is communicating an unconditional offer to acquire the property.\nMoreover, if we could assume that the resolution authorized the communication to the respondents of an offer of an agreement to purchase or to settle the compensation, and if we could assume further that such communication had taken place, we should still be confronted with the letters of the respondents\u2019 solicitors of the 31st of December and the 13th of January. In the first of these letters the respondents state that there was an agreement between the Assessment Commissioner and the respondent that the Corporation should pay $25,000; that this agreement was approved by the Board of Control and adopted by the Council on the 14th of December, 1931.\nOn this date the property had been expropriated, the price had been fixed, the contract had been confirmed by both parties and the sum of $25,000 is therefore due and owing to Elizabeth L. Prince and The Whirlwind Carpet Cleaners, Limited.\nOn behalf of both of these parties, for whom we act, we now request you to pay the sum of $25,000, according to the terms of the contract.\nIt is quite clear that the respondents did not treat the resolution as the offer of an agreement but as the confirmation of an agreement already assented to. The resolution, if communicated as an offer, was plainly not accepted. The respondents declare that they are entitled to be paid $25,000 under an agreement already completed and upon terms different from those contained in the resolution. In other words, if an offer had been communicated, it was met by a counter offer, which was never accepted by the Council.\nThe letter of the 13th of January is almost equally significant. Referring to an opinion of the City Solicitor reported in the newspapers that there was no binding agreement because there was no communication of the Corporation of an intention to purchase the lands, the letter says:\nWe again repeat our request that a cheque for the amount of the compensation be sent us forthwith.\nHere again the respondents are not treating the resolution as an offer but take their stand on the position that they are entitled to something different from anything sanctioned by the resolution under an agreement already concluded. The letter of the City Solicitor of January 15, 1932, as we have mentioned above, apprises the respondents of the fact that \u201cThe Board of Control has made a recommendation to the Council\u201d and that nothing further can be done \u201cuntil the Council deals with such report\u201d. In view of all the circumstances, the letter of the 18th of January, which is not a little ambiguous, cannot be treated as a valid acceptance of an offer still open. If there was communication of an offer in terms of the resolution, that, we repeat, had been met by a counter offer which had never been accepted, in other words, by a rejection, and the original offer was no longer open. It is, perhaps, worth noting that the letter of the 18th of January was only written after the respondents had been informed that the Council was reconsidering the matter.\nIn a letter of January 25th, 1932, the respondents\u2019 solicitors still assert:\nThe City is now indebted to our clients in the sum of $25,000 for the property thus expropriated.\nThe action was brought and the statement of claim delivered before the 15th of April, the date fixed by the resolution for payment. The claim of the respondents in the pleading is free from doubt. In par. 8 they aver that, on\nthe 31st day of December, 1931, the plaintiffs, through their solicitors, having executed and completed a deed of the said lands, and a release of all claims against the said Corporation, delivered the said deed and release to the Corporation of the City of Toronto, and did complete in all respects the said transaction and agreement and requested the payment of the said sum of $25,000 according to the terms of the said agreement.\nThis letter of the 31st of December, as already observed, in unambiguous terms makes a request for immediate payment, and declares that, under the contract between the parties, \u201cthe sum of $25,000 is * * * due and owing\u201d to the respondents; and proceeds, \u201cwe now request you to pay the sum of $25,000, according to the terms of the contract.\u201d\nIn par. 12 it is alleged that \u201can agreement was duly made for the payment of the sum of $25,000 as the purchase price for the said lands;\u201d that the plaintiffs accepted and adopted the same and acted thereon and \u201cthat the said Corporation cannot now rescind or revoke the said contract.\u201d In the same paragraph they allege that \u201ccompensation * * * was duly fixed, and that the same is now due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiffs.\u201d The respondents, it will be noticed, do not by their pleadings advance a claim to payment on the ground that the appellant has repudiated an agreement to be performed by payment in April. They claim, consistently with the letters quoted, that, under the terms of an agreement between the Corporation and themselves, they had become entitled to the payment of compensation before the commencement of the action\u2014as early as the 31st of December, 1931.\nThe respondents, we think, have failed to prove that an agreement was concluded in fact. This alone would suffice to dispose of the appeal; but we think it right to discuss the questions raised by the judgments in the Ontario courts.\nThe ground upon which the majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial judge was that the expropriating by-law\nconnotes an offer by the Corporation of Toronto to take the property at a price to be ascertained. Before that offer was withdrawn and while it was in full force it was accepted by the owner and by such acceptance there arose a completed contract valid in law; for on the part of Toronto it was supported by a by-law under the seal of the corporation. The contractual obligation arose on the acceptance of the offer.\nIn England, when the value of the land taken under compulsory powers has been fixed by an assessment tribunal in conformity with the requirements of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, or has been agreed upon, there is a final and completed contract and either party may maintain an action for specific performance of the contract. This right of action exists because, under the English statute, upon giving notice to treat, the rights of the parties are at once fixed. The notice gives the owner a right to insist upon the company taking that which it has given a notice of its intention to take. \u201cNeither party can get rid of the obligation, the one to take, the other to give up.\u201d (Kindersley, V.C., in Haynes v. Haynes[6]).\nThe relevant statutory provisions are in the Ontario Municipal Act (R.S.O. 1927, c. 233). Sections 5, 9, 258 (1), 267 (1), 342 (1) and (2), 351 (1) and (2) and 396 (45) are as follows:\n5. Where power to acquire land is conferred upon a municipal corporation by this or any other Act, unless otherwise expressly provided, it shall include the power to acquire by purchase or otherwise and to enter on and expropriate.\n9. The powers of a municipal corporation shall be exercised by its council.\n258. (1) Except where otherwise provided, the jurisdiction of every council shall be confined to the municipality which it represents and its powers shall be exercised by by\u2011law.\n267. (1) Every by-law shall be under the seal of the corporation, and shall be signed by the head of the council, or by the presiding officer at the meeting at which the by-law was passed, and by the clerk. 342: (1) Where land is expropriated for the purposes of a corporation, or is injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers of a corporation under the authority of this Act or under the authority of any general or special Act, unless it is otherwise expressly provided by such general or special Act, the corporation shall make due compensation to the owner for the land expropriated and for any damage necessarily resulting from the expropriation of the land, or where land is injuriously affected by the exercise of such powers for the damages necessarily resulting therefrom, beyond any advantage which the owner may derive from any work, for the purposes of, or in connection with which the land is injuriously affected.\n(2) The amount of the compensation, if not mutually agreed upon, shall be determined by arbitration.\n351. (1) Where the arbitration is as to compensation, if the expropriating by-law did not authorize or profess to authorize any entry on or use to be made of the land before the award, except for the purpose of survey, or if the by-law gave or professed to give such authority, but the arbitrator by his award finds that it was not acted upon, the award shall not be binding on the corporation, unless it is adopted by by-law, within three months after the making of the award, or after the determination of any appeal therefrom, and if it is not so adopted, the expropriating by-law shall be deemed to be repealed, and the corporation shall pay the costs between solicitor and client of the reference and award, and shall also pay to the owner the damages, if any, sustained by him in consequence of the passing of the by-law, and such damages if not mutually agreed upon shall be determined by arbitration and if the by-law has been registered or a caution in respect of it has been filed the corporation shall forthwith cause a certificate signed by the mayor and clerk and sealed with the corporation\u2019s seal, stating that the by-law stands repealed, to be registered in the proper registry office or the caution to be removed as the case may be.\n(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection 3, where the expropriating by-law did not authorize or profess to authorize any entry on or use to be made of the land except for the purpose of survey, or if the by-law gave or professed to give such authority but it has not been acted on, the council may at any time before the making of the award, and whether or not arbitration proceedings have been begun, repeal the by-law, and if that is done the repealing by-law shall, if the expropriating by-law has been registered, be forthwith registered by the corporation in the proper registry office, or if the land is under The Land Titles Act and a caution has been filed, the corporation shall forthwith remove the caution and the costs and damages mentioned in subsection 1 shall be paid by the corporation as therein provided.\n396. By-laws may be passed by the councils of all municipalities:\n45. For acquiring land for and establishing and laying out public parks * * *\nThe precise question raised by the judgments in the court below on this phase of the case is this: Assuming, contrary to the conclusion at which we have clearly arrived, as already explained, that the Council acting on behalf of the appellants did profess to assent to an agreement having the effect alleged by the respondents, viz., that the appellant corporation was to pay $25,000 as compensation for the expropriation of the respondents\u2019 part of the property described in the expropriation by-law, and that the parties interested were to execute and deliver a conveyance of that part to the appellant Corporation together with vacant possession: is a resolution of the Council, authorizing and embodying the terms of such an agreement, sufficient to bind the appellant Corporation in the circumstances, or is a by-law under the seal of the Corporation, essential?\nIn considering this question, it is necessary to scrutinize with some care the statutory provisions governing the appellant Corporation now reproduced textually. First of all, the Corporation is given the express power by s. 396 (45) for acquiring land \u201cfor * * * public parks\u201d; and this power, specifically given, is to be exercised by by-law. The effect of the phrase \u201cacquiring land\u201d in s. 396 (45) is set forth in s. 5 in these words:\n5. Where power to acquire land is conferred upon a municipal corporation by this or any other Act, unless otherwise expressly provided, it shall include the power to acquire by purchase or otherwise and to enter on and expropriate.\nThe words \u201cby purchase or otherwise\u201d would appear to be used in contradistinction to the phrase \u201center on and expropriate,\u201d and the words probably extend to every acquisition by voluntary transaction.\nThere is specific authority by statute vested in the Corporation, therefore, \u201cfor acquiring land for * * * public parks\u201d (s. 396 (45)) and, in acting upon this specific authority, the Corporation is expressly empowered \u201cto acquire by purchase or otherwise and to enter on and expropriate\u201d (s. 5).\nThen there is the important enactment of s. 258 (1):\nExcept where otherwise provided, the jurisdiction of every council shall be confined to the municipality which it represents and its powers shall be exercised by by-law.\nEx facie, these provisions of the Municipal Act seem to contemplate that when a municipal corporation, executing the authority given by s. 396 (45), acquires land for the purposes of a public park, whether \u201cby purchase or otherwise,\u201d that is to say, by voluntary transaction, or in pursuance of its right \u201cto enter on and expropriate,\u201d the corporation will proceed by by-law. Land may be acquired for such a purpose by voluntary transaction or the Corpora- tion may \u201center on and expropriate.\u201d In either case, it must, the statute seems to say, proceed by by-law, unless there is some provision to the contrary.\nIn the words of Lord Haldane, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Mackay v. City of Toronto[7], the enactment of s. 2587 constitutes a \u201cprohibition imposed by the Municipal Act\u201d against \u201cthe exercise of its distinctive powers otherwise than by by-law under seal.\u201d Indeed, Lord Haldane\u2019s judgment (at pp. 210, 213 and 214) seems to be a sufficient basis for this proposition: that the execution of the specific authority created by s. 396 (45) can only be effectually accomplished by by-law.\nBy s. 10 of the Act the powers of a municipal corporation are to be exercised by the council. By s. 249, except where otherwise provided, the jurisdiction of every council is to be confined to the municipality which it represents, and its powers are to be exercised by by-law. By s. 258 [now s. 267] every by-law is to be under the seal of the corporation, and is to be signed by the head of the council, or by the presiding officer at the meeting at which the by-law is passed, and by the clerk.\n* * *\n* * * this corporation is not the creature of charter and as such endowed with capacity by the common law, but it is the pure creation of a statute. It may be that the effect of the Interpretation Act of Ontario (R.S. Ont., c. 1, s. 27), which gives to every corporation the power to contract, makes this power a general feature of its statutory equipment. But the section cannot affect the prohibition imposed by the Municipal Act of the exercise of its distinctive powers otherwise than by by-law under seal. Their Lordships do not desire to be understood as saying that the powers referred to in the context are to be taken as covering the whole field of the capacity of such a corporation to contract. It can hardly have been intended by the Legislature that, for example, notepaper cannot be bought for daily use except by a special by-law under seal; it may well be that the power to engage a servant is not a power ejusdem generis with the powers with which the Municipal Act is dealing when it imposes restrictions on their exercise.\n* * *\nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Waterous Engine Works Co. v. Corporation of Palmerston[8] was cited at the bar, and their Lordships were invited to prefer the dissenting judgment of Gwynne J. to those of the other learned judges who took part in that decision. There a municipal corporation was given express power under the then Ontario Municipal Act to purchase fire apparatus. The Act provided that all the powers of the council should be exercised by by-law unless (which was not done by the Act) the exercise of a special power was otherwise expressly authorized or provided for. The defendant corporation contracted with the appellants for the purchase of a fire engine and 550 feet of hose. No by-law was passed sanctioning the purchase. It was held by a majority in the Supreme Court, consisting of Strong, Taschereau and Patterson JJ., that this contract was not enforceable in the absence of a by-law. As the power to purchase fire apparatus was one of the powers expressly conferred by the Act, this appears to have been right.\nThese pronouncements of the Judicial Committee would appear to make it unnecessary to consider the distinction dwelt upon in the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal between \u201clegislative powers,\u201d so-called, and \u201cadministrative powers.\u201d\nThe view taken by the Court of Appeal appears to have been that the \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d of the 2nd November, 1931, constituted a sufficient compliance with the enactments of s. 396 (45), s. 5 and s. 258 (1). The by-law is in these words:\nNo. 13405. A BY-LAW\nTo acquire certain lands for park purposes as an addition to Bickford Ravine.\n(Passed November 2nd, 1931).\nWHEREAS by Report No. 14 of the Committee on Parks and Exhibition, adopted in Council October 5th, 1931, it was recommended that the lands hereinafter described be acquired for park purposes, as an addition to Bickford Ravine:\u2014\nTherefore the Council of the Corporation of the City of Toronto enacts as follows:\u2014\nI.\nThe lands described by Tracy D. LeMay, Esquire, City Surveyor, as follows, namely:\u2014\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the City of Toronto, in the County of York and Province of Ontario, being composed of the westerly forty feet (40\u2019) of Lot No. 43, according to a plan filed in the Registry Office for the Registry Division of Toronto, as No. 1223\nare hereby expropriated and taken for park purposes.\nIn the sections of the statute quoted above, a distinction is patently recognized between the procedure which is described by the verb \u201cexpropriate\u201d and that which is described by the phrase \u201center on.\u201d\nReading s. 5 with s. 351, it sufficiently appears that, where the municipality is proceeding under its compulsory powers alone, the distinction between an \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d and a by-law which, in addition to being an \u201cexpropriating by-law,\u201d authorizes entry upon the property or the making use of the property to be taken, is a practical distinction of great importance.\nThe \u201cexpropriating by-law,\u201d no doubt, may be registered, and the registration of it may affect the powers of disposition possessed by those interested, in the sense that anybody purchasing must purchase subject to the muni- cipality\u2019s right to acquire the property compulsorily, on the footing of paying compensation as of the date of the by-law, or, at least, as of the date of the registration. But an \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d in the sense in which the words are used in s. 351, does not, in itself, commit the municipality to take the property or to pay compensation for it. We assume that, in such a case, the parties interested may insist upon arbitration, but, unless, under the authority of by\u2011law, the Corporation has entered on or made use of the property in the sense of s. 351, then the \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d can be repealed at any time before the award is made (s. 351 (2)); and even when an award has been pronounced, the corporation is not bound to acquire the property, or to pay compensation on the footing of having acquired it, except by force of a by-law accepting and adopting the award. A by-law which, in the sense mentioned, is simply an \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d not only is not, in itself, an acquisition of the property; does not, in itself, authorize such an acquisition on the terms set forth in an award, in the absence of a fresh by\u2011law adopting such award. Such a by-law, therefore, has not the effect of a notice to treat under other systems of expropriation, under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, for example; and one may incur some risk of misleading oneself, if one resort to supposed analogies in proceedings under other statutes, and in decisions in respect of such proceedings, for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of the parties, under the compulsory clauses of the Municipal Act.\nWhere the Corporation proceeds under its compulsory powers alone, and the initiating by-law is an \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d simply, no act or proceeding on the part of the persons interested in the property can have the effect of binding the corporation to acquire the land. There must, in addition, we repeat, be an \u201centry on\u201d or use made of the property, as contemplated by s. 351, under the authority of by-law, or a further by-law adopting an award, or an agreement between the corporation and the parties interested settling the amount of the compensation.\nNow, the by-law of November 2nd professes to \u201cexpropriate\u201d simpliciter. \u201cTake\u201d adds nothing to \u201cexpropriate\u201d in view of the definition of \u201cexpropriate\u201d in s. 337 (a). We agree with the view expressed by Meredith, C.J.C.P., in Re City of Toronto and Grosvenor Street Presbyterian Church Trustees[9] to the effect that the intention to grant authority to \u201center on\u201d or \u201cmake use\u201d of the land must be expressed or given by implication in a by-law. Here, such power is not given in express terms, and we see no sufficient reason for implying it. Indeed, it should be observed that the \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d professes to expropriate the whole of the westerly forty feet of a certain lot 43, while the land with which we are concerned, and which it is contended was taken by the by-law, is only part of the property described in it,\u2014something between one quarter and one half of it. We cannot think that this by-law, in itself, authorizes\u2014by implication\u2014the officials of the corporation, without a further by-law, to commit the corporation to the taking of this fraction of the land, the whole of which, we must assume, was required for the purposes of the scheme, by entering upon or making use of it without having arranged or ascertained the terms upon which the residue of the land involved in the scheme could be acquired. In our opinion, the \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d had not the effect of authorizing the officials of the corporation to do any act or take any proceeding which would deprive the corporation of the benefit of the locus poenitentiae provided for by s. 351.\nWe turn now to the immediate question. An \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d having been passed, which in itself did not bind the Corporation to acquire the property, which could not be converted into a binding obligation to acquire it by any act or proceeding of the parties interested in it, and which, therefore, in itself, did not constitute an acquisition or authorize the officials of the Corporation to effect an acquisition: did that by-law operate to empower the Council, to fasten such an obligation upon the Corporation, and to effect such an acquisition, by resolution alone?\nThere are two grounds upon which this question must, we think, be answered in the negative. First, the amount of compensation to be paid is frequently the most important element entering into the considerations which influence the decision of public authorities in respect of the acquisition of lands for public purposes; and where there is a proposal to acquire land for a public park, or for the pur- poses of a public park, under s. 396 (45), the most weighty consideration would, probably, in most cases be this element of cost. The magnitude of the compensation to be paid seems to be so radical a matter, and the settlement of it, therefore, so important a step in the process of acquiring lands under s. 396 (45), as to justify, in our opinion, the conclusion that the authority to assent to such an agreement must proceed from a by-law enacted under that clause. To hold that a simple \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d, where there is no express or implied authority by by\u2011law to settle the compensation, creates such authority by force of the statute, would, we think, postulate an intention out of harmony with that manifested by the enacments of s. 351, which (in such circumstances) so carefully protects the interests of the ratepayers by making adoption by by-law a condition of the efficacy of an award of the arbitrators.\nThe second ground is that the power to settle compensation by agreement is one of those powers contemplated by s. 258 (1). It might with some force be argued that the transaction under consideration in this appeal was, in its true character, a purchase; that the acquisition was a voluntary acquisition; that the \u201cexpropriating by-law\u201d was nothing more than a negotiating instrumentality of not much greater efficacy than the existence of the power itself to expropriate. But we do not proceed upon that ground. The power to create a binding contractual obligation fixing the amount of the compensation to be paid in circumstances such as those under review is, we think, clearly ejusdem generis with the power to acquire by purchase; a power which, as we have seen, can only be executed by by-law.\nWe think the appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.M.

In determining the damages to the purchaser of a tractor against the vendor, for what was held to be a complete failure of the tractor in respect of the fulfilment of certain warranties as to its performance, it was held that, prima facie, the loss incurred by the purchaser amounted to the full purchase price; and that it was incumbent upon the vendor to adduce evidence in support of its contention that the damages so measured should be reduced by reason of the possession of the tractor of some merchantable value (establishment of the amount of that merchantable value not being upon the purchaser). The judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1933] 2 W.W.R. 567; [1933] 4 D.L.R. 303, holding that the purchaser by his use of the tractor had lost his right to return it, but allowing him damages for the amount of the full purchase price, was affirmed in the result.\nThe judgment of this Court in Nolan v. Emerson-Branting ham Implement Co. ([1921] 2 W.W.R. 416; 60 Can.

Defendant was prepared to pay for the disc but pleaded tender before action. He asked for an order cancelling the notes, and alternatively, \"if the said conditions are to be treated as warranties,\" he claimed damages to the extent of the price of the tractor, and for the use of extra fuel and oil and for loss of time. Plaintiff denied defendant's said allegations.\nThe action was tried before Tweedie J., who found that the tractor did not comply with the representations made by the plaintiff's agent on the sale, and further it was not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was intended; that, notwithstanding a clause of the agreement limiting the representations to those in the agreement, the plaintiff was bound by the verbal representations (not expressed in the agreement) of its agent (The Farm Machinery Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 152, s. 4); that, while defendant did not strictly comply with the provisions of the clause of the agreement as to testing and giving notice, plaintiff was not prejudiced thereby as it had actual notice and waived strict compliance; that the retention of the machine for 16 months was not, under all the circumstances, unreasonable, and plaintiff acquiesced in such retention in its endeavours to so adjust it that it would operate in the manner and do the work that it was represented that it would; that, the tractor not fulfilling the representation made concerning it, and that provided by statute, defendant was justified in not accepting it, other than for the purpose of testing it, and acted within his rights in returning it to plaintiff in whom the title still remained; that there was no legal tender of payment for the disc. He held that, there being a total failure of consideration as to the tractor, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for it and, to the extent of its price, $1,400, the plaintiff's claim should be dismissed. He gave judgment to plaintiff for the price of the disc, $340, and interest.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Harvey C.J.A., in delivering the judgment of the majority of the court, said:\nWith all respect I find myself unable to accept the conclusion of the learned trial Judge that the defendant did not accept the tractor and was entitled to return it. The time that he retained at is not of so much importance as the work he made it perform. He was not merely testing it after each effort by plaintiff's expert to make it perform satisfactorily to see if it would perform satisfactorily but he was actually continuing to do his work on hundreds of acres of land though it did not do it satisfactorily.\n* * * I think, therefore, the defendant's remedy is by way of damages and not by way of rescission or rejection of the tractor. And I do not think he is barred by the clause of the agreement which says that \"The purchaser agrees not to bring any suit for breach of warranty or plead any alleged breach of warranty as a defence or by way of set off after one year from the date of delivery of the machine to him.\" He is not setting up a breach of warranty but is claiming damages for breach of a condition, it being too late to resort to it for other remedy, and it does not make it a warranty because he relies on it as on a warranty. If it were not so it would be necessary to consider whether under the facts in evidence the Court would hold the clause reasonable under the authority of The Farm Machinery Act.\nThe situation then becomes the same as it was in the case in this Court of Nolan v. Emerson-Brantingham Implement Co.\nIn that case the trial Judge, Stuart J., held that it was too late for rescission which was claimed but held that \"the tractors were practically [i.e., for practical purposes on a large farm] valueless\", and he awarded damages in the full purchase price of the tractors though they still remained in the possession of the purchaser.\nOn appeal[2], this Division reduced the damages, being of opinion that the tractors could not be said to be valueless and were still the property of the purchaser.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada[3], the judgment of the trial Judge was restored. Anglin J. (as he then was) at p. 419 says: \"No doubt the 'L' tractors did some useful work while operated by the appellant. But it sufficiently appeared that they could not be profitably used for the purposes for which he purchased them upon evidence accepted by the learned trial Judge as worthy of credence\".\nIn the present case the learned trial Judge has found that there was a total failure of consideration, in other words, that the tractor was valueless to the defendant. There is undoubtedly evidence to support his finding and in view of the decision in the Nolan case, I do not see how we can reverse it and as the tractor is in the possession of the plaintiffs and no claim is made by the defendant in respect of it we are not met with the difficulty presented in this respect in that case.\nI feel myself bound, therefore, to accept his conclusion in substance.\nI think in form, however, there should be judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount claimed and that there should be judgment on the counterclaim for so much of the amount of the claim as relates to the price of the tractor. The plaintiffs should have the costs of the claim with only the nominal costs of the trial since the only ground of controversy in which they succeed is on the question of tender. The defendant should have the costs of the counterclaim including costs of discovery and the general costs of the trial.\nI see no reason for differing from the learned trial Judge in dismissing the defendant's other claim for damages. He certainly had enough value from the use of the tractor to offset any extra expense and loss of time occasioned.\nAs substantial success is with the respondent I would give him the costs of the appeal.\nMcGillivray J.A., dissenting, held that the Appellate Division might not now assess the defendant's damages, for breach of condition, in the full amount of the purchase price. In discussing the judgment at trial, he observed that, while the trial judge did find that there was a total failure of consideration as alleged in the defence, yet an examination of the judgment as a whole showed that the trial judge did not find as a fact that the tractor was valueless either to the defendant or to anyone else; the trial judge's judgment turned upon non-acceptance and could not in any sense be construed as an assessment of damages; it followed that the Nolan case, supra, in which damages were fully assessed, had no application. After discussing the Nolan case, and distinguishing it from the present case, he said:\nI make these observations concerning the Nolan case because that case was so much discussed in the course of argument, but whether I be right or wrong in the view I take of the Nolan case, it is enough to say that the learned trial Judge has found that there has been breach of conditions of purchase and that the defendant is therefore entitled to such damages as he may establish that he is lawfully entitled to, before a trial Judge, and that the learned trial Judge in this case, not having directed his mind to damages, it is impossible to say what evidence he would have believed with respect thereto, and so in my view the proper course for this Court to pursue is to set aside the judgment dismissing the counterclaim and to direct an assessment of damages, * * *\nThe formal judgment of the Appellate Division adjudged that the plaintiff recover the sums claimed and interest (amounting in all to $2,061.07), and that the defendant recover damages on his counterclaim for $1,400 (the amount of the price of the tractor) and interest (amounting in all to $1,670.10); that plaintiff recover the costs of the claim with only the nominal costs of the trial, and that defendant recover the costs of the counterclaim, including costs of discovery and the general costs of the trial; and that defendant recover his costs in the appeal.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from that part of the judgment of the Appellate Division by which it was adjudged that defendant recover as damages on his counterclaim the sum of $1,670.10 (and the costs awarded him) and from the assessment only of the said damages. The defendant cross-appealed, asking, in the event that the Supreme Court of Canada varied or disallowed the judgment for damages awarded him by the Appellate Division, that that part of the judgment of the Appellate Division which held that he had accepted the tractor be reversed and set aside and that the finding of the trial judge be restored, and plaintiff's claim (as to the tractor) be dismissed. Each party obtained leave, to appeal and cross-appeal respectively, from the Appellate Division.\nW. H. McLaws for the appellant.\nM. E. Moscovich for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014We do not differ from the conclusion of the Appellate Division that the respondent had by his use of the machinery lost his right to return it. It is unnecessary to discuss the reasons for this view, as counsel for the respondent in this Court was content to accept the judgment below.\nThe sole question, therefore, concerns the amount of damages to which the respondent is entitled. The learned trial judge found that\nthe tractor delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendant did not comply with the representations * * * as alleged in the statement of claim, and further it was not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was intended.\nThe \"representations as alleged in the statement of claim\" are the representations set forth in paragraph one of the counterclaim which is in these words:\nThe defendant says that on or about the 25th day of April the plaintiff's agent came and represented to him that he had a Wallace tractor \"which will put a 8\u00bd ft. plough in high gear and also a 3 Bottom Breaking Plough, that it would burn distillate, that the tractor would function better than the defendant's Hart Parr tractor and would save the defendant $250 on the year's use and run.\nThere is some evidence that the tractor, although useless for the purposes for which it was purchased, had some merchantable value, and the appellants contend that it was incumbent upon the respondent to establish that value in order to determine the amount of the damages to which he was entitled.\nWe cannot accept this view. Having regard to the nature of the warranties and the complete failure of the tractor in respect of the fulfilment of the warranties, which, the evidence, accepted by the learned trial judge, discloses, we think that, prima facie, the loss incurred by the respondent amounted to the full purchase price; and that it was incumbent upon the appellants to adduce evidence in support of their contention that the damages so measured should be reduced by reason of the possession of the tractor of some merchantable value.\nWe cannot agree with the interpretation by the Appellate Division of the decision in this Court in Nolan v. Emerson-Brantingham Implement Co.(1). There the trial judge held that in respect of the tractors (model \"L\") which he found had no value for the purposes for which they were bought, and had also no merchantable value, no diminution of damages could be allowed. A critical examination of the judgments shews that a majority of this Court accepted the view that on this ground the learned trial judge was right in assessing the damages in respect of these tractors at the amounts paid for them. This was really the basis of the decision in this Court.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1933] 2 W.W.R. 567; [1933] 4 D.L.R. 303.\n[2] 15 Alta.

C.R. 141, holding that plaintiff\u2019s patent (relating to improvements in coffin handles) was valid and had been infringed by defendant, was affirmed.\nIt was held that the construction invented, whereby a certain method of locking was made possible, was novel and ingenious; that the advance upon the prior art, and the inventive ingenuity in the discovery, were sufficient to make it good subject matter of a patent.\nAs to infringement, it was held (distinguishing P. & M. Company v. Canada Machinery Corporation Ltd., [1926] Can. S.C.R. 105, and Gillette Safety Razor Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Pal Blade Corporation Ltd., [1933] Can. S.C.R. 142) that, even assuming that the pivoting means used by defendant were not precisely and exactly covered by the claims of the patent, the article placed on the market by defendant embodied the principle itself of the invention in question; defendant had taken that which constituted the patentable article in the inventor\u2019s disclosure; at best, defendant had borrowed the essence of the patented structure with a small variation in its unimportant features or its non-essential elements.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the plaintiff\u2019s patent in question (relating to improvements in coffin handles) was valid and had been infringed by the defendant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nO. M Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the appellant.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is an action for the infringement of a patent relating to improvements in coffin handles which was granted on November 25, 1919 (No. 194,209) to one Gustav C. Pahlow and assigned on March 7, 1924, to the plaintiff. The action was tried before the President of the Exchequer Court who, on April 8, 1933, held the patent valid and infringed. The judgment granted the usual relief by way of injunction and damages. From it the defendant appeals, contending that the patent is not valid and that, even if it were, there was no infringement of it.\nAlthough before the Exchequer Court, the invalidity of the patent was urged on several particulars of objection, the appellant in this Court limited its defence on that branch of the case to one contention only, viz., that the patent in suit was void because, having regard to the state of the art, the advance, if any, therein disclosed was not sufficient to be regarded as an invention in the legal sense or, in other words, that the patent ought to be set aside for want of subject-matter.\nIt is essential, therefore, to appreciate clearly what the respondent claims to be his invention. And that is to be gathered from the specification. The invention is said to relate to new and useful improvements in handles adaptable for use on caskets and other receptacles. The handle described in the patent consists of two members: the plate or base, which is attached to the side of the receptacle by means of screws, and the \u201cgrip\u201d, which is the portion of the handle grasped by the hand in lifting the receptacle.\nThe device forming the subject-matter of the specification\naims to provide novel means whereby, when the grip portion of the handle is raised, a part of the grip will be distorted or bent, so as to form a permanent pivotal connection between the grip and the base member of the handle.\nThe specification then proceeds to describe the device, \u201cthe combination and arrangement of parts\u201d and \u201cthe details of (its) construction\u201d by way of reference to \u201cthe accompanying drawings\u201d.\nThe base member is preferably made out of metal. It has a semi-circular opening across which a pivot bar extends. The grip\nmay be variously constructed, without jeopardizing the utility of the invention. As shown, but not necessarily, the grip is trough-shaped in cross section, and is provided at its lower end with a tongue having a reverse bent. Ears project inwardly from the side portions of the grip, and engage the bent of the tongue to hold the tongue about a side bar.\nIn the side walls of the grip, at the upper end thereof, slots are formed, the slots denning bendable tongues having depending lugs. On its top, and near to its upper end, the grip may be supplied with a transverse rib.\nHaving thus described the construction of the handle, the specification indicates how it operates. The upper end of the grip is inserted into the opening of the base member, the pivot bar being received in the slots; and when the grip is raised and \u201cfulcrums\u201d on the pivot bar, the bendable tongues at the upper end of the grip, being inside the base or plate, engage the latter at the lower edge of the opening and they are bent upwardly at their free ends, thereby diminishing the width of the slots, at the inner ends thereof, or, in effect, closing them so that, although the grip may still be swung upwardly and downwardly as occasion may demand, it cannot be retracted out of the plate\u2019s opening or be removed from the pivot bar. It is permanently assembled with the pivot bar and, therefore, with the base member.\nIn practical operation, the upper end of the grip (having the bendable tongues) simply is inserted into the opening of the plate. The lower end of the grip is raised, whereupon the grip will be \u201csecurely but pivotally assembled\u201d with the plate.\nIf the transverse rib has been supplied on the top and near to the upper end of the grip, as alternately suggested, it will, when the grip is raised and in use, bear against the base member above the opening and, co-operating with the pivot bar, receive a portion of the weight of the receptacle. If the bendable tongues have \u201cdepending lugs\u201d, the latter will engage the plate at the lower edge of the opening and further help in bending the tongues. One other point only need be mentioned. The specification states it should be\nunderstood that, within the scope of what is claimed, changes in the precise embodiment of the invention shown can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.\nAnd now, here are the claims:\n1. A handle comprising a base member having an opening and provided with a pivot bar extended across the opening and a grip insertible into the opening and having a slot receiving the pivot bar, the slot defining a bendable finger in the grip, the finger co-operating with the base member at the lower edge of the opening, when the grip is raised, to secure a bending of the finger, a partial closing of the slot, and a permanent pivotal mounting of the grip on the pivot bar.\n2. A handle comprising a base member having an opening and provided with a pivot bar extended across the opening and a grip insertible into the opening and having a slot receiving the pivot bar, the slot defining a bendable finger in the grip, the finger having a lug adapted to engage the base member at the lower edge of the opening, the finger and the lug co-operating with the base member, when the grip is raised, to secure a bending of the finger, a partial closing of the slot, and a permanent pivotal mounting of the grip on the bar.\nThe only difference between the two claims is the lug adapted to the bendable finger, which is mentioned in the second claim and is not mentioned in the first one.\nIt will therefore appear that the thing or combination which the inventor regarded as new, and for which he claimed \u201can exclusive property and privilege\u201d (Patent Act, s. 14), is a handle comprising a base member and a grip member. The base member must have an opening into which the grip is insertible. The base member is provided with a pivot bar extended across the opening. The grip has a slot receiving the pivot bar; and that slot defines a bendable finger.\nSuch is what we would call the constructional part of the specification, and it must have been evident to persons having the technical skill and knowledge, to whom, after all, claims of this nature are primarily addressed (Osram Lamp Works Ltd. v. Pope\u2019s Electric Lamp Co. Ltd[2])\u2014 it must have been evident that, having regard to the state of the art as disclosed in the evidence, there was no novelty in the integers of the combination so far enumerated.\nBut the claims proceed to say that the bendable finger co-operates\nwith the base member at the lower edge of the opening, when the grip is raised, to secure a bending of the finger, a partial closing of the slot, and a permanent pivotal mounting of the grip on the pivot bar;\nand there lies the gist of the invention. The article thus described is a construction which will permit the permanent assembly of the two parts of the handle by merely \u201craising\u201d the grip. The principle disclosed in the claims is the arrangement of the bendable finger in such a way that, in the words of the inventor at the trial, it will \u201chook-up automatically\u201d by the mere upward lift of the grip. That is an interpretation of the claims to which, in our view, the respondent is entitled upon a fair reading of the whole of the specification (Lister v. Norton[3]). In the light of that specification, the words \u201cthe finger cooperating\u201d in the claims may reasonably be construed as meaning: \u201ccapable of co-operating\u201d. In that sense and contrary to what was urged by the appellant, the invention does not consist solely in a mode of attachment or in a method of locking the parts, to which, when the finger is once bent or when the closing of the slot is once permanently secured, the claims no longer apply. The invention is not precisely the method of locking. It is rather the particular construction whereby that method is made possible, the arrangement whereby the bendable finger will close by the mere raising of the grip and will procure \u201ca permanent pivotal mounting of the grip\u201d on the base member. No other two such parts had ever been constructed before. It was a combination which appeared to the learned President of the Exchequer Court \u201cquite novel and ingenious indeed\u201d; and we agree with his decision.\nThere was nothing similar in the prior art. Fletcher (U.S. patent no. 438,349) disclosed a handle built up of a knuckle and slot made to receive a pintle and drilled transversely for the insertion of a fastening pin. It was the clear intention of that inventor that the two parts of the handle should be held together by the pin and that the insertion of this pin should constitute a separate operation. No way was provided in this patent whereby the tongues defining the slot could be bent. In fact, no thought of bending the tongues was in the mind of the Inventor.\nRaymond (U.S. patent 1027067) suggested a stamped or pressed metal handle whereof the prongs were bendable; but he provided for bending them by tool or by machine; and, assuming the device he disclosed could be made to work automatically\u2014an assumption not warranted by the evidence\u2014it is abundantly clear that no such idea ever entered his mind. His device was conceived and based on an entirely different principle. As was said by Parker J. (afterward Lord Parmoor) in Flour Oxydizing Co. Ltd. v. Carr & Co. Ltd.[4]:\nIt is not enough to prove that the apparatus described in an earlier specification could have been used to produce this or that result. It must also be shown that the specification contains clear and unmistakable directions so to use it.\nWe are not mentioning these anterior publications for the purpose of negativing anticipation. Counsel for the appellant expressly declared he was not relying on anticipation. We are referring to these former patents (the only ones produced at the trial), in order to show the state of the art and the extent of the advance made by Pahlow, the inventor of the respondent\u2019s device. He eliminated the use of the fastening pin or of the tool operation or of the machine operation. Indeed, he did away with the method of manually connecting the parts of the handle. He devised an article which is useful, practical, of manifest ingenuity (Pneumatic Tyre Company v. Casswell[5]) and producing a beneficial result. Though simple, his device cannot be said to have been obvious. Raymond applied his mind to the same subject, and he never thought of the use to which the pliable material could be put as it was by Pahlow. Raymond\u2019s patent issued seven years before Pahlow\u2019s and yet Pahlow\u2019s idea never occurred to the skilled craftsmen working on these or similar handles, although the bendable tongue or finger had been suggested by Raymond. The merit of Pahlow\u2019s patent is not so much in the means of carrying out the idea as in conceiving the idea itself (Fawcett v. Homan[6]. He produced an improved thing as the result of the ingenious application of a known elastic material (Gadd and Mason v. Mayor, etc., of Manchester[7]); and, to our mind, there was just as much inventive ingenuity in his discovery as there was in the adoption of tubular wire braids in making bristles, held by the House of Lords to have been good subject-matter of a patent (Thomson v. American Braided Wire Company[8]), the result attained being a complete article, effective and capable of being assembled cheaply and expeditiously. The advance may have been slight\u2014although, as pointed out by Fletcher Moulton on Patents (p. 22), \u201cthe general tendency of the mind is to minimize the difficulty of a discovery after it has been made\u201d \u2014but there was a real inventive step upon \u201cwhat went before\u201d; and the new result which obtained was of sufficient importance to make it a genuine invention. It follows that the patent should be held good and valid.\nWe also agree with the learned President that infringement has been established.\nInfringement is a matter depending on the construction of the claims, for there it is that the inventor is required to state \u201cthe things or combinations * * * in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege\u201d (Patent Act, s. 14 (1) (c)). The appellant\u2019s formation is the same as that disclosed in the patent in suit, with the exception that the pivoting means in the appellant\u2019s structure do not make use of the continuous bar extending across the semi-circular opening in the plate or base member as described in the specification. Instead of the pivot bar running right across the opening, there are two holes \u201cabout which the tongues in the sides of the grip rotate, when they are closed by raising the handle to bend the tongues.\u201d\nIt so happened that, in 1925, the patentee abandoned the pivot bar, in the manufacture of the base member, and replaced it by two holes in the lower wall for pivoting the grip. And the appellant copied exactly the device described in the patent including the modification brought about by the patentee in 1925. The appellant has made, constructed, used and vended the identical article turned out by the respondent since that date.\nWe would feel disposed to hold, as suggested by one of the expert witnesses, that the pivoting means now adopted by the patentee, and notwithstanding the modification, conform, strictly speaking, with the description of the specification. We hardly believe that, in the premises, even in respect of \u201cthe pivot bar extended across the opening\u201d, the slight change that was made may really be called a departure from the fair construction of the claims within the meaning of the patent law. But having indicated, as we have in the first part of this judgment, how we think Pahlow\u2019s claims ought to be construed, to wit: as disclosing an invention, not of a method of pivoting or locking, but of a noval construction or arrangement capable of being assembled automatically and of securing a permanent pivotal mounting by the mere raising of the grip,\u2014the consequence follows that the particular pivot bar is not of the essence of the patented combination. Indeed, it was an old element of the prior art.\nWhat the appellant did\u2014and in that his infringement truly consists\u2014was to take the idea which formed the real subject-matter of the invention. It does not matter whether he also adopted the substitution of the two holes for the bar in the pivoting means. The precise form of these means was immaterial In the language of the patent, they could be changed \u201cwithout departing from the spirit of the invention.\u201d\nThat is the essential distinction which must be made between this case and those of The P. & M. Company v. Canada Machinery Corporation Limited[9] and of Gillette Safety Razor Company of Canada, Limited v. Pal Blade Corporation, Limited[10] relied on by the appellant. In the P. & M. case9, the appellant\u2019s invention was one of mechanical detail. It was held that the use of a different method not embodying the specified mechanical contrivance did not fall within the ambit of the claims. In the Gillette case10, the patentee had claimed the blade as a subordinate invention in addition to the main or principal invention consisting in the complete safety razor. The subject-matter, if any, of the subordinate invention was found to consist in the particular form and position of the holes in the blade; and it was held no infringement to have punched in a razor blade holes of a different form and in a different position. In such cases, so it was decided, the patentee must make plain the metes and bounds of his invention, and he will be held strictly to the thing in which he has claimed an exclusive property and privilege. In both cases, it was found there was no infringement because the alleged infringing article was not the precise mechanism claimed for by the patentee. In this case, the situation is entirely different. Assuming, but not admitting, that the pivoting means used by the appellant are not precisely and exactly covered by the claims of the patent, the article placed on the market by the appellant embodies the principle itself of Pahlow\u2019s invention. The appellant has taken that which constitutes the patentable article in Pahlow\u2019s disclosure. Both handles are in all material respects the same.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel was able to point to only three differences:\n(a) the substitution of the holes for the pivot bar, and that has already been discussed.\n(b) the dependent lug on the bendable finger; and that is not mentioned in claim 1, so that, at all events, it would not affect the question of infringement.\n(c) the shoulder or transverse rib on the top and near the upper end of the grip; and that is given only as optional in the specification. It is an immaterial part of the mechanism.\nAt best, the appellant has borrowed the essence of the patented structure with a small variation in its unimportant features or its non-essential elements; and we would say, as Lord Davey, in Consolidated Car Heating Company v. Came[11], that, according to any fair interpretation of the language of the specification, he has taken, in substance, the pith and marrow of the invention, with all its essential and characteristic features, except in details which could be varied without detriment to the successful working of it. There is no difference in the main elements of the two structures. There is no difference in the operation. Both perform the same function in the same way. Above all, \u201cthe spirit of the invention\u201d was infringed. It does not matter, of course, that, by chance, the appellant failed to appreciate the full value of the invention and, in assembling the two parts of the infringing handle, he bent the finger by mechanical operation, instead of accomplishing the same object by the simple method of raising the grip. We are no more impressed than the trial judge by the contention that the mechanical operation, in this case, would make for more uniformity.

On the 2nd of March, 1903, a resolution was adopted by a municipality later on annexed to the city respondent declaring the lands of the appellant company and all their existing and future buildings and machinery exempt from ordinary annual municipal and business taxes \u201cduring the twenty-five years which commenced to run on the first of September last, 1902,\u201d accordingly until the first of September, 1927. On the 11th August, 1927, the city respondent adopted a by-law which is captioned \u201cBy-law imposing a tax on the immoveable property of the City for the year 1927\u201d. After reciting the amount required for the purposes of the municipality for the \u201ccurrent year,\u201d the total valuation of all taxable immoveable property of the city subject to the general property tax, the amount of exemptions, and the balance required after taking into account the revenues derived from other sources, the by-law imposed a general property tax of l 36\/100 of 1% on all the taxable immoveables of the city of Lachine (une taxe est par le pr\u00e9sent impos\u00e9e et sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e * * *) according to their real value as set forth on the valuation roll in force, \u201cin order to provide for the general administration expenses of the city for the current year, and for the amortization of its funded debt\u201d. The by-law likewise provided that as soon as possible after the coming into force thereof the secretary-treasurer of the city shall prepare the collection roll of the general and special taxes imposed by the city and shall give public notice of its preparation and deposit as required by law. This by-law was published on the 12th day of August, 1927, and came into force on the 27th of the same month, at a time when the twenty-five year period of exemption, from September 1, 1902, had not yet expired. The collection roll under the said by-law however was not prepared and published until the 10th day of September, 1927, and the taxes became exigible on the 30th of September, 1927, after the expiry of the period of exemption. The city respondent urged that it was the collection roll which created the tax, while the appellant company alleged that it was the by-law imposing it.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 54 K.B. 414), that the appellant company was entitled to claim exemption from taxes so imposed. A municipal tax is formally created at the date the by-law imposing it is adopted and not at the time of the entry into force of the collection roll. The by-law of the 11th of August, 1927, imposing taxes for that year did not affect the property of the appellant company, as it had been adopted before the expiry of the exemption. Consequently the collection roll could not validly impose taxes which were unauthorized by the by-law; and the act of the secretary-treasurer in including in the collection roll the property of the appellant company as subject to taxation was therefore illegal and ultra vires.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court, Montreal, Rivet J.[2] and maintaining the city respondent\u2019s action for the recovery of municipal taxes.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. W. F. Chipman K.C. and J. C. Macfarlane K.C. for the appellant.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and A. S. Pelletier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014La cit\u00e9 de Lachine a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de la compagnie appelante un certain montant de taxes municipales pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1927. La compagnie a admis qu\u2019elle devait une partie de ce montant, et elle l\u2019a pay\u00e9e. Pour le surplus, elle a invoqu\u00e9 une exemption octroy\u00e9e par des r\u00e9solutions en date des 16 ao\u00fbt et 29 septembre 1900 et du 2 mars 1903.\nCes r\u00e9solutions furent adopt\u00e9es par une corporation municipale dont le territoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Lachine; et, lors de l\u2019annexion, la cit\u00e9 fut tenue de respecter cette exemption.\nEn plus, l\u2019exemption fut originairement accord\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes que l\u2019appelante; mais il est admis que cette derni\u00e8re est leur ayant droit et qu\u2019elle peut r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019exemption. Il est donc inutile de tenir compte des diff\u00e9rences de personnes ou de municipalit\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de l\u2019exemption. Pour les faits de la discussion, l\u2019on peut envisager la situation comme si la cit\u00e9 de Lachine avait elle-m\u00eame consenti l\u2019exemption \u00e0 la compagnie Allis-Chalmers. Nous adopterons cette ligne de conduite au cours du jugement pour plus de clart\u00e9 et de simplicit\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a l\u00e0-dessus qu\u2019un point qu\u2019il suffit de mentionner, c\u2019est que l\u2019exemption de taxes fut accord\u00e9e en vertu du code municipal et que la cit\u00e9 de Lachine est r\u00e9gie par la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes (1925, S.R.Q., c. 102); mais les parties sont d\u2019accord pour admettre que cela n\u2019affecte pas le litige.\nLes donn\u00e9es essentielles de la cause sont les suivantes:\nLe 16 ao\u00fbt 1900, une premi\u00e8re r\u00e9solution\nexempte par les pr\u00e9sentes du paiement des taxes municipales annuelles ordinaires, ainsi que du paiement des taxes d\u2019affaires, pour une p\u00e9riode de vingt-cinq ans, les terrains (en question), ainsi que les usines et machineries qui y seront construites le ou avant le premier jour de septembre 190.2 (moyennant certaines conditions dont nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous occuper, parce qu\u2019il est admis qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies). Cette exemption ne devra avoir effet qu\u2019\u00e0 dater du jour que ces manufactures ou usines seront en op\u00e9ration dans les conditions ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es.\nLe 29 septembre 1900, une deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9solution annule et remplace la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019en citer le texte, dont la partie se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la question sous discussion est identique \u00e0 celle de la r\u00e9solution ant\u00e9rieure. Entre la raison d \u00eatre de cette nouvelle r\u00e9solution et le pr\u00e9sent litige il n\u2019y a aucune relation.\nLe 2 mars 1903, rapport est fait \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 que, le 1er septembre 1902, les conditions exig\u00e9es pour l\u2019octroi de l\u2019exemption avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies par la compagnie, et il est, en cons\u00e9quence, r\u00e9solu que le terrain et les usines ou manufactures et leurs d\u00e9pendances (d\u00e9crites dans la r\u00e9solution et qui font l\u2019objet du litige)\nsoient et sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes exempts des taxes municipales annuelles ordinaires et des taxes d\u2019affaires pendant les vingt-cinq ans \u00e0 commencer \u00e0 courir le 1er septembre dernier 1902.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question furent d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u201cexemptes du paiement des taxes\u201d, suivant le texte des deux premi\u00e8res r\u00e9solutions, ou \u201cexemptes des taxes\u201d, suivant le texte de la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9solution. Nous signalons cette divergence dans la phras\u00e9ologie uniquement parce qu\u2019il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat lors de l\u2019audition, mais nous ne pensons pas qu\u2019elle ait d\u2019importance, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le texte de l\u2019article 943 du code municipal en vigueur lors de l\u2019octroi de l\u2019exemption. La version fran\u00e7aise de cet article emploie l\u2019expression: \u201cexempter des taxes municipales\u201d, tandis que la version anglaise se sert des mots \u201cexempt from the payment of municipal taxes\u201d, ce qui semble indiquer que, dans l\u2019esprit du l\u00e9gislateur, les deux expressions sont \u00e9quivalentes.\nCe qui est important, c\u2019est que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s doivent avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019exemption \u201cpendant l\u00e8s vingt-cinq ans qui ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir le 1er septembre 1902\u201d; et, par cons\u00e9quent, jusqu\u2019au 1er septembre 1927.\nOr, voici maintenant ce qui a donn\u00e9 lieu aux difficult\u00e9s entre la cit\u00e9 et la compagnie:\nLe 11 ao\u00fbt 1927, la cit\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement (n\u00b0 443) imposant une taxe sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re de la cit\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1927. Ce r\u00e8glement a pour but de pourvoir aux \u201cd\u00e9penses pr\u00e9vues au budget pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale courante encourues ou \u00e0 encourir\u201d. Il mentionne le chiffre des d\u00e9penses ainsi pr\u00e9vues, de m\u00eame que le chiffre des recettes pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale courante provenant des taxes sp\u00e9ciales pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rents r\u00e8glements ou provenant de toutes autres sources \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019exception de la taxe fonci\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u201d. Il proc\u00e8de ensuite \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que \u201cl\u2019\u00e9va- luation de tous les biens immeubles imposables de la cit\u00e9 sujets \u00e0 la taxe fonci\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est de $17,402,222.40\u201d. Il ajoute que pour couvrir la balance des d\u00e9penses pr\u00e9vues pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e courante il faudra pr\u00e9lever $236,670.27; puis il statue et ordonne:\nArticle 1. Une taxe de un et trente-six centi\u00e8mes de un pour cent est par le pr\u00e9sent impos\u00e9e et sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur tous les immeubles imposables de la cit\u00e9 de Lachine suivant leur valeur r\u00e9elle, telle que port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur dans la cit\u00e9 pour pourvoir pour autant, aux d\u00e9penses g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019administration de la cit\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e courante et \u00e0 l\u2019amortissement de sa dette fond\u00e9e;\n* * *\nArticle 4. Aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur de ce r\u00e8glement, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9parera un r\u00f4le de perception des taxes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et sp\u00e9ciales impos\u00e9es par la cit\u00e9, et donnera l\u2019avis public de sa pr\u00e9paration et de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t tel que requis par la loi.\nIl est admis que, apr\u00e8s publication, ce r\u00e8glement est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 27 ao\u00fbt 1927.\nLe r\u00f4le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de perception fut compl\u00e9t\u00e9 et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de la cit\u00e9, et avis en fut donn\u00e9 le 10 septembre 1927.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, les personnes tenues au paiement de la somme mentionn\u00e9e dans ce r\u00f4le \u00e9taient requises d\u2019en payer le montant au bureau du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier dans les vingt jours qui suivaient la publication de cet avis (Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 540).\nLe r\u00e8glement imposant la taxe est donc venu en vigueur le 27 ao\u00fbt, avant l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode fix\u00e9e pour l\u2019exemption de taxes. Mais le r\u00f4le de perception n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9 que le 10 septembre et la taxe n\u2019est devenue exigible que le 30 septembre 1927, soit, dans chaque cas, apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019exemption. D\u2019o\u00f9 les pr\u00e9tentions respectives des parties.\nLa cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que c\u2019est le r\u00f4le de perception qui \u00e9tablit la taxe. Par suite, il en r\u00e9sulte, d\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, que la compagnie doit cette taxe qui serait post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la date d\u2019expiration de l\u2019exemption.\nLa compagnie pr\u00e9tend, au contraire, que la taxe est cr\u00e9\u00e9e, non pas par le r\u00f4le de perception, mais par le r\u00e8glement qui impose la taxe et qui sert de base \u00e0 ce r\u00f4le. D\u2019o\u00f9 elle conclut que la taxe est ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la date d\u2019expiration de l\u2019exemption et qu\u2019elle ne la doit pas.\nD\u00e8s l\u2019abord, il faut distinguer, semble-t-il, entre l\u2019obligation personnelle qui r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019imposition de la taxe, et le caract\u00e8re hypoth\u00e9caire qui lui est attribu\u00e9 par la loi. Les taxes municipales impos\u00e9es sur un terrain peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9es aussi bien du locataire, de l\u2019occupant, ou autre possesseur du terrain, que du propri\u00e9taire, lors m\u00eame que tel locataire, occupant, possesseur ou acqu\u00e9reur n\u2019est, pas inscrit sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation (Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 534). Aussi, le paiement d\u2019une taxe municipale peut-il \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9 par voie de poursuite ordinaire devant les tribunaux comp\u00e9tents (Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 546; code de proc\u00e9dure, art. 48 et suiv.; Galt v. Robert[3].\nMais les taxes municipales et leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats constituent, en outre, une cr\u00e9ance privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e exempte de la formalit\u00e9 de l\u2019enregistrement (art. 518), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que d\u00e8s que l\u2019obligation personnelle devient exigible, elle est rev\u00eatue par la loi du caract\u00e8re d\u2019un droit r\u00e9el; et, en outre des m\u00e9thodes sp\u00e9ciales de recouvrement pr\u00e9vues par les lois municipales (saisie et vente des meubles en vertu des articles 542 et suivants; ou vente des immeubles en vertu des articles 548 et suivants), il n\u2019y a pas de doute que la municipalit\u00e9 peut se pourvoir par le moyen de l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire.\nOn a donc pu d\u00e9cider que l\u2019acheteur d\u2019un immeuble \u00e9tait, par rapport \u00e0 son vendeur, le v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9biteur de la taxe municipale inscrite sur un r\u00f4le de perception, dont avis de d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait publi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la vente, quoique le r\u00e8glement imposant la taxe fut venu en vigueur avant la vente. Cette solution fut adopt\u00e9e dans un grand nombre d\u2019arr\u00eats, dont on nous a cit\u00e9 quelques-uns: Lunn v. Windsor Hotel[4]; Thibault v. Robinson[5]; Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques du S\u00e9minaire de Saint-Sulpice de Montr\u00e9al v. Masson[6]; Surprenant v. Brault[7].\nCes d\u00e9cisions proviennent de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1508 C.C., qui d\u00e9finit l\u2019obligation de garantie du vendeur \u00e0 raison de l\u2019immeuble qui a fait l\u2019objet de la vente. Il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que la taxe ne constituait un \u201cdroit existant\u201d ou une charge affectant l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019\u00e0 dater du moment o\u00f9 le montant de la taxe \u00e9tait devenu certain et d\u00e9termin\u00e9. Ce montant n\u2019est d\u00e9finitivement fix\u00e9 que par le r\u00f4le de perception et il n\u2019est exigible que \u201cdans les vingt jours qui suivent la publication\u201d de l\u2019avis de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ce r\u00f4le. Le privil\u00e8ge n\u2019affecte donc l\u2019immeuble que du moment o\u00f9 devient d\u00e9finitif le montant de la taxe qu\u2019il garantit. Jusque-l\u00e0, et, par cons\u00e9quent, lors de la vente, il n\u2019existait sur l\u2019immeuble aucune charge l\u2019affectant et dont le vendeur \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de garantir l\u2019acheteur.\nMais cette solution, qui peut s\u2019imposer entre vendeur et acheteur par application d\u2019un article du code civil, ne saurait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e dans la discussion des rapports entre une corporation municipale et son contribuable dans une cause de la nature de celle qui nous est soumise.\nD\u2019autre part, envisager l\u2019octroi de l\u2019exemption de taxes comme un contrat inviolable entre les parties, ainsi que l\u2019a fait le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, est \u00e9videmment une proposition dont les pr\u00e9misses ne peuvent \u00eatre discut\u00e9es et que la Cour du Banc du Roi n\u2019a pas un instant mis en doute. Mais cela ne nous rapproche pas de la solution qu\u2019il faut chercher; car il reste toujours \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e et l\u2019intention de ce contrat.\nIl se peut que l\u2019intention des parties contractantes, en stipulant une exemption de taxes pour une p\u00e9riode fixe d\u2019ann\u00e9es, soit que la personne exempt\u00e9e ne sera pas appel\u00e9e \u00e0 contribuer aux d\u00e9penses de la corporation municipale qui seront faites pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de cette p\u00e9riode d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Si le contrat est interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on, la pr\u00e9sente r\u00e9clamation de la cit\u00e9 est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019esprit du contrat, puisque le montant de taxes pour lequel elle poursuit couvre des d\u00e9penses encourues pendant la p\u00e9riode de l\u2019exemption.\nLa cit\u00e9 r\u00e9pond que, par ailleurs, si l\u2019on se reporte \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode fix\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1902, la compagnie n\u2019aurait pu \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer une taxe r\u00e9partie apr\u00e8s le 1er septembre 1902, quoique cette taxe e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e pour pourvoir aux d\u00e9penses encourues depuis le 1er janvier 1902 et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 des d\u00e9penses faites ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la date de d\u00e9part de l\u2019exemption.\nMais ce raisonnement nous para\u00eet tourner dans un cercle vicieux. En effet, il tient pour indiscutable, au commencement de l\u2019exemption, un point qui est exactement semblable \u00e0 celui qui est contest\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019exemption. La question de savoir si la compagnie e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer une taxe r\u00e9partie apr\u00e8s le 1er septembre 1902 pour des d\u00e9penses ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 cette date d\u00e9pend exactement de la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision que celle de savoir si elle peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 payer une taxe r\u00e9partie apr\u00e8s le 1er septembre 1927 pour des d\u00e9penses encourues pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019exemption. Dans un cas comme dans l\u2019autre, il faut d\u00e9cider si la taxe prend naissance lors de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du r\u00e8glement qui l\u2019impose, ou simplement lors de l\u2019avis de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du r\u00f4le de perception. En plus, si le contrat r\u00e9el est que la compagnie exempt\u00e9e ne doit en aucune fa\u00e7on contribuer aux d\u00e9penses qui sont faites par la municipalit\u00e9 pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019exemption, le raisonnement doit \u00eatre le m\u00eame pour le d\u00e9but et pour la fin de l\u2019exemption. De prime abord, comme l\u2019exemption commence seulement le 1er septembre 1902, on ne voit pas pourquoi l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1902 toute enti\u00e8re serait compt\u00e9e comme la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de vingt-cinq ans qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e (voir: La Communaut\u00e9 des Saints Noms de J\u00e9sus et Marie v. The Corporation of the village of Waterloo)[8]. En vertu de la loi, l\u2019ann\u00e9e financi\u00e8re de la municipalit\u00e9 commence le 1er janvier et se termine le 31 d\u00e9cembre de chaque ann\u00e9e (Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 484). Ici, l\u2019exemption ne concorde pas avec l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale, et les difficult\u00e9s qui en r\u00e9sultent sont exactement les m\u00eames au commencement comme \u00e0 l\u2019expiration des vingt-cinq ann\u00e9es convenues. Il est tr\u00e8s s\u00fbr que la compagnie a droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice int\u00e9gral de ces vingt-cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019exemption. Il est \u00e9galement certain qu\u2019en principe la taxe fonci\u00e8re ordinaire n\u2019est impos\u00e9e qu\u2019une fois par ann\u00e9e et est pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e, non pas exactement le 1er jour ou le dernier jour, mais au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale; et cette taxe est indivisible. Elle ne peut \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e ni \u00eatre pay\u00e9e jour par jour. Ainsi, du moins, l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi de Qu\u00e9bec, en 1884 (Hogan v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al)[9], et cette d\u00e9cision ne para\u00eet pas avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis mise en question.\nDans cette cause-ci, nous n\u2019avons m\u00eame pas la ressource de nous en rapporter \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les parties ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 leur contrat; car, par une curieuse co\u00efncidence, aucune taxe n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e ou pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e dans la municipalit\u00e9 en 1902; en sorte que l\u2019occasion ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e alors pour l\u2019une et l\u2019autre des parties de prendre position. Mais il en r\u00e9sulte au moins que l\u2019on ne peut pas dire que la compagnie a, comme question de fait, \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de vingt-cinq taxes annuelles ou que sa pr\u00e9tention actuelle \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 demander d\u2019\u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9e d\u2019une vingt-sixi\u00e8me taxe.\nToutes ces questions pr\u00e9sentent, dans la pratique, des difficult\u00e9s s\u00e9rieuses, que nous mentionnons parce qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battues devant nous et qu\u2019elles font l\u2019objet de la discussion dans les jugements qui nous sont soumis. Mais nous ne croyons pas n\u00e9cessaire de les trancher pour la d\u00e9cision de la pr\u00e9sente cause qui nous para\u00eet d\u00e9pendre du texte du r\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 443 qui a impos\u00e9 la taxe. En vertu de ce texte, \u201cune taxe * * * est par le pr\u00e9sent impos\u00e9e et sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur tous les biens imposables de la cit\u00e9\u201d.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un r\u00e8glement d\u2019emprunt pourvoyant une fois pour toutes \u00e0 l\u2019imposition d\u2019une taxe annuelle qui devra \u00eatre pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e d\u2019ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019amortissement de l\u2019emprunt. Il ne s\u2019agit pas, non plus, de l\u2019imposition d\u2019une taxe sp\u00e9ciale pour am\u00e9liorations locales et dont le paiement est r\u00e9parti en versements p\u00e9riodiques annuels.\nIl s\u2019agit de la taxe fonci\u00e8re que le conseil pouvait imposer et pr\u00e9lever pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1927 suivant le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation alors en vigueur en vertu de l\u2019article 521 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. Sans doute, on peut pr\u00e9tendre que la taxe n\u2019est pas rendue d\u00e9finitive\u2014et peut-\u00eatre n\u2019est-elle pas compl\u00e8te\u2014au moment o\u00f9 le r\u00e8glement qui la d\u00e9cr\u00e8te vient en vigueur et avant l\u2019avis de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du r\u00f4le de perception. Jusque-l\u00e0 on peut la d\u00e9crire comme une taxe en marche, et l\u2019on peut dire que l\u2019imposition comprend \u00e0 la fois l\u2019adoption du r\u00e8glement et la confection du r\u00f4le de perception qui a pour effet de fixer la dette individuelle de chaque contribuable. Il est de jurisprudence que cette taxe ne devient pas une cr\u00e9ance privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e grevant l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019elle affecte tant que le r\u00f4le de perception n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9. Avant cela, \u201cla taxe n\u2019est pas sp\u00e9cialement impos\u00e9e sur les immeubles des contribuables\u201d; bien plus, elle n\u2019est pas exigible, et il est certain que ces derniers ne doivent rien \u00e0 la corporation municipale.\nMais il est non moins certain que le conseil ne peut imposer et pr\u00e9lever annuellement la taxe fonci\u00e8re autrement que par un r\u00e8glement municipal. Cette taxe ne peut exister que suivant les donn\u00e9es du r\u00e8glement qui l\u2019impose. Elle doit \u00eatre le fait du conseil et non pas celui du secr\u00e9tairetr\u00e9sorier. Le r\u00f4le de perception est surtout un m\u00e9canisme de recouvrement n\u00e9cessairement bas\u00e9 sur le r\u00e8glement. Il est avant tout une op\u00e9ration math\u00e9matique. Il constitue le calcul fait par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du montant proportionnel d\u00fb par chaque contribuable des taxes \u201calors impos\u00e9es\u201d (art. 538) et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9es par le conseil. Le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier n\u2019a aucun pouvoir, sauf celui de faire ce calcul. Il ne peut r\u00e9sulter de son r\u00f4le aucune imposition qui ne trouverait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sa source et son autorisation dans le r\u00e8glement du conseil. Il est \u00e9vident que s\u2019il r\u00e9partissait la taxe sur un immeuble qui ne serait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 vis\u00e9 par le r\u00e8glement d\u2019imposition, l\u2019inscription de l\u2019immeuble sur le r\u00f4le de perception serait radicalement nulle et aucune charge valide n\u2019en pourrait r\u00e9sulter. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il faut donc avoir recours au r\u00e8glement pour savoir quels sont les immeubles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9s.\nOr, le r\u00e8glement qui nous est soumis en fait une imposition imm\u00e9diate (\u201cune taxe * * * est par le pr\u00e9sent impos\u00e9e\u201d). Il ajoute: \u201cet sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e\u201d. C\u2019est la partie qui concerne le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier et qui devra \u00eatre mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution au moyen du r\u00f4le de perception. Et l\u2019imposition imm\u00e9diate qui r\u00e9sulte du r\u00e8glement est faite\nsur tous les immeubles imposables de la cit\u00e9 de Lachine suivant leur valeur r\u00e9elle telle que port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur.\nCela veut dire: sur les immeubles imposables au moment de la confection du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation; ou, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, au moment de l\u2019adoption du r\u00e8glement d\u2019imposition.\nIl n\u2019y a pas dans la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes de d\u00e9finition des \u201cimmeubles imposables\u201d. On n\u2019y trouve qu\u2019une \u00e9num\u00e9ration des biens d\u00e9clar\u00e9s non imposables en vertu de la loi (art. 520). Il ne faut pas oublier, d\u2019ailleurs, que le droit d\u2019octroyer des exemptions de taxes n\u2019est plus autoris\u00e9 par la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La seule exception est que le conseil peut, par une r\u00e9solution, faire remise du paiement des taxes municipales aux personnes pauvres de la municipalit\u00e9 (art. 572).\nOr, forc\u00e9ment, un immeuble exempt de taxes n\u2019est pas un immeuble imposable pendant la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019exemption. Cet immeuble ne peut entrer en ligne de compte dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation municipale, ni par cons\u00e9quent figurer sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour former la valeur totale des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sujettes \u00e0 cotisation. Toute autre interpr\u00e9tation serait injuste pour les municipalit\u00e9s rurales dans la fixation de leur contribution au conseil de comt\u00e9. En outre, aux cr\u00e9anciers de la municipalit\u00e9 elle indiquerait de fa\u00e7on erron\u00e9e la valeur de leur gage; et, surtout, elle repr\u00e9senterait faussement aux pr\u00eateurs le montant r\u00e9el de leur garantie.\nLorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un emprunt projet\u00e9, la loi modifie le pouvoir d\u2019emprunt suivant la valeur r\u00e9elle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re imposable (comme, par exemple, dans l\u2019article 589). Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re imposable \u00e0 la date du r\u00e8glement d\u2019emprunt, quoique la taxe n\u00e9cessaire au paiement des int\u00e9r\u00eats et \u00e0 la formation du fonds d\u2019amortissement soit r\u00e9partie sur un grand nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir. Et il est certain que, m\u00eame dans ce cas, l\u2019\u00e9valuation qui limite le pouvoir d\u2019emprunt est l\u2019\u00e9valuation alors en vigueur; et, d\u00e8s lors, les biens imposables qui servent de base \u00e0 cette \u00e9valuation sont les biens imposables \u00e0 la date du r\u00e8glement. Ils ne comprennent donc pas les immeubles exempts de taxe \u00e0 cette date-l\u00e0.\nLes immeubles de la compagnie dont il s\u2019agit dans cette cause-ci \u00e9taient certainement exempts de taxes \u00e0 la date de l\u2019adoption du r\u00e8glement d\u2019imposition. Ils n\u2019entraient donc pas, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, dans la cat\u00e9gorie des immeubles imposables et ils ne sont pas compris parmi les immeubles sur lesquels la taxe a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e et sur lesquels le conseil a ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle serait pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e.\nNous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous demander si, en fait, ces immeubles figuraient sur le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la cit\u00e9 alors en vigueur. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019en pareil cas le fait seul de leur inscription sur le r\u00f4le ne les rendait pas imposables \u00e0 rencontre des r\u00e9solutions d\u2019exemption et du contrat entre les parties. C\u2019est une circonstance o\u00f9 le contribuable n\u2019est pas priv\u00e9 de ses droits par suite du fait qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est pas pourvu dans les d\u00e9lais de contestation du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, et o\u00f9 il peut toujours faire valoir ses pr\u00e9tentions en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation de la taxe (Hogan v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[10]; Shannon Realties Limited v. Ville de Saint-Michel)[11].\nLa cons\u00e9quence, c\u2019est que le r\u00e8glement d\u2019imposition n\u2019a pas frapp\u00e9 les immeubles de la compagnie; et il s\u2019ensuit que le r\u00f4le de perception n\u2019a pu valablement les affecter d\u2019une taxe qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e sur ces immeubles par le r\u00e8glement du conseil. Tout acte du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier dans son r\u00f4le de perception allant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre ou au del\u00e0 du r\u00e8glement d\u2019imposition est fatalement ill\u00e9gal et ultra vires.\nA ce point de vue, il importe peu que l\u2019on traite le r\u00e8glement comme imposant imm\u00e9diatement la taxe ou comme ayant seulement autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9lever. Le texte du r\u00e8glement, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant sa teneur, ne d\u00e9signe que les biens immeubles imposables sujets \u00e0 la taxe fonci\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et cette d\u00e9signation, \u00e0 cette date, ne frappe pas les immeubles de l\u2019appelante. Une proc\u00e9dure qui n\u2019atteignait pas ces immeubles au d\u00e9but, lors de l\u2019adoption du r\u00e8glement, n\u2019a pu valablement les atteindre \u00e0 la fin par l\u2019acte du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier. Elle n\u2019a pu, pour ainsi dire, les ramasser en route.\nN\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus parmi les immeubles frapp\u00e9s par le r\u00e8glement, ils ne pouvaient faire partie des immeubles sur qui la taxe serait r\u00e9partie; et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier n\u2019avait ni le droit, ni le pouvoir de les inscrire dans sa r\u00e9partition.\nLa cause actuelle, nous l\u2019avons vu, est une poursuite par voie d\u2019action ordinaire en recouvrement de la taxe. Ce n\u2019est pas une proc\u00e9dure pour faire d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e ou la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019exemption. Pour que la poursuite soit maintenue, il faut que la taxe soit due. Elle ne peut \u00eatre due que si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e ou si elle l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement. Il ne suffit pas de dire que la compagnie \u00e9tait seulement exempt\u00e9e de payer et, qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le montant n\u2019\u00e9tant devenu exigible qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de l\u2019exemption, la compagnie n\u2019en est plus lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Si les immeubles ne sont pas sujets \u00e0 cotisation en vertu du r\u00e8glement, ils n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb figurer sur le r\u00f4le de perception et cela est d\u00e9cisif car, d\u00e8s lors, il n\u2019y a rien d\u2019exigible.\nD\u2019ailleurs, nous ne voyons pas bien comment l\u2019exemption de taxes pourrait fonctionner si elle consistait simplement \u00e0 lib\u00e9rer du paiement. Cela impliquerait que, pour le reste, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9e devrait figurer au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, dans les r\u00e8glements d\u2019imposition et dans les r\u00f4les de perception, comme toute autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9. L\u2019exemption entrerait en jeu seulement au moment du paiement dont la personne exempt\u00e9e serait dispens\u00e9e. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019en peut \u00eatre ainsi. La taxe fonci\u00e8re est impos\u00e9e pour rapporter une somme totale pr\u00e9cise bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation en vigueur. Et pour qu\u2019elle rapporte cette somme, il faut qu\u2019elle soit r\u00e9partie en entier dans le r\u00f4le de perception pour, ensuite, \u00eatre per\u00e7ue en entier de tous ceux qui sont tenus de la payer. Imposer et r\u00e9partir une partie de cette somme sur une personne exempt\u00e9e, qui ne serait pas tenue de la payer, laisserait un \u00e9cart entre le montant requis, impos\u00e9, r\u00e9parti et le montant qui serait exigible et percevable. Le but du r\u00e8glement d\u2019imposition ne serait pas atteint. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9clamation, l\u2019\u00e9cart serait de $9,320.42, \u00e0 part les int\u00e9r\u00eats\u2014ce qui n\u2019est pas n\u00e9gligeable.\nPour ces raisons, nous sommes d\u2019avis de faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, avec d\u00e9pens devant la Cour du Banc du Roi et devant cette Cour.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

(who was not a party to the action) contracted with the Crown to build an ice pier, and did some of the work. In the foundation work, the contract required excavating the bottom to bed rock by dredging. Dredges chartered by appellant abandoned the work because of difficulties encountered, and appellant complained to the Crown\u2019s District Engineer that the dredging was impossible of performance. The District Engineer changed the plan of the work so as to eliminate the dredging and secure the foundation by other means, and directed appellant to proceed on the plan as changed. The District Engineer and appellant differed in their estimates of the nature of the change made and of the extra cost involved, and appellant asked for written instructions, which were not given. A deadlock ensued and the time within, which, under the contract, the work was to be completed, expired. The Crown\u2019s Chief Engineer gave notice to the contractors, in pursuance of a clause in the contract, to put an end to their \u201cdefault and delay\u201d and that, if within a certain time satisfactory progress was not made, the Crown would take the work out of their hands and complete it; and, the work not being proceeded with, the Crown, on further notice, and purporting to act under said clause, took over the work and appellant\u2019s materials and plant and proceeded to complete the work according to the plan as changed. Appellant sued (on petition of right) for damages.\nHeld, reversing judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court, [1933] Ex. C.R. 33, Lamont and Hughes JJ. dissenting, that, upon all the facts and circumstances and the proper construction of the contract, the appellant was entitled to succeed.\nPer curiam: The nature of the change made in the plan was such as required, under the contract, written instructions from the Chief Engineer; also, in the absence thereof, the Chief Engineer\u2019s said notice requiring satisfactory progress to be made, must be taken to mean to proceed under the original plan. Per Rinfret and Crocket JJ.: Previous to the change of plan there was no delay of which the Crown could now complain; and the delay after the change of plan was directly attributable to the Crown itself, because, while its District Engineer (a recognized departmental representative and the real controlling spirit in all that pertained to the contract and its execution throughout) had directed to proceed on the new plan, it failed to give written instructions, in accordance with the contract, to do so; therefore the taking over by the Crown of the work and materials and plant was not justified (Roberts v. Bury Improvement Commissioners, 39 L.J.C.P. 129, Lodder v. Slowey, 73 L.J. P.C. 82, cited). Further, the Crown did not bring itself within the clause under which it purported to act, as that clause, fairly construed, contemplated that the contractors should be made aware of the specific default or delay with which the engineer was dissatisfied, and, to justify under it, the Crown must show that the contractors were guilty of some default or delay in diligently executing some part of the contract work to the engineer\u2019s satisfaction (the intention being that the engineer in the exercise of his judgment should act justly and reasonably); and the facts failed to discharge that onus and, further, absolutely negatived justification of the Crown\u2019s act. The case should be sent back to the Exchequer Court for assessment of damages, with right to appellant to join V. in the petition (though quaere whether this was necessary, in view of the terms of the partnership agreement between appellant and V. Atkinson v. Laing, 171 E.R. 901, referred to).\nPer Smith J.: There was actually little delay on the contractors\u2019 part that counted, except what was caused by the miscalculation that it was practicable to do the dredging in the manner attempted. This was a miscalculation of the engineers that was relied on by the contractors, though they were not warranted in doing so by the terms of the contract. But, when the District Engineer directed the change of plan, the contractors were justified in insisting upon approval thereof by the Chief Engineer in writing before proceeding further. Although the notice by the Chief Engineer to proceed could mean only, in the absence of written instructions to the contrary, to proceed on the original plan, yet, as the Crown subsequently proceeded on the changed plan, the latter was the one clearly contemplated, and there was never any intention of resorting to the original plan. The contractors were never in default as to the changes, and appellant should \u2018 succeed on his claim. The case should be sent back for assessment of damages in the manner directed by Rinfret and Crocket JJ.\nPer Lamont J. (dissenting): There was unreasonable delay by the contractors in engaging dredges. It was not established that the dredging was impossible of performance; on the evidence, it could have been done, though probably at considerable expense. Moreover, in view of provisions of the contract, appellant was not entitled to recover from the Crown his expense in connection with the attempt to operate the dredges on the footing of impossibility of performance. The contractors, with the contract before them, must be held to have known of the lack of authority to make the proposed change in the plan of the work in the absence of written instructions from the Chief Engineer. The trouble arose by reason of their failure to examine the bottom, though a certificate in their tender indicated they had done so. They should have known beforehand whether dredges such as were employed were sufficient for the work. The Crown could not be mulcted in damages for alterations made by an official who had no authority to make them. The judgment of the Exchequer Court should be affirmed, with the variation suggested by Hughes J.\nPer Hughes J. (dissenting): The District Engineer had no power to make the proposed alteration in the work, and, in the absence of written instructions from the Chief Engineer, the contract, plan, and specifications remained as they were originally. The contractors must have been aware of said lack of power in the District Engineer. The contractors were in default on the date limit set by the contract for completion; and the difficulty in dredging was not a valid excuse for such default (Thorn v. The Mayor and Commonalty of London, 1 App. Cas. 120, at 132; Connolly v. City of Saint John, 35 Can. SCR. 186, referred to). Under the terms of the contract the Crown was entitled to take over and use appellant\u2019s materials and plant to complete the work, even with changes in plan. The appeal should be dismissed, but the judgment should be without prejudice to any proceedings in proper form which appellant might, if so advised, subsequently take against the Crown for the return of, or damages in respect of, any materials or plant not used up by the Crown in accordance with the contract and improperly withheld.\nAPPEAL by the suppliant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that he was not entitled to the relief sought by his Petition of Right herein, in which he claimed damages from the Crown in respect of a contract for the construction of an ice pier at Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia, the Crown having, by reason of alleged default and delay in the work, taken the work out of the contractons\u2019 hands and taken possession of appellant\u2019s materials and plant for purposes of completion of the work. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs and the judgment of the Exchequer Court was set aside and the case sent back to that court for the assessment of damages, with a reservation of the right of the suppliant, if deemed advisable, to join in the Petition one Voye, who had, with the suppliant, been a party to the said contract. Costs in the Exchequer Court were left in the discretion of that court. Lamont and Hughes JJ. dissented.\nP. J. Hughes K.C. for the appellant.\nA. N. Carter for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014I find it impossible upon the evidence to avoid the conclusion that the real reason for the action of the Department of Public Works in terminating this contract and confiscating the contractors\u2019 material, plant and equipment was the impossible situation in which the contractors were placed by the failure of Locke, the supervising resident engineer, or the Chief Engineer himself to provide the necessary written confirmation of the radical change which the former had ordered in August, 1929, in the contract plans and specifications regarding the construction of the foundation for the pier, and not any default or delay on the part of the contractors before that time, as the Department is now contending.\nLocke admitted that on August 13, 1929, after the powerful dredge Leconsfield had tried unsuccessfully to do the required dredging for the foundation of the pier, following the failure of the dredge J. A. Gregory, he told Boone that it was not feasible to excavate by a dredge to the rock, as required by the contract specification, and that he would make a change in the plans. He admitted that he did make a change in the original plan, for another foundation than that specified in the contract, which it was not denied affected not only the foundation itself but necessitated the reduction in the height of the crib, which the contractor at that time had built on the shore, all ready to float and place in position on the site as soon as the foundation was prepared. He admitted that he delivered a copy of the changed plan to the contractor and another to Mr. McKay, the inspector, and that he notified Mr. Allison, an engineer also employed in his office and to whom much of the supervision of this contract work was entrusted. On August 28 he telegraphed Boone to start the bag concrete foundation on the changed plan. Boone wrote Locke the following day acknowledging this telegram and requesting, as he had previously personally done, to have the instructions concerning the proposed changes made in writing before commencing the new work. This letter Locke did not acknowledge and in his testimony, under questioning by the respondent\u2019s counsel, admitted that he deliberately waited until the expiration of the contract and then reported to the Chief Engineer of the Department at Ottawa and that the Chief Engineer then notified the appellant\u2019s firm of the expiry of the contract.\nThe Chief Engineer\u2019s notice appears under date of September 11, 1929, and recites the making of the contract on September 22, 1928, and that by the terms thereof the work should have been satisfactorily executed and completed within twelve months from the date of notification of the acceptance of the firm\u2019s tender, viz., on or before September 1, 1929, and then proceeds:\nAnd Whereas, you have made default and delay in diligently continuing to advance or execute the said works to the satisfaction of the undersigned;\nTherefore, the undersigned, in pursuance of Clause 19 of said contract, hereby requires you to put an end to said default and delay, and if within six days from the service hereof on you, satisfactory progress is not made with the said works, His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Public Works, intends to avail Himself of the provisions of said Clause and take the said works out of your hands and complete them.\nTo this notice the appellant\u2019s firm replied on September 18, giving, as my brother Smith states in his judgment, an accurate account of the situation which had developed in connection with the dredging, calling the Chief Engineer\u2019s attention to the fact that he had asked for written instructions covering the changes which had been made by the resident engineer in the plan and stating that as soon as the Department gave them these instructions they were prepared to deal with the work just as expeditiously as they reasonably could and asking that the written instructions be given them without delay. This letter, it seems, was not acknowledged either. On September 25, after receiving a long telegram from Locke, which shews that the Chief Engineer had forwarded to him the contractors\u2019 letter of the 18th, and which telegram advised that the Department was fully justified in completing the work itself, the Chief Engineer on September 25 again wrote the appellant\u2019s firm that,\nas no satisfactory progress has been made since my notice has been served upon you it has been decided to take the work out of your hands, in pursuance of Clause 19 of [the contract],\nand that \u201cthe materials, tools, equipment, etc., become the property of the Department.\u201d This letter stated that \u201cthe required instructions have been given Mr. District Engineer Thomas J. Locke,\u201d to whom the firm was referred for any further information.\nThe Department afterwards proceeded with the work itself under Mr. Locke\u2019s supervision and upon the changed plan which the latter had made, using the appellant\u2019s materials and equipment therefor.\nThe Chief Engineer\u2019s notice of September 11, 1929, was the first complaint made to the contractors by that official of any default or delay in diligently executing any part of the work to his satisfaction after the signing of the contract by the Deputy Minister on September 22, 1928. There is not a written line of any such complaint by any officer or representative of the Department in the whole record from the date of the signing of the contract until that notice was served. The only exhibit containing even so much as a suggestion that there had been any delay of any kind on the part of the contractors is Locke\u2019s letter of May 8, 1929. This is the letter in which Locke confirmed his conversation of the previous day regarding the creosoting of the timber for the crib after six weeks\u2019 seasoning instead of four months\u2019 seasoning which the creosoting plant usually insisted upon. \u201cThis concession,\u201d Locke stated in that letter, \u201cwas made you in order to expedite commencement of this work at the earliest possible date,\u201d and he added:\nI wish to emphasize the importance of your not neglecting any opportunity of procuring a suitable dredge quickly for the purpose of having the foundation excavated and work commenced June 1, 1929.\nIt is true that on the trial he said, in answer to questions by the respondent\u2019s counsel, that he was not satisfied with the progress the contractors had made up to May 7, and that he felt that they should have made arrangements the first part of September when they heard they had the contract\u2014that was before the contract was signed\u2014and it was the first of May when they were trying to procure dredges. In cross-examination, however, he admitted that he approved of the creosoted timber; that he did not expect any actual work to be commenced before spring; and that the earliest time he would expect the contractors to undertake the dredging would be between the middle of May and June 1. His letter of May 8 itself, it will be noted, made no complaint of any delay that had occurred in connection with the dredging, but merely impressed upon the contractors the importance of procuring a suitable dredge quickly in order that work might be commenced on June 1, 1929. As a matter of fact, the contractors had tried to secure a dredge some time before that from the Saint John Dredging Company, which was unwilling on account of the small quantity of material to be dredged to undertake the job, and Boone on the very day of the conversation mentioned, May 7, according to Locke\u2019s own testimony, negotiated with the manager of the Beacon Dredging Co. of Halifax to do the dredging, and informed him that the latter had agreed to do the work. It was May 27, however, before the formal charter was signed, whereby the Dredging Company agreed to send its dredge J. A. Gregory from Parrsboro, where it was, to the site within a week of that date with a tug boat and scows with three days\u2019 allowance to make the trip. On account of repairs which had to be made, this dredge did not arrive at the site until late in June and it did not make its unsuccessful attempt to do the dredging until July 2. No complaints were made by Locke or by the Chief Engineer or anybody else of the delay caused by the dredging company, and after its failure Locke himself made arrangements for the contractors with the manager of the Saint John Dry Dock Co. to send the Leconsfield into the site while on its way to Liverpool, N.S. McKay, the resident engineer\u2019s inspector, admitted that at the time Locke made the changes in the plan all that could reasonably be done on the crib had been done by the contractors, and it is obvious that no progress could be made with the actual erection of the crib and pier until the foundation was prepared.\nSo far, therefore, as the Chief Engineer\u2019s notice of September 11 is concerned, although it recites the fact that the time for performance of the contract had then expired, it conclusively shews that this was not the reason for the contemplated action. The notice on its face carries with it an extension of time and commits the Department to the second preamble as its justification, viz., that the contractors had \u201cmade default and delay in diligently continuing to advance or execute the said works to the satisfaction of the undersigned.\u201d If this preamble refers to any default or delay in the execution of the work before the resident engineer changed the foundation plans, it is clear from what has already been stated that there is no evidence whatever that there was any default or delay of any kind on the part of the contractors before that time in diligently continuing to advance or execute the work to the satisfaction either of the Chief Engineer himself or of the resident engineer or of any other officer or representative of the Department. It must accordingly be taken as referring to the delay which took place afterwards. If there had been any delay of any kind previously it could only have been in relation to the contractors not having arranged immediately after being notified of the acceptance of their tender for the procuring of the timber for the crib and for the hiring of a dredge, notwithstanding that the dredging for the foundation was not expected by the resident engineer or the Department itself to be commenced before June 1. These were the only pretended grounds of previous delay suggested on the trial. If they were real or in any light fell within the terms of the contract they were clearly condoned, as clause 55 of the contract shews that any breach or default might be condoned, though providing that no such condonation shall operate as a waiver of any term of the contract if it is a breach or default \u201csimilar to that for which any action is taken or power exercised or forfeiture is claimed or enforced against the Contractor.\u201d\nWhat then are the true facts as to the delay for which it must be taken, as already intimated, that the Department\u2019s action was taken and the forfeiture of the contractors\u2019 materials, plant and equipment claimed?\nThe resident engineer finds the original foundation plans unfeasible, informs the contractors to that effect and that he is going to change them and substitute a new foundation, furnishes the contractors and his own inspector with copies of the changed plan, admits that the substituted plan involved the abandonment of ten feet of the crib the contractors already had constructed, new work in the rock talus and many other important items for which no provision was made in the original contract, telegraphs the contractors on August 28 to start work on the new plans, notifies his assistant supervising engineer, ignores the contractors\u2019 request for written confirmation covering the changes in accordance with the terms of the contract, deliberately waits until the date for completion expires, and then advises the Chief Engineer to take the work out of their hands. The Chief Engineer consequently directs the necessary notice to the contractors. The resident engineer\u2019s report which brought this notice to the contractors was not produced on the trial for some reason, but the notice to the contractors brought a letter from them to the Chief Engineer, which advised him of the true facts and that the contractors were awaiting the written confirmation to which they were entitled from him before proceeding to construct the new foundation which Locke had ordered them to do. The Chief Engineer, without acknowledging this letter or either confirming or repudiating Locke\u2019s order to the contractors to proceed on the changed plans, sends a copy of it to Locke. The latter replies on September 23 with a telegram of over 500 words. In his telegram he states that he instructed the contractors on August 13 to immediately proceed with the foundation work on the changed plan; that their complaint as to non-receipt of written confirmation did not bear on subject as his instructions were given in the presence of three witnesses and that the change was not a sufficient radical departure to justify their complaint, and then he proceeds to formulate complaints of previous delays on the part of the contractors in connection with the procuring of the dredge, alleging, quite contrary to the evidence adduced on the trial, that the contractors made no move to procure a dredge until practically compelled by him to do so, and that their entire conduct had been unsatisfactory and unprogressive. Not content with this he went on to bolster up a case against the contractors by stating that he had learned from outside sources that Mr. Boone did not intend to move \u201cuntil he received a letter from me promising much larger prices than he was getting\u201d\u2014a statement for which no justification whatever is to be found in the record, and concludes with the statement that he considers the Department fully justified in completing the work itself and \u201cnot trusting contractor who pursues such dilatory methods with the evident intention of forcing our hand if possible to receive a larger remuneration for work which he should have completed long ere this date\u201d and an urgent recommendation \u201cfor early action\u201d to this end. Then follows the final notice of September 25, from the Chief Engineer, taking the work out of the contractors\u2019 hands without any acknowledgment having been made of their letter of September 18, though a later note of September 20, referring to a claim received from the Beacon Dredging Co. for its futile attempt to do the dredging, was acknowledged on September 24 with the mere statement: \u201cthe contents of which have been noted.\u201d\nThat the Chief Engineer\u2019s notice of September 11 was, directed to the contractors at the instance of the resident engineer cannot, in my opinion, be doubted. That the contractors had previously been advised by the resident engineer of material alterations he had made in the original plans and definitely ordered by him to proceed with their work under the altered plans and at the time they received the Chief Engineer\u2019s notice were awaiting the written confirmation of the resident engineer\u2019s directions, which they had requested of the latter, is als\u043e beyond question. That the Chief Engineer\u2019s notice can only be interpreted as a notice to proceed with the work under the original plans is self-evident. The learned President of the Exchequer Court so construed it, and held that, at the time the Chief Engineer gave notice, the original plans and specifications remained unaltered because of the failure of that official to approve the changes and instructions, made and given to the contractors by the resident engineer. The result of the whole situation is that we have the Department terminating the contract and declaring a forfeiture of the contractor\u2019s materials, plant and equipment because of the Department\u2019s own failure to approve the resident engineer\u2019s orders in accordance with the terms of the contract, and refusing to do so upon the representations and advice of the resident engineer himself, and then immediately proceeding to do the work itself, not upon the original contract plans and specifications, but upon the very plans, as altered by the resident engineer, which it had refused to confirm in writing for the contractors.\nThis seems to me, not only to constitute harsh treatment of the contractors and to have placed them in a most awkward position, as stated by my brother Smith, but to constitute on the part of the Department itself conduct which cannot be defended or justified under any of the very onerous and oppressive terms of the contract which the contractors were required to sign before entering upon their work. It surely ought not to be permitted to justify its harsh and arbitrary action by putting forward as a default or delay of the contractors \u201cin diligently continuing to advance or execute the said works,\u201d a default or delay which is directly attributable to the Department itself. That the law precludes the Department from doing so is clearly shewn by Roberts v. Bury Improvement Commissioners[2], and Lodder v. Slowey[3]. In the former case Blackburn, J., enunciated this principle in the following words at p. 136:\u2014\nfor it is a principle very well established at common law that no person can take advantage of the non-fulfilment of a condition the performance of which has been hindered by himself.\nKelly, C.B., in delivering the judgment of himself and Channell, \u0412., in the same ease, said:\u2014\nIn this case we should have been content to have simply adopted the judgment of my brother Blackburn, in which we in substance concur, and observing that, inasmuch as it is admitted on the record that the alleged failure by the plaintiff to use such diligence and to make such progress as to enable him to complete the work by the day specified, was caused by the failure of the defendants and their architect to supply plans and set out the land necessary to enable the plaintiff to commence the work, the rule of law applies, which exonerates one of two contracting parties from the performance of a contract when the performance of it is prevented and rendered impossible by the wrongful act of the other contracting party. And again:\nNow, in considering this question, we agree that we are not to assume a jurisdiction which we do not possess, to mitigate the hardship upon contractors of clauses, however oppressive, which are sometimes, and indeed most commonly introduced into agreements of this nature; but we must take care also not to add to their severity, and to the injustice which they are often the means of inflicting upon a contractor, by imagining stipulations which are not to be found in the contract, and which the parties have never entered into or contemplated.\nIn Lodder v. Slowey[4], in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Lord Davey pointed out that the jury had found that the corporation, meaning the borough council acting by their engineer, prior to the seizure of the works improperly prevented the respondent from proceeding with the works in the manner authorized by his contract and also prevented him from proceeding with the works with sufficient expedition, and said:\u2014\nTheir Lordships hold that a party to a contract for execution of works cannot justify the exercise of a power of re-entry and seizure of the-works in progress when the alleged default or delay of the contractor has been brought about by the acts or default of the party himself or his agent\n\u2014citing Roberts v. Bury Improvement Commissioners[5].\nIn this case the Chief Engineer and the resident engineer between them just as effectually held up the contractors as if they had directed them to suspend all work. One was ordering them to proceed with the foundation work on a new plan, while refusing to obtain for them the written confirmation which they demanded and to which they were entitled, and the other, knowing this fact, was notifying them to proceed on the original plan, while ignoring their specific request to him for written confirmation of the resident engineer\u2019s orders to such an extent that he would neither signify to them his approval or disapproval thereof.\nApart, however, from this feature of the case, I go further and hold that the Department did not bring itself within the terms of clause 19 of the contract, under which it pretended to act. I have already pointed out that the Chief Engineer\u2019s notice committed the Department to the second preamble as the justification for its action, and did not claim to exercise the power of re-entry and confiscating the contractors\u2019 property because of their failure to complete within the contract time, but in point of fact notified them to proceed with the work after the time fixed for completion had expired. The Department, therefore, was bound to justify under the following words of that clause:\nIn case the Contractor shall make default or delay in commencing, or in diligently executing any of the works or portions thereof to be performed, or that may be ordered under this contract, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer may give a general notice to the Contractor requiring him to put an end to such default or delay, and should such default or delay continue for six days after such notice shall have been given by the Engineer to the Contractor * * * the Minister * * * may take all the work out of the Contractor\u2019s hands * * *\nOn a fair construction of this language it must, I think, be taken to pre-suppose the existence of some specific, definite default or delay on the part of the contractors in diligently executing any of the works or portions thereof to the satisfaction of the Engineer, of which complaint has been made to them; otherwise what effect can be given to the words of the notice \u201cto put an end to such default or delay\u201d? If by \u201cthe Engineer\u201d is meant, as is contended, the Chief Engineer, he certainly had never apprized the contractors of any dissatisfaction on his part with the progress of the work in any manner or form, and there is no evidence of any complaint having been made by the resident engineer or any of his representatives other than that already pointed out of any default or delay prior to the time when the resident engineer recognized the un-feasibility of the provision in the original specifications requiring that the footing for the pier be excavated to the rock by means of a dredge. The words of clause 19, under which the Department purported to act, clearly contemplate that the contractor shall be made aware of the default or delay with which the Engineer is dissatisfied. Otherwise how could the contractor reasonably be expected to put an end to such default or delay within six days? The clause is a confiscatory clause and as such should be strictly construed against the party seeking to enforce its provisions. It was incumbent on the Department, in order to justify under it, to prove by a preponderance of testimony that the contractors were guilty of some default or delay in diligently executing some part of the contract work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the intention of the clause, of course, being that the Engineer in the exercise of his judgment should act justly and reasonably. The undisputed and indisputable facts al- ready pointed out not only fail, in my opinion, to discharge that onus, but absolutely negative the claim that the Department was justified in taking the contract work out of the contractors\u2019 hands and confiscating their material, plant and equipment.\nNotwithstanding the one-sided character of the contract and the limitation prescribed in clause 37 of the specifications as to the power of the Department\u2019s supervising District Engineer in respect of it, I can find nothing in that clause or in any other clause of the contract or the specifications from beginning to end, by which it is provided that the action of the District Engineer or any other representative of the Chief Engineer or of the Department may not be relied upon by the contractors as an excuse for any default or delay which may be charged against them in the execution of the contract work, even though such action may not be approved in writing by the Chief Engineer. The question to be decided here is not whether the contractors are to receive compensation for work ordered by the District Engineer, without the written authority of the Chief Engineer, but whether they are to be debarred from claiming for the work which they performed under the original contract and specifications because they declined to proceed with their work on the foundation on the orders of the District Engineer under plans delivered to them which constituted a radical departure from their contract without the changed plans and the resident engineer\u2019s order to execute these changes first being approved in writing by the Chief Engineer in accordance with the terms of the contract. That the Department entrusted the whole supervision of the work to the District Engineer cannot be disputed, and I am not at all sure that, apart from the limitation prescribed in clause 37 of the specifications, the words \u201cthe Engineer\u201d used in many other clauses of the contract should not be construed as the District Engineer. The definition of the term \u201cEngineer\u201d provides that it \u201cshall extend to and include any of the officers or employees of the Department of Public Works acting under the instructions of the Chief Engineer or Chief Architect,\u201d while the introductory words of the interpretation clause provide that it is only where the context does not otherwise require, that the definitions stated shall apply. It is a matter of common knowledge that the Chief Engineer himself does not personally witness the progress of any of these works, and that he necessarily relies entirely on the reports of the supervising district engineers throughout the country, and moreover, that these District Engineers are permanent and highly responsible representatives and agents of the Department in the supervision and direction of the execution of all such works. Indeed in the case at bar the evidence indicates that Locke\u2019s was really the controlling mind from the very inception to the termination of this contract. The original plan of August 7, 1928, bears his signature as having been checked by him as Supervising Resident Engineer. It was he who notified the contractors by telegram on September 1, 1928, that he had been advised directly by the Minister of the passage of the order in council accepting their tender, and of his anxiety to have the work commenced at the earliest possible date, as the Minister wished to make \u201cimportant announcement in address Clarks Harbour his constituency Monday matter urgent.\u201d It is true that he denied on the trial that this message was dictated by his desire for political reasons to get something which could be seen on the ground, even before the contract was signed, but the message none the less shews to what an extent the Department relied upon him as its representative in the district, and the facts as above outlined as to what occurred in connection with the creosoting of the timber, the dredging, the changing of the plans, the giving of the notice terminating the contract, the appropriation by the Department of the contractors\u2019 materials, plant and equipment, its immediate approval after the termination of the contract of his change in the plan, and the prosecution of the work by the Department under the changed plan and under his supervision and direction, are, in my opinion, conclusive as to his being, not only a recognized representative and agent of the Department, but, as I have already said, the real controlling spirit in all that pertained to this contract and its execution from beginning to end.\nAs to the objection which was raised on the trial regarding the non-joinder of Voye as a suppliant, I am inclined to think, having regard to the terms of the partnership agreement between Boone and Voye whereby Boone was to supply without charge all plant, tools and equipment which he owned as well as all necessary funds for the completion of this and the two other contracts to which the partnership agreement was confined and that all moneys received by the partnership in respect of the three contracts were to be deposited in the name of Boone and that Voye\u2019s interest in the partnership was limited to his right to share only in the profits of the three contracts after payment of all moneys properly payable by the partnership, that Boone had a right to bring his petition in his own name. See Atkinson v. Laing[6]. Whether I am justified in this view or not, it is clear that the mere failure to join Voye in the petition could have made no difference in the attitude of the Attorney General in granting his fiat and that the respondent was in no way prejudiced by such non-joinder on the trial of the cause. If, therefore, there should be any doubt upon this question of non-joinder, I have no doubt as to the right of the Exchequer Court to allow an amendment joining Voye in order that the petition should not be defeated upon that ground. The learned President of the Exchequer Court in his judgment expressed the same view, though, as he stated, not without some doubt, and granted leave to add Voye as a suppliant upon the condition that Boone indemnify Voye, if the latter so required, against any costs to which he might be subjected thereby. Apparently this suggestion was not accepted on the trial.\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be set aside and the case sent back to the said Court for the assessment of damages, with the reservation of the right of the suppliant, if deemed advisable, to join Voye in the petition.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs and remit the case to the Exchequer Court for the purpose and with the reservation stated. Smith J.\u2014The appellant, having been the successful tenderer for the contract of Ice Pier No. 5 at Barrington Passage, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia, entered into a contract for its construction with the Department of Public Works.\nThe plan and specifications of the work, upon which the appellant tendered, required that the pier should be founded upon bed rock, necessitating the removal of an accumulated mass of what was called \u201csand, gravel and boulders,\u201d amounting to 975 cubic yards. The specification provides that the footing for the crib must be excavated by means of a dredge to the rock, and cleared off by a diver. A crib of the size of the proposed pier was to be built of 10\u02dd by 10\u02dd square creosoted timber, to be placed on the prepared foundation.\nThe contract was signed on 22nd September, 1928, and provided that the work was to be completed by 1st September, 1929.\nThe first question that arose was as to the timber. The appellant says that this timber could not be procured anywhere in a seasoned condition, and had to be cut from the woods, that the creosoting plant selected by the Department Engineer, pursuant to the terms of the contract, required that the timber should be seasoned for four months, and that this seasoning does not take place in winter, but commences about the 1st of April, so that the creosoting could not be commenced until the 1st of August, 1929. The appellant knew, or ought to have known, all about this at the time of entering into the contract.\nThe Resident Engineer, Mr. Locke, says that in his opinion seasoned timber could have been had, but at greater expense. This difficulty, however, has little bearing on the question, because it was surmounted by Mr. Locke persuading the creosoting plant that the seasoning referred to was not necessary, and the timber was on the site in time.\nThe real difficulty was in connection with the dredging. Mr. Locke says that the time he would expect Mr. Boone to do the dredging in this case would be from the middle of May to the first of June, and that he would not dredge any considerable time before being in a position to put the crib down. The reason for this, as I gather from the evidence, is that if the dredging were done much in advance of the time the crib could be placed, drift material would be lodged by the rapid current; and that it was therefore desirable to have the bottom cleared off and the foundation laid immediately after the completion of the dredging.\nMr. Locke had, after the appellant\u2019s tender was accepted, pointed out to him the need of having the work completed within the stipulated time. On the 7th May, 1929, the appellant was in Mr. Locke\u2019s office when the question of the creosoting was brought up, and finally disposed of in the manner I have already indicated. Mr. Locke made some complaints about delay, and reminded the appellant that he should make arrangements for a suitable dredge. Mr. Dunfield, of the Beacon Dredging Company, was present, and negotiations at once took place for a contract with his company; and he and Mr. Boone, as Mr. Locke says, went out with the intention of making a contract. A contract was entered into, dated 27th May, for doing the work with the dredge Gregory, which arrived at the site on the 2nd July, and utterly failed to do any work, owing to the dangerous current. Arrangements were then made, with the help of Mr. Locke, to get the dredge Leconsfield to do the work. This was the most powerful dredge available in the Maritime Provinces. This dredge attempted to do the work on 2nd August, and also found it impossible, owing to the nature of the material to be removed.\nIn the meantime, during the month of July, the crib had been built up to ten tiers, ready for floating, and all necessary material was on the ground.\nMr. Locke was notified of the failure of the Leconsfield, and decided to change the plans by having the material that he had intended to dredge remain, and by having the foundation built on this material after it had been properly cleared off.\nThe appellant went to Mr. Locke\u2019s office on the 13th August, when the latter told the appellant he did not think it feasible to have the dredging done, because to do this it would be necessary to bring a drill for the purpose of boring and blasting, and that he was substituting a change in the plan, and handed to the appellant a plan on which the proposed change was indicated. A discussion took place as to what this change involved in the way of extra expense, Mr. Locke contending that it would increase the cost by $600, and the appellant contending that the increase would be $10,000. The latter asked for written instructions to proceed on the changed plan, which were not given, and on 28th August Locke telegraphed the appellant as follows:\nKindly start bag concrete foundation for pier Barrington Passage Allison advises by wire to notify your representative at Barrington to this effect.\nOn the 29th August the appellant replied to this telegram, stating that in his opinion this change called for work quite outside the terms of the contract, that it was an entire change and a modification of the contract as to price and as to time for completion, and asking to have instructions concerning the proposed changes made in writing before commencing the work.\nNo further instructions were given, and Mr. Locke says he waited for the 1st September, when the time for completion of the work under the contract elapsed, and then recommended to the Chief Engineer that the work should be taken over by the Department, pursuant to the terms of the contract, owing to the delay. This recommendation does not appear to be printed in the records, but in pursuance of it the Chief Engineer of the Department wrote to the appellant reciting in part the terms of the contract, and stating that there was default and delay in diligently continuing to advance or execute the said works, and finally notifying the appellant that if within six days satisfactory progress was not made, the Minister intended to avail himself of the provisions of clause 19 of the contract and take the works out of the appellant\u2019s hands and complete them.\nThis brought a reply from the appellant, dated 18th September, in which he refers to the failure of the dredges, the change of plan made by Mr. Locke, his request for written instructions for such change, as required by the contract, and the failure to receive same; and promising, upon receipt of such instructions, to proceed with the work as expeditiously as possible.\nOn the 23rd September Mr. Locke sent a long telegram to the Chief Engineer, in which he stated that the appellant was instructed on August 13 to proceed with leveling the present foundation, as the material could not be moved by either dredge. He complains of the delay in obtaining the dredges, and says he was told from outside sources that the appellant did not intend to move until he received a letter promising larger prices; complains of delays and unsatisfactory actions of Boone in connection with the work; and concludes by saying that he considers the Department fully justified in completing the work itself rather than trust to the contractor, who pursues dilatory methods, with the evident intention of obtaining a larger remuneration for the work.\nThe result was that on the 25th September the Chief Engineer notified the appellant that it had been decided to take the works out of his hands pursuant to clause 19 of the contract, and that therefore the materials, tools, equipment, etc., had become the property of the Department.\nThe work was accordingly taken out of the hands of the appellant, and the Department proceeded to do the work by day labour, and has spent so far, apparently, $27,000, the original estimate by the Department being $17,000, and the contract price $18,190. The work was apparently still incomplete at the commencement of these proceedings in 1932.\nIt appears to me that the appellant has been somewhat harshly treated. In the first place, the Departmental engineers had come to the conclusion that the sand and boulders to be removed in order to place the foundation of the pier on solid rock could be removed by dredges without drilling and blasting. It was not contemplated that any drilling outfit would be required, as Mr. Locke himself helped to arrange for the two dredges that attempted to do the work. On the failure of these dredges, he told the appellant that the dredging was not feasible, and it is therefore quite idle to talk of the possibility of doing this work by drilling and blasting.\nThe specifications provided that the excavation was to be done by means of a dredge, and there is no suggestion of blasting the material. There was, no doubt, some delay on the part of the appellant in getting the first dredge on the scene, but this was by reason of the appellant having been informed by the creosoting company that they would require the timber to be seasoned for four months, so that the crib, according to this, could not be ready to place on the foundation before 1st August. It is admitted that the dredging should be done so that this could be followed up at once by laying the foundation and placing the crib.\nThe creosoting difficulty being surmounted, by the intervention of Mr. Locke, as already stated, the dredging was arranged for, and would have been completed in June in time for the placing of the crib, had it not turned out that the dredge was unable to do the work, by reason of the unexpected nature of the material to be removed. This unforeseen occurrence involved the delay that occurred in getting the other dredge, and it was quite unexpected that that powerful dredge would also fail. From these failures, Mr. Locke decided that it was not feasible to do the dredging at all, and altered the plan.\nUnder the terms of the contract, the appellant was perfectly right in requiring written instructions before proceeding upon this altered plan, and, while he received instructions from Mr. Locke by telegram to proceed, these instructions were altogether insufficient because, as admitted, Mr. Locke had no authority to give the required instructions, and he absolutely refused to give them. He never advised the Chief Engineer of the change of plan that he proposed. Instead of doing this, he deliberately, as he says, waited for the expiration of the time limit, and then advised the Chief Engineer to take over the work.\nThe appellant, on being shown the changed plan, took the attitude already referred to as to extra cost and the effect on prices and time limitation. Mr Locke, no doubt because of this attitude, considered it necessary to be careful not to give any written instructions that would involve such a result. He was quite right in not giving any such instructions in writing himself, as he had no authority. He no doubt went beyond his authority in changing the plan and telegraphing to the contractor to proceed upon that changed plan, because the Chief Engineer alone had authority to do all this. The result was that the contractor was placed in a most awkward position. He was asked by the Resident Engineer to proceed with the work on the changed plan, and at the same time was refused the necessary written instructions that would enable him to do so with safety under the terms of the contract.\nThe Chief Engineer, without any notice of this situation, was recommended to take possession of the work because of delay, and, acting upon this recommendation, notified the contractor to proceed with the work within six days, without informing him upon which plan he was to proceed.\nThe first intimation that the Chief Engineer seems to have received as to the actual circumstances was from the letter of the appellant of the 18th September, which was in fact an accurate representation of the real circumstances, but which was counteracted largely by the telegram of Mr. Locke of the 23rd September, in which he tells of the delays and insincerity and lack of real effort upon the part of the contractor, founded in large part upon what he had been told from outside sources as to the appellant\u2019s intentions in order to secure larger remuneration.\nWhen Mr. Locke found, on the 2nd August, by the failure of the large dredge that dredging was impracticable, and resolved to change the plan, his proper course was so to inform the Chief Engineer and request his approval and written instructions to the contractor to proceed on the changed plan. This he knew to be a necessity under the terms of the contract. Instead, he altered the plan and asked the appellant to proceed on his own authority, and thus wasted the precious time from 2nd August until 1st September. If he had followed the proper course that I have pointed out, the work would probably have been completed, not on 1st September, but probably later that fall.\nThere was actually little delay that counted on the part of the appellant except what was caused by the miscalculation that it was practicable to do the dredging in the manner attempted. This was a miscalculation of the engineers that was relied on by the contractor, though he was not warranted in doing so by the terms of the contract.\nIf, immediately after the 2nd August, the Chief Engineer had received from Mr. Locke the information and request mentioned above, it is very improbable that he would have failed to act accordingly. The time for completion was allowed to expire, and then Mr. Locke recommended that the work be taken out of the appellant\u2019s hands, but on what precise representations does not appear. The result was, the letter from the Chief Engineer to proceed with the work within six days, which, by the lack of written instructions to the contrary, could mean only a request to proceed on the original plan, which the engineers had determined to abandon as impracticable, and which they did in fact abandon when they took over the work. The appellant was then in the position of having been furnished a changed plan, with a telegram from the Resident Engineer to proceed on that plan, and then a formal notification from the Chief Engineer to proceed, without any intimation as to the plan that he was to proceed with.\nI think that it is quite clear that the Chief Engineer had decided to change the plan as Mr. Locke intended. The contractor was quite right in insisting upon the approval of the Chief Engineer in writing before proceeding further. The Chief Engineer does not say in his notice anything about it, but he clearly contemplated a change of plan because, after the notice, he proceeded on the changed plan and carried on the work according to it.\nNo doubt the contractor made some complaint about the change, but all that was provided for in the contract; and the final claim that he made was that he had a right to have the changes made by the Chief Engineer in writing. He never got these changes approved in writing by the Chief Engineer, and he was never in default as to these changes, and there was never any intention on the part of Mr. Locke or the Chief Engineer of resorting to the original plan.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, and would send the case back to the Exchequer Court for the assessment of damages in the manner set out by Mr. Justice Crocket.\nLamont J. (dissenting).\u2014The material facts in this appeal and the relevant clauses of the contract entered into between the appellant (hereinafter called the \u201c Contractor\u201d), and His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Public Works, are set out in the judgment of my brother Hughes. The contract, which was dated September 22, 1928, was for the construction of Ice Pier No. 5 at Barrington Passage, Shelburne County, N.S., according to the plans and specifications attached to the contract. The work was to be completed by September 1, 1929, and time was made of the essence of the contract.\nThe contract called for a crib built pier of a certain size and shape placed upon a level foundation. This foundation was to be secured by excavating the bottom to bed rock, a distance of some ten feet, by means of a dredge, clearing it off by a diver and then levelling it up with bags of cement. Clause 56 of the contract provided that it was made and entered into on the distinct understanding that the Contractor had, before execution, investigated and satisfied himself of everything and of every condition affecting the work to be executed, and the labour and material to be provided and that\nthe execution of this contract by the Contractor is founded and based upon his own examination, knowledge, information and judgment, and not upon any statement, representation, or information * * * derived from any * * * tests, specifications, plans * * * furnished by His Majesty or any of His officers, employees or agents.\nThe tender of the Contractor contained the following:\u2014\n(We) hereby certify that (we) have visited and examined the site of the proposed work, or have caused it to be visited and examined by a competent person on (our) behalf.\nThis certificate was not true. The Contractor, Boone, some years before, had gone through Barrington Passage in a boat, but the water where the pier was to be constructed was twenty-five feet deep, and he admits that he could not see the bottom. The bottom, according to a plan attached to the specifications, was shewn to consist of large and small boulders, gravel and sand, with the boulders covering the entire surface of the bottom. The contract further provided that if the Contractor should make default or delay in commencing or in diligently prosecuting the work, the Minister of Public Works, act for His Majesty, might take the work out of the Contractor\u2019s hands and complete it himself.\nOn September 1, 1929, when the pier should have been completed, little work had been done beyond the building on shore of the frame work of the crib, the accumulation of materials for the construction of the pier, the blasting of a number of boulders on the bottom by a diver so that the dredge would be able to operate, and the dredging of one hundred and twelve of the estimated nine hundred and seventy-five cubic yards. This one hundred and twelve cubic yards was dredged out on August 3, and was the only dredging which was done. In September the Minister took the work out of the Contractor\u2019s hands, and took over the materials he had on hand, and used his plant, equipment and tools for completing the work. After the work was taken out of his hands, the Contractor brought this action against His Majesty, claiming some $13,000 damages for being deprived, by the Minister, without just cause, of an opportunity to complete the contract. He alleged that if the work was delayed, the delay was due to a change in the plans made by the District Engineer, one Locke, and his refusal or neglect to give instructions to proceed with the work, according to the substituted plan, to which instructions he claimed to be entitled under the contract.\nThat there was an unreasonable delay on the part of the Contractor in engaging dredges to excavate the foundation is, I think, established beyond question. The evidence shews that to complete the pier would require in the neighbourhood of four months\u2019 work after the dredging had been done. Although the attention of the Contractor had been called by Locke during the fall of 1928 to the necessity of arranging for the dredge to start work early in May, 1929, the Contractor did not get his first dredge on the job until July 2. This dredge\u2014the Gregory \u2014did not attempt to do any excavating. When it arrived it found the current so strong that the crew were afraid to operate, so it turned and went away. No further attempt at dredging was made until August 2, when the Leconsfield, a large bucket dredge, was procured and commenced dredging. It took out one hundred and twelve yards when it quit. The reason for quiting, so far as the evidence discloses, was that the surface of the bottom was covered with large boulders which, owing to their weight and size, were doing damage to the buckets. No further attempt was made to secure a suitable dredge, but the Contractor reported to Locke, through one Allison, who was an engineer in Locke\u2019s office, that the dredging part of the contract was impossible of performance. Locke, being anxious to get on with the pier, said he would see if he could make a change by which something else could be substituted for the dredging. On August 13 the Contractor came to Locke\u2019s office and Locke shewed him a plan of the work with changes on it marked in red ink. The suggested changes were that the dredging should be eliminated and that a level foundation upon which the pier could rest should be secured by levelling the bottom with bags of concrete, to the top of the boulders, and placing around this a talus, constructed also of bags of concrete. The Contractor and Locke had some discussion as to the cost of the suggested changes. Locke thought that the work, according to the plan as he had altered it, would cost about $600 more than the original work; the Contractor thought it would cost about $10,000 more, and that he should be given written instructions to proceed with the suggested alterations, as it entirely changed the contract, and he asked for written instructions. Locke told him to go down and start the work and he would get his instructions. The Contractor went away but he did not start the work. On August 24, Allison, who was making a tour of inspection, called at Barrington Passage and reported to Locke in these words:\u2014\nMr. Boone on the work and states he is waiting final instructions under a new scheme of foundation.\nOn August 28, Locke telegraphed the Contractor as follows:\u2014\nKindly start bag concrete foundation for pier Barrington Passage Allison advises by wire to notify your representative at Barrington to this effect.\nOn the following day the Contractor wrote to Locke as follows:\u2014\nI received your wire yesterday re proposed changes in foundation. While I am willing and most anxious to do the work just as you wish it done, I wish to point out that in my opinion this change calls for work quite outside the provisions of the contract.\nBy the terms of the contract it is provided that the footing of the crib must be excavated by means of a dredge to the rock. We had the largest and most powerful dredge available undertake to do this excavation, and it was found impossible to excavate because the material was such that a dredge could not remove it.\nThe change now proposed is to meet the situation arising from the impossibility of using a dredge. I claim that this makes an entire change and a modification of the contract as to price and as to time for completion of the work should be made with us as a result.\nWe have also been put to large expense in connection with the attempt made to operate the dredge which under the circumstances ought to be paid by the Department. As already requested I would like to have the instructions concerning the proposed changes made in writing before commencing the work.\nOn September 11, the Chief Engineer, as required by the contract, gave the Contractor six days\u2019 notice to put an end to his default and delay and to make satisfactory progress, within that time, otherwise the work would be taken out of his hands. Nothing was done, so the Minister took the work away from the Contractor.\nThe position taken by the Contractor was that the alterations made an entire change in the character of the work to be done, and that the alterations should all be considered as work outside of the contract. The object of this is, I think, apparent: The Contractor, in his letter of August 29, said that he had been put to a large expense in connection with the attempt to operate the dredges for which he desired the Department to pay. He would only be entitled to this if the necessity for the alterations could be attributed to the fault of the Department. This he attempted to prove by claiming that the work as called for in the specifications was impossible of performance. In my opinion the Contractor is not entitled to succeed on that footing: first, because the Department has sufficiently protected His Majesty from an action of this nature by clause 56, above referred to, and clause 45, which negatives all implied covenants or agreements; and, secondly, because it is not established that the dredging was impossible of performance. The Leconsfield was able to take out one hundred and twelve cubic yards because a diver had been sent down to blast out a number of boulders so that the dredge could take hold. From the evidence I am satisfied that the rest of the surface could have been dealt with in the same way. No doubt blasting the surface with dynamite would have been expensive, but the Contractor had agreed to do the dredging. Furthermore there is evidence that this dredging could have been done by means of a dipper dredge.\nThe position taken by the Contractor raises the very important question of Locke\u2019s authority to alter the nature of the work to be done. Locke, as I gather from his evidence and communications, held the view that, as all the work was being paid for at unit prices, the alterations suggested were matters of detail and came within what was described as \u201csmall things necessary to secure good work,\u201d which he had authority to make without referring the matter to the Chief Engineer, and did not come within the clause requiring written instructions to be given. The trial judge, however, held that the alterations made by Locke were decided variations in the plans and not something of a mere trifling nature, and with that view I agree.\nThe contract provides that the Engineer may, in writing, order any additional work not covered by the contract to be performed by the Contractor, but it also provides that, as a condition precedent to being paid for such extra work, the Contractor must obtain and produce the order of the Engineer in writing and shew that the work ordered had been done.\nIn the contract \u201cEngineer\u201d is defined as meaning the \u201cChief Engineer\u201d for the time being having control over the work, and extends to and includes any of the officers or employees of the Department of Public Works acting under the instructions of the Chief Engineer, but all instructions, or directions, or certificates given, or decisions made by anyone acting for the Chief Engineer, shall be subject to the approval of the Chief Engineer. In the specifications which were made a part of the contract, clause 37, in part, reads:\u2014\n37. Power of the District Engineer.\u2014The District Engineer will have no power to order extra work or changes which will entail an increase or decrease in cost without referring the matter to the Chief Engineer, and being authorized by him to order such changes. The Contractor will have no claims for compensation if such changes, though ordered by the District Engineer, have not been authorized, in writing, by the Chief Engineer. * * *\nUnder those provisions the onus, in my opinion, was upon the Contractor to establish that, notwithstanding clause 37, Locke had express instructions to make the alterations which he in fact did make, or that the Chief Engineer had approved of the same. This onus the Contractor did not discharge. So far as the evidence discloses, the Chief Engineer had no knowledge that any alterations had been made or suggested until after the date on which the contract was to be completed, nor did he authorize the same. The Contractor, whose duty it was to obtain and produce an order, in writing, from the Chief Engineer, did not communicate with him at all in respect of the same, until after he received the Engineer\u2019s notice, which lends some plausibility to the opinion expressed by Locke, in his testimony, that the Contractor found himself with a disadvantageous contract on his hands and was looking for a way to get rid of it. Locke, in my opinion, went beyond his authority when he so materially altered the character of the work to be done, and the Contractor, with his contract before him, must be held to have known of his want of authority to make the alterations, or to give written instructions, without which the Contractor would not proceed. The trouble in this case arises by reason of the failure of the Contractor to examine the bottom for himself, as he certified he had done. He should have known, before he put in his tender, whether or not the current was too strong for the small dredge he first employed, and he also should have known whether a bucket dredge was sufficient to remove the boulders which were indicated as being on the surface of the bed. As I see it, the real question in this appeal is, whether His Majesty can be mulcted in damages for alterations made by an official who had no authority to make them? The answer to this question must be in the negative.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, and the judgment of the Exchequer Court affirmed, but with the variation suggested by my brother Hughes.\nHughes J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by the suppliant from a judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada dated the 6th day of December, 1932, whereby it was held that the suppliant was not entitled to the relief sought in a Petition of Right, in which the suppliant claimed damages from the Crown in respect of a contract for the construction of an ice pier at Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia. The contract provided for the completion of the work on or before September 1, 1929. On September 25, 1929, the Crown notified the contractor that it had been decided to take over the work in pursuance of clause 19 of the contract, and this was done.\nThe following contentions were presented to this Court by the appellant:\u2014\n1. That there was no default on the part of the contractors. 2. That there was no order of the Minister of Public Works declaring the forfeiture.\n3. That there was no justification for the forfeiture of the appellant\u2019s contract, goods and deposit.\n4. That the respondent did not apply the appellant\u2019s goods and use the appellant\u2019s plant to complete the works mentioned in the contract, but for a new work substituted for the work called for under the contract and for other purposes.\nThe contract was between the appellant and one Alexander R. Voye, of the first part, and His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Public Works, of the second part, and was dated the 22nd day of September, 1928. Attached to the contract and made a part of it were specifications and a plan.\nBorings, at and about the site of the pier proposed in the contract, had been made by the Department of Public Works in the year 1923. The plan attached to the contract was not lacking in information as to borings or the condition of the bottom, as it shewed a section on the line of the proposed ice piers, details of borings and materials above the surface of the rock, including information that large and small boulders covered the bottom. The contractors had examined the plan before tendering and had seen the references to the borings and to the condition of the bottom. They had also examined the specifications. The contractors, in their tender of August 25, 1928, certified that they had seen and examined the site of the proposed work or had caused it to be visited and examined by a competent person on their behalf, although, as a fact, they had not examined it or had it examined. The appellant had merely seen the site some time previously.\nThe contractors tendered for the total price of $18,190 as per the following unit prices:\u2014\nDredging, 975 c.\u0443. at $3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2,925\nBag concrete, 66 c.\u0443. at $24 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,584\nCrib work, 14,500 cf. at 65 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,425\nConcrete top, 133 c.\u0443. at $32. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,256\n$18,190 On August 30, 1928, an Order in Council was passed accepting the above tender but the contract was not signed until September 22, 1928.\nThe crib was to be constructed of creosoted hardwood timber. Even before the contract was signed the District Engineer at Halifax, Thomas J. Locke, was asking the appellant about the timber and told the appellant that he, Thomas J. Locke, would like to get it to Barrington Passage that fall. The appellant told the District Engineer that it was impossible to get the timber to the creosoting plant for treatment that fall. The District Engineer thought the timber could be procured, and, as the appellant put it, was harping to get the timber down. The appellant testified, however, that he could not get the timber that fall, although he tried to do so. The contractors finally procured the timber and framed it and sent it to the creosoting plant about April 1, 1929. The appellant testified that there it had to be piled and stacked for seasoning purposes for at least four months before creosoting could be properly done. It must, therefore, have been fairly clear to the appellant before the contract was signed that the contractors could scarcely complete the work on or before September 1, 1929. On May 7, 1929, the District Engineer and the appellant had a conference and, on May 8, 1929, the District Engineer wrote the appellant that he would have the timber creosoted at the earliest possible moment, and emphasized the importance of procuring a suitable dredge for the purpose of having the foundation excavated and work commenced by June 1, 1929. As a result the timber had six weeks\u2019 treatment and was then delivered to Barrington Passage. The contractors then began to build the crib and ran it up ten courses, which was as high as it could usefully be built on land.\nOn May 27, 1929, the contractors entered into an agreement in writing whereby they hired the dredge J. A. Gregory, two dump scows and a steam tug to do the dredging. This dredge was a 1\u00bd yards, orange peel, bucket dredge. It proceeded to Barrington Passage and pulled over the site on July 3, 1929, but could do nothing because of the swift running of the tides and gave up. The contractors then procured the dredge Leconsfield which arrived at Barrington Passage on July 27, 1929. The Leconsfield was a powerful dredge but it also was a bucket dredge, which, according to the appellant, was the only kind procurable. This dredge took out 68 yards of material and then the superintendent gave up as the buckets were being torn to pieces.\nThe appellant, on August 3, 1929, went to Halifax and saw the District Engineer. The appellant testified that they looked over the plans and the District Engineer said that he would make changes.\nIt is important at this stage to mention some of the provisions of the specifications and contract.\n\u201cEngineer\u201d is defined in the specifications as the Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works of Canada.\nClauses 14 and 15 of the General Conditions are as follows:\u2014\n14. Alterations.\u2014The Engineer shall have the power and right to make from time to time and at any time, additions to or deductions from the dimensions shown on the drawings or specified herein and ta add to, omit, change, modify, cancel or alter the works and materials herein specified, or shown on the drawings, without rendering void or in any way vitiating the contract. The value or cost of such additions, deductions, omissions, modifications, or alterations, shall be determined in accordance with the rates or prices stated in the tender which prices are assumed, and will be taken to cover the cost of materials and workmanship measured in the works, or as specified herein, and to include the cost and expense of all plant, labour, machinery, tools, temporary works, cartages, freight, patterns, moulds, superintendence and profit; but the Contractor is not to make any change or alteration in the works or in the dimensions and character of the materials to be used without the consent and permission, in writing, of the Engineer. In case such permission is not obtained, unless the Contractor can show good and sufficient reason for his action, payment for such works will be refused.\n15. Meaning of Terms, Etc.\u2014Alterations, deductions, omissions, modifications or deviation are to be understood as applying to decided variations in the plans or designs, such as a decrease in width, an increase in depth, the substitution of one class of material for another, the addition of works neither shown nor described, etc., and for these or similar matters alone, will \u2018 any sum be allowed to the Contractor or deducted from the contract, and then only upon the written orders of the Engineer. All other alterations, etc., consequent upon a better disposal of materials an improved mode of construction adopted, repairs required, and such like, as long as the costliness of the materials, workmanship, etc., are of a trifling nature, which shall be, judged of by the Engineer, shall be deemed to be included in the contract, and for such no extra sum or amount will, under any consideration be allowed to the Contractor.\nClause 32 of the General Conditions is as follows:\u2014\n32. Claims.\u2014No claims for extras will be entertained by the Department on account of unforeseen difficulties in the carrying out of the works herein specified. Clause 37 of the General Conditions is as follows:\u2014\n37. Power of the District Engineer.\u2014The District Engineer will have no power to order extra work or changes which will entail an increase or decrease in cost without referring the matter to the Chief Engineer, and being authorized by him to order such changes. The Contractor will have no claims for compensation if such changes, though ordered by the District Engineer, have not been authorized, in writing, by the Chief Engineer. The District Engineer will see that the work is carried out exactly in accordance with the plans and specification, and in matters of detail, or small changes necessary to secure good work, where the question of extra cost cannot come into consideration, he must use his best judgment in the interpretation of the specification, and must conduct the work and carry out the plans with the idea that the best results are to be obtained and the Contractor must abide by the decision.\nHe shall give clear and detailed instructions in writing to all Inspectors, who will have no power to allow or make any changes in the work.\nIt will not be his duty to take the responsibility of advising the Contractor as to the way or best method of conducting his operations, and the Contractor must have his own Engineer in this connection. However, if in his opinion, the methods employed by the Contractor are such that the progress of the work is not satisfactory, or that they may lead to bad results, it will be his duty to warn the Contractor to change these methods, and force him to take such steps as will ensure the completion of the works in strict accordance with the plans and specification.\nThe provision of the contract defining \u201cEngineer\u201d and his duties is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cEngineer\u201d shall mean the Chief Engineer or Chief Architect, as the case may be, of the Department of Public Works of Canada, for the time being having control over the work, and shall extend to and include any of the officers or employees of the Department of Public Works, acting under the instructions of the Chief Engineer or Chief Architect, and all instructions or directions, or certificates given, or decisions made by any one acting for the Chief Engineer or Chief Architect, shall be subject to the approval of the Chief Engineer, or the Chief Architect, tand may be cancelled, altered, modified and changed as to the Chief Engineer or Chief Architect may see fit: Provided always and it is hereby understood and agreed that any act on the part of the Chief Engineer or the Chief Architect in connection with and in virtue of the present contract, and any instructions or directions or certificates given, or decisions made by the said Chief Engineer or the Chief Architect, or by any one acting for such Chief Engineer or the Chief Architect shall be subject to the approval of or modification or cancellation by the Minister of Public Works of Canada.\nClause 7 of the contract is as follows:\u2014\n7. The Engineer may, in writing, at any time before the final acceptance of the works, order any additional work, or materials or things, not covered by the contract, to be done or provided, or the whole or any portion of the works to be dispensed with, or any changes to be made which he may deem expedient, in, or in respect of the works hereby contracted for, or the plans, dimensions, character, quantity, quality, description, location or position of the works, or any portion or portions thereof, or in any materials or things connected therewith, or used or intended to be used therein, or in any other thing connected therewith, or used or intended to be used therein, or in any other thing connected with the works, whether or not the effect of such orders is to increase or diminish the work to be done or the materials or things to be provided or the cost of doing or providing the same; and the Engineer may, in such order, or from time to time as he may see fit, specify the time or times within which each order shall, in whole or in part, be complied with. The Contractor shall comply with every such order of the Engineer. The decision of the Engineer as to whether the compliance with such order increases or diminishes the work to be done or the materials or things to be provided, or the cost of doing or providing the same, and as to the amount to be paid or deducted, as the case may be, in respect thereof, shall be final. As a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to payment in respect of any such order of the Engineer, the Contractor shall obtain and produce the order, in writing, of the Engineer, and a certificate, in writing, of the Engineer, showing compliance with such order and fixing the amount to be paid or deducted in respect thereof.\nThe appellant saw the District Engineer on August 13, 1929, and received from the latter a copy of the plan with proposed amendments shewn in red ink. By these amendments it was proposed to eliminate the dredging, to take ten feet off the height of the timber portion of the crib, to level off the bottom with concrete and to build a talus of concrete. The appellant said that he asked for instructions in writing and for an extension in time, and he testified at the trial that the District Engineer said the instructions would follow. At the trial before the learned President the District Engineer, Thomas J. Locke, testified that on August 13, 1929, he did tell the appellant that he was substituting a change in the plan, which would involve a number of extras. He estimated a net difference of $600 in favour of the contractors, made up of the excess of extras over deductions.\nThe contractors, however, claimed that there was an entire change, and asked for a modification of the contract as to price and time for completion. On August 28, 1929, the District Engineer sent to the appellant a telegram reading as follows:\u2014\nKindly start bag concrete foundation for pier Barrington Passage. Allison advises by wire to notify your representative at Barrington to this effect.\nT. J. LOCKE.\nWritten instructions, however, were not forthcoming from the Chief Engineer and thus the date for completion came and went with matters in a deadlock. This was most unfortunate for the contractors. I agree with the finding of the learned President that the District Engineer could not alter the contract and that, in the absence of written instructions from the Chief Engineer, the contract remained to be executed according to the original contract, plan and specifications; that the alterations proposed were such as could be authorized only by the Chief Engineer, and, as he did not authorize them in writing, they were as ineffective as if they had never been proposed at all, and, as a consequence, the contract, plan and specifications remained as they were.\nIt must have been clear to the contractors that the power of the District Engineer was restricted by General Condition 37 and that the District Engineer had no power to order extra work or changes which would entail an increase or decrease in cost without authorization in writing by the Chief Engineer. Nor was the difficulty in dredging any answer to the contention of the respondent that there was default on September 1, 1929. The appellant was not misled in any way by the respondent before he undertook the work. Clause 32 of the General Conditions was clear. Even if the dredging was difficult or impossible without blasting, the contractors would not be excused.\nIn Thorn v. The Mayor and Commonalty of London[7], Lord Chelmsford said:\u2014\n[The builder] before he made his tender, ought to have informed himself of all the particulars connected with the work, and especially as to the practicability of executing every part of the work contained in the specification.\nSee also Connolly v. The City of Saint John[8]. It must be held, therefore, that there was default on September 1, 1929, and that the first contention of the appellant fails.\nIt is convenient now to set out clauses 19 and 20 of the contract:\u2014\n19. In case the Contractor shall make default or delay in commencing, or in diligently executing any of the works or portions thereof to be performed, or that may be ordered under this contract, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the Engineer may give a general notice to the Contractor requiring him to put an end to such default or delay, and should such default or delay continue for six days after such notice shall have been given by the Engineer to the Contractor, or should the Contractor make default in the completion of the works, or any portion thereof, within the time limited with respect thereto in or under this contract, or should the Contractor become insolvent, or abandon the work, or make an assignment of this contract without the consent required, or otherwise fail to observe and perform any of the provisions of this contract, then and in any of such cases, the Minister, for and on behalf of His Majesty, and without any further authorization, may take all the work out of the Contractor\u2019s hands and may employ such means as he, on His Majesty\u2019s behalf, may see fit to complete the works, and in such case the Contractor shall have no claim for any further payment in respect of work performed, but shall be chargeable with, and shall remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by His Majesty by reason of such default or delay, or the non-completion by the Contractor of the works, and no objection or claim shall be raised or made by the Contractor by reason, or on account of the ultimate cost of the works so taken over, for any reason proving greater than, in the opinion of the Contractor, it should have been; and all materials, articles and things whatsoever, and all horses, machinery, tools, plant and equipment, and all rights, proprietary or otherwise, licences, powers, and privileges, whether relating to or affecting real estate or personal property, acquired, possessed or provided by the Contractor for the purposes of the work, or by the Engineer under the provisions of this contract shall remain and be the property of His Majesty for all purposes incidental to the completion of the works, and may be used, exercised and enjoyed by His Majesty as fully to all intents and purposes connected with the works as they might therefor have been used, exercised and enjoyed by the Contractor; and the Minister may also, at his option, on behalf of His Majesty, sell or otherwise dispose of, at forced sale prices, or at public auction or private sale, or otherwise, the whole or any portion or number of such materials, articles, things, horses, machinery, tools, plant and equipment at such price or prices as he may see fit, and detain the proceeds of any such sale or disposition and all other amounts then or thereafter due by His Majesty to the Contractor on account of, or in part satisfaction of any loss or damage which His Majesty may sustain or have sustained by reason aforesaid.\n20. Whenever in this contract power or authority is given to His Majesty, the Minister, the Engineer or any person on behalf of His Majesty, to take any action consequent upon the insolvency of the Contractor or upon the acts, defaults, neglects, delays, breaches, non-observance or non-performance by the Contractor in respect of the works or any portion or details thereof, such powers or authorities may be exercised from time to time, and not only in the event of the happening of such contingencies before the time limited in this contract for the completion of the works, but also in the event of the same happening after the time so limited in the case of the Contractor being permitted to further proceed with the execution of the works.\nProvided always that after the expiration of the time limited for the completion of the works the Minister shall be sole judge as to what additional time, if any, may be allowed to the Contractor for such completion, and is decision as to the reasonableness or sufficiency thereof for the purpose of completion shall be final and binding upon the Contractor.\nOn September 11, 1929, the Engineer notified the Contractor in writing that if within six days satisfactory progress was not made, the work would be taken over and completed in pursuance of clause 19 of the contract. On September 25, 1929, as apparently the Contractors had not complied with that notice, the Engineer wrote them and advised them that it had been decided to take over the work, and that the materials, tools and equipment would thenceforth be the property of the Department of Public Works.\nAt this time Alexander R. Voye wrote the appellant an informal letter of withdrawal from their partnership.\nThe respondent then went ahead and constructed a pier at a cost very considerably in excess of the contract price above mentioned.\nAs the Minister was empowered by clause 19, for and on behalf of His Majesty, to take the works out of the Contractor\u2019s hands with the consequent forfeiture provided in that clause, it must be assumed that the forfeiture was the act of the Minister. Moreover the Minister resisted the claim of the suppliant in the Exchequer Court of Canada and in this Court. It must, therefore, be held that the second contention of the appellant fails.\nThe forfeiture of the contract and goods have just been discussed in connection with clause 19. As there was default on the part of the Contractors, it must be held that the deposit was forfeited under clause 54 of the contract, and the third contention of the appellant, therefore, fails.\nThe appellant lastly contended that the respondent did not apply the appellant\u2019s goods, and use the appellant\u2019s plant to complete the works mentioned in the contract, but for a new work substituted for the work called for under the contract, and for other purposes.\nIt may be true that the respondent did not complete the pier strictly in accordance with the original contract, plan and specifications. But the respondent did build a pier at the place designated on the plan, and the General Conditions and contract provided for very wide latitude in changing the original plan and specifications. See clauses 14 and 15 of the General Conditions, and clauses 7, 8 and 9 of the contract. Clause 8 of the contract is particularly in point. It reads as follows:\nAll the clauses of this contract shall apply to any changes, additions, deviations, or additional work, so ordered by the Engineer, in like manner, and to the same extent as to the works contracted for. J. K. McKay, a civil engineer, testified before the learned President that the respondent took over the crib which the appellant had worked upon and launched it upon the proposed site, and built upon it. There is, moreover, no evidence in the record that the respondent refused to return to the appellant, before the Petition of Right was launched, any of the appellant\u2019s goods or any of the appellant\u2019s plant not used up by the respondent, in accordance with the provisions of the contract. Clayton v. Le Roy[9]. Moreover, the appellant has not before this Court his partner, or former partner, Alexander R. Voye. The learned President gave leave to the appellant to join Alexander R. Voye, if possible, but the appellant has not taken advantage of that leave. Under the circumstances, however, this judgment will be without prejudice to any proceedings in proper form which the appellant may, if so advised, subsequently take against the respondent for the return of, or damages in respect of, any goods, tools or plant not used up by the respondent in accordance with the contract and improperly withheld.\nWith this variation the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

At trial, after answers by the jury to certain questions submitted, judgment was given dismissing the action (the ground being that appellants had agreed with R. without respondent\u2019s consent to extend the time for payment), which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 7 M.P.R. 89. On appeal to this Court:\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the evidence it could not be said that there was no reasonable basis for the jury\u2019s findings attacked by appellante.\nCertain objections by appellants, claiming misdirection, insufficient presentation of their case, and failure to direct in certain respects, in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, were held to be not justified.\nHeld, further, that, had there been any non-direction or insufficient direction, or if there should have been, as contended, a further question submitted to the jury, the appellants, having failed on the trial to make objection or to request the submission of any further question to the jury, were precluded in the circumstances of this case from raising objection on appeal. Nevili v. Fine Art & General Ins. Co., [1897] A.C. 68, at 76, Seaton v. Burnand, [1900] A.C. 135, at 143, cited.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Mellish J. (dismissing their action, following the trial of the action with a special jury), and dismissing their alternative application for a new trial. In the action the plaintiffs claimed from the defendant the sum of $37,269.25 and interest, upon a guarantee by the defendant of an account of one Dr. Rankine with the plaintiffs. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and G. F. Osler for the appellants.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014The appellants brought this action to recover the sum of $37,269.25 alleged to be due them on a stock trading account which they were carrying in their Halifax stock brokerage office for one Dr. John Rankine, and which the respondent agreed in writing dated November 20, 1929, to guarantee.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Mellish and a jury and dismissed on the ground that the appellants had agreed with the debtor without the consent of the respondent to extend the time for payment of the guaranteed account. This was the principal defence on which the respondent relied at the trial and in relation to which the learned judge left two questions to the jury, Nos. 3 and 4, as follows:\u2014\n3. Did plaintiffs through their manager agree with Dr. Rankine to extend the time for the payment of Dr. Rankine\u2019s account?\n4. If so, was it part of the consideration for said agreement that the plaintiffs should obtain the insurance which they did obtain from Dr. Rankine for plaintiffs\u2019 benefit?\nTo both these questions the jury answered \u201cyes.\u201d\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc the appellants contended that these findings were not warranted by the evidence. They also challenged the trial judgment on the ground that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury and that he did not sufficiently instruct the jury with respect to the subject-matter of these two questions and the evidence concerning them. This appeal was dismissed, Graham J. dissenting on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 case was not sufficiently presented to the jury by the learned trial judge. He agreed, however, that the jury\u2019s findings upon both questions could not be set aside as against evidence.\nThe same grounds are taken on this appeal.\nWe agree with the appeal judges that the findings on the two vital questions, 3 and 4, cannot well be set aside as not being reasonably warranted by the evidence. That an oral agreement was entered into between Dr. Rankine and Mr. White, manager of the appellants\u2019 Halifax branch, sometime during the fall of 1930, whereby the former promised to make regular payments of $400 a month for the carrying on of his account, is not disputed. The only substantial conflict between the two witnesses was as to whether Dr. Rankine agreed during this conversation or in a later conversation to procure and assign to the appellants life insurance to the amount of $20,000 or $24,000, and as to whether Dr. Rankine asked Mr. White if he kept on making these payments would he sell him out as soon as the appellants were clear or would they give him a chance in the event of the market coming back to get some of his own money back and the latter answered that he didn\u2019t think there would be the slightest question about that, that they would give him a chance or words to that effect Mr. White testified when first examined that He had no recollection of any such statement but that he wouldn\u2019t deny it was made. Later, when recalled in rebuttal, he did deny it, as he did that there was any mention of insurance in connection with the $400 payments. That Dr. Rankine did obtain and assign to the appellants on January 13, 1931, a policy of $20,000 and a week later another policy of $4,000 is admitted, as is also the fact that he made his first monthly payment of $400 on December 1, 1930, and continued to make regular monthly payments of $400 as agreed down to the time of the trial. Dr. Rankine\u2019s evidence, in so far at least as it concerned the granting of an extension of time until his indebtedness was discharged, was corroborated by the following statement contained in a letter addressed under date of November 18, 1930, by Mr. White to the respondent at Belmont, Mass.:\u2014\nWe have made an arrangement to help you in the matter of Dr. Rankine\u2019s account, by having obtained an agreement from him whereby he undertakes to pay us a minimum of $400 per month, these payments to be continued until his indebtedness is discharged.\nIt is not shewn that the respondent ever received this letter but in any event it was never acknowledged.\nIn the light of this evidence it can hardly be said that there was no reasonable basis for the jury\u2019s findings that the appellants through their manager agreed to extend the time for payment of Dr. Rankine\u2019s account and that it was part of the consideration for such agreement that Dr. Rankine should provide the insurance policies which he admittedly assigned to the appellants a few weeks later.\nAs to misdirection, objection is taken to the learned trial judge in his summing up of the evidence bearing on questions 3 and 4 attributing to Dr. Rankine more definite statements than he had in fact made. One observation of His Lordship was particularly stressed as being calculated to leave the impression on the jury that Dr. Rankine had absolutely sworn in terms that in consideration of his promise to pay $400 a month and to provide the life insurance Mr. White had agreed to give him an extension of time. An examination of that portion of the charge in which this observation was made shews that His Lordship was referring to the letter which Mr. White had written to the respondent on November 18, containing the reference above quoted to the agreement he was reporting that he and Dr. Rankine had made, but reporting it\u2014contrary to the evidence of either himself or Dr. Rankine\u2014as being subject to the depositing of further securities to the credit of the guaranteed account to properly margin it, and in this connection proposing that the respondent put up the required additional collateral and protect himself by means of insurance on Dr. Rankine\u2019s life. His Lordship immediately added to the statement complained of: \u201cNow that is what I understand to be roughly what Dr. Rankine says. Mr. White wrote Mr. McCartney something different from that.\u201d The whole passage was clearly intended as an exposition of the effect of the two conflicting versions of the oral agreement which had been entered into,\u2014first Dr. Rankine\u2019s and then Mr. White\u2019s as reported in the letter referred to. For my part I cannot see that it was in any way inappropriate or inaccurate. Moreover, His Lordship had very clearly stated to the jury that they had heard the evidence and that he might make some remarks about the evidence, as to what the evidence was, but that, unless what he stated conformed to their good judgment as to what the evidence was, they were to take their own view of it, and that if they had any doubt as to the evidence they could have any part of it they desired read by the stenographer. As a matter of fact he did on his own suggestion during the course of his charge have Dr. Rankine\u2019s cross-examination read by the stenographer, and he told the jury more than once that it was their sole duty to determine these questions of fact and that they were under no obligation to follow any views he might himself express of the evidence. Practically his last words to the jury were:\nIf I have expressed any view as to the evidence that does not commend itself to your judgment, take your own view; don\u2019t take mine.\nProbably the strongest statement excepted to as misdirection was the following:\u2014\nThen the policies come on afterwards and they are made out, as I understand it, payable to assigns of Johnston & Ward. They hold the policies. So the agreement that did go through was an agreement that was made with Dr. Rankine, and the agreement did not go through of which McCartney was to be a partner. I want you to get a proper view of it,\u2014Did the plaintiffs through their manager agree with Dr. Rankine to extend the time for the payment of Dr. Rankine\u2019s account? All I can say is, that they were to take $400 a month until it was liquidated and they were taking insurance on his life, so that they could get their money if he didn\u2019t live.\u2019 long enough to liquidate. It is pretty strong; evidence that they agreed to extend the time. I leave that question with you. It is objected that this was a definite direction that the agreement that did go through was an agreement that was made with Dr. Rankine and that the agreement did not go through of which McCartney was to be a partner. This is probably so, but can it properly be said to mean anything more than what the admitted facts established, viz.: that the appellants received and accepted the $400 regular monthly payments which Dr. Rankine testified he had promised to make, and did make right down to the time of the trial, and accepted as well insurance policies on his life, which Dr. Rankine testified he agreed to take out in response to Mr. White\u2019s proposal, and still held as valid subsisting policies at the time of the trial? It seems to me that it was an eminently proper consideration to put to a jury, who were called upon to decide whether the true version of the oral agreement was the one which Mr. White recorded in his letter to McCartney or the one to which Dr. Rankine had deposed on the trial, and that it amounted to no more than calling the jury\u2019s attention to the admitted facts and suggesting that the jury should determine which of the two conflicting versions best accorded with these indisputable facts.\nAfter a careful examination of the relevant evidence and the judge\u2019s charge I can discover nothing which can justifiably be characterized as a misquotation of the evidence in any material particular or any misdirection either as to law or fact.\nAs to non-direction the substantial objection is that the learned trial judge insufficiently presented the appellants\u2019 case and that he failed to direct the jury that an agreement to extend time for payment was not binding unless there was consideration therefor or to explain what consideration meant. The use of the word consideration in question 4, it was argued, made this necessary.\nFor my part I should not have thought that the learned judge in framing question 4 meant anything more than to get the jury\u2019s finding as to whether Dr. Rankine had promised as part of the bargain to provide the life insurance as well as to make the monthly $400 payments. It was the duty of the learned judge himself to decide the question of the validity and binding character of the promise as a question of law; not the jury\u2019s. Manifestly no direction which His Lordship could have given as to the legal meaning of consideration could have made any difference to the jury\u2019s view of the evidence of what was said between the parties. And, the jury having accepted Dr. Rankine\u2019s statement that he promised to provide the life insurance as well as to make the monthly payments, there could, in my opinion, be no doubt that such a promise constituted a valid and binding consideration for an agreement on the part of the appellants to extend the time until \u201chis (Rankine\u2019s) indebtedness was discharged,\u201d to use White\u2019s own words in recording his understanding of the agreement or \u201carrangement,\u201d as he described it in his letter to McCartney.\nIt was further contended that the learned trial judge should have submitted a question to the jury to ascertain whether the conversation regarding insurance took place at the time the arrangements for the $400 monthly payments were made.\nYet, notwithstanding the Nova Scotia Judicature Act expressly provides that the trial judge shall direct the jury to answer any question which counsel may require him to submit, counsel for the appellants on the trial made no request that he submit any other questions than those stated. Not only so, but he made no request for any direction upon the question of consideration, nor that His Lordship should call the jury\u2019s attention to any portion of Mr. White\u2019s or any other evidence bearing on questions 3 and 4 than that to which His Lordship had referred. Neither did he make any suggestion that His Lordship had misquoted any part of the testimony. Had there been any non-direction or insufficient direction, we think the appellants, having failed to make any objection at the proper time, are precluded in the circumstances of this case from raising the question on appeal. To quote the words of Lord Halsbury in Nevili v. Fine Art & General Ins. Co.[2]:\u2014\nWhere you are complaining of non-direction of the judge, or that he did not leave a question to the jury, if you had an opportunity of asking him to do it and you abstained from asking for it, no court would ever have granted you a new trial.\nSee also Seat on v. Burnand[3].\nWe think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L. A. Lovett.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. B.

Florant ([1925] S.C.R. 532). Marshall v. Fournelle ([1927] S.C.R. 48) and Kivenko v. Yagod ([1928] S.C.R. 421) also discussed and followed. The meaning of the expression \u201crestrained of his liberty\u201d, in article 1114 C.C.P., has been extended so as to include the case of a young child being kept in the custody of a person other than the one legally possessing authority and control upon that child; but the main question, to be decided in such cases as whether the child, according to the evidence, has been \u201cconfined or restrained of his liberty\u201d within the meaning of that article.\nThe circumstances of this case are as follows: The child is almost 15\u00bd years old; he possessed a sufficient degree of intelligence and gave expression to his wishes to stay with appellant in a \u201ccategorical manner\u201d which the trial judge found \u201creasonable\u201d, in the light of the circumstances of the case. After the mother\u2019s death when the child was one month old, the respondent (the father) voluntarily placed him in the care of his maternal grandmother and of his aunt, his mother\u2019s sister (the appellant\u2019s wife), the latter bringing him up with her own resources and always taking care of him with true maternal love. On the other hand, the respondent acted as if he was heedless or indifferent to his child\u2019s welfare; although living in the same city, he never went to see him and it was the appellant\u2019s wife who had to bring the child to him so that he could see his father. The appellant, although wishing to keep the child, added in the pleadings that the latter remained with him of his own free will, that he was not deprived of his liberty and that he was free to go back to the respondent if he so desired.\nHeld that, in the circumstances of this case, this court ought not to interfere with the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in dismissing the writ of habeas corpus; although the child will always be free to go back to his father, the respondent, this court cannot declare that he is \u201cconfined\u201d or \u201crestrained of his liberty\u201d.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The question to be decided is not simply whether the minor child is \u201cconfined or restrained of his liberty\u201d, but rather if his stay elsewhere than with his father or mother is contrary to law. The existence of illegal detention must be declared when paternal authority, which exists mainly for the benefit of the child and not for the exclusive advantage of the father, is unduly interfered with. Therefore that authority must always be upheld whenever a change in his present conditions would obviously be advantageous to the child. On the other hand, when the child is old enough to be capable of a judicious choice and further, when the circumstances show that his moral, religious, intellectual and physical interests would be safeguarded by the ratification of his choice, the Court may find that there is no ground for the habeas corpus. But, in such a case, the legality of the child\u2019s stay elsewhere than with his parent must be established. It must be said, that in the light of all the circumstances, \u201cparental\u201d authority has to give way to the authority of the Court, representative of the Sovereign \u201cparens patriae\u201d, whenever it is in the child\u2019s interest.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 54 K.B. 82) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec,[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Patterson J., and maintaining a writ of habeas corpus, issued at the request of the respondent, the father, to recover the custody of his minor child.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Antoine Garneau for the appellant.\nGustave Monette K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff \u0421.J. and Rinfret, Lamont and Crocket JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9, p\u00e8re et tuteur de L\u00e9o Lefebvre, all\u00e9guant que ce dernier \u00e9tait actuellement d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 la maison de l\u2019appelant \u201ccontre le gr\u00e9, la volont\u00e9 et le consentement de votre requ\u00e9rant\u201d (i.e. de l\u2019intim\u00e9), a demand\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref adress\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et lui enjoignant de conduire L\u00e9o Lefebvre devant la cour pour\nfaire voir la cause de cette, d\u00e9tention et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par ledit Jules Dugal de justifier telle d\u00e9tention, ledit L\u00e9o Lefebvre soit mis en libert\u00e9 et remis \u00e0 votre requ\u00e9rant.\nPour \u00e9viter tout ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 au cours de ce jugement, nous allons d\u00e9signer le p\u00e8re sous le nom de requ\u00e9rant, et l\u2019appelant sous le nom de d\u00e9fendeur.\nSur le rapport du bref, le d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9clarait\nd\u00e9tenir l\u2019enfant parce que le p\u00e8re dudit enfant est indigne de sa garde. Mais, \u00e0 la suite de plaidoires \u00e9crites produites de part et d\u2019autre, il fut proc\u00e9d\u00e9 devant le juge \u00e0 une longue enqu\u00eate sur le d\u00e9bat engag\u00e9 entre les parties dans leur contestation.\nCette contestation soulevait trois points principaux:\n1. L\u2019enfant, il est vrai, \u00e9tait chez le d\u00e9fendeur \u201cmais de son plein gr\u00e9 et nullement contre le consentement dudit enfant\u201d. L\u2019enfant \u201cn\u2019est pas priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9\u201d; il a \u2018\u201cle droit d\u2019en jouir selon son bon plaisir, il est libre d\u2019aller chez le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019il le d\u00e9sire\u201d.\n2. Le requ\u00e9rant, \u00e0 cause de sa \u201cconduite irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re\u201d, est indigne de la garde de son enfant.\n3. Il est de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat physique, moral et intellectuel de l\u2019enfant de demeurer avec le d\u00e9fendeur et son \u00e9pouse.\nLa conclusion de la plaidoirie \u00e9crite du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait\nqu\u2019il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ledit enfant, Louis-L\u00e9o Lefebvre, n\u2019est pas priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9 et que le d\u00e9fendeur en cette cause ne le d\u00e9tient pas ill\u00e9galement ni d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on, et qu\u2019il est de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant de continuer de vivre avec\nle d\u00e9fendeur (appelant devant cette cour).\nDevant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, le bref d\u2019habeas corpus fut annul\u00e9. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance trouva le requ\u00e9rant indigne de la garde de son enfant. Il jugea, en outre, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant de rester chez le d\u00e9fendeur; et, sur la question de d\u00e9tention\u2014\u0441 est le point sur lequel nous voulons insister\u2014il d\u00e9cida comme suit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que ledit enfant n\u2019est pas retenu contre son gr\u00e9 chez ledit intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, devant cette Cour, vouloir vivre avec ses parents adoptifs, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019avec son p\u00e8re, et que ce d\u00e9sir exprim\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on cat\u00e9gorique est raisonnable, vu les circonstances du proc\u00e8s;\n* * *\nConsid\u00e9rant que pour les raisons ci-dessus le p\u00e8re est indigne de la garde de son enfant, \u00e9tant de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de celui-ci de rester dans le milieu o\u00f9 il se trouve aujourd\u2019hui, et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune contrainte, ni de fait ni de droit, pour l\u2019enlever du milieu o\u00f9 il d\u00e9sire demeurer pour le transporter dans un milieu o\u00f9 il refuse \u00e0 bon droit d\u2019aller;\nOr, le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, par lequel celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est infirm\u00e9, ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 cette question de contrainte. Le cour diff\u00e9ra du juge de premi\u00e8re instance dans \u013eappr\u00e9ciation des faits relatifs \u00e0 \u013eindignit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re, elle trouva qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de \u013eenfant ne serait pas sauvegard\u00e9 s\u2019il retournait chez son p\u00e8re; et elle fut d\u2019avis, d\u00e8s lors, qu\u2019il ne subsistait aucun motif d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019exercice de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 paternelle. Il faut pour cela \u2014comme elle le dit \u00e0 bon droit\u2014des raisons s\u00e9rieuses et exceptionnelles; et l\u2019on ne saurait faire pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 rencontre le simple d\u00e9sir de l\u2019enfant. Ce principe nous para\u00eet inattaquable. Mais le jugement ne se prononce nullement sur la question de savoir si, en \u013eesp\u00e8ce, il y avait contrainte et si \u013eenfant pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u201cd\u00e9tenu\u201d et \u201cpriv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9\u201d.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 la principale question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur lors de l\u2019audition devant cette cour.\nIl ne saurait faire de doute que le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019est adress\u00e9 au tribunal en vertu de l\u2019article 1114 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Une requ\u00eate de ce genre est autoris\u00e9e par cet article\ndans tous les cas o\u00f9 une personne est emprisonn\u00e9e ou priv\u00e9e de sa libert\u00e9, autrement qu\u2019en vertu d\u2019une ordonnance en mati\u00e8re civile rendue par un tribunal ou un juge comp\u00e9tent, ou que pour une mati\u00e8re criminelle ou suppos\u00e9e criminelle.\nCette requ\u00eate est\naux fins d\u2019obtenir un bref adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la personne sous la garde de Laquelle elle se trouve emprisonn\u00e9e ou d\u00e9tenue, lui enjoignant de la conduire sans d\u00e9lai devant le juge qui a d\u00e9cern\u00e9 le bref, ou devant tout autre juge du m\u00eame \u00a1tribunal et de faire valoir la cause de d\u00e9tention afin de faire constater si elle est justifiable.\nPar extension, l\u2019on a assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 une privation de sa libert\u00e9 le fait pour un enfant en bas \u00e2ge d\u2019\u00eatre sous la garde d\u2019une personne autre que celle \u00e0 qui la loi conf\u00e8re cette autorit\u00e9 et ce contr\u00f4le. C\u2019est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle nous en sommes arriv\u00e9s dans le jugement de Stevenson v. Florant[2], qu\u2019il faut lire naturellement avec les pr\u00e9cisions apport\u00e9es par le Conseil Priv\u00e9[3].\nCette cause soulevait m\u00eame une question sp\u00e9ciale: le conflit entre les droits d\u2019une m\u00e8re et ceux d\u2019un tuteur sur la personne d\u2019une fille mineure. Nous n\u2019y avons vu aucune objection \u00e0 trancher ce d\u00e9bat accessoire dans une esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 les parties avaient eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de faire valoir tous leurs moyens et o\u00f9 la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e n\u2019avait pu causer le moindre pr\u00e9judice (pp. 538 et 539); et ce point de vue fut partag\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 (p. 216).\nMais le d\u00e9bat principal consistait \u00e9videmment \u00e0 discuter si l\u2019enfant se trouvait \u201cemprisonn\u00e9e ou d\u00e9tenue\u201d, tel qu\u2019il est pourvu \u00e0 l\u2019article 1114 C.P.C. Le tuteur, qui avait sous sa garde l\u2019enfant \u00e2g\u00e9e de neuf ans, pr\u00e9tendit que le bref d\u2019habeas corpus n\u2019\u00e9tait pas recevable pour d\u00e9cider la question de la d\u00e9tention des enfants mineurs, que l\u2019article 1114 C.P.C. ne s\u2019appliquait pas en pareil cas, et qu\u2019il fallait recourir \u00e0 l\u2019action ordinaire au moyen d\u2019un bref de sommation (voir R.J.Q. 38 B.R., au bas de la page 316, et toute la discussion devant cette cour, depuis la page 539).\nIl nous a donc fallu d\u00e9cider le point de droit ainsi soulev\u00e9 par le tuteur. Nous avons alors fait remarquer que le bref d\u2019habeas corpus \u00e9tait essentiellement un bref d\u2019enqu\u00eate ayant \u201cpour but d\u2019examiner les causes de d\u00e9tention et de constater s\u2019il y a contrainte\u201d (p. 544). Apr\u00e8s avoir signal\u00e9 \u201cqu\u2019il faut \u00e9viter de confondre entre la recevabilit\u00e9 du bref et la question de savoir s\u2019il devra \u00eatre maintenu\u201d apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate du juge, nous avons conclu que l\u2019habeas corpus \u00e9tait l\u2019instrument appropri\u00e9 pour d\u00e9cider\ns\u2019il y avait, au sens o\u00f9 l\u2019on entend ces mots pour les enfante mineurs, privation de leur libert\u00e9.\nDans la cause de Stevenson[4], il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une enfant de neuf ans; et, comme l\u2019a fait justement observer M. le juge Rivard, re Marshall v. Fournelle[5]:\nla, garde d\u2019un mineur, sans contrainte r\u00e9elle exerc\u00e9e sur sa libert\u00e9, ne peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e au cas de d\u00e9tention forc\u00e9e que lorsque l\u2019enfant n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e0 faire un choix judicieux, ou qu\u2019il ne sait pas juger sainement de son propre int\u00e9r\u00eat; on peut alors justement pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019option, inconsciente ou non, de l\u2019enfant est due \u00e0 l\u2019influence de celui qui le garde sans droit, et dire qu\u2019il y a une sorte de contrainte morale ou de d\u00e9tention. La jurisprudence, et sp\u00e9cialement l\u2019arr\u00eat ci-dessus cit\u00e9 de la Cour Supr\u00eame (Stevenson v. Florant4), ne me paraissent pas aller plus loin.\nPour Gertrude Stevenson, toutes les cours ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le cas \u00e9tait assimilable \u00e0 une contrainte, \u00e0 une privation de libert\u00e9. Mais il ne faut pas perdre de vue le but essentiel du bref d\u2019habeas corpus et que le tribunal demeure oblig\u00e9 de s\u2019assurer que la contrainte existe, s\u2019inspirant, comme nous le disions,\nd\u2019une discr\u00e9tion restreinte, bas\u00e9e sur certaines conditions d\u2019\u00e2ge et d\u2019intelligence de l\u2019enfant, en tenant compte des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 chaque cas particulier (p. 544).\nNous croyons ce principe d\u00e9sormais \u00e9tabli. Il fut r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise dans la cause de Marshall v. Fournelle[6] d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e). Catherine Marshall devait avoir quinze ans dans les quelques jours qui suivaient le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que, par son \u00e2ge et son intelligence, elle \u00e9tait dans les conditions voulues pour bien comprendre ce qu\u2019elle faisait; et qu\u2019en persistant \u00e0 vouloir demeurer l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait, elle ne paraissait pas \u201cagir par caprice mais par un sentiment que l\u2019on peut estimer l\u00e9gitime\u201d. Il avait, en cons\u00e9quence, refus\u00e9 \u201cd\u2019intervenir dans le choix qu\u2019elle a fait de demeurer chez \u013eintim\u00e9\u201d; et il avait rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate pour bref d\u2019habeas corpus.\nM. le juge Tellier, maintenant juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, apr\u00e8s avoir fait observer\nque le bref d\u2019habeas corpus ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour contraindre un enfant de 14 ans, s\u2019il jouit de ses facult\u00e9s, \u00e0 suivre son p\u00e8re ou sa m\u00e8re,\nconclut que, dans ce cas, c\u2019\u00e9tait avec raison que le bref obtenu par la demanderesse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cass\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par cette cour[7]. On pourrait en rapprocher ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit de nouveau par la Cour du Banc du Roi re Kivenko v. Yagod[8], \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 par cette cour[9].\nNous ajouterions, d\u2019ailleurs, que cette cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9sulte forc\u00e9ment de la nature m\u00eame de la proc\u00e9dure. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une action intent\u00e9e par le p\u00e8re contre son enfant pour le forcer \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre son autorit\u00e9 paternelle contradictoirement avec lui et pour le contraindre \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le domicile. Dans ce cas, il y aurait lieu de se demander s\u2019il ne faudrait pas nommer \u00e0 l\u2019enfant un tuteur ad hoc pour repr\u00e9senter ses int\u00e9r\u00eats devant le tribunal. Dans \u013ehabeas corpus, en principe, c\u2019est la personne priv\u00e9e de sa libert\u00e9 qui, elle-m\u00eame, s\u2019adresse au juge pour faire constater si la cause de sa d\u00e9tention est justifiable. Le code permet cependant qu\u2019un autre le fasse pour elle; mais, alors, la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour le compte de cette personne et le v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9bat s\u2019\u00e9tablit entre cette derni\u00e8re et le pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9tenteur. La fonction du bref est de permettre au juge de faire enqu\u00eate sur la question de savoir s\u2019il y a d\u00e9tention, d\u2019examiner la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et d\u2019adjuger en cons\u00e9quence (Art. 1119 C.P.C.). A cette fin, le tribunal doit s\u2019entourer de tous les renseignements qui lui paraissent utiles pour s\u2019\u00e9clairer; et les plaidoiries \u00e9crites dont il ordonne la production, ainsi que l\u2019instruction \u00e0 laquelle il est subs\u00e9quemment proc\u00e9d\u00e9, ont principalement pour but de l\u2019aider \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019intervenir et d\u2019ordonner ce que de droit. La d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de rendre est souvent fort d\u00e9licate et d\u00e9pend dans une large mesure de l\u2019exercice d\u2019une sage discr\u00e9tion\u2014discr\u00e9tion judiciaire, bien entendu, mais que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est mieux plac\u00e9 pour exercer, parce qu\u2019il a l\u2019avantage de voir les personnes et qu\u2019il est m\u00eal\u00e9 de plus pr\u00e8s aux circonstances sp\u00e9ciales de chaque cause. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019a reconnu d\u2019ailleurs M. le juge Hall, qui a prononc\u00e9, en la pr\u00e9sente cause, le jugement auquel s\u2019est ralli\u00e9e la majorit\u00e9 de la cour. Mais, alors qu\u2019il admet que ce serait l\u00e0 le motif qui a inspir\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Marshall v. Fournelle[10], nous ne nous expliquons pas pourquoi la m\u00eame tigne de conduite n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie dans la cause actuelle, o\u00f9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9galement us\u00e9 de sa discr\u00e9tion pour rejeter le bref d\u2019habeas corpus et o\u00f9 la diff\u00e9rence d\u2019\u00e2ge et des autres circonstances environnantes n\u2019est pas suffisamment marqu\u00e9e pour entra\u00eener un r\u00e9sultat contraire.\nIci, l\u2019enfant dont il est question a maintenant tout pr\u00e8s de quinze ans et demi. Il nous para\u00eet d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il a toute l\u2019intelligence requise pour que l\u2019on doive tenir compte de ses sentiments. Il les a exprim\u00e9s \u201cd\u2019une fa\u00e7on cat\u00e9gorique\u201d et que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a trouv\u00e9e raisonnable, vu les circonstances du proc\u00e8s\u201d. Ils ne sont pas le fruit d\u2019un caprice ou d\u2019une fantaisie, mais ils semblent appuy\u00e9s sur les motifs les plus judicieux.\nImm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la mort de sa m\u00e8re, alors que l\u2019enfant avait un mois, son p\u00e8re l\u2019a volontairement confi\u00e9 \u00e0 sa grand\u2019m\u00e8re maternelle et \u00e0 sa tante, la s\u0153ur de sa m\u00e8re. La grand\u2019m\u00e8re \u00e9tait sans moyens et vivait aux crochets de cette derni\u00e8re. C\u2019est sa tante, qui est maintenant l\u2019\u00e9pouse du d\u00e9fendeur, qui en a toujours eu soin et qui l\u2019a \u00e9lev\u00e9 de ses propres ressources. La preuve est unanime \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019elle a tenu \u00e0 son \u00e9gard une conduite \u201cadmirable\u201d. Elle a eu pour lui les attentions les plus suivies. Elle l\u2019a entour\u00e9 d\u2019un amour vraiment maternel. Suivant l\u2019expression de l\u2019un des juges d\u2019appel: Elle \u201ca bien pr\u00e9cieusement conserv\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait\u201d.\nPendant ce temps, le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019est compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 de son enfant. Il demeurait dans la m\u00eame ville et\u2014si nous ne nous trompons\u2014dans la m\u00eame localit\u00e9; et cependant il n\u2019est jamais all\u00e9 le voir. L\u2019enfant lui-m\u00eame fait la remarque qu\u2019il n\u2019a rencontr\u00e9 son p\u00e8re que \u201cune fois ou deux par ann\u00e9e\u201d. Chaque fois, c\u2019\u00e9tait Mme Dugal qui \u00e9tait \u201call\u00e9e le conduire pour que l\u2019enfant voit son p\u00e8re\u201d. Le requ\u00e9rant a agi comme s\u2019il \u00e9tait indiff\u00e9rent et insouciant du sort de son enfant. Il ne para\u00eet pas s\u2019\u00eatre jamais occup\u00e9\u2014pour ne pas dire: pr\u00e9occup\u00e9\u2014de sa sant\u00e9, de son bien-\u00eatre, de son \u00e9ducation, de son instruction. Sur la question de savoir s\u2019il a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa subsistance, la preuve est rest\u00e9e pour le moins ind\u00e9cise. Les fils du requ\u00e9rant disent qu\u2019ils ont eu connaissance de certains paiements. Mme Dugal affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais pay\u00e9 pour la pension. Elle assure n\u2019avoir re\u00e7u en tout que la somme de cinquante dollars, qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en banque au nom de l\u2019enfant. Ni la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ni la Cour du Banc du Roi n\u2019ont tranch\u00e9 ce point de fait. Le requ\u00e9rant aurait pu l\u2019\u00e9lucider, mais il a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ne pas rendre t\u00e9moignage. Sur cette question, comme sur toutes les autres, il a laiss\u00e9 le tribunal dans l\u2019ignorance de tout ce qu\u2019il connaissait, de tout ce qu\u2019il pouvait avoir fait et de tout ce qu\u2019il entendait faire pour l\u2019enfant. Il ne saurait se plaindre maintenant si son abstention l\u2019a plac\u00e9 sous un jour d\u00e9favorable. Sans chercher \u00e0 accabler le requ\u00e9rant, dont il faut, par ailleurs, reconna\u00eetre les nombreux m\u00e9rites et qui \u00e9videmment a fort bien \u00e9lev\u00e9 ses autres enfants, il est malheureusement difficile (parce que c\u2019est notre devoir) de lui \u00e9viter le reproche qu\u2019il para\u00eet avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9 et abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019enfant qui est en cause. L\u2019autorit\u00e9 paternelle n\u2019accorde pas seulement des droits, elle comporte aussi des devoirs. Ils sont inscrits dans le code. Et si les parents d\u00e9sirent que les tribunaux les aident \u00e0 conserver l\u2019affection et l\u2019attachement de leurs enfants, il faut au moins qu\u2019eux-m\u00eames s\u2019y int\u00e9ressent. Sans entrer dans la discussion des faits d\u2019inconduite\u2014sur lesquels nous sommes dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 donner au requ\u00e9rant le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019opinion de la Cour du Banc du Roi\u2014le dossier r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fort peu soucieux de ses devoirs envers son enfant, et il a laiss\u00e9 clore l\u2019enqu\u00eate sans en fournir la moindre explication personnelle. Il \u00e9tait strictement dans l\u2019ordre que son silence f\u00fbt interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 contre lui. Et il y a eu lieu de se demander s\u2019il a conscience de s\u2019\u00eatre montr\u00e9 digne de \u013eexercice de \u013eautorit\u00e9 paternelle dont il revendique si tardivement les droits.\nQuant \u00e0 \u013eattitude du d\u00e9fendeur, elle est exprim\u00e9e dans sa plaidoirie \u00e9crite, que le juge saisi du bref \u013ea autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 produire et qui explique la r\u00e9ponse contenue dans le rapport. Il d\u00e9sire garder \u013eenfant, qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 comme son enfant et dont il entend faire son h\u00e9ritier; mais celui-ci est \u201ctr\u00e8s volontiers de rester\u201d chez lui. L\u2019enfant est l\u00e0 de son plein gr\u00e9 et nullement contre son consentement; il n\u2019est pas priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9 et il est libre d\u2019aller chez le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019il le d\u00e9sire. L\u2019enfant, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 dans les conditions requises d\u2019\u00e2ge et d\u2019intelligence, corrobore les d\u00e9clarations du d\u00e9fendeur. A notre humble avis, il n\u2019y a pas lieu ici, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait lieu dans la cause de Marshall v. Fournelle[11], d\u2019intervenir dans la discr\u00e9tion exerc\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance. En cela, nous croyons faire une application exacte des principes pos\u00e9s dans cette cause ainsi que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de Stevenson v. Florant[12], r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s depuis dans celui plus r\u00e9cent de Kivenko v. Yagod[13]. Nous endossons les observations si justes faites dans ces causes par les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, et notamment celles de M. le juge-en-chef Tellier et celles de M. le juge Rivard, sur le principe de \u013eautorit\u00e9 paternelle. Mais, comme eux, nous ne voyons pas comment, dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause, et sur une requ\u00eate qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, est faite au nom et pour le compte de \u013eenfant, nous pouvons mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nIl doit \u00eatre bien compris que l\u2019enfant reste libre de retourner chez son p\u00e8re; mais nous ne pouvons d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il est \u201cd\u00e9tenu\u201d et que le d\u00e9fendeur le \u201cprive de sa libert\u00e9\u201d, ni, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019il y a lieu de maintenir le bref d\u2019habeas corpus; et nous devons faire droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel en r\u00e9tablissant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Cependant, comme nous ne donnons raison au d\u00e9fendeur que sur l\u2019un des points soulev\u00e9s par sa contestation et que l\u2019enqu\u00eate a port\u00e9 sur un grand nombre d\u2019autres faits, nous croyons faire justice en d\u00e9cidant que chaque partie devra supporter ses frais d\u2019enqu\u00eate, mais le requ\u00e9rant devra payer les autres frais en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ainsi que les frais devant la Cour du Banc du Roi et devant cette Cour. Cannon, J.\u2014Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 soigneusement la jurisprudence de cette cour dans les causes analogues: Stevenson v. Floran[14]; confirm\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9[15]; Marshall v. Fournelle[16]; et Kivenko v. Yagod (4)[17], je crois devoir dire que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de Stevenson v. Florant14 par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans les deux autres causes me semble avoir restreint la port\u00e9e de cette d\u00e9cision. Il ne s\u2019agit pas simplement de d\u00e9cider si le mineur est emprisonn\u00e9 ou priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9, mais bien plut\u00f4t si son s\u00e9jour ailleurs que chez son p\u00e8re ou sa m\u00e8re est contraire \u00e0 la loi. A mon avis, il y a d\u00e9tention ill\u00e9gale si \u013eautorit\u00e9 paternelle, qui existe surtout pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de \u013eenfant, et non pour l\u2019avantage exclusif du p\u00e8re, est ind\u00fbment entrav\u00e9e. Il faut donc dans chaque \u00a1cas seconder cette autorit\u00e9 si elle peut s\u2019exercer pour l\u2019avantage \u00e9vident de \u013eenfant en changeant sa situation actuelle. Si, d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019enfant est d\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e0 faire un choix judicieux, si, de plus, les circonstances d\u00e9montrent que son int\u00e9r\u00eat moral, religieux, intellectuel et physique est sauvegard\u00e9 en ratifiant son choix, la cour peut d\u00e9clarer que le recours par habeas corpus est mal fond\u00e9. Mais, dans ce cas, il faut pouvoir conclure \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du s\u00e9jour de l\u2019enfant ailleurs que chez son parent. Il faut pouvoir dire que, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u201cparentale\u201d doit c\u00e9der \u00e0 \u013eautorit\u00e9 du tribunal repr\u00e9sentant le souverain parens patrice, quand l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de \u013eenfant \u013eexige. Je crois qu\u2019il est maintenant admis par la doctrine que les droits et pouvoirs du p\u00e8re et de la m\u00e8re sur la personne des enfants mineurs ne leur sont accord\u00e9s que comme cons\u00e9quence des lourds devoirs qu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 remplir et n\u2019ont d\u2019autre but que de leur rendre possible l\u2019entretien et l\u2019\u00e9ducation de \u013eenfant. C\u2019est pour la protection de l\u2019enfant que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u201cparentale\u201d existe. La cour peut donc, en certains cas exceptionnels, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9vident de l\u2019enfant, refuser de contraindre ce dernier, malgr\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 librement exprim\u00e9e, \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 son domicile l\u00e9gal, s\u2019il est raisonnable de croire que la demeure actuelle procurera au moins les m\u00eames avantages de la part de personnes b\u00e9n\u00e9voles que la loi n\u2019oblige pas \u00e0 pourvoir \u00e0 son logement et \u00e0 ses autres besoins. Dans \u013eesp\u00e8ce, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en faveur de la r\u00e9sidence chez \u013eappelant. Le p\u00e8re ne s\u2019est pas fait entendre et semble avoir compt\u00e9 sur la lettre de la loi, sans prendre la peine de d\u00e9montrer au tribunal qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en mesure d\u2019assurer ou d\u2019am\u00e9liorer le sort de son enfant en le reprenant chez lui, m\u00eame contre son gr\u00e9. L\u2019esprit de la loi\u2014et le requ\u00e9rant l\u2019a oubli\u00e9\u2014n\u2019est pas favorable \u00e0 l\u2019exercice arbitraire de son autorit\u00e9 quand les circonstances exigent de fortes raisons pour bouleverser la situation faite au mineur par l\u2019acte m\u00eame du p\u00e8re en le confiant, d\u00e8s son bas \u00e2ge, \u00e0 des parents de sa d\u00e9funte femme. En pr\u00e9sence du t\u00e9moignage de cet enfant ayant d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e2ge de discr\u00e9tion, le silence du p\u00e8re n\u2019est pas assez convaincant pour nous faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. La Cour du Banc du Roi a pass\u00e9 outre en. refusant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le droit de contester l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du p\u00e8re. On a sembl\u00e9 oublier que c\u2019est le requ\u00e9rant qui a amen\u00e9 l\u2019appelant devant le tribunal pour expliquer la pr\u00e9sence chez lui de cet enfant. D\u00e8s le rapport du bref, le juge devait faire son enqu\u00eate pour d\u00e9cider si la plainte faite par le p\u00e8re pour le fils en vertu de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u201cparentale\u201d \u00e9tait bien dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce dernier. L\u2019on a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 la satisfaction du premier juge qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas d\u00e9tention contraire \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi, que l\u2019exercice de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du requ\u00e9rant, dans les circonstances, allait, non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du libre choix, mais \u00e9tait aussi contre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant. Comme dans la cause de Marshall v. Fournelle[18], l\u2019on peut consid\u00e9rer ici que ce jeune homme ne para\u00eet pas agir par caprice, mais par un sentiment que l\u2019on peut estimer \u00eatre l\u00e9gitime, et aussi qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame du mineur, d\u2019intervenir dans le choix qu\u2019il a fait de demeurer chez l\u2019appelant et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence la requ\u00eate pour habeas corpus \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit.\nLe jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Stevenson v. Florant[19] m\u2019oblige \u00e0 conclure que, dans certains cas, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 \u201cparentale\u201d doit c\u00e9der quand l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant l\u2019exige\u2014bien que je fusse d\u2019abord plut\u00f4t port\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer, dans sa rigueur, l\u2019article 243 du code civil. Rien n\u2019emp\u00eache le p\u00e8re ou le fils, si les circonstances changent, de s\u2019adresser de nouveau \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pour obtenir, sur requ\u00eate all\u00e9guant des faits nouveaux, un autre bref d\u2019habeas corpus pour une enqu\u00eate au sujet de sa situation nouvelle, si, par exemple, Dugal manquait \u00e0 la promesse contenue dans son plaidoyer de continuer \u00e0 nourrir, \u00e9lever et entretenir \u013eenfant \u00e0 \u013eavenir comme par le pass\u00e9.\nJe crois donc, comme mon coll\u00e8gue, \u013ehonorable juge Rinfret, que nous devons faire droit \u00e0 \u013eappel en r\u00e9tablissant le dispositif de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; et j\u2019adopterais aussi sa d\u00e9cision quant aux frais.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bertrand, Gu\u00e9rin, Goudrault & Garneau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Patenaude, Monette, Filion & Patenaude.\n[1] (1932) Q.R. 54 K.B. 82.\n[2] [1925] S.C.R. 532.\n[3] [1927] A.C. 211.\n[4] [1925] S.C.R. 532.\n[5] (1926) Q.R. 40 K.B. 391, at 396 and 397.\n4 [19251 S.C.R. 532.\n[6] (1926) Q.R. 40 K.B. 391, at 396 and 397.\n[7] [1927] S.C.R. 48.\n[8] (1928) Q.R. 44 K.B. 330.\n[9] [1928] S.C.R. 421.\n[10] (1926) Q.R. 40 K.B. 391.\n[11] (1926) Q.R. 40 K.B. 391.\n[12] [1925] S.C.R. 532.\n[13] [1928] S.C.R. 421.\n[14] [1925] S.C.R. 532.\n[15] [1927] A.C. 216.\n[16] [1927] S.C.R. 48.\n[17] [1928] S.C.R. 421.\n14 [1925] S.C.R. 532.\n[18] [1927] S.C.R. 48.\n[19] [1927] A.C. 211.\n"}

Emma (who was a sick person and could not have children) died unmarried, in 1930. Louisa died without children, in 1925, leaving all her property to her two sisters, Rose de Lima and Lea, with substitution as to the share of Lea in favour of Rose de Lima. Joseph also died in 1925, but his estate is not involved in the present case. Lea died unmarried in 1930, leaving all\u2019 her property to Rose de Lima. The only children of the testatrix living at the time of the institution of this action were the appellant and the respondent. The latter claimed that, under the will, she was entitled to the whole of the interests of both Louisa and Lea in the estate of her mother, including what both had received from Emma\u2019s share. The appellant, on the other hand, claimed that the will created a compendious substitution i.e., both vulgar and fiduciary (Arts. 925-926 C.C.) in favour of the surviving children of the testatrix when one of these children died after the testatrix, without leaving any children, and that accordingly he was entitled to share equally with the respondent in the shares of Louisa and Lea. The material clauses of the will are quoted in the judgment; but the clause, which is to be interpreted and upon which the appellant mainly relied, was in the following words: \u201cdans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants, la part du d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 accro\u00eetra \u00e0 mes autres l\u00e9gataires universels survivants\u201d (in case of decease without children the share of the deceased will be added to the shares of my other universal legatees surviving). The respondent\u2019s claim was maintained by the trial judge, whose judgment was unanimously affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld: That the respondent, was alone entitled to the whole of the interests of her sisters Louisa and Lea in the estate of her mother, including what both had received from Emma\u2019s share, thus affirming the decisions of the trial and the appellate courts, and that the above quoted clause did not create a fiduciary substitution as claimed by the appellant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, P.

Joseph est mort la m\u00eame arm\u00e9e, mais sa succession n\u2019est pas en question.

La Marquise de Pompadour fit son testament le 15 novembre 1757. Apr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents legs particuliers, elle s\u2019exprimait ainsi:\nQuant au surplus de mes biens meubles et immeubles, de quelque nature et en quelque lieu qu\u2019ils soient situ\u00e9s, je les donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 M. le Marquis de Marigny, mon fr\u00e8re, que je fais et institue mon l\u00e9gataire universel; et, en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de mon fr\u00e8re sans enfants, je mets en son lieu et place M. Poisson de Malvoisin, mar\u00e9chal-des-logis de l\u2019arm\u00e9e, et ses enfants.\nIl fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 2 juillet 1766, que ni le sieur de Malvoisin, ni ses enfants, n\u2019\u00e9taient substitu\u00e9s fid\u00e9icommissairement, quoique la testatrice les e\u00fbt mis \u00e0 la place de son l\u00e9gataire universel, au cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de celui-ci sans post\u00e9rit\u00e9. Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire de jurisprudence, vo. Substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, vol. 32, page 151, met en doute l\u2019exactitude de cette d\u00e9cision. Il se demande s\u2019il est bien vrai que les termes \u201cau cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s\u201d, joints \u00e0 ceux-ci: \u201cje mets \u00e0 la place\u201d, ne marquent pas le trait de temps, ou l\u2019ordre successif, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019ils appellent le substitu\u00e9 en second ordre et apr\u00e8s que l\u2019institu\u00e9 ou l\u00e9gataire imm\u00e9diat aura recueilli. Ne peut-on pas aussi bien r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s apr\u00e8s avoir recueilli qu\u2019au cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans avoir recueilli la condition \u00e9ventuelle qu\u2019ils expriment?\nThevenot d\u2019Essaule, \u201cTrait\u00e9 des substitutions\u201d, chapitre XXIII, \u00a74, ne pense pas autrement:\n441. Ainsi, quoiqu\u2019il y ait simplement, j\u2019institue un tel, et \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ou apr\u00e8s sa mort, je substitue un tel il y a substitution compendieuse.\nN on oportet, dit P\u00e9r\u00e9grinus, tempus mortis adjicere per distributivum quandocumque sed sufficiet conditionem mortis heredis gravati adscribere.\n442. La raison en est claire. Les mots \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou apr\u00e8s sa mort, \u00e9tant ind\u00e9finis, embrassent visiblement les deux cas de la vulgaire et de la fid\u00e9icommissaire. Le substituant n\u2019ayant pas dit, en cas de mort sans avoir recueilli, et n\u2019ayant pas dit non plus, en cas de mort apr\u00e8s avoir recueilli, on ne peut pas limiter sa disposition \u00e0 d\u2019un des deux oas.\nQuand il a dit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement et indistinctement, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ou apr\u00e8s sa mort, c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose que s\u2019il e\u00fbt dit, en quelque temps qu\u2019il d\u00e9c\u00e8de.\nC\u2019est la judicieuse remarque de P\u00e9r\u00e9grinus: Quicumque mortis casus, comprehenditur sub verbis, et ex defunc\u0163i voluntate est.\nMerlin note que l\u2019arr\u00eat du 2 juillet 1766, qui \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 cette doctrine, a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9, sur requ\u00eate civile, apr\u00e8s la mort du Marquis de Marigny sans enfants en mai 1781. Un arr\u00eat du 21 mars 1782, sur les conclusions de l\u2019avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019Aguesseau, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la substitution \u00e9tait ouverte suivant les termes du testament en faveur des enfants du sieur de Malvoisin. Les h\u00e9ritiers du Marquis de Marigny avaient pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 grev\u00e9 de substitution au profit de la famille de Malvoisin; que Mme de Pompadour n\u2019avait appel\u00e9 le sieur de Malvoisin et ne l\u2019avait mis au lieu et place du Marquis de Marigny que dans le cas o\u00f9 il mourrait avant elle sans enfants; que sa volont\u00e9 \u00e9tait de faire son fr\u00e8re l\u00e9gataire universel pur et simple, et qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait occup\u00e9e que d\u2019avoir un autre l\u00e9gataire universel au cas que son fr\u00e8re mourrait avant elle; et l\u2019on fondait ce syst\u00e8me sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 o\u00f9 l\u2019on \u00e9tait de supposer dans la disposition de Mme de Pompadour ces mots avant moi comme ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux-ci: \u201cAu cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de mon fr\u00e8re sans enfants\u201d. Mais M. \u013eavocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019Aguesseau argua, et la Cour dit avec lui, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas permis d\u2019ajouter ainsi aux dispositions des testateurs; et celles de Mme de Pompadour, claires et absolues par elles-m\u00eames, n\u2019ont besoin d\u2019aucune interpr\u00e9tation forc\u00e9e. Le cas de la mort du Marquis de Marigny sans enfants est la seule condition de la vocation de la famille de Malvoisin. Dans quelque temps que la condition arrive, le droit est assur\u00e9.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 bien clairement dans cet arr\u00eat de 1782 que les termes \u201cje mets \u00e0 la place\u201d forment un fid\u00e9icommis lorsqu\u2019ils sont joints \u00e0 \u201cau cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s\u201d. Mais, nous dit Merlin, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient isol\u00e9s, ils n\u2019auraient pas le m\u00eame effet parce que alors ils n\u2019apporteraient pas le trait de temps. Et cet auteur ajoute:\nLes termes, en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ont-ils en cette mati\u00e8re, le m\u00eame effet que ceux \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, rendent-ils fid\u00e9icommissaire la substitution \u00e0 laquelle ils se rapportent?\nIl semblerait qu\u2019il y e\u00fbt entre les uns et les autres une certaine diff\u00e9rence. Quand je dis, j\u2019institue un tel, et \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s je mets un tel \u00e0 sa place, je suppose visiblement que l\u2019institu\u00e9 recueillera ma succession et en jouira jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mort. Mais en disant j\u2019institue un tel, et en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, je mets un tel \u00e0 sa place, il semble que je ne pr\u00e9vois qu\u2019im seul cas, celui o\u00f9 l\u2019institu\u00e9 viendrait \u00e0 mourir sans profiter de mon institution; et si cela est,, point de trait de temps, ni, par cons\u00e9quent, de substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise, la testatrice, apr\u00e8s deux legs particuliers, donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 ses enfants, qu\u2019elle nomme ses l\u00e9gataires universels, tous et chacun les biens meubles et immeubles qu\u2019elle d\u00e9laissera \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, sans exception, sujet cependant aux legs ci-dessus. C\u2019est la seule restriction impos\u00e9e aux droits des l\u00e9gataires.\nPour cette institution d\u2019h\u00e9ritiers, \u00e0 sa mort, elle adopte, par la clause suivante, dans le cas des l\u00e9gataires universels d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s, le principe de la repr\u00e9sentation par leurs propres enfants pour recueillir les legs \u00e0 eux faits.\nMais\n(dit-elle avant de finir cette clause)\ndans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants, la part du d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 accro\u00eetra \u00e0 mes autres l\u00e9gataires universels survivants.\nL\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que cette phrase contient une substitution compendieuse, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 la fois la vulgaire et la fid\u00e9icommissaire. Art. 925-926 C.C.\nL\u2019appelant nous expose qu\u2019en vertu de la loi, il peut y avoir accroissement, non seulement par la caducit\u00e9 d\u2019un legs (art. 868 C.C.), ou si celui en faveur de qui la disposition est faite n\u2019a pas surv\u00e9cu au testateur (art. 900 C.C.), ou si le l\u00e9gataire d\u00e9c\u00e8de avant l\u2019accomplissement de la condition (art. 901 C.C.), ou lorsque le l\u00e9gataire le r\u00e9pudie ou se trouve incapable de le recueillir (art. 904 C.C.), mais aussi pour des causes post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la saisine l\u00e9gale ou apr\u00e8s que le l\u00e9gataire a recueilli et poss\u00e9d\u00e9 plus ou moins longtemps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du de cujus et il cite \u00e0 l\u2019appui les articles 610 et suiv. et 893 C.C. Il n\u2019y a rien dans la loi qui emp\u00eacherait l\u2019accroissement si la testatrice avait dispos\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on. L\u2019appelant a le fardeau de nous convaincre que la part de chacun des l\u00e9gataires ayant recueilli est grev\u00e9e de cette condition r\u00e9solutoire en faveur des col\u00e9gataires. La disposition et l\u2019institution d\u2019h\u00e9ritier ne mentionnent que les enfants et n\u2019expriment que les restrictions contenues dans les deux legs particuliers qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence importante avec le testament de la Marquise de Pompadour. Puis vient la clause dont le dernier membre pourvoit en faveur des col\u00e9gataires \u00e0 accroissement de la part du l\u00e9gataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sans enfants. La testatrice a-t-elle simplement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 la loi (art. 868 C.C.), ou y a-t-elle ajout\u00e9 pour stipuler accroissement en cas de mort sans enfants apr\u00e8s la mort de la testatrice?\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9es plus haut, l\u2019appelant pourrait mieux soutenir son interpr\u00e9tation si, au lieu d\u2019employer les mots: dans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants, on trouvait dans le testament les mots: \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants, avec l\u2019autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment requis, savoir: \u201cJe substitue\u201d ou \u201cje mets \u00e0 la place\u201d. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle se trouve, la clause telle que r\u00e9dig\u00e9e pourvoit au cas o\u00f9 un des institu\u00e9s viendrait \u00e0 mourir, sans profiter de l\u2019institution, avec ou sans enfants; et dans les deux alternatives, pas de trait de temps, et, par cons\u00e9quent, substitution vulgaire.\nL\u2019on ne trouve pas ici de termes indiquant clairement l\u2019intention de la testatrice de substituer ses autres l\u00e9gataires universels survivants \u00e0 l\u2019un d\u2019eux qui d\u00e9c\u00e9derait sans enfants, apr\u00e8s avoir, \u00e0 la mort de la testatrice, re\u00e7u sa part. Il n\u2019y aurait donc dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qu\u2019une substitution vulgaire et \u2018Cette clause du testament, dans son ensemble, ne r\u00e8gle que les conditions requises pour recueillir \u00e0 la mort de la testatrice, \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de la succession. Le l\u00e9gataire universel d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette date\u2019 sera remplac\u00e9 par ses propres enfants; mais \u00e0 la m\u00eame date, dans le cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants, la part du d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 accro\u00eetra aux l\u00e9gataires universels survivants.

APPEALS from the judgments of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], upon leave to appeal granted by Crocket J., Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, said judgments sustaining the conviction of both appellants, on their trial before H. Fortier, J.S.P. on a charge of smuggling.\nPierre Devarennes for the appellants.\nLaetare Roy K.C. and Henri Bernier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014The appellants were convicted before the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the district of Quebec on an indictment which is translated as follows by the parties:\nTo have, on or about the 18th of May in the year 1932, in the waters of the St. Lawrence River, and particularly near the shores of Beaumont, in the district of Quebec, assisted or otherwise been concerned in the unshipping, the landing or removing and the importing of goods illegally imported in Canada and upon which the exigible legitimate duties had not been paid, by having under his control and his possession, on board a yacht named Marinefs Joy, an approximate quantity of 860 gallons of alcohol fraudulently imported in Canada and upon which the exigible legitimate duties had not been paid, said alcohol having an approximate value of $860, contrary to R.S.C., c, 42, s. 193, ss. 3.\nA penalty of $300 or four months imprisonment was imposed on both appellants. The Court of King\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec dismissed their appeal. They obtained special leave to appeal to this court, under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, because the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the province of Quebec, it was alleged, conflicted with the judgment in a like case of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia re Rex v. Langille[2]. The facts in the latter case are as follows:\nOn June 18, 1928, at eight o\u2019clock in the evening, the captain of one of the Canadian patrol boats came out of Ketch Harbour, Halifax County, and sighted a motor boat a mile off Ketch Harbour Head making towards land; the motor boat was stopped and found to contain a considerable quantity of rum in kegs. Langille was in charge of the motor boat. The motor and cargo were seized and brought to Halifax Harbour and Langille was charged of unlawfully smuggling into Canada goods subject to duty. The judgment of the Nova Scotia court was to the effect that despite s. 203, par. 4, of the Customs Act (s. 21 of c. 50 of the statutes of Canada passed in 1927), which declares\nthat the offence of smuggling should be deemed to be completely committed whenever any vessel containing goods not reported pursuant to section 11 of the Act arrives within three miles of the coast of Canada,\nthe offence is not complete until the master of the vessel has had an opportunity of complying with the conditions laid down in s. 11, i.e.,\nof reporting to the Customs House after the vessel is anchored or moored.\nMr. Justice Ross dissented from the above judgment.\nAfter careful consideration of the case, we find that the Langille case[3] differed from the present ones. It must be noted that subsection 4 applies when any vessel arrives within three miles of the coast or shores of Canada, i.e., enters the territorial waters of this country. This evidently covered the Nova Scotia case, as the vessel there involved was approaching from the ocean the coast or shores of Canada, was arriving and was still moving towards her destination. In the present case, the vessel was deliberately stranded by its crew, to avoid capture by the Government patrol, on the shores of Beaumont, within the limits of the harbour of Quebec, several hundred miles inland, on the river St. Lawrence. Certainly it was not then arriving within three miles of the coasts of Canada.\nMoreover, by wilful stranding and the abandonment of their boat on the shore, the appellants have placed themselves in such a position that it was utterly impossible for them to arrive, anchor or moor in the harbour of Quebec and comply with the requirements of section 11. That circumstance, of their own making, cannot help them. They could not be first given the opportunity of declaring on arrival, as required by the Nova Scotia decision, because, of their own accord, they had \u201carrived\u201d and landed on the Beaumont beach. It is admitted that both appellants were on board the boat and that the dutiable goods which had admittedly been smuggled or clandestinely introduced into Canada by another vessel were in their possession. Under section 262 of the Customs Act, this possession once proven or admitted placed on the appellants the burden of proof of all facts relating to the origin, the importation or the payment of duty or the compliance with the requirements of the Act with regard to the entry of any such goods.\nMr. Justice Dorion[4], with whom concurred Howard, Rivard and Bond JJ., in his reasons for judgment, says:\nJe crois que les pr\u00e9somptions cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la loi contre les accus\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour but d\u2019emp\u00eacher ce man\u00e8ge nonobstant Rex v. Langille[5], cit\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant.\nAnd Mr. Justice St. Jacques says, at page 94 (1):\nCes deux causes se distinguent nettement de celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e par la cour supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, Rex v Langille.5\nLes faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve sont bien diff\u00e9rents; et en rejetant l\u2019appel, cette cour ne donne pas \u00e0 la loi des douanes une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente de celle que lui a donn\u00e9e la cour supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse.\nThe attitude of Mr. Justice Dorion and of the majority of his colleagues disclosed an apparent conflict with Rex v. Langille5 sufficient to grant leave to appeal under 1025 Cr. \u0421. After considering the facts of the case, however, we agree with Mr. Justice St. Jacques that there is no real conflict between the two courts of appeal, as section 203, p. 4, of the Customs Act applies only to vessels arriving within three miles of the coast of Canada and could have no possible application to a vessel which, having cleared from Levis for Gasp\u00e9, stopped somewhere below Rimouski to take over from a schooner a cargo of liquor and then turned back to try and land these smuggled goods at some point on the shores of the St. Lawrence under the very inculpating circumstances disclosed by the record.\nWe are, therefore, unanimously of opinion that these appeals fail and should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1933) Q.R. 56 K.B. 88.\n[2] (1932) 57 Can.

These sections do not profess to create such an obligation. They enact a prohibition and impose a penalty upon the person who acts in contravention of the prohibition. Nor does the statute in terms penalize the failure to purchase or pay for stamps. The settled principles, as indicated in the passages, quoted in the judgment, of the highest courts touching the interpretation of taxing statutes, do not permit this Court to read those sections as constituting such an obligation.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (47 B.C. Rep. 293) aff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Ellis C.C.J., and dismissing the appellant's action to recover $499.48 due under the Special War Revenue Act for stamp tax on sale or transfer of stocks and shares.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. Farris K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014This action was brought against the respondent for the recovery of $499.48 alleged to be due as a debt for stamp taxes payable on sales of shares of stock under the Special War Revenue Act.\nSection 58 of Part VII of the statute provides that no person shall sell or transfer the stock or shares of any association, company or corporation, or any bond other than a bond of the Dominion of Canada or of any province of Canada, unless there is affixed to or impressed upon the document evidencing ownership or a document shewing the transfer thereof stamps of certain values as in the statute provided.\nSection 59, subsection 1, provides among other things that where the evidence of sale or transfer is shewn only by the books of the company, the stamp shall be placed or impressed upon such books. Section 59, subsection 3, is as follows:\nIn case of an agreement to sell or where the transfer is by delivery of the certificate or bond assigned in blank, or bond payable to bearer, there shall be made and delivered by the seller to the buyer a bill or memorandum of such sale or transfer to which the stamp shall be affixed or impressed.\nSection 63 provides that any person who violates any of the provisions of that part of the statute shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars.\nThe action, however, as above stated, was not for the recovery of penalties, but was an action for the stamp taxes. The provision relied upon is section 108, Part XIV, of the Act which reads in part as follows:\nAll taxes or sums payable under this Act shall be recoverable at any time after the same ought to have been accounted for and paid, and all such taxes and sums shall be recoverable, and all rights of His Majesty hereunder enforced, with full costs of suit, as a debt due to or as a right enforceable by His Majesty, in the Exchequer Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe respondent admitted that during the period in question, he was a stock broker carrying on business as a member of the Vancouver Stock Exchange. He admitted that during that period he had sold or transferred stock or shares on which the taxes would have been the amount claimed by the appellant; but he testified, and there was no evidence to the contrary, that none of the shares was his own property and that he sold only as agent or broker for various clients and customers, receiving as his remuneration a commission on each transaction. The respondent therefore contended that there was no debt due by him or right enforceable against him by His Majesty within section 108.\nIn Partington v. Attorney-General[2], Lord Cairns, at page 122, stated the rule of interpretation of fiscal legislation as follows:\nI am not at all sure that, in a case of this kind\u2014a fiscal case\u2014form is not amply sufficient; because, as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: if the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible, in any statute, what is called equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute where you simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nAnd again in Pryce v. Monmouthshire Canal and Railway Companies[3], as follows:\nMy Lords, the cases which have decided that Taxing Acts are to be construed with strictness, and that no payment is to be exacted from the subject which is not clearly and unequivocally required by Act of Parliament to be made, probably meant little more than this, that, inasmuch as there was not any a priori liability in a subject to pay any particular tax, nor any antecedent relationship between the taxpayer and the taxing authority, no reasoning founded upon any supposed relationship of the tax-payer and the taxing authority could be brought to bear upon the construction of the Act, and therefore the tax-payer had a right to stand upon a literal construction of the words used, whatever might be the consequence.\nIn Oriental Bank Corporation v. Wright[4], Lord Blackburn, delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said at page 856:\nTheir lordships, therefore, having regard to the rule that the intention to impose a charge on the subject must be shown by clear and unambiguous language, are unable to say that the obligation of the bank to make the return applied for, and its consequent liability to pay duty on the notes put in circulation by its Kimberly branch, are so clearly and explicitly imposed by the present Act as to satisfy this rule.\nIn Tennant v. Smith[5], Lord Halsbury stated the rule as follows, page 154:\nThis is an Income Tax Act, and what is intended to be taxed is income. And when I say \"what is intended to be taxed,' I mean what is the intention of the Act as expressed in its provisions, because in a taxing Act it is impossible, I believe, to assume any intenton, any governing purpose in the Act, to do more than take such tax as the statute imposes. In various cases the principle of construction of a taxing Act has been referred to in various forms, but I believe they may be all reduced to this, that inasmuch as you have no right to assume that there is any governing object which a taxing Act is intended to attain other than that which it has expressed by making such and such objects the intended subject for taxation, you must see whether a tax is expressly imposed.\nCases, therefore, under the Taxing Acts always resolve themselves into a question whether or not the words of the Act have reached the alleged subject of taxation. Lord Wensleydale said in re Micklethwait[6]: \"It is a well-established rule, that the subject is not to be taxed without clear words for that purpose; and also, that every Act of Parliament must be read according to the natural construction of its words.\"\nIn Attorney-General v. Milne[7], Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, said at page 771:\nIt may be that, if probabilities, apart from the words used, are to be looked at, there is, on the construction which the Court of Appeal have put on the statute, a casus omissus which the Legislature was unlikely to have contemplated. But, my Lords, all we are permitted to look at is the language used. If it has a natural meaning we cannot depart from that meaning unless, reading the statute as a whole, the context directs us to do so. Speculation as to a different construction having been contemplated by those who framed the Act is inadmissible, above all in a statute which imposes taxation.\nIn Lumsden v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[8], Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, at pages 896 and 897 said:\nMy Lords, I said at the beginning that the duty of judges in construing statutes is to adhere to the literal construction unless the context renders it plain that such a construction cannot be put on the words. This rule is especially important in cases of statutes which impose taxation.\nIn the Matter of the Finance Act, 1894, and in the Matter of the Estate of the Rev. George Studdert[9], the rule of interpretation applicable to a taxing Act was stated thus by Fitzgibbon L.J.:\nIf it be doubtful or difficult of interpretation, which I do not think it is, the Finance Act is subject to the rule that no tax can be imposed except by words which are clear, and the benefit of the doubt is the right of the subject.\nReferring now to the provisions we have to construe, it is quite clear that persons falling within the incidence of the prohibition enacted by section 58 are, by reason of the penalty created by section 63, affected by a motive of considerable weight not to disregard the prohibition; in other words, to see that the documents mentioned in section 58 are duly stamped. It does not follow, however, that the statute creates a civil obligation on the part of such persons to pay the value of the necessary stamps, or indeed, any sum, to the Crown. These sections do not profess to create such an obligation. They enact a prohibition and impose a penalty upon the person who acts in contravention of the prohibition. Nor does the statute in terms penalize the failure to purchase or pay for stamps. The settled principles, as indicated in the passages quoted above from the judgments of the highest courts touching the interpretation of taxing statutes, do not permit us to read these sections as constituting such an obligation.\nCounsel for the Crown relies upon section 61, which refers to \"the tax imposed by this Part.\" This, it is said, is a statutory construction of Part VII; and necessarily implies that the persons affected by the prohibition created by section 58 are directly charged with a civil obligation to pay to the Crown, in respect of the transactions falling within section 58, the cost of the stamps required for conformity with the provisions of the section. It appears to us that there is no such necessary implication.\nThere could, we think, be no impropriety in speaking of sections 58 and 63 as in a practical sense imposing a tax; but they do not necessarily imply an intention to create a civil obligation to pay any sum of money to the Crown.\nSection 108, Part XIV, it should be observed, presupposes the existence of a tax or sum \"payable under this Act,\" the existence, that is to say, of a legal duty, imposed by the statute upon the person from whom the \"debt\" is alleged to be \"due\" or the \"right enforceable \" to pay to the Crown the sum sued for.\nLeave to appeal was granted in this case upon terms that the appellant should pay the costs of the respondent as between solicitor and client. The result is that the appeal should be dismissed with costs as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed with costs as between solicitor and client.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. H. S.

The respondent then brought the present action for $250, balance of his salary for that month, reserving his rights to claim the balance of his salary for the balance of the ten years.\nHeld that, on the facts, outside of the questions of law raised by the respondent, the record contains evidence of grave misconduct which gave ample justification for the dismissal of the respondent.\nHeld, also that the respondent\u2019s recourse, if he had been as a fact dismissed without cause or valid reason, could only have been a claim for damages and he could not ask the court for an order compelling the appellant company to keep him in its employ. The contract of lease or hire of personal service, owing to the personal character of the obligations which it contains, is not susceptible of a condemnation for specific performance: the appellant cannot physically be forced to keep the respondent in its employ, nor could the respondent be physically constrained to remain in the appellant\u2019s service.\nHeld, further, that the appellant was not bound to take legal proceedings before the courts to obtain the resiliation of the contract of hire before dismissing the respondent.\nOn the ground raised by the respondent that the contract of the 10th of October, 1929, was a single one and not susceptible of partial resiliation, i.e., that if the contract of hire was rescinded the sale also should be annulled, held that the agreement between the parties did not constitute an indivisible thing, each contract in the deed having its distinct individuality, and, therefore, the appellant had the right to resiliate the contract of hire without affecting the sale made in the same document.\nAPPEAL by special leave from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, P.

Effectivement, le 6 novembre 1929, la compagnie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e dans l\u2019intervalle, il fit \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re le transfert qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu. L\u2019intim\u00e9 intervint \u00e0 l\u2019acte de cession et y donna son consentement. Pour les fins de ce litige, on peut donc consid\u00e9rer Dupr\u00e9 Quarries Limited, l\u2019appelante, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme les deux parties contractantes.\nLe contrat comprend d\u2019abord la vente \u201cas a going concern\u201d de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une carri\u00e8re au Sault-au-R\u00e9collet, y compris les b\u00e2tisses, constructions, machines et outils, meubles, chevaux et camions y attach\u00e9s, pour la somme de $55,000. Il comprend ensuite l\u2019engagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme surintendent de la carri\u00e8re achet\u00e9e de lui pour une p\u00e9riode de dix ann\u00e9es, \u00e0 compter du 1er octobre 1929, \u00e0 un salaire de $500 par mois, et un autre engagement pour son fils, Emilien Dupr\u00e9. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0, nous occuper de ce dernier, dont les droits ne sont pas en discussion.\nLe 10 avril 1930, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante, qui lui a alors pay\u00e9 son salaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du 15 avril. Il a ni\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelante le droit de le destituer; et, demandant acte du fait qu\u2019il se tenait \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019appelante et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00eat \u00e0 lui donner tout son temps, de m\u00eame que sous r\u00e9serve de son droit de lui r\u00e9clamer son salaire au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019il deviendra d\u00fb, ainsi que de toute r\u00e9clamation en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, il a intent\u00e9 cette action pour recouvrer la somme de $250 repr\u00e9sentant la balance de son salaire pour le mois d\u2019avril.\nL\u2019appelante a plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour cause, \u00e0 savoir parce que celui-ci ne remplissait pas les conditions de son engagement. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lui a donn\u00e9 raison; mais la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi (avec le dissentiment de monsieur le Juge-en-chef Tellier) a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et a maintenu l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nL\u2019appelante a obtenu de la Cour du Banc du Roi la permission sp\u00e9ciale de se pourvoir en appel devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada.\nUne premi\u00e8re question se soul\u00e8ve, relative \u00e0 la situation juridique des parties. L\u2019engagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme surintendant de la carri\u00e8re constitue un louage de service. Comme cet engagement \u00e9tait pour un temps d\u00e9fini, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas le droit de le cong\u00e9dier, m\u00eame pour cause, et qu\u2019elle devait n\u00e9cessairement s\u2019adresser aux tribunaux pour obtenir la r\u00e9siliation du contrat. Il ajoute, en plus, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un contrat complexe, o\u00f9 l\u2019engagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 faisait partie de la consid\u00e9ration de la vente, et que la r\u00e9siliation, si elle pouvait \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e, devait embrasser le contrat tout entier, et non pas seulement la partie de ce contrat qui concernait de louage de service.\nQuelles que soient, dans les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, les expressions d\u2019opinion sur les moyens ainsi plaides par l\u2019intim\u00e9, il para\u00eet certain que la cour a refus\u00e9 de les accepter; et Tunique motif du jugement en appel est\nque les faits reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 (Dupr\u00e9), eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature et \u00e0 l\u2019imp or tance du contrait du 10 octobre 1929, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas assez graves pour motiver contre lui la r\u00e9solution imm\u00e9diate de ce contrat.\nEn effet, les droits et obligations r\u00e9sultant du bail de service personnel sont assujettis aux r\u00e8gles communes aux contrats (Art. 1670 C.C.). Comme dans tout contrat synallagmatique, le louage de service comporte des obligations r\u00e9ciproques, dont la sanction se trouve dans l\u2019article 1065 du code civil. Dans ce genre de contrats, toute contravention rend le d\u00e9biteur passible de dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats dans tous les cas. Le cr\u00e9ancier peut aussi, dans les cas qui le permettent, demander l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation m\u00eame, ou l\u2019autorisation de la faire ex\u00e9cuter aux d\u00e9pens du d\u00e9biteur. Le cr\u00e9ancier peut toujours demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat d\u2019o\u00f9 na\u00eet l\u2019obligation.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a pas de doute que l\u2019appelante a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle a donc r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 son obligation de le garder \u00e0 son service. Si elle l\u2019a fait sans cause l\u00e9gale, il y a contravention de sa part, et elle doit \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Mais le contrat de louage de service, \u00e0 cause du caract\u00e8re personnel des obligations qu\u2019il comporte, ne se pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 une condamnation \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution sp\u00e9cifique. Il n\u2019entre pas \u201cdans les cas qui le permettent\u201d et o\u00f9 \u201cle cr\u00e9ancier peut aussi demander l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation m\u00eame.\u201d L\u2019appelante ne pouvait \u00eatre physiquement contrainte \u00e0 garder l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son service; pas plus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pouvait \u00eatre physiquement contraint \u00e0 rester au service de l\u2019appelante. 11 y a l\u00e0 une question de volont\u00e9 et de libert\u00e9 humaines contre lesquelles l\u2019ex\u00e9cution directe est impuissante (16 Laurent, 3e \u00e9d. p. 258, n\u00b0 198; voir aussi les observations des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Pitre v. L\u2019Association Athl\u00e9tique d\u2019Amateurs Nationale)[1]. Le recours de l\u2019intim\u00e9, s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans droit, consistait donc dans une r\u00e9clamation pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qui en r\u00e9sultaient. Il ne pouvait demander \u00e0 la cour de contraindre l\u2019appelante \u00e0 le garder \u00e0 son service. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une sanction impossible (Guillouard, 2 Contrat de Louage-n\u00b0 727; 4 Pothier, Ed. Bugnet, n\u00b0 174).\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante ne pouvait, par sa seule volont\u00e9, r\u00e9silier le contrat d\u2019engagement, mais qu\u2019elle devait en demander la r\u00e9solution \u00e0 la cour, peut donc pr\u00e9senter un int\u00e9r\u00eat acad\u00e9mique, mais elle n\u2019a aucun c\u00f4t\u00e9 pratique. L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9mis l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ces fonctions et elle a mis fin au louage de ses services. Si elle l\u2019a fait sans raison valable, l\u2019unique sanction efficace de sa contravention est la condamnation aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Si elle l\u2019a fait pour cause suffisante, et c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire: avec justification l\u00e9gale, la cour n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 se prononcer l\u00e0-dessus d\u00e8s que l\u2019affaire vient devant elle. C\u2019est la solution logique et raisonnable. C\u2019est celle qui est adopt\u00e9e par Laurent (vol. 25, n\u00b0 517):\n517. Nous avons suppos\u00e9 jusqu\u2019ici que le patron cong\u00e9diait le commis sans qu\u2019il y e\u00fbt aucune faute \u00e0 reprocher \u00e0 celui-ci. Si l\u2019employ\u00e9 ne remplit pas ses devoirs, il y a une cause l\u00e9gale de r\u00e9vocation; c\u2019est le cas de la condition r\u00e9solutoire tacite de l\u2019article 1184. Mais pour que la r\u00e9vocation soit l\u00e9gale, il faut qu\u2019elle soit prononc\u00e9e par le juge. Dans l\u2019opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, consacr\u00e9e par la jurisprudence, on n\u2019exige pas une action judiciaire; mais si l\u2019on admet que l\u2019employ\u00e9, cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans motif l\u00e9gitime, a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9, la question sera en d\u00e9finitive soumise au tribunal appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9. (Rouen, 9 f\u00e9vrier 1859, Dalloz, 1860.2.52.)\nCette doctrine conduit au m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat que celle de MM. Planiol & Rupert (Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil\u2014vol. 11\u2014p. 90):\nL\u2019application stricte du droit commun conduirait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que le contrat subsiste jusqu\u2019au jugement de r\u00e9solution, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le travail doit continuer et le salaire doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 pendant l\u2019instance. Cette situation serait pleine d\u2019inconv\u00e9nients; le contrat de travail supposant des rapports personnels entre les parties dans son ex\u00e9cution, ces rapports pourraient \u00eatre fort p\u00e9nibles, et entra\u00eener m\u00eame quelque trouble dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 travaille. La pratique a donc imagin\u00e9 un palliatif. En fait, l\u2019employ\u00e9 coupable est imm\u00e9diatement mis \u00e0 pied, sans d\u00e9cision judiciaire. Le patron \u00e0 qui des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats seraient r\u00e9clam\u00e9s pour avoir ainsi rompu le contrat de sa propre autorit\u00e9 a un moyen de d\u00e9fense qui le couvre; il objecte que l\u2019autre partie a commis une faute qui rendait indispensable une rupture imm\u00e9diate. Le tribunal peut \u00eatre saisi pour v\u00e9rifier le bien fond\u00e9 de cette all\u00e9gation, et s\u2019il l\u2019estime exacte, il ne met aucune indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 la charge du patron pour \u2022une rupture qu\u2019il reconna\u00eet justifi\u00e9e. (Civ. 26 f\u00e9vr. 1896, S.97.1.187; Civ. 15 juin 1914, D.1918.1.32.\u2014Cf. Demogue, Rev. trimestrielle, 1919, p. 129.V. aussi notre Trait\u00e9, VI, n\u00b0 428). La m\u00eame solution doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e au profit d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui aurait lieu de se plaindre gravement de son patron.\nLe principe\nqu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, dans ce cas, de faire r\u00e9silier l\u2019engagement de l\u2019employ\u00e9 par les tribunaux avant de le cong\u00e9dier\na d\u2019ailleurs, depuis longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit dans la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. D\u00e8s 1881, dans la cause de MacDougall v. MacDougall[2], la Cour du Banc de la Reine (Sir A. A. Dorion J.-en-C, Ramsay, Tessier, Cross & Baby JJ.) en faisait l\u2019application au cas o\u00f9 un propri\u00e9taire d\u2019usines avait renvoy\u00e9 de son service, avant l\u2019expiration de son terme d\u2019engagement, le g\u00e9rant de ces usines qui s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9, sans le consentement du propri\u00e9taire, dans une industrie rivale de la sienne et de nature \u00e0 nuire au commerce de cette derni\u00e8re. Le rapport de cet arr\u00eat pouvait citer plusieurs d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieurement rendues dans le m\u00eame sens, et faisait la distinction n\u00e9cessaire avec le jugement dans la cause de Reid v. Smith[3], que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa pr\u00e9tention.\nEn plus, nous sommes d\u2019accord avec le juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour dire que\ndu moment que l\u2019appelante avait le droit de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019engagement, si le demandeur manquait \u00e0 ses obligations, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue, pour repousser la pr\u00e9sente action, de demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat. Il lui suffisait de d\u00e9montrer que les causes du renvoi \u00e9taient valables.\nIl reste naturellement aux tribunaux \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier souverainement si les motifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s suffisent \u00e0 entra\u00eener la r\u00e9solution du contrat.\nC\u2019est ce que nous verrons, dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l\u2019autre point soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, et qui est: Qu\u2019il s\u2019agit, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019un contrat complexe non susceptible de r\u00e9siliation partielle. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019intim\u00e9 dit que le contrat du 10 octobre 1929 \u00e9tait avant tout une vente dont le louage de services \u00e9tait en partie la consid\u00e9ration, et que l\u2019un ne pouvait \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sans l\u2019autre: le louage ne pouvait \u00eatre rescind\u00e9 sans que la vente le f\u00fbt aussi. S\u2019il doit y avoir r\u00e9siliation, il faut que ce soit de la convention toute enti\u00e8re (Latreille v. Gouin)[4].\nIl arrive dans les contrats complexes, \u201cs\u2019il est impossible de diviser l\u2019op\u00e9ration\u201d (Planiol & Ripert, Droit civil, tome 10, n\u00b0 35), que les juges sont oblig\u00e9s d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la coloration pr\u00e9dominante du contrat et de lui attribuer le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019op\u00e9ration principale. Mais la convention de l\u2019appelante et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019analyse pas de cette fa\u00e7on. Elle ne forme pas un ensemble indivisible. Chaque contrat a, dans l\u2019acte m\u00eame, son sens distinct et son individualit\u00e9 propre.\nIl y a eu entre les parties un contrat de vente dont la cause et l\u2019objet \u00e9taient la carri\u00e8re et ses accessoires pour un prix de $55,000. Il y a eu, en outre, un contrat de louage dont la cause et l\u2019objet \u00e9taient les services de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix ans, moyennant un salaire de $500 par mois. Naturellement l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait grand \u00e9tat de ce que la convention s\u2019exprime ainsi: And in consideration of the present sale, the purchaser has presently engaged the vendor as superintendent of the quarry purchased by the purchaser from the vendor, etc.\nCette phrase n\u2019a pas la port\u00e9e que l\u2019intim\u00e9 veut lui attribuer. Elle ne signifie pas que, comme partie du prix de vente, l\u2019appelante sera tenue, pendant dix ans, de garder l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 son service, au salaire stipul\u00e9, et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 demeurera irr\u00e9vocablement son employ\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode de temps convenue. Ce que cette clause veut dire, c\u2019est que, en consid\u00e9ration de la vente, l\u2019appelante est tenue de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un contrat d\u2019engagement suivant les conditions fix\u00e9es. Ce contrat d\u2019engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti par l\u2019appelante, ainsi que le dit fort bien le juge de premi\u00e8re instance (Philippe Demers J.): \u201cCe contrat d\u2019engagement constituait un avantage que le demandeur a r\u00e9ellement obtenu.\u201d\nMais la convention n\u2019\u00e9cartait pas les r\u00e8gles du louage de service pour l\u2019engagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti (si l\u2019on veut: en consid\u00e9ration de la vente), il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la loi qui r\u00e9git le louage de services et \u00e0 toutes les conditions r\u00e9solutoires que cette loi impose, sauf, bien entendu, celles auxquelles la convention aurait express\u00e9ment d\u00e9rog\u00e9. Or, la convention que nous \u00e9tudions ne d\u00e9roge \u00e0 aucune des conditions ordinaires, ni \u00e0 aucune des r\u00e8gles du louage de service, telles qu\u2019elles sont exprim\u00e9es dans le code, en vertu duquel\nles droits et obligations r\u00e9sultant du bail de service personnel sont assujettis aux r\u00e8gles communes aux contrats. (Art. 1670 C.C.).\nSans que cela f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire, parce que, en somme, c\u2019est une condition implicite de tout louage de service, le contrat entre les parties a cependant express\u00e9ment stipul\u00e9:\nBut it is clearly understood that the vendor will give all his time, energy and capacity to the service of the said purchaser to run the said quarry, etc.\nEt, plus loin, apr\u00e8s avoir pourvu \u00e0 l\u2019engagement du fils de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le contrat revient sur le sujet d\u2019une fa\u00e7on encore plus \u00e9nergique:\nMoreover, it is clearly understood between the vendor and the purchaser, and this is essential to the present agreement, that the vendor, as well as his son, Emilien Dupr\u00e9, will not take any interest whatever in any other quarry during the time of their services to the purchaser, but they will both give all their time and energy to promote the interests of the purchaser or his representatives.\nNous n\u2019h\u00e9sitons pas \u00e0 dire que, dans les circonstances, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u00e9gligeait ses devoirs et manquait de remplir les obligations que lui imposaient \u00e0 la fois le texte de sa convention et la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des contrats de louage de service, sa contravention entra\u00eenait les sanctions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019article 1065 du code civil: l\u2019appelante avait le droit de r\u00e9siliation, et ce droit pouvait \u00eatre limit\u00e9 au contrat d\u2019engagement, sans affecter la vente effectu\u00e9e simultan\u00e9ment (B\u00e9langer v. B\u00e9langer[5])\nC\u2019est, d\u2019ailleurs, la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en est \u00e9galement arriv\u00e9e la Cour du Banc du Roi; et elle a infirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour l\u2019unique raison que, dans son appr\u00e9ciation,\nles faits reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelant * * * n\u2019\u00e9taient pas assez graves pour motiver * * * la r\u00e9solution imm\u00e9diate du contrat.\nElle ajoute, il est vrai, \u201ceu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature et \u00e0 l\u2019importance de ce contrat.\u201d Et il ressort des notes des juges qui ont form\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 que les causes de renvoi all\u00e9gu\u00e9es et prouv\u00e9es eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes pour justifier le cong\u00e9 d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ordinaire, mais qu\u2019elles ne l\u2019\u00e9taient pas dans le cas de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nNous ne croyons pas cependant que la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi ait voulu, par l\u00e0, \u00e9tablir la proposition juridique que les causes de r\u00e9siliation d\u2019un contrat de louage de service sont diff\u00e9rentes dans le cas d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ordinaire et dans le cas d\u2019un surintendant. Nous comprenons plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il s\u2019agit seulement d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve, et que le \u201cConsid\u00e9rant\u201d de la cour veut simplement dire que, dans un contrat de la nature et de l\u2019importance de celui qui est sous consid\u00e9ration, les tribunaux se montreront plus difficiles et plus h\u00e9sitants pour justifier les causes de renvoi.\nCependant l\u2019on ne saurait dire que, dans l\u2019occurrence, l\u2019appelante a agi \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re ou que les faits d\u2019inconduite qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au renvoi n\u2019\u00e9taient pas de la plus s\u00e9rieuse gravit\u00e9. Nous ne nous attacherons pas \u00e0 chaque reproche s\u00e9par\u00e9 que la preuve a mis en \u00e9vidence plus particuli\u00e8re. Nous croyons qu\u2019il faut envisager plut\u00f4t l\u2019ensemble de la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 depuis son entr\u00e9e en service jusqu\u2019au moment de sa d\u00e9mission.\nIl avait une position de responsabilit\u00e9; et nous pensons que, loin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer la gravit\u00e9 des faits qu\u2019on lui a reproch\u00e9s, sa situation leur donnait, au contraire, plus de relief et de cons\u00e9quence. Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019enqu\u00eate a d\u00e9voil\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait adonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019usage habituel des boissons enivrantes. C\u2019est une chose que Franceschini et l\u2019appelante ignoraient lorsqu\u2019ils ont consenti \u00e0 le prendre \u00e0 leur emploi, et qui n\u2019est donc couverte, de leur part, par aucun acquiescement.\nA raison de ses exc\u00e8s de boisson, non-seulement, comme le fait remarquer le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans trois circonstances, au moins, s\u2019est mis dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ses obligations et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pendant plusieurs jours incapable de vaquer \u00e0 ses occupations, mais il s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la carri\u00e8re, il s\u2019est rendu dans les bureaux de la compagnie, assez fr\u00e9quemment apr\u00e8s avoir fait un trop grand usage de boisson, et, dans certains cas, dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e et qui, au t\u00e9moignage des employ\u00e9s qui ont alors eu \u00e0 s\u2019adresser \u00e0 lui, le rendait tout \u00e0 fait incapable de remplir ses devoirs, sans tenir compte de l\u2019exemple n\u00e9faste que cela \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 cr\u00e9er autour de lui, non plus que\u2014comme l\u2019on est en droit de le supposer\u2014de l\u2019impression d\u00e9favorable que cette conduite devait produire sur les clients et les autres personnes qui avaient affaire \u00e0 la compagnie.\nEn plus, il appert que, dans ses relations avec la client\u00e8le, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019autorisation de se servir de la signature de la compagnie. Or, au cours de ses exc\u00e8s de boisson, il a sign\u00e9 plusieurs ch\u00e8ques personnels sans se rendre compte de ce qu\u2019il faisait, et que le g\u00e9rant de l\u2019appelante a d\u00fb s\u2019employer \u00e0 intercepter, \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019\u00e9pouse de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Dans un cas particulier, le 24 mars 1930, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit lui-m\u00eame une lettre \u00e0 un bureau d\u2019avocats, qui lui r\u00e9clamait le paiement d\u2019un ch\u00e8que de ce genre, et a donn\u00e9 pour excuse que celui qui avait obtenu le ch\u00e8que de lui\ncame to my house and while I was in an intoxicated condition, I signed a blank cheque in his favour, which has been returned N.S.F. in view of the fact that, when I realized my mistake, I immediately stopped payment of the cheque.\nLe g\u00e9rant de la compagnie \u00e9tait personellement au fait de ces incidents et les avait port\u00e9s \u00e0 la connaissance des officiers de la compagnie; et l\u2019on peut concevoir les craintes de ces derniers en songeant aux risques auxquelles ils \u00e9taient expos\u00e9s par une personne qui \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 se servir de la signature de la compagnie et qui se conduisait de pareille fa\u00e7on. La compagnie fut patiente. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fut averti, tant verbalement que par \u00e9crit, qu\u2019en persistant dans ces actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles, il s\u2019exposait \u00e0 perdre sa position; et sa destitution lui est arriv\u00e9e lorsque la compagnie e\u00fbt atteint la limite de la tol\u00e9rance.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le renvoi du demandeur \u00e9tait justifiable. Sa d\u00e9cision est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, dans les circonstances, la compagnie avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas apte \u00e0 remplir la position qu\u2019il occupait, ni qualifi\u00e9 pour exercer les pouvoirs qu\u2019elle lui conf\u00e9rait.\nComme l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dissident en Cour du Banc du Roi, nous croyons que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu raison, et nous partageons son opinion. Mais, surtout, il nous para\u00eet difficile d\u2019arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que son jugement, sur ce point, devait \u00eatre infirm\u00e9. Il nous semble que c\u2019est l\u00e0 un des cas o\u00f9 le juge du proc\u00e8s avait un avantage consid\u00e9rable sur les juges d\u2019appel pour envisager la situation \u00e9tablie devant lui et dont la solution d\u00e9pendait \u00e9minemment de son appr\u00e9ciation des faits. M\u00eame si l\u2019impression qui nous est rest\u00e9e de la preuve e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente, nous eussions beaucoup h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 substituer notre point de vue sur cette question de fait \u00e0 celui du juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens en Cour du Banc du Roi et en Cour Supr\u00eame.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Antonio Perrault.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Penverne & Duckett.\n[1] (1910) 11 R. de P. 336.\n[2] (1881) 11 R.L. 203.\n[3] (1872) 6 Q.L.R. 367.\n[4] (1926) S.C.R. 558 at 562.\n[5] (1895) 24 Can.

Has the Tariff Board as constituted under chapter 55 of the statutes of 1931 authority to determine questions of law as distinct from questions of fact?\n2. Has the Tariff Board authority under said Act to determine that the orders of the Minister of National Revenue, fixing the values for duty of goods, under the authority of section 43 of the Customs Act as enacted by chapter 2 of the statutes of 1930 (second session), prior to the enactment of chapter 7 of the statutes of 1932-33, were annulled and ceased to be effective from the date of the last mentioned enactment in respect of goods entitled to entry under the British Preferential Tariff?\n3. When the Tariff Board acts under the provisions of part II of the said Act, are its decisions as to the value of goods for duty purposes subject to the approval of the Minister of National Revenue?\nThe Order in Council recites section 43 of the Customs Act, as enacted by c. 2 of 1930 (second session, 21 Geo. V), which provides as follows:\n43. (1) If at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council on a report from the Minister that goods of any kind are being imported into Canada, either on sale or on consignment, under such conditions as prejudicially or injuriously to affect the interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers, the Governor in Council may authorize the Minister to fix the value for duty of any class or kind of such goods, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the value so fixed shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such goods.\n(2) Every order of the Governor in Council authorizing the Minister to fix the value for duty of any class or kind of such goods, and the value thereof so fixed by the Minister by virtue of such authority, shall be published in the next following issues of the Canada Gazette.\nThis section came into force on the 22nd September, 1930. Between that date and the 25th November, 1932, the Governor in Council, by appropriate action thereunder, authorized the Minister of National Revenue to fix the value for duty of several classes or kinds of goods and, pursuant to the authorization so given, the Minister fixed the value for duty of such goods. The Orders in Council and the orders of the Minister were duly published in the Canada Gazette.\nOn the 25th November, 1932, c. 7 of the statutes of 1932-33 (23-24 Geo. V) became law, which Act substituted the following subsection (1) of s. 43 for that enacted in 1930:\n43. (1) If at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council on a report from the Minister that goods of any kind not entitled to entry under the British Preferential tariff or any lower tariff are being imported into Canada either on sale or on consignment, under such conditions as prejudicially or injuriously to affect the interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers, the Governor in Council may authorize the Minister to fix the value for duty of any class or kind of such goods, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the value so fixed shall be deemed to foe the fair market value of such goods.\nThe only modification in the new subsection was effected by the insertion of the words:\nnot entitled to entry under the British Preferential tariff or any lower tariff.\nSince the enactment of this subsection in 1932, certain importers of goods entitled to entry under the British Preferential tariff, of classes or kinds of goods falling within the Orders in Council and the orders of the Minister of National Revenue fixing the value for duties, have made application to the Tariff Board for a declaration that the orders of the Minister fixing the value for duty were annulled by c. 7 of the statutes of 1932-33 aforesaid, in so far as they applied to such goods. It was contended that the value for duty should be the appraised value at the time of importation and in the principal markets of the country whence the same had been imported into Canada (s. 35). The applicants alleged that these goods should be dealt with by the Tariff Board under the jurisdiction conferred upon it by part II of the Tariff Board Act. The Tariff Board heard the applications and decided that the orders of the Minister fixing the values for duty of such goods were annulled by the new legislation.\nIn one of these cases, an appeal was taken to the Governor in Council by a Canadian manufacturer. It was contended, on behalf of such manufacturer, that the Tariff Board had exceeded its jurisdiction in deciding that the orders of the Minister of National Revenue fixing the value for duty of such goods were annulled by c. 7 of the statutes of 1932-33 in so far as they applied to goods entitled to entry under the British Preferential tariff; and it was further contended that if the Board had jurisdiction to decide the question, the decision of the Board that the orders of the Minister fixing the value for duty of such goods were so annulled was erroneous in law.\nThe Governor in Council considered these matters were of great public importance and thought, pending any decision of the matter, the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada should be obtained. For that purpose, the above questions have been referred to the Court.\nCopies of the decisions of the Board upon the concrete cases mentioned in the Order in Council, and also of the reasons for judgment in one of these cases were submitted to the Court; but they were placed before us only for the purpose of illustration; and, by the questions put, the Court is not asked to say if these decisions were right or wrong. It was made clear at the argument that in our answers we are to limit ourselves to the abstract questions referred to us.\nWe will therefore proceed to give our opinion upon each question with the reasons for each answer.\nThe Act to provide for the appointment of a Tariff Board, known as the Tariff Board Act (c. 55 of 21-22 Geo. V), came into force on the 3rd of August, 1931. It is divided into two parts.\nPart I provides for the constitution of a Board to be called the Tariff Board, consisting of three members appointed by the Governor in Council, and defines the duties of the Board. At the request of the Minister of Finance, the Board shall make inquiries as to several matters therein enumerated in respect to goods produced in or imported into Canada. It may also be empowered by the Governor in Council to hold other inquiries or to make investigations in other matters stated in the Act.\nIn connection with these inquiries or investigations, the Board is given the power of summoning witnesses and of taking evidence. It holds its sessions in the city of Ottawa, or in any other place in Canada, or, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, in any place outside of Canada. It conducts its proceedings in such manner as may seem to it most convenient for the speedy and efficient discharge of its duties.\nIn the exercise of its powers of inquiry and investigation as so provided by the Act, the Board is a court of record and has an official seal.\nThe other provisions of part I relate to the appointment of a secretary, and to his duties, to the appointment of other officers, clerks and employees of the Board, of persons having technical or special knowledge of any of the matters into which inquiry may be made to assist the Board in making such inquiries; and they also relate to the salaries, the pensions and the residence of the members of the Board and the other officials.\nThen comes part II, which deals with a different subject altogether. Under that part, the powers, functions and duties of the Board of Customs are assigned to the Tariff Board and shall be transacted by that Board after a date to be fixed by the Governor in Council. Whenever in any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any regulation or order made thereunder, the Board of Customs is mentioned or referred to, the Tariff Board shall in each and every case be substituted therefor. Section 3 of the Customs Act (c. 42 of R.S.C. 1927) shall be deemed to be repealed from and after the date fixed by the Governor in Council \u201cfor the transfer of the duties and powers of the Customs Board to the Tariff Board.\u201d The section of the Customs Act so deemed to be repealed is that which provides for the constitution of the Board of Customs.\nThe only other provisions to be found in part II of the Tariff Board Act deal with the right of appeal from decisions of the Tariff Board (the former right of appeal from decisions of the Board of Customs is to continue as provided by the Customs Act), when transacting business under this part, and with the right of access to documents and records and to information from any officer, clerk or employee of the public service. There is a further provision for the publication of the decisions of the Board; and finally it is enacted that the Governor in Council may make regulations not inconsistent with this part, or any Act of the Parliament of Canada, as may be deemed necessary for carrying out the provisions of this part; and also that the Board shall have such powers and perform such duties under this part as are assigned to it by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or by the Governor in Council.\nThe questions and matters submitted to this Court have reference only to the powers of the Tariff Board under part II of the Tariff Board Act; and, in the course of these reasons, it should therefore be borne in mind that we are dealing only with that part of the Act.\nAs will have been perceived by the analysis just made, when the Tariff Board acts under the provisions of part II, it exercises the powers and functions and duties of the former Board of Customs, no less and no more. The Tariff Board is substituted for the Board of Customs, the duties and powers whereof have been \u201ctransferred\u201d to it. We are not speaking, of course, of such other powers and duties which may later be assigned to the Board by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or by the Governor in Council (subs. 4 of s. 11). To all intents and purposes under part II, the Tariff Board takes the place of the Board of Customs to such an extent that under the Act\nwherever in any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or in any regulation or order made thereunder, the Board of Customs is mentioned or referred to, the Tariff Board shall in each and every case be substituted therefor.\nIt should be emphasized that, for the purposes of transferring the powers and duties from one board to the other under part II, the legislation proceeds by the mere insertion of the words \u201cTariff Board\u201d in lieu of the words \u201cBoard of Customs\u201d in the Acts of Parliament, or in the regulations and in the orders made thereunder.\nIt follows that, if we are to ascertain the powers, functions and duties of the Tariff Board under part II, we are compelled to look to the powers, functions and duties of the former Board of Customs. They are to be found in the Customs Act (c. 42 of R.S.C. 1927 and amendments); but in order fully to comprehend the matter, a brief reference must be made to the whole scheme of the customs administration in Canada.\nUnder Canadian legislation, the control, regulation, management and supervision of the collection of the duties of customs and of matters incident thereto are assigned to the Minister of National Revenue. The Act (c. 137, R.S.C. 1927) provides for a Department of National Revenue over which the Minister presides and of which he has the management and direction. The Act also provides for the appointment of three officers, who are the chief officers of the department, and who are designated as follows: The Commissioner of Customs; the Commissioner of Excise; and the Commissioner of Income Tax. It further provides for the appointment of an Assistant Commissioner of Customs.\nThe Minister has the power, after such examination as he may prescribe, to select and nominate suitable persons for appointment by the Civil Service Commission as customs appraisers of all classes, whether serving at the various ports and places of entry or as Dominion appraisers, or as officers in the customs and excise preventive service or as officers assigned to duties as investigators of values and claims for drawbacks.\nThey are, of course, all of them, officers of the Department of National Revenue. Dominion appraisers and customs appraisers are defined in s. 4 of the Customs Act. The Dominion appraisers are those who hold \u201cjurisdiction at all ports and places in Canada.\u201d The customs appraisers are those who hold \u201cjurisdiction at such ports and places in Canada as are designated in an order in council in that behalf.\u201d Every appraiser is deemed an officer of customs (sec. 6, Customs Act). The Board of Customs, as constituted under sec. 3 of the Customs Act\nconsists of the Commissioner of Customs, or any officer for the time being acting as such, who shall be the Chairman of the Board, the Commissioner of Excise, the Commissioner of Income Tax, the Assistant Commissioner of Customs, and such other duly qualified officer of Customs as the Governor in Council from time to time appoints.\nAnd it is a branch of the Department of National Revenue.\nCustoms duties are either ad valorem or specific duties. In the case of ad valorem duties, they are computed by reference to the value of the goods. This value is called the value for duty (Customs Act, s. 35), and is the \u201cfair market value,\u201d as determined by the methods provided for by the Act. The true and fair market value is ascertained by the appraisers; and, in this respect, subject to the limits of their territorial jurisdiction, the functions of the Dominion appraiser and of the customs appraiser are the same.\nBut, pursuant to certain provisions of the Customs Act, the Minister of National Revenue may determine the value of goods; and the value so determined, until otherwise provided, is the value upon which duty is to be computed and levied under regulations prescribed by the Minister (ss. 35-4, 36-2, 37, 41. 42, 43, 47, &c.) If there has been a determination or fixing of value properly made by the Minister, the provisions with regard to \u201cfair market value\u201d do not apply. When they apply, as already mentioned, the appraisers\nshall, by all reasonable ways and means in * * * their power, ascertain, estimate and appraise the true and fair market value (s. 38). (N.B. It is sufficient to note here that the Collector of Customs, at a certain port or place, may sometimes act as appraiser.)\nTheir decision is subject to review\nas to the principal markets of the country, or as to the fair market value of goods for duty purposes (s. 38-4).\nThe power of review was formally vested in the Board of Customs, and is now vested in the Tariff Board. It is limited to the two particular purposes just stated. The decision of the Board in the exercise of this power is expressly made final and conclusive only \u201cwhen approved by the Minister\u201d (except as otherwise provided by the Act).\nThe Board of Customs, therefore, as it formerly existed (now the Tariff Board under part II of the Tariff Board Act), and subject to what may be said later with regard to ss. 48 and 54 of the Customs Act, simply enters into the scheme devised by Parliament for the control and management of the collection of the duties of customs and of matters incidental thereto, primarily put by the Act respecting the Department of National Revenue under the direction, the regulation and the supervision of the Minister who presides over that Department.\nThe Board of Customs was, and the Tariff Board is, in no sense, a court. By force of the provisions of the Customs Act, it is not a judicial body but an administrative body. Its functions were and are purely departmental. Its duties as set forth in the Act are all in respect to questions of fact; and there is nothing in the Customs Act which purports to exclude from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts any question of law, either with regard to the validity of the Minister\u2019s acts or otherwise, nor is any such jurisdiction conferred on the Board of Customs (now the Tariff Board, part II). It follows that in the performance of its duties under part II the Board must give effect to the orders of the Minister of National Revenue; and moreover that its decisions are subject to the approval of the Minister, by whose orders the Board is bound as the responsible Head of the Department.\nIncidentally, we would say, in connection with s. 43 of the Customs Act, that the question whether a particular case comes or not under that section is left to the Governor in Council, and not to the Tariff Board. The point, as it presents itself, is really not so much whether the orders of the Minister were repealed or cancelled by the Act c 7 of 23-24 Geo. V, but rather: whether the orders in council, by virtue of which the Minister\u2019s orders were issued, were themselves annulled by the coming into force of the Act. We find nothing in the Customs Act giving to the Board of Customs (now the Tariff Board) jurisdiction to determine a question of that character. In the present state of the legislation, the determination of that question is undoubtedly vested in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nIt remains to consider the sections 48 and 54 of the Customs Act, upon which counsel heard in favour of the Tariff Board\u2019s jurisdiction laid particular stress.\nIn our view, s. 54 does not really come within the purview of the questions referred to the Court, and we do not consider that the subject-matter of those questions calls for the interpretation of that section. Moreover, the decisions of the Tariff Board which led to the present reference have no apparent connection with s. 54. That section deals with the rate of duty. The matters involved in the decisions of the Tariff Board referred to had to do with the appraisal of values for duty. The section provides that\nWhenever any difference arises or whenever any doubt exists as to whether any or what rate of duty is payable on any class of goods, and there is no previous decision upon the question by any competent tribunal, (N.B. Evidently meaning: any court of justice) binding throughout Canada, the Board of Customs (now the Tariff Board under part II) may declare the rate of duty payable on the class of goods in question, or that such goods are exempt from duty.\nIn each case, the declaration of the Board is subject to an appeal within sixty days from its date by any person interested to the Governor in Council. Any such declaration of the Board, when approved by the Minister, after the expiration of sixty days from the date thereof, or\nany such declaration when made by any order in council upon appeal, shall have force and effect as if the same had been sanctioned by statute.\nThe power given by this section is self-explanatory and does not require any comment. It is entirely distinct and separate from the powers and functions relating to the valuations for duty. We are not considering the effect of that special section in the answers given in this reference. It need only be noted that s. 54 calls for a declaration with regard to rate in specially defined cases, that it is subject to appeal to the Governor General in Council; and that it requires either the approval of the Minister or the approval by Order in Council (in case where there was an appeal) in order to have force and effect.\nAs for section 48, so as to grasp its exact meaning, it ought to be read in full:\n48. If, upon any entry or in connection with any entry, it appears to any Dominion appraiser or to the Board of Customs that any goods have been erroneously appraised, or allowed entry at an erroneous valuation by any appraiser or collector acting as such, or that any of the foregoing provisions of this Act respecting the value at which goods shall be entered for duty have not been complied with, such Dominion appraiser or such Board may make a fresh appraisement or valuation, and may direct, under the valuation or appraisement so made, an amended entry and payment of the additional duty, if any, on such goods, or a refund of a part of the duty paid, as the case requires, subject, in case of dissatisfaction on the part of the importer, to such further inquiry and appraisement as in such case hereinafter provided for.\nThe main observation to be made about this section is that it deals essentially with a pure matter of appraisement. The sections applies when\nit appears to any Dominion appraiser or to the Board * * * that any goods have been erroneously appraised or allowed entry at an erroneous valuation by any appraiser.\nThe section also applies when it appears to the Dominion appraiser or to the Board that \u201cany of the foregoing provisions of this Act respecting the value at which goods shall be entered for duty have not been complied with.\u201d And it was on that part of the section that the contention was most strenuously advanced that the Board had, of necessity, the power to determine questions of law, in order properly to fulfil the functions therein conferred on it.\nLet us see however what it is that the Board is authorized to do under that section. It is nothing more than to \u201cmake a fresh appraisement or valuation.\u201d Of course, it may also direct an amended entry and payment of additional duty, if any, or a refund of a part of the duty paid. But that is only consequential upon the new \u201cvaluation or appraisement so made.\u201d There is no doubt that before the Dominion appraiser or the Board may proceed to make the fresh appraisement or valuation, it must appear to them that there has previously been an erroneous appraisement made by the local appraiser or collector; and it stands to reason that, in order to come to that conclusion, the Dominion appraiser or the Board must, in a sense, form an opinion as to the proper method of appraisal which ought to be followed under the Customs Act; and either of them must act upon the view so formed. But that is vastly different from the suggestion that, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s. 48, the Dominion appraiser or the Board may determine questions of law as distinguished from the question of fact involved in the fresh appraisement or valuation which either of them is called upon to make.\nIt was argued that every decision of the Board, and more particularly a decision under s. 48 implies: 1\u2014a decision as to value; and 2\u2014a decision as to the rate of duty applicable under the law. And it was contended that, as a necessary consequence, the Board must determine the questions of law which such decisions call for.\nIt is obvious, however, that the same remark may equally be made of the local appraisers or of the collectors, when they are called upon to ascertain, estimate and appraise the true and fair market value of goods. In that connection, the local appraisers, when giving their decision, are exactly on a par with the Dominion appraiser or the Board. They also, before making their appraisement, must form an opinion as to the relevant law. But, whatever incidental conclusions the appraisers or the Board must come to in order to arrive at a decision on the proper appraisement to be made, the decision of each or either of them is nothing but the finding of a fact in the particular case (Girls Public Day School Trust Ltd. v. Ereaut[1]).\nThe circumstance that it may appear to a Dominion appraiser or to the Board that an erroneous valuation was made by the local appraiser affords the occasion and is the condition required for the exercise by the Dominion appraiser, or by the Board, of the power to act under section 48. The result, however,\u2014and the only result\u2014is merely that the Dominion appraiser, or the Board, is empowered to \u201cmake a fresh appraisement or valuation,\u201d and nothing more. The enactment does not intend to confer jurisdiction to deal with anything but physical values and facts. Of course, in so doing, the Dominion appraiser, or the Board, must be guided by a certain view of the law; but,, in so far as they are concerned, the law includes the Orders in Council and the orders of the Minister. In no way are they authorized to dispute the validity of those orders and far less to determine the conditions of that validity or to pronounce upon any other question of law which, in case of conflict between the Crown and the importer, are left to the determination of the courts of justice. To put it in plain words: the Dominion appraiser, or the Board, acting under s. 48, is empowered to make appraisals, and not rulings.\nBesides, it must be pointed out that, under s. 48, the Dominion appraisers are given exactly the same powers as the Board; and it seems to us that Parliament cannot have intended by that section to confer jurisdiction on a Dominion appraiser to determine questions of law, or to determine the validity or invalidity of the orders of the Minister, the responsible Head of the Department, of which they are the officers.\nPerhaps it may be added that the jurisdiction of the Dominion appraiser or of the Board under s. 48 is only by way of appeal from a valuation or appraisal by an appraiser or collector as such. It would therefore appear that the exercise of the powers therein conferred presupposes a valuation or appraisement; and the consequence would be that when the value for duty is fixed by the Minister, and not by an appraisement, the section does not apply and the Dominion appraiser, or the Board, has no jurisdiction under it.\nIn conclusion, it may be stated, therefore, that an appraisal, in a sense, involves, on the part of any appraiser, whether in the initial steps, or upon review, or upon appeal under s. 48, the taking into consideration of the state of the law on the subject; but there is a clear distinction between that and the power to determine the question as a question of law.\nAt the argument, the Trade Agreement between His Majesty\u2019s Government in Canada and His Majesty\u2019s Government in the United Kingdom, as approved by c. 2 of 23-24 Geo. V, was referred to. The Act respecting the Agreement was assented to on the 25th November, 1932. At that date, the Tariff Board Act was already on the statute book. By art. 12 of the Agreement, His Majesty\u2019s Government in Canada undertook to constitute forthwith the Tariff Board, for which provision had already been made in the Tariff Board Act (1931). Our attention was not drawn to any subsequent legislation modifying the Board Act after approval was given to the Trade Agreement. It follows that nothing contained in the Agreement may be helpful in construing the provisions of the Board Act.\nFor the reasons above stated, the questions referred to the Court will be answered as follows:\nTo Question No. 1: No;\nTo Question No. 2: No;\nTo Question No. 3: Yes.\n[1] [1931] A.C. 12.\n"}

In 1897 they had formed a commercial partnership during about 10 years, when they converted it into an incorporated company under the name \u201cQuinlan, Robertson, Ltd.\u201d In 1919, they took a third associate, one Alban Janin and reorganized their company under the name of \u201cQuinlan, Robertson & Janin Limited.\u201d The capital stock of the new company was equally divided between the three associates. About 1925. the late Hugh Quinlan jointly with the appellant and Janin agreed upon the principle that, in the event of the death of one of them, the survivors would buy the shares owned by the predeceased partner in the various companies organized for the carrying on of their joint undertakings. Hugh Quinlan died on the 26th of June, 1927, leaving his last will and testament in notarial form, dated 14th April, 1926, by which he bequeathed all his property, apart from a few particular legacies, to his wife, but in trust jointly to the appellant and the Capital Trust Corporation, Limited, appointing them his testamentary executors. A year or so before his death, Mr. Quinlan, on account of failing !health, gradually withdrew from active participation in the conduct and control of the various enterprises in which he was interested, leaving the management of them to his associates and especially to the appellant. As the improbability of his recovering his health became apparent, what he ought to do with his shares in the companies in which he and the appellant were interested became of increasing concern to Mr. Quinlan. He discussed the matter from time to time with the appellant and eventually decided that the shares should be sold at minimum fixed prices. The appellant testified that, at his request, the legal advisor of the company and Mr. Quinlan fixed the value of \u2018the shares at $250,000 and that, at Mr. Quinlan\u2019s demand, he put that decision in the form of a letter from himself to Mr. Quinlan and, three or four days before the latter\u2019s death, took it to Mr. Quinlan\u2019s house and read it to him before a witness and again discussed with him its subject-matter. The letter, dated 20th of June, 1927, reads partly as follows: \u201cThis will acknowledge your transfer of the following stocks to me: (1,601 shares of different companies), which stock represented all your holdings in the above companies. I have agreed to obtain for you the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the above mentioned securities, payable one-half cash on the day of the sale, and one-half within one year from this date, which latter half will bear interest at 6%. Should your health permit you to attend to business within one year from this date, I agree to return all of the above mentioned stocks to you on the return to me of the moneys I have paid you thereon including interest at 6%.\u201d The appellant also testified that, having been unable to find a buyer for those shares, at the price agreed upon of $250,000, he had been obliged to keep them and had effectively paid to the estate that amount. The evidence also shows that the appellant had in his custody or under his control certificates endorsed in blank by Mr. Quinlan, on the 21st of May, 1927, when the appellant visited the latter, for the greater part if not for all of these shares, and that he, before the death of Mr. Quinlan, had the shares transferred on the registers of the companies respectively in his own name as owner. On that same day, Mr. Quinlan dictated to his son a memo, specifying all the certificates of shares he owned in those companies with the following note: \u201cDep. in A. W. Robertson\u2019s box,\u201d with the date of the endorsements, to wit: 21st of May, 1927. The respondents are two of the children of the late Hugh Quinlan; and the material conclusions of their action are that the Capital Trust Corporation, Limited, and the appellant, be dismissed as trustees and executors of the estate (destitu\u00e9s de leurs jonctions) for misfeasance in office and be ordered to render account of their administration of the estate; that the sale and transfer of the shares mentioned in the said letter of the 20th of June, 1927, be annulled and that the appellant be ordered to return them to the estate of the late Hugh Quinlan or to pay to it their value, which the respondents estimate at $1,350,000. At the hearing of the trial, the appellant proved, by his own testimony and by that of the witness there present that he had communicated the letter of June the 20th, 1927, to the late Hugh Quinlan, at the latter\u2019s house, by reading it aloud; but when he proceeded to prove that the late Hugh Quinlan had acquiesced to the contents of the letter and accepted the agreement therein contained, the trial judge refused to allow this evidence and held that the acquiescence and consent of the late Hugh Quinlan could not be proved by parol evidence. The trial judge dismissed the two first claims of the respondent as to the dismissal of the executors and as to the order to render account; he annulled the transfer of the shares by the late Hugh Quinlan to the appellant and he condemned the appellant to retrocede to the estate these various shares, with the profits made and the dividends paid since the death of the late Hugh Quinlan, or to pay their value as determined by him to be $408,728, but, in either case, the respondents were obliged to reimburse the appellant the sum of $270,000 paid by him, $20,000 being an amount mentioned in another transaction. And this judgment, with certain modifications, was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld (reversing the judgment appealed from) that, upon the evidence and upon consideration of many other facts stated in the judgment, the transfer of the shares to the appellant bearing the signature of the late Hugh Quinlan, their possession by the appellant, the memo, dictated by Mr. Quinlan to his son and the understanding between the partners in case of death of one of them, were all facts constituting a commencement of proof by writing, and, consequently, parol evidence should have been admitted by the trial judge to prove that the late Hugh Quinlan had acquiesced to the contents of the letter of the 20th of June, 1927. All these facts do not establish the assent of the late Hugh Quinlan to accept the sum of $250,000 for his shares; but they are facts which render probable the fact which the appellant wanted to prove. It is not necessary that facts or writings establish one of the elements of the fact to be proved; it is sufficient that they may constitute a starting point of a reasoning by the trial judge. The probability of an alleged fact is the criterion of the commencement of proof in writing.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, Martineau J., and maintained the respondents\u2019 action.\nL.

Pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019appel entre ces deux parties, sur cette partie du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure port\u00e9e en appel devant la Cour du Banc du Roi et devant nous, la question capitale, comme l\u2019a fort bien dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, est de savoir s\u2019il y a eu une vente des actions en litige avant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur. Si cette vente a eu lieu avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, elle est valide, quelle que soit la vilit\u00e9 du prix; car, dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, le 20 juin, M. Quinlan \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de consentir \u00e0 la vente; si, par contre, elle a eu lieu apr\u00e8s, elle est invalide, vu la prohibition de l\u2019article 1484 C.C. alors m\u00eame que le prix repr\u00e9senterait la pleine valeur des actions. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ne donne pas en d\u00e9tail les raisons pour lesquelles, apr\u00e8s avoir permis la preuve que la lettre de Robertson, du 20 juin 1927, \u00e0 Quinlan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lue \u00e0 ce dernier en pr\u00e9sence de M. Leamy, le tribunal a refus\u00e9 de laisser faire la preuve par t\u00e9moins de la nature de la r\u00e9ponse de Quinlan, alors que Robertson avait plaid\u00e9 que ce dernier avait accept\u00e9 sa proposition.\nIl me para\u00eet essentiel, avant de discuter les autres points soulev\u00e9s, d\u2019\u00e9tudier d\u2019abord le bien ou mal fond\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les notes de l\u2019honorable juge Martineau, a entra\u00een\u00e9 comme cons\u00e9quence cette partie du jugement final dont l\u2019appelant se plaint. La situation des parties avant l\u2019enqu\u00eate me semble bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9e comme suit par l\u2019honorable juge Surveyer, dans son interlocutoire du 7 janvier 1929:\nConsidering that in paragraphs 11 to 25 of their declaration, plaintiffs allege in substance:\n(11) that on or about the 22nd day of June, 1927, three days before the said testator died, said Angus William Robertson, one of the defendants, personally and for his own benefit, acquired a number of shares, the property of the testator, in different companies;\n(12) that the said transfer of said shares to defendant Robertson is due to fraud on the part of said defendant Robertson and to collusion by him with others; (13, 14, 15, 16) that said transfer was made when said Hugh Quinlan was not compos mentis;\n(17, 18, 19) that it was clandestine and made for less than the real value of the said shares;\n(20, 21, 22, 23) that in order to conceal said transfer, said defendant Robertson has assigned some of these shares to pr\u00eate noms of his, unable to pay for same;\n(24) that the said transfer was not mentioned in the inventory sent by defendants to plaintiff Ethel Quinlan on August 8, 1928;\nConsidering that the allegations of defendant Robertson\u2019s plea are in the following terms:\n(37) In or about the month of June, 1927, and some time before his death, the said late H. Quinlan transferred and delivered all his holdings of stock in the said companies to his partner and associate, defendant Robertson, under an agreement with said Robertson, the terms of which were as stated in a letter addressed by said Robertson, to said Quinlan, dated June 20th, 1927:\n(38) Said letter reads as follows:\nMontreal, June 20th, 1927.\nMr. Hugh Quinlan,\n357 Kensington Ave.,\nWestmount, Que.\nDear Hugh,\u2014This will acknowledge your transfer of the following stocks to me:\u2014\n1,151 shares Quinlan, Robertson & Janin, Ltd.\n50 shares Amiesite Asphalt Limited.\n200 shares Ontario Amiesite Asphalt Limited.200 shares Amiesite Asphalt Ltd., in the name of H. Dunlop.\nWhich stock represented all your holdings in the above companies. I have agreed to obtain for you the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for the above mentioned securities, payable one-half cash on the day of the sale, and one-half within one year from this date, which latter half will bear interest at 6 per cent. Should your health permit you to attend to business within one year from this date, I agree to return all of the above mentioned stocks to you on the return to me of the moneys I have paid you thereon including interest at 6%.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) A. W. Robertson.\n(39) At the time the contract and agreement evidenced by the above letter was entered into, the said H. Quinlan was in full and complete possession of his faculties and thoroughly capable, in all respects, of passing upon the propriety and sufficiency of said transaction; and the defendant Robertson agreed to send the above letter only after he had been repeatedly and urgently requested to do so by and on behalf of the said late H. Quinlan;\n(40) After the death of the late H. Quinlan, the defendant Robertson endeavoured strenuously to find some buyers, for said shares, at the price mentioned in the above letter, but was unable to do so, and finally he paid himself to the estate of the said late H. Quinlan, in fulfilment of his obligations, $250,000, as agreed upon between himself and the said late H. Quinlan; (43) The shares mentioned in the above letter of June 20th, 1927, were not assets of the estate of the said late Hugh Quinlan, at the time of his death; but they were, in effect, sold and transferred by the said late Hugh Quinlan himself either to defendant Robertson, or to some other buyer, whom the latter agreed to obtain and, failing the obtaining of whom, said defendant Robertson was obliged and entitled to retain said shares at the price of $250,000, agreed to be paid therefor;\n(44) It was an error on the part of a subordinate employee of defendant \u201cCapital Trust Corporation Ltd.\u201d who helped prepare the statement of assets and liabilities constituting the estate of the said late H. Quinlan and filed as plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit P-2, that the said 1,151 shares of Quinlan, Robertson & Janin Ltd. (erroneously called \u201cHugh Quinlan & Janin Co.\u201d) were entered as an asset of said estate, the said shares being at the time of the death of the said Hugh Quinlan transferred and delivered to defendant Robertson with said other shares on terms of the agreement aforesaid, and all that should have been entered as an asset of the estate of the said late H. Quinlan was the claim against the said Robertson and of others to obtain payment of the price of said shares as and when it became payable in terms of said agreement;\nLe d\u00e9fendeur Robertson fournit ensuite les d\u00e9tails suivants quant au paragraphe 37:\nA. The said transfer of said shares from the said Hugh Quinlan to defendant A.. W. Robertson, took place on or about the 20th of June, 1927;\nB. The agreement was in writing;\nC. The said agreement was dated the 20th of June, 1927;\nD. The said agreement was signed by A. W. Robertson, the defendant, and by him delivered to Hugh Quinlan, who, in turn, delivered to the said defendant Robertson his certificate for said shares, endorsed in blank;\nE. The document was a private writing under the form of a letter addressed to the late Hugh Quinlan, and signed by the defendant A. W. Robertson;\nDe sorte que Ton peut dire que Taction a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par deux l\u00e9gataires pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019acquisition qu\u2019elles all\u00e8guent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 20 juin, avant la mort du testateur, pour le motif que le transport des actions aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti alors que ce dernier, ne jouissant pas de la capacit\u00e9 mentale requise, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime des man\u0153uvres dolo-sives de Robertson, son associ\u00e9, qui aurait abus\u00e9 de sa confiance en lui payant un prix insuffisant. Il semble donc que le litige entre les parties ne mettaient pas en doute l\u2019existence d\u2019une vente \u00e0 cette date; mais il s\u2019agissait simplement de prouver en quelles circonstances elle avait eu lieu et quelle \u00e9tait, la capacit\u00e9 mentale de Quinlan lors de la transaction all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de part et d\u2019autre dans les proc\u00e9dures.\nIl nous faut donc d\u00e9cider aux lieu et place de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si la preuve d\u00e9j\u00e0 faite et les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e9taient suffisants pour constituer le commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit exig\u00e9 par le paragraphe 7 de l\u2019article 1233 du code civil pour permettre la preuve testimoniale. Les faits et \u00e9crits devant la cour \u00e9taient les suivants:\n1. L\u2019entente de 1925, par laquelle Quinlan et ses deux associ\u00e9s, Robertson et Janin, avaient pourvu \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition par les survivants de la part de l\u2019associ\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9; cet \u00e9crit porte la signature de Quinlan et celle de ses associ\u00e9s;\n2. L\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 pr\u00e9caire depuis plusieurs mois de Quinlan, qui faisait pr\u00e9voir sa fin prochaine;\n3. Les pourparlers au sujet de cette acquisition entre Janin, Robertson et l\u2019honorable M. Perron, avocat de Quinlan, qui lui a continu\u00e9 sa confiance m\u00eame apr\u00e8s sa mort en l\u2019instituant par testament l\u2019aviseur de sa succession;\n4. L\u2019entrevue de M. Perron avec Quinlan, au commencement de mai 1927;\n5. La fixation du prix de $250,000 par M. Perron comme \u00e9tant la juste valeur des int\u00e9r\u00eats de Quinlan dans les diff\u00e9rentes compagnies contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par les trois associ\u00e9s;\n6. La visite de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 Quinlan, le 21 mai 1927, au cours de laquelle Quinlan endossa en blanc, en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019appelant et de la garde-malade Kerr, la formule de transport au dos de quatre certificats d\u2019actions, dont deux repr\u00e9sentant 1151 actions de Quinlan, Robertson & Janin, et deux certificats de 50 actions de Amiesite Asphalt Co. Ltd.;\n7. La t\u00e9moignage de Mlle Kerr \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019\u00e0 cette occasion l\u2019appelant lui avait expliqu\u00e9 le but de sa visite, qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la vente de certaines actions;\n8. Le m\u00eame jour, le testateur dicta \u00e0 son fils le m\u00e9moire qui est devant la cour, \u00e9num\u00e9rant tous les certificats qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait dans ces deux compagnies, avec la note suivante: \u201cDep. in A. W. Robertson\u2019s box,\u201d avec la date des endossements, savoir le 21 mai 1927, ce qui, \u00e0 mon avis, d\u00e9montrerait clairement que, dans l\u2019esprit du testateur, ces valeurs devaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es sous le contr\u00f4le et en possession de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 partir de cette date; cet \u00e9crit provient certainement du d\u00e9funt;\n9. Apr\u00e8s cette livraison et cet endossement, Robertson soumit \u00e0 M. Janin que le prix de $250,000 serait raisonnable; et ce prix, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019avis de l\u2019honorable J.-L. Perron, fut fix\u00e9 comme repr\u00e9sentant la valeur r\u00e9elle de ces actions; 10. Le fait qu\u2019un double de la lettre dat\u00e9e du 20 juin 1927 fut trouv\u00e9 dans la vo\u00fbte de l\u2019honorable J.-L. Perron \u00e0 l\u2019endroit que ce dernier avait indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son secr\u00e9taire;\n11. La preuve que cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 lue \u00e0 Quinlan, qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, \u00e9tait parfaitement en \u00e9tat de comprendre son contenu et de donner ou refuser son assentiment au prix propos\u00e9.\nA part la nature de la contestation li\u00e9e entre les parties, tel qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, le transport des actions portant la signature de Quinlan et leur possession par Robertson et le m\u00e9moire pr\u00e9par\u00e9 sous la dict\u00e9e de Quinlan, joints \u00e0 l\u2019entente qui existait entre les associ\u00e9s, constituent-ils, oui ou non, un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit? Le seul fait qu\u2019il restait \u00e0 prouver \u00e9tait qu\u2019\u00e0 cette date du 21 juin Quinlan a bien et d\u00fbment, pour le montant de $250,000 mentionn\u00e9 dans la lettre de Robertson, consenti \u00e0 rendre d\u00e9finitive, suivant les conditions de la lettre de Robertson, l\u2019ali\u00e9nation des actions dont les certificats endoss\u00e9s par lui \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 physiquement en la possession de Robertson depuis le 20 mai. Ces \u00e9crits ne constatent pas le consentement de Quinlan \u00e0 accepter $250,000; mais constatent-ils des faits qui rendent vraisemblable le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9? Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019\u00e9crit \u00e9tablisse un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du fait \u00e0 prouver; il peut \u00eatre simplement le point de d\u00e9part d\u2019un raisonnement pour le juge. 25 Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil (1926) p. 410.\nIl ressort des d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielies (nous disent Planiol & Ripert, 7 Droit Civil, n\u00b0 1534) que le fait \u00e9tabli par le commencement de preuve doit rendre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 vraisemblable, que la vraisemblance n\u2019est pas l\u2019apparence de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais ce qui est probable, mais qu\u2019il ne suffit pas que le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 soit rendu seulement possible. Le juge ne se contente pas de prendre en consid\u00e9ration le fait \u00e9tabli et le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9; mais il examine tout le proc\u00e8s en se basant sur ces circonstances extrins\u00e8ques.\nEn appliquant ce crit\u00e8re, il nous semble que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a restreint la port\u00e9e qu\u2019il fallait donner aux \u00e9crits et aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s des parties en refusant, comme il Fa fait, de prouver par t\u00e9moins l\u2019attitude et la conduite de Quinlan en cette circonstance. Il se contente de dire qu\u2019il est possible que le prix de $250,000 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 en vue des conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es en l\u2019acte d\u2019accord du 11 juin 1925. Nous croyons qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 accepter la vraisemblance et la probabilit\u00e9 que ce prix de $250,000, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 dans les circonstances plus haut relat\u00e9es apr\u00e8s les entrevues de Quinlan avec son homme de confiance et avocat, l\u2019honorable M. Perron, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par Quinlan comme d\u00e9finitif, lorsqu\u2019il lui fut offert par \u00e9crit par son associ\u00e9 Robertson. Or la vraisemblance du fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est le criterium du commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit.\nVoir Cox v. Patton[1].\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en revision dans Lejebvre v. Bruneau[2].\nque la possession en fait de meubles \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, suffisant pour permettre au possesseur d\u2019expliquer sa possession par une preuve testimoniale.\nLe juge Tellier a jug\u00e9 de m\u00eame dans Boucher v. Bousquet[3], que la possession seule d\u2019effets mobiliers fournit en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur une pr\u00e9somption de droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 assez forte pour lui donner droit de prouver son titre par t\u00e9moins. Or, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Robertson \u00e9tait en possession des actions depuis mai 1927, et aussi de celles endoss\u00e9es par Dunlop. Voir aussi Forget v. Baxter[4].\nEn pr\u00e9sence de la plaidoirie \u00e9crite r\u00e9sum\u00e9e plus haut, ne pouvons-nous pas dire, comme feu le juge-en-chef Taschereau, parlant au nom de cette cour dans Campbell v. Young[5]:\nIt is not a commencement of proof of a contract that is in question. * * * The appellant had not to prove it, since it is admitted, pleaded by the respondents themselves. * * * Once a contract is admitted, no commencement of proof in writing is required for the admissibility of oral evidence of the amount of the consideration thereof.\nMais, m\u00eame si l\u2019article 1243 C.C. et la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019indivisibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019aveu s\u2019appliquent, nous dirions, comme dans cette cause:\nThe contract must be proved by the opposite party, aliunde of the admission. But the admission is sufficient as a commencement of proof in writing to legalize oral evidence of it and of its conditions.\nL\u2019honorable juge Howard nous dit:\nThe appellant answers: \u201cWell, if the evidence does not amount to complete proof, it constitutes a commencement of proof sufficient to open the door to testimony on the point.\u201d\nAgain I cannot agree. If the evidence were ail one way, it would, in my opinion, be sufficient, but it is rebutted by the significant fact that the appellant and his co-executor treated these shares as belonging to the succession of the late Mr. Quinlan, whereas if the proposal had been accepted by Mr. Quinlan and therefore the agreement, whatever it should be called, completed before his death, these shares would have been removed from his succession and their value, that is, the consideration received for them, would have taken their place among its assets. This conflict in the evidence now under consideration defeats the appellant\u2019s claim that it constitutes a commencement of proof.\nAvec respect, l\u2019honorable juge nous semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trop s\u00e9v\u00e8re. Le fait que ces actions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9, par erreur suivant la pr\u00e9tention du d\u00e9fendeur, mentionn\u00e9es par sa co-ex\u00e9cutrice testamentaire, exclusivement charg\u00e9e de la comptabilit\u00e9, comme faisant partie de l\u2019actif de la succession, aurait parfaitement pu servir \u00e0 la transquestion de Robertson, mais n\u2019est pas suffisant par lui-m\u00eame pour d\u00e9truire la vraisemblance du fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9, savoir l\u2019acceptation du prix de $250,000 par Hugh Quinlan. Ce n\u2019est pas d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019acte personnel de Robertson. Il est fort possible que dans l\u2019esprit de ce dernier et de sa co-ex\u00e9cutrice, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9es les conditions de cette acquisition, aussi longtemps que le montant convenu n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par un acheteur ou par lui-m\u00eame, la valeur des actions, sinon les actions elles-m\u00eames, faisaient n\u00e9cessairement partie de l\u2019actif de la succession. Il s\u2019agit de mots, plut\u00f4t que de la substance de la chose: de toutes fa\u00e7ons, ces actions ou leur valeur devaient figurer au bilan de la succession Quinlan. Cette erreur, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e, ne devrait pas, \u00e0 notre avis, suffire pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s plus haut et qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le juge Howard, seraient suffisants pour constituer un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit. La nature du contrat intervenu peut expliquer cette attitude de Robertson, que lui reproche M. le juge Howard. Il s\u2019obligeait \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Quinlan ou \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers la somme de $250,000 pour obtenir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des actions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la lettre. Il y a donc eu d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, contrat d\u2019ali\u00e9nation d\u2019une chose certaine et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour un prix en argent, ou, en d\u2019autres termes, une vente. Le prix devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 moiti\u00e9 comptant et l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019une vente avec \u201cr\u00e9serve d\u2019\u00e9lection d\u2019amis\u201d ou de d\u00e9claration de \u201ccommand\u201d. Colin et Capitant (Droit Civil, vol. 2, page 429) nous disent \u00e0 ce sujet:\nL\u2019acheteur se r\u00e9serve donc, dans le contrat, la facult\u00e9 de se substituer une autre personne, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement non d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, laquelle prendra le march\u00e9 pour son compte. Si cette personne, appel\u00e9e command, ne se d\u00e9clare pas, c\u2019est l\u2019acheteur en nom ou command\u00e9 qui reste acheteur.\nLa vente avec r\u00e9serve de d\u00e9claration de command (ajoutent-ils) est moins une vente conditionnelle qu\u2019une vente affect\u00e9e d\u2019une alternative, quant \u00e0 la personne de l\u2019acheteur, l\u2019un des deux acheteurs \u00e9ventuels \u00e9tant d\u00e8s \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et l\u2019autre restant encore inconnu. (Voir note de M. Glasson, D.P. 95,2,1.) La conduite des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, d\u00e8s le 22 juin 1927, en enregistrant le transport dans les livres des compagnies, semble confirmer cette interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019entente all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019avis de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure refusant cette preuve testimoniale. Vu cependant les frais \u00e9normes d\u00e9j\u00e0 encourus, nous d\u00e9sirons, avant d\u2019aller plus loin, entendre les parties durant le terme actuel pour d\u00e9cider ce qu\u2019il serait juste et convenable de faire dans les circonstances.\nAs it appears by the last words of the above judgment, a final judgment was not rendered by this Court, which was desirous, owing to the enormous costs already incurred, to hear later on the parties in order to decide what should be reasonably done under these circumstances. The parties were so heard, and, on the 6th of June, 1934, the following final judgment by the Court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014Since the court ruled, on March 6, 1934, that the trial judge misdirected himself when he refused to hear oral evidence of the testator\u2019s answer to Robertson\u2019s letter of June 20, 1927, the parties were heard and requested to file in writing their views of the proposed settlement and as to what evidence should be allowed, if the case be sent back to the Superior Court. The respondent Margaret Quinlan reiterated her decision not to be any longer involved as plaintiff in this case and prayed that, under the agreement of settlement executed between herself and all parties interested in the estate of the late Hugh Quinlan, excepting only the appellant Dame Ethel Quinlan (Mrs. Kelly) and the tutor, if any, of her minor children, passed before R. Papineau Couture, N.P., on the 31st of January, 1934, whereof a certified copy was left with the Registrar, this court should either declare that it sees no objection to the intervenants carrying it into effect or grant acte thereof.\nThe intervenants also explained that the reason why the stipulation of paragraph 6 was inserted in the agreement was because the intervenants, having filed before this court a declaration that they submit to justice, there was at least doubt of their right to enter into a settlement without the acquiescence of the court.\nWe see no reason why we should not declare that the settlement forms part of the record of the appeal and that we grant acte thereof without passing upon the validity or the binding character of the agreement in question, nor deciding whether or not the intervenants acted within their powers and the officers of the intervenants within their authority. As far as Robertson and Margaret Quinlan are concerned, we cannot refuse to find as a fact that they have settled their differences and wish to stop this litigation.\nThe filing of the agreement in the record so that it will form part thereof for the future is all that is required and granted by giving \u201cacte\u201d of the production of the settlement.\nTherefore, there remains before us only the appellant Robertson, the respondent Ethel Quinlan (Mrs. Kelly) and the two trust companies, who intervened here at the request of the court to watch the proceedings, although they, at first, only appeared to submit to justice, s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 justice, they having accepted the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel submits that the only additional evidence which should be allowed, if the enqu\u00eate is reopened before the Superior Court, is the evidence which has been offered, and refused by the trial judge. This should include oral evidence to show:\n(a) the answer given by the late Hugh Quinlan when the letter of June 20, 1927, was read to him, including, of course, the conduct, statements, communications and declarations of the persons present when the letter was so read and of the late Hugh Quinlan himself and generally, all relevant circumstances relating thereto;\n(b) All the facts, circumstances, statements and communications relating to the drafting of the said letter of June 20, 1927, including the conduct of all those who shared in the drafting of the said letter; and the whereabouts and safekeeping of said letter;\n(c) All the facts, circumstances, statements and communications relating to the visits of the Honourable J. L. Perron and of the present appellant to the late Hugh Quinlan, during the month of May, 1927, or thereabout, and to the endorsement of the four certificates of shares filed as exhibits P-9, P-10, P-26 and P-27; also to the memorandum of the 21st of May, 1927, P-66; including the conduct of all the participants in these various events; (d) Generally, all facts, conditions and circumstances tending to show that the late Hugh Quinlan agreed, or disagreed, as the case may be, to the contents of the letter of June the 20th, 1927.\nThe respondent would also bring new evidence of all facts, declarations and statements which might tend to rebut the evidence to be afforded as aforesaid by the appellant. The respondent in her memorandum does not object to the above suggestions of the appellant\u2019s attorney. We must take it that she would be content to reopen the enqu\u00eate within the above mentioned limits, although she has refrained from offering any suggestions in respect thereto.\nWe believe, however, that we should not send the case back to the Superior Court before deciding the question of the status of the plaintiff Ethel Quinlan, which was strongly attacked and defended before us. It must be borne in mind that the litigation has taken a different aspect since the judgment of the Superior Court, which dismissed a very substantial part of the conclusions, to wit\n1. The prayer that the appellant A. W. Robertson and the Capital Trust Company be removed from office;\n2. The prayer that they be condemned to render an account;\n3. The prayer that the inventory be annulled;\n4. The various allegations of fraud against the appellant, as well as the allegation that the late Hugh Quinlan was not of sound mind when the letter of the 20th of June, 1927, was read to him.\nNow, the plaintiff having acquiesced in the judgment of the trial judge, the issue before the Court of King\u2019s Bench and before us was limited to the following points:\n(a) The existence or nullity of the transfer to the appellant of the shares enumerated in the letter;\n(b) The validity of the transfer to the appellant of four hundred shares of the Fuller Gravel Company Limited;\n(c) The value of the shares whose transfer has been set aside; and as to the time at which the valuation should retroactively be made;\n(d) The legality of the finding that the appellant should pay all the profits made and dividends paid since the death of the late Hugh Quinlan. In this connection, we must take cognizance of the last will and testament of the late Hugh Quinlan, dated April 14, 1926.\nThe testator empowered his executors and trustees, in part, as follows:\nI extend the duration of their authority and seizin as such executors and trustees beyond the year and day limited by law, and I constitute them administrators of my succession and declare that they and their successors in office shall be and remain from the date of my decease seized and vested with the whole of my said property and estate for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this, my present will, with the following powers in addition to all the powers conferred upon them by law:\n(a) Power to collect all property assets and rights belonging to my Estate: power to sell and convert into money all such portions of my property and Estate, movable and immovable, as are not herein specially bequeathed, and that they may deem inadvisable to retain as investments as and when they think best, for such prices and on such terms and conditions as they may see fit: to receive the consideration prices and give acquittances therefore; to invest the proceeds and all sums belonging to my succession in such securities as they may deem best but in accordance with Article 9810 of the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec, and to alter and vary such investments from time to time.\n(b) To compromise, settle and adjust or waive any and every claim and demand belonging to or against my succession.\n(c) To sell, exchange, convey, assign, borrow money, mortgage, hypothecate, pledge, or otherwise alienate or deal with the whole or any part of the property or assets at any time forming part of my succession, either movable or immovable, bank or other stocks or bonds and to execute all necessary deeds of sale, mortgage, hypothec and pledge, acquaintances and discharges and other documents, in connection herewith, and thus \u201cde gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9,\u201d without judicial formalities and with the express understanding that any third party dealing with my Executors and Trustees shall never be compelled to attend or to control the investment or re-investment (emploi ou remploi) of the moneys.\n* * * * *\n(d) After the death of my said wife, to distribute and divide all the net income or revenue of my Estate equally between my children issued of my marriage with the said Dame Catherine Ryan \u201cpar t\u00eate\u201d or the legitimate issue \u201cpar souche\u201d and thus until the death of the last survivor of my said children at the first degree, it being my wish and desire that should any of my said children die without issue, his share in the revenues of my Estate shall be added to the share of his survivor brothers and sisters per capita \u201cpar t\u00eate\u201d and nephews and nieces \u201cpar souches.\u201d\n(e) After the death of all my said children at the first degree to divide the capital and property of my whole Estate, with all accrued interests and revenues equally per capita \u201cpar t\u00eate\u201d between my grandchildren and great grandchildren issued of legitimate marriages and then living.\nArticle Twelfth\nIn order that all the stipulations of this, my present will, may be respected by all and each of my legatees and beneficiaries, I hereby formerly (sic) declare that should any of them contest any stipulation of this, my present will and testament, they shall ipso facto lose their rights and titles of legatees or beneficiaries in this, my present will.\nArticle Thirteenth\nI expressly declare that no other parties or persons may have the right to endeavour, control, manage and divide the property of my estate, but my said testamentary executors and trustees and their successors in office and thus, without any intervention of any third party, tutors, curators and so on and so on and that the powers and authority hereinbefore given to my testamentary executors and trustees shall be interpreted as covering all deeds, documents and proceedings without any special judicial formalities being required and thus notwithstanding any provisions of the law to the contrary.\nThe nature of the rights vested in the female respondent under the will of the late Hugh Quinlan is not doubtful. He bequeathed his entire estate, save and except certain legacies in particular title, \u201cin trust\u201d to his trustees who are \u201cseized and vested with the whole of my said property and estate.\u201d\nAs to the children of the first degree, their rights are strictly limited, until the death of their mother, to\nan annual sum not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and not over two thousand dollars ($2,000) payable by monthly instalments in advance as will seem fit to my executors and trustees, and thus until such child or children will not remain with his or their mother.\nAnd after the death of their mother, the rights of the children of the first degree are restricted to \u201call the net income or revenue of my estate,\u201d with the stipulation that, in the event of the death of one of them\nhis shares in the revenues of my estate shall be added to the shares of his surviving brothers and sisters, per capita (par t\u00eate), and nephews and nieces \u201cpar souche.\u201d\nThe appellant has submitted to us that the children of Hugh Quinlan have no other right in their father\u2019s estate than the personal claim to the revenue payable out of the said estate; that mere creditors of revenues are as such unable to dispose of the estate or any portion thereof and that therefore they have no status to take an action concerning the ownership of any property appertaining to the estate.\nThe only remaining plaintiff now prays, as above stated, that the various sales and transfers of shares be declared null and void and that it be declared that these shares belong and have never ceased to belong in full ownership to the estate of Hugh Quinlan. As creditors of the revenues of the estate, the plaintiffs certainly had an interest sufficient to sue for the removal of the executors, if they were acting fraudulently. But now that these conclusions have been refused, and that this issue has been finally determined between the parties, can we say that the sole remaining plaintiff has the right to compel the executors and Robertson to undo what she alleges has been done illegally and return to the \u201ccorpus\u201d the shares in question? We believe that Ethel Quinlan Kelly, to the extent that she is entitled to a variable share in the net revenue of the estate of her father, has sufficient interest and \u201cstatus\u201d to preserve intact the \u201ccorpus\u201d of the estate if she can satisfy the court, that the shares mentioned in the letter of June 20, 1927, or that the 400 shares of the Fuller Gravel Company Limited were illegally transferred after the death of her father to the present appellant and should be returned to the estate.\nWe do not and cannot disturb that part of the judgment of the Superior Court which is now \u201cres judicata\u201d between the parties, since the respondent acquiesced in the dismissal of that part of her conclusion above enumerated, nor can we disturb that part of the judgment accepted by the executors and trustees.\nWe therefore allow the appeal with costs; quash in part the judgment of the Superior Court and also the rulings during the trial refusing oral evidence of the facts and circumstances hereinabove mentioned under paragraphs A, B, C and D; we declare such oral evidence to be admissible, and we send back the parties to the Superior Court to so complete the evidence already taken by a further enqu\u00eate and then secure a new adjudication on the merits of the issues hereinabove shown as remaining to be decided as between the respondent Dame Ethel Quinlan (Mrs. Kelly) and the appellant Robertson personally. The Court gives \u201cacte\u201d and considers as part of the record of this case the deed or agreement of settlement passed before R. Papineau Couture, N.P., on the 31st day of January, 1934, within the limits above stated.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaulieu, Gouin, Mercier & Tellier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tanner & Desaulniers.\n[1] (1874) 18 L.C.J. 317.\n[2] (1870) 14 L.C.J. 268.\n[3] (1889) M.L.R. 5 S.C. 11, at 15.\n[4] [1900] A.C. 467, at 474, 475.\n[5] (1902) 32 Can.

Ltd., seeking to set aside an emphyteutic lease entered into between the province of Quebec and the Power Company comprising the bed of the St. Francis River at or near Spicer Rapids, on the grounds: (a) that the river was neither navigable nor floatable, and consequently belonged not to the Crown but to the appellants usque ad medium filum aquce as riparian owners; and, (b) that, even if the river were floatable or navigable, the petitioners\u2019 titles having been granted in free and common soccage carried with them the right to the bed and banks of the river.\nIn the Superior Court, on the question of navigability and floatability, the respondents tendered certain historical evidence concerning the condition of the river at or about the time the appellants\u2019 lots were granted at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The learned trial judge rejected the evidence thus submitted.\nThe learned judge found that the river was neither floatable nor navigable opposite the appellants\u2019 properties, and set aside the lease between the Crown and Southern Canada Power Co. Ltd.\nThe Crown and Southern Canada Power Co. appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, which maintained the appeal because of the refusal of the trial judge to admit the historical evidence and referred the record back to the Superior Court for further enqu\u00eate, in order that the historical proof might be received in the record, the right of the adverse party to contradict it being reserved, and that, upon the said proof being submitted, the Superior Court might deal with the case on the merits; Mr. Justice Howard and Mr. Justice Bernier dissenting\u2014the first named judge being in favour of maintaining the appeal and the second named judge being in favour of dismissing it.\nThe respondents allege that the judgment of the King\u2019s Bench is not a final judgment, and that consequently this Court is without jurisdiction to hear an appeal from that judgment.\nWe have come to the conclusion that the motion to quash should be granted.\nAs pointed out in Davis v. The Royal Trust Company[1], in order that a judgment may come under the definition of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in s. 2 (b) of the Supreme Court Act, it must have, \u201cin whole or in part,\u201d determined or put an end to the issue raised and in respect to which the judgment was rendered. Dealing with the judgment a quo only as a matter of interpretation, it seems to us that it determined nothing with regard to the titles or the rights relied on by the parties, and that it is purely provisional. The dispositif, in our view, makes that clear. It says:\nFait droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel, avec d\u00e9pens; In firme le jugement final de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ainsi que les d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate refusant la preuve historique offerte par les d\u00e9fendeurs; D\u00e9clare cette preuve admissible en loi, sauf au tribunal \u00e0 en appr\u00e9cier la force ou la valeur probante, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agira du m\u00e9rite de la cause, et Renvoie les parties \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate pour que l\u00e0, cette preuve d\u00e9j\u00e0 offerte et toute autre de m\u00eame nature soient re\u00e7ues au dossier, que la partie adverse puisse la contredire, s\u2019il y a lieu, et que cela fait, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure puisse \u00e0 nouveau adjuger au m\u00e9rite de la cause, suivant que de droit.\nIt will thus be seen that all the judgment does is to refer the record back to the trial court for further enqu\u00eate. It does not even decide that if the evidence already tendered or other evidence of a similar character be established, a certain result will conclusively follow. No directions, in that respect, are given to the Superior Court; far less is there to be found in the judgment any declaration to that effect binding upon the Court of King\u2019s Bench. Both courts are left entirely free to appreciate the new evidence and to decide upon it, concurrently with the facts already of record, in absolute independence. To paraphrase the words of M. Lacoste (\u201cDe la chose jug\u00e9e,\u201d n\u00b0 50):\nLa juridiction d\u2019appel n\u2019a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la partie qui a obtenu l\u2019interlocutoire qu\u2019une simple esp\u00e9rance; elle \u00e9tait en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une instruction imparfaite et n\u2019a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les faits d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive.\nNor is a judgment like the present one in the nature of the judgment \u201cdirecting a new trial\u201d contemplated by s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act. While it may be said perhaps that in enacting subs, (b) of s. 36 (\u201ca judgment granting a motion for a nonsuit or directing a new trial\u201d) Parliament, had in mind only jury trials\u2014as to which it is unnecessary to decide here\u2014there is no doubt that, in the premises, the judgment does not order a new trial. The supplementary enqu\u00eate will be merely the continuation of the original trial. The record will remain exactly as it is, and the future judgment will have to be pronounced upon that record, except that special leave is given to adduce further evidence upon the particular point and within the limited scope therein expressly stated. Otherwise the parties remain precisely in the same position as they were before, apart from the fact that the first judgment is set aside. (And see Hudon v. Tremblay[2]).\nThe appellants, however, pointed to the following consid\u00e9rant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que les requ\u00e9rants ont prim\u00e2 facie \u00e9tabli leurs titres, mais qu\u2019il convient de dire qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9sulte pas de la stipulation de franc et commun soccage qui est \u00e0 l\u2019acte de concession originaire de ces terrains, que l\u2019on puisse appliquer au cas qui nous est soumis une autre r\u00e8gle que celle du code civil;\nand they expressed the fear that, if their appeal were not asserted, this consid\u00e9rant might constitute res judicata against them.\nWe are of opinion that this is not well founded. Under the Civil Code (art. 1241) the authority of res judicata \u201capplies only to that which has been the object of the judgment.\u201d At bar, Mr. Geoffrion, while conceding\u2014as well he might\u2014that res judicata will sometimes result from the implied decision (though stated only in the motif), which is the necessary consequence of the express dispositif of the judgment (Refer Ellard v. Millar[3]), was frank to admit that, in the ensuing proceedings, it would not be possible for his clients to contend that the issue raised in respect of the title under franc and common soccage was finally determined between the parties in virtue of the above consid\u00e9rant.\nIn our view, the whole case is left open by the judgment appealed from. It may be that the trial judge and even the Court of King\u2019s Bench will feel inclined to follow the opinion expressed in that consid\u00e9rant. In no way, however will that be as a result of chose jug\u00e9e; and we are definitely of the view that the parties will not be bound by it in such a way as to be prevented from raising the point before a higher court, should there be an appeal to such court after the final judgment has been delivered. (Davis v. Royal Trust[4]).\nWe are the more influenced in giving that interpretation to the judgment a quo and towards construing it as not having determined the issue now in question, because, in their reasons for judgment, two only of the judges of appeal have expressed any opinion upon the point which forms the subject of that consid\u00e9rant and, of those two, one (Howard J.) does so only inferentially.\nThe motions to quash will therefore be granted with costs.\nMotions granted with costs.\n[1] [1932] S.C.R. 203, at 206.\n[2] [1931] S.C.R. 624.\n[3] [1930] S.C.R. 319, at 326, 327.\n[4] [1932] S.C.R. 203 at 208.\n"}

To quote the words of Lindley, L.J. in Brooks v. Steele (14 R.P.C. 9), \u201cthe judge may, and indeed generally must, be assisted by expert evidence to explain technical terms, to show the practical working of machinery described or drawn, and to point out what is old and what is new in the specification. Expert evidence is also admissible, and is often required, to show the particulars in which an alleged invention has been used by an alleged infringer, and the real importance of whatever differences there may be between the plaintiff\u2019s invention and whatever is done by the defendant. But, after all, the nature of the invention for which a patent is granted must be ascertained from the specification, and has to be determined by the judge and not by a jury, nor by any expert or other witness.\u201d\nOn the merits of the appellant\u2019s action for infringement of letters patent relating to devices for amplifying electric signal waves, upon the evidence adduced in the case, the trial judge was right in holding that the language of the daims must be construed by reference to the disclosure of the nature of the invention in the body of the specification and that, so construed, the thing done by the respondent did not constitute an infringement.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the president of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J., dismissing the appellants\u2019 action for infringement of letters patent relating to devices for amplifying electric signal waves.\nO. M. Biggar K.C., R. S. Smart K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellants.\nE. G. Gowling and D. K. MacTavish for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court (Smith J. taking no part) was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014First, as to the Arnold patent. The action, in so far as concerns this patent, is founded upon allegations that the respondents have infringed the monopoly limited by claim no. 2, which is in these words:\n2. The combination with a plurality of thermionic repeaters connected in tandem, the first repeater of the series having a high-voltage output and the last repeater of the series having a high-current output.\nIt will be convenient, at the outset, before stating the precise considerations which seem to me to dictate the construction of this claim, to mention some long established and well understood principles of patent law.\nThe first I shall mention could hardly be better stated than in the language of the treatise in Lord Halsbury\u2019s collection, of which Lord Halsbury himself was the author:\nIn order that the public may have sufficient and certain information respecting what they are prohibited from doing whilst the privilege continues, the patentee must particularly describe and ascertain the nature of his invention. In order that, after the privilege is expired, the public may he able to do what the patentee has invented, he must particularly describe and ascertain the manner in which the same is to be performed; (22 Hals. 161, Art. 338).\nIn Tubes, Ld. v. Perfecta Seamless[1], Lord Halsbury explained the purpose and meaning of a specification in these words:\n* * * if one has to look at first principles and see what the meaning of a specification is * * * why is a specification necessary? It is a bargain between the State and the inventor: the State says, \u201cIf you will tell what your invention is and if you will publish that invention in such a form and in such a way as to enable the public to get the benefit of it, you shall have a monopoly of that invention for a period of fourteen years.\u201d That is the bargain. The meaning which I think, in my view of the patent law, has always been placed on the object and purpose of a specification, is that it is to enable, not anybody, but a reasonably well informed artisan dealing with a subject-matter with which he is familiar, to make the thing, so as to make it available for the public at the end of the protected period. The question here is whether that has been done. Now it appears to me that the mode in which one ought to face that question is to look\u2014and I should say so not only of the specification of a patent, but of every instrument\u2014at the whole of the instrument to see what it means\u2014not to take one isolated passage out of it and make that inconsistent with the general invention, but to see substantially what the inventor really means, and when you arrive at that, then see whether the language is within the test that I have suggested as the proper test to apply to such a specification and is such as will enable a typical workman to give the public the benefit of the invention.\nIn Clark v. Adie[2], Lord Cairns said:\n* * * it must be made plain to ordinary apprehension upon the ordinary rules of construction, that the patentee has had in his mind, and has intended to claim, protection * * *\nfor the things which the infringer is alleged to have taken or done contrary to the prohibition of the patent.\nIn Dudgeon v. Thomson[3], Lord Cairns expressed it in this way,\n* * * that which is protected is that which is specified, and that which is held to be an infringement must be an infringement of that which is specified.\nYou ascertain what is specified by considering the specification as a whole. Lindley, L.J., in Needham v. Johnson[4], after quoting the language of the plaintiff\u2019s second claim, used these words:\nNow the first thing is to ascertain what that means; and with a view to ascertain what the whole sentence means, it is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by the expression \u201cconduit\u201d. The expression \u201cconduit\u201d requires explanation, and one must look for it, and see what it does mean. Of course it does mean that which the patentees have said it means. You are not to look into the dictionary to see what \u201cconduit\u201d means, but you are to look at the specification in order to see the sense in which the patentees have used it.\nI should add also that not only is the constructions of the specification exclusively within the province of the court\u2014but also it is for the court a question of law. In British Thomson-Houston Co. v. Charlesworth, Peebles & Co.[5], Lord Buckmaster said,\nMy lords, what did the specification of 1906 disclose and what did the patent of 1909 protect? These are the questions that arise for determination on this appeal, and their resolution depends upon the construction of two documents; such construction is the exclusive duty of the court, and this duty can neither be delegated nor usurped. As however in ordinary cases the existing circumstances in which documents were prepared, the relationship of the parties and the interpretation of terms of art are the proper subject-matter of evidence, so in specification of patents the state of knowledge in the craft, art or science to which the specification is directed and the explanation of technical terms, words and phrases are the proper subject-matter of testimony to aid interpretation; but beyond this, evidence affecting construction should not be allowed to stray. Finally, the document must be regarded as addressed to craftsmen in the particular branch of industry to which the alleged invention relates.\nAnd Lindley, L.J., in Brooks v. Steele and Currie[6], expressed himself thus:\nThe judge may, and indeed generally must, be assisted by expert evidence to explain technical terms, to show the practical working of machinery described or drawn, and to point out what is old and what is new in the specification. Expert evidence is also admissible, and is often required, to show the particulars in which an alleged invention has been used by an alleged infringer, and the real importance of whatever differences there may be between the plaintiff\u2019s invention and whatever is done by the defendant. But after all, the nature of the invention for which a patent is granted must be ascertained from the specification, and has to be determined by the judge and not by a jury, nor by any expert or other witness. This is familiar law, although apparently often disregarded when witnesses are being examined.\nThis is a case in which the specification, read as a whole, sheds a peculiarly revealing light upon the meaning of this claim. Moreover, we have the assistance of another document\u2014a contemporary document\u2014which, in view of the manner in which it was dealt with in the court below may properly be looked at for some purposes which will appear as I proceed.\nIt is necessary, however, I think, perhaps, to speak a word of caution with regard to such evidence. The duty of the inventor to disclose with certainty the nature of the invention for which he claims protection is a duty owing to the public, as Lord Halsbury observes, and that duty arises out of important public considerations. The protection afforded him by the grant is strictly limited to the invention disclosed and specified. He cannot enlarge his monopoly beyond that which he has specified, or that for which he has claimed protection (in such a manner as to make it clear to those to whom the document is addressed) by reference to supposed intention gathered from some contemporary document which is not part of the specification and has never been made known to the public. Such a document may establish or support a contention that the true nature of the invention has not been disclosed, or that the best manner known to the inventor of performing it has not been made known; and such matters may redound to the disadvantage of the patentee because it is a double condition of his right to a grant that he has invented a new manufacture and that he has disclosed completely his invention. But the rule limiting his monopoly right to what is clearly disclosed by the specification is a rule of substantive law, which it is the duty of the court, in the public interest, to enforce, and the application of it is quite independent of any question as to the admissibility in evidence of any particular document for some other purpose.\nAll this is, no doubt, applied with some qualification where the issue concerns the validity of a patent or the validity of a claim; where the claim is attacked, for example, on the ground that it is so broadly expressed as to embrace matters not included in the invention, or to embrace matters in respect of which it is alleged that there was no novelty at the date of the patent; or on other cognate grounds. In passing upon such an issue, the courts, as in the case of other documents, have, where they have been satisfied that there was a meritorious invention, resorted to the maxim ut res magis valeat quam per eat. And, where the language of the specification, upon a reasonable view of it, can be so read as to afford the inventor protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented, the court, as a rule, will endeavour to give effect to that construction.\nBut, I am now dealing with the construction of the specification from another point of view; for the purpose of ascertaining the limits of the monopoly acquired by the appellants and determining whether or not what the respondents do is something which the appellants\u2019 patent prohibits. In relation to such a question, the principles indicated above have full play.\nThe document I have just mentioned, which is a memorandum produced by Arnold for the information of his superior officer, Colpitts, thus discloses the subject matter of his investigations which led to the invention: the memorandum is headed \u201cAudion amplifiers without transformers,\u201d and the first sentence is as follows:\nThis relates to the use of audions as amplifiers in circuits from which it is advisable to exclude transformers.\nThat is the subject matter of the memorandum. The subject matter of the specification is defined in very much the same way in these words: This invention relates to the use of repeaters generally, and of vacuum discharge repeaters more particularly, as amplifiers without transformers. Still more particularly, it relates to the use of thermionic repeaters for securing amplification of current in circuits of low impedance.\nIn his memorandum, Arnold outlines the nature of the difficulties and disadvantages attending the use of audions then \u201con the market\u201d as amplifiers. Before doing that, he explains that in certain very important fields for use of audions as amplifiers, it is advisable to exclude transformers. These include telegraph circuits of all kinds, land, submarine and wireless. He emphasizes cable telegraph circuits and also the reproduction of speech and music where undistorted amplification must be secured over a wide range of frequency. He explains that, in this last case especially, the inherent selectivity of a transformer is undesirable. Then he states that with the audion then \u201con the market\u201d it is necessary to use transformers in order \u201cto secure appreciable amplification\u201d. He adds that this is especially true where the circuit in which amplification is desired is of low impedance. This is due, he points out, to the \u201ccharacteristics of the audion itself.\u201d If there is a circuit of low impedance, say 1,000 ohms, and it is desired to secure amplification in that circuit, you cannot obtain more than 10% of the possible current amplification without the use of a transformer, because, with the audions then in current use, the impedance of the input side, when the audion is operating efficiently, is greater than 100,000 ohms, and it did not appear that any structural change would be likely to reduce it.\nThen, with the same type of \u201ccommercial audion structure,\u201d if you were to attempt, without transformers, to operate into a line of like impedance there must always be a considerable loss of \u201cpossible amplification,\u201d on account of the magnitude of the impedance on the output side. So that if you desired to take a current from a line of low impedance and deliver that current, after amplification, to a line of like impedance, you could not get more than 10% of the possible current amplification, unless you made use of transformers,\u2014transformers at the point of reception from the incoming low impedance line and at the point of delivery to the outgoing low impedance line.\nThe problem before him was to design \u201ccircuit arrangements\u201d which would escape these difficulties and disadvantages; and he says, at the end of his memorandum, We have designed\u2019 circuit (arrangements such that a combination of audions can operate without the use of transformers, and, even between circuits of low impedance, can give an output current in excess of 50 times the arriving current for all frequencies from those suitable to wireless signalling down to the lowest frequencies used in cable telegraphy.\nIt is this circuit arrangement, involving this combination, which is the subject matter of the patent. In the specification he states,\nIt has been discovered that a combination of one or more of the aforementioned high-voltage output type of audions working into one of the high-current output type, will operate, without transformers, from a line of low impedance, for example, 250 ohms, into a like line with a resultant current much greater, fifty or more times greater, than would flow in the second circuit if it were directly connected to the first circuit. The present invention is directed to such combination of two different types of repeaters, preferably audions.\nIt is well to point out, perhaps, that the invention which the respondents are alleged to have infringed is not that involved in the discovery and construction of the special types of audion themselves made use of in this circuit arrangement. The patentee explains in his specification that in respect of the audions themselves, applications have been made for patents, which, it appears, were afterwards granted, and, further, he explains that an application was made for a patent for another somewhat analagous combination but involving the use of only one of the new types of audion.\nThe combination, however, to which he declares in the specification that \u201cthe present invention is directed,\u201d and which in his memorandum he describes in the passage just quoted, seems to be very clearly defined. For the moment, the feature of it with which I am concerned is this: it is a circuit arrangement in which a combination of audions \u201cwill operate without transformers, from a line of low impedance\u201d into a line of like impedance.\nIt is not necessary to consider, for the purposes of this appeal, whether or not the patentee has conformed to the conditions of patent law which would be necessary to enable him validly to claim protection for a combination of repeaters other than audions. The infringement, if there has been one, is an infringement by the use of audions in a manner in which the appellants allege to be precluded by their monopoly under the patent, and we are concerned with audions alone. I now proceed to consider, first, the particular point of controversy as to transformers: whether, that is to say, the absence of transformers is a characteristic and essential feature of the invention disclosed by the specification.\nNow, Arnold, in his memorandum, follows up the passages already cited with this:\nIt has been found possible to construct audions with any desired output impedance, but no modification of this kind has produced a single audion-structure which will operate to advantage in low impedance circuits from which transformers are excluded.\nObviously an attempt might be made to use several audions, the one operating into the next, etc., in the hope that by such a succession of devices the output and input losses noted above might be so far overcome as to render the complete operation of value. Various attempts at so-called \u201ccascade\u201d operation have been made by DeForest and others, but never, so far as I am informed, in circuits from which transformers are excluded.\nThis appears to indicate that at least one of the desiderata which he is aiming to meet is the exclusion of transformers from such circuits.\nThen he proceeds to tell what he and his associates have accomplished:\nIn the course of our experiments we have discovered that certain forms of audion structure are especially adapted to this end.\nThen he describes these \u201cforms of audion structure\u201d which are \u201cespecially adapted to this end.\u201d They are of two types. The first type provides\nwithout the use of transformers * * * the possibility of stepping up the input voltage in one step to as much as 30 times its original value, or in two successive steps to as much as 500 times its original value.\nAudions of the second type \u201cstep down the input voltage to one-third its original value.\u201d He does not say in so many words that this audion is operated without a transformer but he makes it quite plain, by implication, because he says,\nIt is not because of this property that this latter type is of value, however, but rather because its output impedance can be made as low as 500 ohms, and hence it can be worked efficiently into a line of like impedance.\nOne surmises from the context that the figure 500 is a slip of the pen and ought to be 250.\nThen he proceeds to explain the nature of the combination that has been discovered, which is a combination of the two types of audion he has invented; each of which being (by a definition) operated without the use of transformers, as already explained; and he sums up the results obtained at the end of the memorandum by a description of the circuit arrangement involving this combination, in terms already quoted in which it is made perfectly clear that one fundamental characteristic of the invention is that, through these circuit arrangements, a combination of the two types of audions so described can operate \u201cwithout the use of transformers,\u201d and can, without the use of transformers, take a current from a circuit of low impedance and deliver it amplified by at least fifty times into a circuit of like impedance.\nTo revert to the definition of the combination to which, as the specification says, \u201cthe invention is directed,\u201d it would be difficult to find any construction, consistent with the grammatical sense of the words, that would exclude the absence of transformers from the essential features of the combination in respect of which protection is claimed. First of all, he defines the \u201chigh-voltage output audion\u201d; and an element of that definition is that \u201cwithout the use of transformers\u201d it will perform certain operations on the input current.\nThen, there is a definition of the \u201chigh-current output audion,\u201d which does not explicitly make the absence of transformers an essential element, but which, as already indicated, appears very clearly to do so when it is read with the specification as a whole properly construed.\nThen, after mentioning that the patentee has applied for patents in respect of these types of audions, he proceeds to describe the combination, and the combination, which is the invention for which he desires protection, is of\none or more of the aforementioned high-voltage output type of audions\n(a type which, by definition, is of such a construction that it performs the function assigned to it in this circuit arrangement without the use of transformers) with one of the high-current output type.\nThis combination, he says in explicit terms will \u201coperate without transformers\u201d; and it is \u201csuch a combination\u201d to which, he says, the \u201cpresent invention is directed.\u201d\nThis conception of the absence of transformers as characteristic and essential in the invention, essential, that is to say, for the purpose of efficiently securing the desiderata at which the inventor is aiming, indeed, pervades the whole specification as well as the whole memorandum addressed to Colpitts. The specification is illustrated by figures and there is not in any one of these figures a suggestion of a transformer.\nIn finally summing up the advantages of his invention, he emphasizes the various fields, indicated in the memorandum and in the beginning of the specification, in which the invention is hoped to prove of the greatest service. All these fields are fields in which, he declares, more than once, it is desirable to exclude transformers; and, I think the fair conclusion from his memorandum is that by that he means it is necessary in these fields to exclude them in order to secure efficient, if not, indeed, \u201cappreciable\u201d amplification.\nMy conclusion is that the learned trial judge was right in holding that it is an essential feature of the invention, for which the specification claims protection, that it should be capable of efficient operation for the purpose of amplification in currents of low impedance and in the fields to which he draws special attention, without the use of transformers. Indeed, the inventor has not left us in doubt as to his own view of the relation between the absence of transformers and the efficiency of the circuit arrangements which he has designed. After describing the two types of audion and describing the discovery of the combination of the two types and its happy effects in amplification between lines of low impedance, and emphasizing the transcendant importance of this discovery for submarine cable circuits, he proceeds to say,\nAn essential part of the system of amplification is the circuit whereby the several elements are interconnected without the use of transformers.\nThe significance of this statement is brought into relief by the fact that, so far as I have been able to observe, this paragraph and the preceding paragraph in his memorandum are the only places where he makes any explicit statement as to what he regards as the essential parts of his system. In the preceding part of this paragraph he says,\nIt must be admitted that the \u201cB\u201d type is not an essential to this scheme of operation but it is, however, necessary that audions of the \u201cA\u201d type must be used at the input.\nAnd then follows the sentence I have just quoted in which he declares that the exclusion of transformers is an essential part of the system.\nI now turn to the construction of the specification in another aspect. To revert to the language of claim no. 2: 2. The combination with a plurality of thermionic repeaters connected in tandem, the first repeater of the series having a high-voltage output and the last repeater of the series having a high-current output.\nThe learned President has held, in addition to his holding as to the use of transformers, that the language of this claim must be construed by reference to the disclosure of the nature of the invention in the body of the specification, and that, so construed, the thing done by the respondents: does not constitute an infringement. I agree with him in both these conclusions.\nFirst of all, as to the construction of the claim, we need not concern ourselves with the phrase \u201cplurality of thermionic repeaters connected in tandem\u201d. The controversy really concerns the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe first repeater of the series having a high-voltage output and the last repeater of the series having a high-current output.\u201d\nAs already observed, this is especially one of those cases in which it is the document itself which affords the most valuable assistance possible for ascertaining the scope and signification of the phrases employed to limit the claim. That will fully appear as I proceed.\n\u201cHigh-voltage output\u201d and \u201chigh-current output\u201d as; applied to audions or thermionic repeaters do not appear, so far as the evidence discloses, to have been terms of art: prior to Arnold\u2019s invention. No witness says they were, and Arnold\u2019s memorandum rather suggests that they were not, as we have seen.\nHe describes two types of audion which he and his associates have succeeded in designing, one of which steps up the input voltage (type \u201cA\u201d) to as much as thirty times its original value, and the other of which steps down the input voltage by as much as two-thirds of its original value; the first being denominated type \u201cA\u201d and the second, type \u201cB.\u201d\nIn the first paragraph of his summing up, at the conclusion of his memorandum, he refers to this particular matter in this way,\nWe have discovered the fundamental factors and their relative importance in audion structure to such an extent that we are able to make one particular type of structure which provides a large amplification of input voltage, and another type of structure which provides large amplification of current with considerable diminution of voltage.\nThe memorandum seems to show very clearly that both types of audion are new,\u2014the inventions of himself and his associates. In the specification, where the description in the memorandum is virtually repeated, the denominations are changed. Type \u201cA\u201d becomes the \u201chigh-voltage output audion\u201d and type \u201cB\u201d the \u201chigh-current output audion\u201d.\nThe specification seems to indicate that, as regards the high-voltage output audion, what Arnold has done is to give \u201caudions of the usual type\u201d a form of construction which provides certain effects that are essential to the operation of his circuit arrangements; while, as to the \u201chigh-current output audion,\u201d he speaks of it in the specification as a \u201cnew type of audion\u201d. As already mentioned, it apparently was patented in January, 1915.\nIn the specification, he says, referring to the \u201chigh-voltage output audion\u201d,\nThis type of audion will, for convenience, be hereinafter referred to as the high-voltage output audion.\nReferring to the high-current output type, he says,\nThis new type of audion will, for convenience, hereinafter be referred to as the high-current output audion.\nThe natural conclusion from all this is, that Arnold conceives himself to be assigning a denomination to a new type of audion designed by him for certain purposes, and a denomination to a special construction of the usual type of audion designed by him for specific purposes; and that these denominations are assigned for the purposes of the exposition of his invention in the specification. The particular type is to be \u201chereinafter referred to\u201d under its appropriate denomination.\nAs we proceed through the specification, at the very outset, we are met with a sentence in which he defines the combination to which, he says, the \u201cinvention is directed\u201d, as\none or more of the aforementioned type of audions working into one of the high-current output type.;\nAs to the significance of these phrases, I shall come to that later. In the meantime it is sufficient to point to the perfectly definite way in which the specification tells the people to whom it is addressed: Here is a type of audion which has been devised and which has certain definite features; and that type of audion will hereinafter be referred to under its appropriate denomination. Then he proceeds immediately, in defining the combination, in re- speet of which the invention is claimed, to speak of a combination of the \u201caforementioned types\u201d.\nOne might multiply references:\nFig. 1. is * * * an audion of the high-voltage output type;\nFig. 2. * * * an audion of the high-current output type;\nFig. 7. * * * audions of the high-voltage type in tandem working into * * * audions of the high-current output type * * *\nFig. 8. * * * a circuit arrangement embodying the invention in which the two different types of audions are (combined in one bultb.\nIn the drawings, the audions 1 are of the high-voltage output type and the audions 2 are of the high-current output type.\nIn the high-current output type of audion, the input electrode * * * may be at any side of the filament * * * As hereinbefore stated, the high-voltage output type of audion gives an amplification with low current and high voltage in its output circuit; whereas the high-current output type gives amplification with high current and low voltage, and hence low impedance, in its output circuit.\nFig. 7 shows a plurality of the high-voltage output audions in tandem working into a plurality of the high-current output audions.\nFig. 8 shows * * * an audion of the high-voltage output type (which) works into an audion of the high-current output type * * *\nI do not believe that any member of the class of people to whom this specification is addressed could have much doubt that the specification is employing these phrases in the sense defined by the specification itself. As I have already said, there is no evidence that they were terms of art having a generally understood signification in the art at the date of the patent, and, even if there had been such evidence, I should have regarded it as quite immaterial, because the inventor has made it plain that he is not using these phrases in any sense caught from the air, or from some general usage, but with a precise signification which he has defined in his specification.\nIt ought to be mentioned that Mr. Arnold admittedly is a distinguished scientist, and it seems not an unreasonable assumption that he would express himself in a manner likely to be understood by practitioners in his own art. Such persons, I think, could not fail, in perusing this document, to read the phrase \u201chigh-current output type\u201d and \u201chigh-current output audion\u201d as phrases denoting the \u201cnew type\u201d which the specification has already defined and which it declares will be \u201chereinafter referred to under the denomination high-current output audion\u201d. Nor do I think this exposition is calculated to convey to an intelligent reader any other impression than the impression that the phrases \u201chigh-current output\u201d and \u201chigh-voltage output\u201d are employed to denote what is described in the paragraph defining \u201chigh-voltage output audion\u201d and \u201chigh-current output audion\u201d respectively.\nMoreover, I find it impossible to separate claim no. 2 from the final summing up of the invention beginning,\nIt has been discovered that a combination of one or more of the aforementioned high-voltage output type of audions working into one of the high-current output type, will operate, without transformers, from a line of low impedance, for example, 250 ohms, into a like line * * * The present invention is directed to such combination of two different types of repeaters, preferably, audions.\nI have no doubt whatever that, on a proper construction of the specification as a whole, the combination mentioned in the second claim is the combination described in the passage just quoted; or that the \u201cthermionic\u201d repeaters mentioned in the claim must be taken to be thermionic repeaters having the characteristics ascribed by definition to those with which the inventor has succeeded in securing the results which he says are secured by his invention. As a matter of construction, the point does not really appear to me to be open to serious argument.\nThen, what are the essential features of the combination? The combination, I repeat, is defined in the passage quoted, and it is\na combination of one or more of the aforementioned high-voltage output type of audions working into one of the high-current output type.\nI do not think there is much controversy as to the essentials of the high-voltage output audion, but there is a controversy as to the high-current output audion. Grammatically, there could be no possible question about the construction of the language which is used in defining the high-current output audion. In the first sentence it is stated that\nIt has been discovered that audions may be constructed which will step down the output voltage to, for instance, one-third its original value.\nThen follows the sentence, \u201cThis last mentioned type of audion has a high current and low voltage output.\u201d \u201cLast mentioned type of audion\u201d means, grammatically, the type of audion mentioned in the first sentence; and the only typical thing about the audion mentioned in the first sentence is that it \u201cwill step down the input voltage, for instance, to one-third its original value.\u201d Then follows the sentence, \u201cBecause of its low output impedance * * * such type of audion\u201d (which means this \u201clast mentioned type of audion\u201d of the next preceding sentence, that is to say, the type of audion which steps down the input voltage) \u201ccan be worked efficiently into a line of like impedance.\u201d Then, the final sentence, \u201cThis new type of audion,\u201d (which, of course, is the type of audion with which alone the paragraph is concerned, the type of audion \u201cmentioned\u201d in the first sentence, \u201cwill, for convenience, hereinafter be referred to as the high-current output audion.\u201d\nThen, in the description of the combination just cited, the definition of the two types of audion is imported by this phraseology.\n* * * a combination of one or more of the aforementioned high-voltage output type of audions working into one of the high-current output type * * * The present invention is directed to such combination of two different types of repeaters, preferably audions.\nGrammatically, therefore, the type of audion which is denominated the \u201chigh-current output audion\u201d or the \u201chigh-current output type,\u201d and in the description of the combination is the last of the series of audions, and in the claim is referred to as \u201cthe * * * repeater * * * having a high-current output\u201d is, for our present purposes, since we are here not concerned with repeaters other than audions, a type of audion which is defined by the possession of the property that it \u201cwill step down the input voltage to one-third its original input value.\u201d That is the result of reading the words in their ordinary grammatical sense, and there is not in the specification, or in Arnold\u2019s memorandum, anything I can discover which would justify a departure from the grammatical sense. On the other hand, there is much in these documents, apart from the paragraph cited, which goes to show that the property of stepping down the voltage is a property of essential importance. In the definition of high-current output audion, there is this which is not without significance:\nBecause of its low output impedance * * * such type of audion can be worked efficiently into a line of like impedance.\nThat is to say, \u201csuch type of audion\u201d (the type which \u201cwill step down the input voltage\u201d) possesses, as such, a low output impedance which can be worked into a line of low impedance. Elsewhere in the specification, and in Arnold\u2019s memorandum, this relation between the reduction of input voltage below its original value and low output impedance is recognized in unequivocal terms. In a passage already quoted from the specification it is stated,\nThe high-current output type gives amplification with high current and low voltage and hence low impedance in its output circuit.\nIt is the low output impedance, which is characteristic of the high current output audion that, by definition, steps down the input voltage, that makes it possible to have an audion, so defined, work efficiently into a line of like low impedance. That is one, at all events, of the cardinal virtues of this type of audion.\nThe capital purpose of the inventor, no doubt, is to secure a high amplification of current flowing into a line of low impedance.\nThe audion 2, says the specification, acts as an amplifier in which the current is increased and the voltage lowered in its output circuit. Because of the fact that the impedance * * * is lowered, it can be worked efficiently into a line of similarly low impedance.\nIn his memorandum, Arnold describes the high current output type in this way,\nWe have also succeeded in making audions which step down the input voltage to one-third its original output.\nHe goes on to explain that this property, that is, the property of stepping down the input voltage is not, per se, the thing which gives this type its value; but that such value directly results from the property by which the output impedance can be made low, by reason of the fact, as the specification explains, that the voltage has been lowered, making it suitable therefore, for direct connection to a low impedance outgoing line.\nAgain, at the conclusion of his memorandum, in describing this type of audion, the properties mentioned are\nthat it provides a large amplification of current with considerable diminution of voltage.\nIt is quite clear, I think, that one of the essential characteristics of this type, for the purposes of the invention in question, is that it should be capable of diminishing, and does diminish, the input voltage below its original value.\nI do not propose to enter upon a scientific discussion touching the relations between voltage, impedance and current in thermionic repeaters of the kind with which Arnold is dealing in their bearing upon this device of Arnold\u2019s in which the input voltage is reduced below its original value, and by the use of which he produces such results in magnitude of current and minimization of impedance in the output circuit as to enable the inventor to arrive at that at which he says he has arrived, viz., to obtain a current amplification of fifty-five times between circuits of 250 ohms impedance with sufficient energy capacity to deliver at least one-tenth of an ampere at the terminals. There was no satisfactory scientific discussion of these matters at the trial and, although I have read the evidence many times, I have not discovered any evidence (and our attention has not been called to any) which would enable me to go into scientific matters of which I do not think I can take judicial notice without a much more complete instruction upon them than this record presents.\nIt is sufficient that Arnold himself says he obtained these results with a series of tubes consisting of one or more of the high-voltage type and one of the new type known as the high-current type, the primary characteristic of which is (by definition) that it steps down the input voltage below its original value, and that he was able to do so because this tube, in which the input voltage is lowered as low, for example, as one-third its original value, is a tube in which the impedance of the outgoing circuit can be reduced as low as 250 ohms or 500 ohms which makes it possible to work it into a line of like impedance,\u2014the normal impedance, as one of the witnesses says, for low impedance circuits.\nI now come to the matter of infringement. The issue is, to adopt the language of Lord Cairns in Clark v. Adie (1)[7]. \u201c Whether\u201d (the alleged infringer has) \u201cadopted the substance of the instrument patented\u201d, or, to vary the phrase, whether he has \u201ctaken in substance the pith and marrow of the invention\u201d.\nInfringement is a mixed question of law and fact. First of all, it involves the construction of the specification and, if there is any dispute about that, the issue, let me repeat, is an issue of law for the court.\nThere is further an issue of fact whether the invention, as disclosed by the specification as construed by the court, has been in substance taken by the defendant. This issue is, to adopt again the language of Lord Cairns in Clark v. Adie[8], \u201ceither for a jury or for any tribunal judging of the facts of the case\u201d. It is for the appellants to establish by reasonable evidence to the satisfaction of the court, as judge of the facts, that the respondents have really taken and adopted the substance of the invention which Arnold specified in his specification.\nThe contention of the appellants is that the thing which the respondents do is prohibited by claim no. 2.\nThe description of Baldwin\u2019s system, given by the witness Cornwell in the course of his examination, may, I think, for all relevant purposes be accepted as accurate. It is as follows:\n117. Q. Do that briefly?\nA. The first tube of this amplifier is a type 224 vacuum tube and it is a potentially operated tube, in other words, its function depends on nothing but voltage which is applied to the terminals connected by the input. It has a very high impedance circuit in design and when connected there is a resistance of 200,000 ohms. This tube is a screen grid tube, a development of late years, where in a high rate of amplification is realized over what was had in the days of Colpitts and Arnold; by virtue of the introduction of this screen grid this tube steps up the voltage that is applied to its grid and in addition increases the current at the same time; in other words, it is an energy amplifier which is the standard and common action of all conventional radio tubes. If I might give a value that perhaps would make it more clear. We can apply at the input 3\/10 of one volt, a very small fraction, and by virtue of its amplifying power it will step up that voltage to 50 volts; that is, we could get off the plate of that tube 50 volts if 3\/10 of a volt was applied to its grid. In so much as it is a pulsating or alternating current of 50 volts it will travel to the grid of the tube labelled (B) and it travels directly to this grid through a copper conduction, there being introduced in that circuit nothing in the way of condensers, inductors or batteries, giving the conductivity the value of the lowest possible resistance, which assures more efficiency than is disclosed in patents in the prior art. This tube receives this 50 volts and steps it up still higher. Relatively speaking, the 224 tube is rather a low voltage tube as regards the value of its output in comparison with the voltage of the output of tube (B) which has a value of about 3.8; in other words, it multiplies the voltage 3.8 times. However, we do not realize exactly that full value but actually realize a gain of three times, which means that off the plate of this second tube we obtain 150 volts and a small increase in current as well. This plate, the output or plate of this tube also contributes voltage to the grid of tube (C), the third tube. The voltage is conveyed to tube (C) through another resistance and those resistances are R10, R9 and R8 and they maintain a fixed value of ratio nearer that grid and tube (C) will receive 50 volts when the grid of tube (B) is receiving 50 volts by reason of the gain to tube (B) from the amplification power and tube (C) steps it up to 150 volts, and those two plates as mentioned above are working in a series relation to each other, so that they gain double that voltage, making it 300 volts which is, of course, a very high value. The relationship of the tubes (B) and (C) to each other, in so far as performance is concerned, can be explained as follows: If tube (B) is removed from the circuit and tubes (C) and (A) are retained, then the whole instrument ceases to function. If tube (B) is replaced and tube (C) is withdrawn, the circuit will function but unsatisfactorily, due to the fact that its power is reduced to less than half and it is distorted due to unbalanced potentials and change of impedance in what we call the inductance T. The two tubes are essentially then to give operation that is acceptable for general commercial standards of quality. The two terminals, labelled output, upon being measured, possess the value of approximately 8,000 ohms impedance, which is a high value. With the impedance of 8,000 ohms, roughly figuring upon driving the whole amplifier with this 3\/10 of a volt, is computing it at 300 volts, and with the imposed values of that impedance of 8,000 ohms, we get power, which is energy, the product of current and voltage, of 11 watts. In consideration of 300 volts being embraced the current would be, very roughly figuring, about 37\/1000 of one ampere, which is, of course, quite low. That is, the output would not work when connected to a cable line or telephone line of the conventional values of 250 ohms impedance or that of 500, as far as efficiency or quality is concerned, first, because of the values in the circuit the amplifier is not able to reproduce the low frequencies that go down to as low as 30, 20 or 10 cycles and no efficiency could be realized at 2 cycles with it and if you desire to apply it to a telephone line, if you want to obtain any efficiency or quality at all, as well as vitality of wave form, it is essential that a transformer be connected to that output, that is, to reduce the voltage and to also, of course, reduce the impedance down to a value that is comparable to the impedance value of your line, and naturally, when you reduce that voltage but retain that power, your current then will increase, but it can only be done by the insertion of a transformer; the tubes do not do it, but the transformer does it in such a case. I believe that covers the circuit.\n* * *\n126. Q. Is there any device or such a thing as a cable telephone or microphone which you could attach to the input of the defendant\u2019s circuit and have it match the impedance of the circuit generally?\nA. Microphones and telephones of general type are low impedance instruments, telephone lines are also low impedance circuits usually. If any of them were connected to the input of the defendant\u2019s amplifier natural impedance matching would not be realized; it naturally suffers in efficiency and does not amplify as much as it might or should do if they matched.\n127. Would you say whether it was practical to use the defendant\u2019s circuit without transformers, input and output, in public address systems?\nA. No, sir.\nSubject to what the defendants\u2019 witnesses say in regard to the use of transformers, the physical characteristics of the Baldwin system are briefly summed up in a passage from the appellants\u2019 factum which I quote in full:\n20. Specific figures were given with respect to the defendant\u2019s system. The input upon which the calculations at the trial were based was 3\/10 of a volt and the input amperage fifteen ten-millionths of an ampere. In the first tube (A) the voltage is amplified 166 times, and the current only 55-66 times. In each of the tubes of the pair (B and C) on the other hand, the current is amplified 370-444 times and the voltage only 1.8-3.8 times, the variance in the figures depending upon the particular method of Calculation adopted. By reason of the last repeater consisting of a pair of tubes the resulting voltage output of the system is double what it would have been if there had been only one. In the final result the system\u2019s output of power is just short of 25,000,000 times the input, a result which by the use of ordinary tubes in cascade would require five stages instead of two, and about 80 tubes of the kind until lately used.\nNow, comparing broadly Baldwin\u2019s device with Arnold\u2019s invention, and postponing for a moment the matter of transformers, you have these contrasted features:\nArnold\u2019s specification contemplates his amplifying system as one which, without the use of transformers, could be efficiently worked from and into it a line of low impedance, 250 to 500 ohms, for example. He refers thus to some of the fields in which he thinks his invention can be most usefully applied:\nAs applied to submarine cable work for amplifying the feeble current at the receiving end the invention is of special importance. And, he adds, the invention is particularly adapted for use in circuits where especially pure, loud reproducton of speech or music is desired. In general in the art of submarine, land and wireless telegraphy, the invention is of importance with reference to recording, high-speed working and direct repetition from one type of system to another type of system.\nAs to the Baldwin system, the impedance of the first repeater reaches the high magnitude of 200,000 ohms, and, as a result of the evidence as a whole, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that, without the use of transformers, a repeater having such an order of input impedance could not be efficiently operated from lines with such impedance as would be encountered in those fields which Arnold has specially in view. Cornwell\u2019s evidence is perfectly clear on that point. Cornwell\u2019s evidence is quite explicit that the use of this system is not practicable for the transmission of speech and music without transformers at both ends of the circuit, that is to say, at the input of the first repeater, as well as at the output of the last repeater.\nIt is admitted, it is true, that in some cases where the incoming line connected with the input of the first repeater has an impedance ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 ohms the system can be put to some practical purpose; though this is emphatically denied by the appellants\u2019 expert witness. The point I am concerned with at the moment is that by reason of the very high impedance \u00f3f the first repeater, Baldwin\u2019s system cannot be usefully employed without the use of a transformer in the wide and important fields specially mentioned by Arnold. That, coupled with the fact already mentioned that in his disclosure of his combination he contemplates working from a line of low impedance, say 250, ohms, into a line of like impedance without transformers, is a not unimportant circumstance when considering whether or not the pith and substance, the spirit of Arnold\u2019s invention, has been taken by Baldwin.\nThen, there is another feature which is not without its importance in Baldwin\u2019s first repeater. Arnold contemplates no appreciable increase of current in his first repeater. Baldwin\u2019s first tube is vastly different. It amplifies the current over 60 times. This is of significance when it is remembered that Arnold only contemplates a total amplification of current by his whole system of 55 times.\nNow, coming to the second repeater consisting of a pair of tubes (B and C) in series. The distinction is marked. It is an essential feature of Arnold\u2019s invention, that the second type of repeater, according to the intention of the inventor, and by express definition in the specification as well as in the memorandum, reduces the output voltage of the first repeater below its original value; Baldwin does not lower the output voltage from the first repeater. On the contrary, the second repeater, involving two audions, amplifies that voltage by six times. I shall have to return to this in discussing one of the arguments addressed to us, but, in the meantime, I pass on to the output impedance of the system.\nOne of Arnold\u2019s capital aims is to reduce the output impedance of the system, which he was eminently successful in accomplishing, to 250 or 300 ohms. The difference in figures alone is striking but the practical consequences are of still greater importance. Arnold\u2019s object, let me repeat to the point of weariness, in reducing impedance to 250 or 500 ohms was to enable him to work his output circuit of his last repeater into a line of low impedance directly, without the use of transformers, and this to enable him to employ his system in the fields already mentioned with all the advantages arising, as he considered, from the absence of transformers.\nIn Baldwin, the output impedance reaches at least 4,000 ohms and in the most efficient operation it reaches 8,000 ohms. It is not seriously disputed that Baldwin\u2019s output circuit, working through such impedance, could not be efficiently connected with an outgoing line, for any of the purposes for which his devices are employed, without the use of transformers.\nA word upon the subject of transformers. The learned trial judge rightly found as a fact that for practical purposes the Baldwin system is not used without transformers connected with the output circuit; that for all except some very exceptional purposes for which such systems are used, a transformer is employed and is necessarily employed between the incoming line and the input circuit of the first repeater.\nTo sum up, Baldwin employs an initial repeater having 200,000 ohms in his output circuit, which, if it can be worked directly at all with an incoming line of low impedance, cannot be efficiently worked with an incoming line of impedance less than 5,000 ohms.\nArnold\u2019s invention contemplates a system which, after amplification of current by 50 times can be worked directly, without the use of transformers, into a line of low impedance and ordinarily will be so worked.\nBaldwin employs a repeater of outgoing impedance of from 4,000 to 8,000 ohms which cannot be efficiently, and is not in practice, worked, into an outgoing line without the use of transformers.\nArnold employs as his first repeater a repeater which does not amplify the current. Baldwin employs a repeater which amplifies the current of the incoming circuit between 55 and 66 times.\nArnold\u2019s invention involves a final repeater of such characteristics that it diminishes the voltage of the input circuit by a factor of two-thirds. Baldwin employs a repeater consisting of two audions which increases the output voltage of his first repeater by a factor of six, and these differences are not mere differences in figures. They have most important results in relation to the respective objects aimed at.\nAs I have already said, I entirely agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge, and on the issue of fact whether or not Baldwin\u2019s arrangement in substance infringes Arnold\u2019s patent, I agree with his finding.\nI also agree with the view expressed by him upon what is also a mixed question of fact and law, as I have already intimated, that neither the individual audions which constitute Baldwin\u2019s second repeater, nor the repeater as a whole, can be brought within the definition derived from Arnold\u2019s specification of high-current output audion.\nThis brings me to one or two points argued on behalf of the appellants to which I think it is necessary to refer. In order to be sure that I am doing no injustice to the argument, I quote from the appellant\u2019s factum:\n28. The patent specification refers to audions of the kind adapted for use as the first repeater as being of the \u201chigh voltage output type\u201d, and to audions of the kind adapted for use as the second repeater as being of the \u201chigh current output type\u201d. It describes the construction of each type. They differ in the size and spacing of their electrodes, which are to be larger or smaller and more or less far apart according to the result desired. This result is, in the case of the first type, a high output impedance, which leads to a high voltage amplification and inhibits the ready flow of current in the output circuit; in the case of the second type it is a low output impedance which permits a large increase in current but is inconsistent with a corresponding voltage amplificaton. In a passage twice quoted in the judgment Arnold says that he has discovered that audions of the second type can be made with so low an output impedance as even to \u201cstep down the voltage, for example to one-third of its original value\u201d. From this the learned trial judge infers that such a stepping down of the voltage in the second repeater was an essential feature of Arnold\u2019s idea, and accordingly holds that although each of the audions constituting the defendant\u2019s second repeater amplifies the current 370-444 times and the voltage only 1.8 to 3.8 times, these audions are not of the high current output type contemplated by the patent. Not only is the learned trial judge\u2019s inference directly contrary to the intention really entertained by Arnold and expressed in the preliminary memorandum, but it is also contrary to the oral evidence. The plaintiffs\u2019 witness Waterman categorically states that the second repeater in the defendant\u2019s system is a \u201chigh-current output tube\u201d, and the definition which the defendant\u2019s witness gives of the expressions \u201chigh-voltage output\u201d and \u201chigh-current output\u201d supports this statement. The point is one upon which, in the plaintiffs\u2019 submission, a judicial conclusion contrary to the express evidence cannot be supported. The plaintiffs further submit that Arnold-s object is accurately expressed in his patent. He proposes to Obtain a high undistorted amplification of signal energy by using audions in tandem, the first so constructed as to secure the amplification primarily of voltage and the second primarily of current. It is such a system which Arnold\u2019s claim defines and the defendant uses. There is no excuse for attributing to Arnold an intention to restrict his invention, or for interpreting his claim as being confined, to a system in which either of the audions used is the most extreme possible example of its type.\nThe essential fallacy of the argument seems to lie in the assumption that the phrase \u201chigh-current output audion\u201d is to be construed by witnesses, and that the tribunal charged with interpreting the specification is bound to accept the opinions of witnesses as to the effect of these words.\nI have already fully discussed this point of construction and I will now repeat that the question of the meaning of these terms in the specification, and the construction of the claim with reference to these terms, is a matter exclusively within the province of the court; and the learned trial judge would have fallen into grave error if he had accepted, as binding upon him, the evidence of witnesses with reference to that matter, as the appellants contend he ought to have done.\nI repeat that the witnesses relied upon in the factum did not profess to say that these terms had, before the publication of Arnold\u2019s patent, derived any commonly known meaning from usage in the art; that the specification itself provides the dictionary by which the scope and effect of these terms is to be ascertained; and, moreover, that it is clear that Arnold did not intend them to be read in any sense imposed by general usage, but solely in the sense in which he himself defines them.\nI may add, moreover, that if I were at liberty to treat the construction of these phrases as a question of fact, that is to say, if I were at liberty to treat as a question of fact, to be determined upon the testimony of witnesses along with the other facts in evidence, whether the meaning ascribed by the appellants to the phrase \u201chigh-current output\u201d corresponds with the sense in which Arnold intended to use it, or intended it to be understood, I should have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the oral evidence relied upon by the appellants, whatever be the effect of it, is entirely overborne by the internal evidence of documents before us.\nThen, the argument includes this statement:\nNot only is the learned trial judge\u2019s inference directly contrary to the intention really entertained by Arnold and expressed in the preliminary memorandum, * * *\nI have already discussed the memorandum sufficiently to show that in my judgment the evidence is diametrically in contradiction to this argument, but I must notice for a moment the reference by which that statement is supported. The first of these is a paragraph in these words:\nIt has been found possible to construct audions with any desired output impedance, but no modification of this kind has produced a single audion-structure which will operate to advantage in low impedance circuits from which transformers are excluded.\nIn several respects, this passage is not entirely clear. I am not sure that Arnold is speaking of some invention of his own. The context, especially the two following paragraphs, seem to indicate that he is not. However, the point of his observation seems to be this: The single audion-structure, whatever its impedance, it has not been found possible to devise in such a way as to make it possible to operate efficiently without transformers. I do not think that lends much force to (indeed, I am afraid I think it tells neither way) the contention the appellants are advancing.\nThe next reference is to another paragraph which is in these words:\nIt must be admitted that the \u201cB\u201d type audion is not an essential to this scheme of operation. We may replace one of the \u201cB\u201d type by from 10 to 100 of the \u201cA\u201d type in parallel, and secure comparable results. It is obvious, however, that the use of one audion of the \u201cB\u201d type is to be preferred. It is, however, necessary that audions of the \u201cA\u201d type be used at the input end, since only this type has the property of voltage step-up transformation.\nI must admit that here again I cannot ascribe any weight to this paragraph either for or against the appellants. The point under discussion is the validity of the learned judge\u2019s conclusion as to the nature and properties of a \u201chigh-current output tube\u201d as that phrase is used in Arnold\u2019s specification. The paragraph quoted points out that Arnold\u2019s \u201cscheme of operation\u201d as conceived by him, does not necessarily involves the use of an audion of the \u201chigh-current output type\u201d which may be replaced by a series of from 10 to 100 audions of the high-voltage output type arranged in parallel.\nWe are only concerned with Arnold\u2019s specification. There is no suggestion that the claim sued upon (which relates to a combination of two different types of thermionic repeaters) or the invention as described in the specification, embraces this alternative method; and, indeed, it is stated in the specification that, for a method which, from its description, I take to be this alternative method, Arnold has applied for a separate patent. I am unable to see what bearing all this has upon the scope and significance of the phrase \u201chigh-current output audion\u201d in Arnold\u2019s specification. On the other hand, I must point out that these are the only two passages from Arnold\u2019s memorandum that are referred to in support of the proposition that the learned trial judge\u2019s conclusion in respect of the nature and properties of that type of audion is \u201cdirectly contrary to the intention really entertained by Arnold and expressed in the preliminary memorandum.\u201d These references, as I have said, in my opinion have no weight either way. There are many other passages in the memorandum, however, to which reference might be made which at least point to the conclusion that this comment upon the learned President\u2019s judgment rests upon a misconception of the essential effect of the memorandum.\nFor example,\nWe have discovered the fundamental factors and their relative importance in audion structure to such an extent that we are able to make one particular type of structure which provides a large amplification of input voltage, and another type of structure which provides large amplification of current with considerable diminution of voltage.\nThe expert witness called by the appellant insists that in the high-current output type of audion the high-voltage delivered from the first type is accepted and passed on \u201cwithout material alteration.\u201d It will be plain from what has already been said that this description is a quite inadequate substitution for the definition given in Arnold\u2019s memorandum and his specification of this electrical device.\nThere is one general observation which, I think, ought not to be omitted. Fortunately, in this case we have, in the memorandum of Arnold, an exposition in language chosen by the inventor himself (who is a distinguished scientist and admittedly an entirely competent expert in this particular field of science) of the characters and circumstances of his inventions. The character of the devices, of the combination and of the circuit arrangements is explained by Arnold for the information of his superior officer in the memorandum before us, and we may assume that he would not use language of which the grammatical sense, as well as the sense imposed by the context, is the very opposite of what he intended to convey. A like remark would apply to the specification.\nI cannot yield my adherence to the process of replacing the plain language selected by Arnold himself to express his ideas of the properties of his inventions and substituting therefor paraphrases, possibly ingenious, but far from faithful.\nWith reference to Colpitt\u2019s case, it does not seem necessary to add anything to the observations of the learned trial judge. I entirely agree with his conclusions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\n[1] (1902) 20 R.P.C. 77 at 95, 96.\n[2] (1877) 2 A.C. 315, at 321.\n[3] (1877) 3 A.C. 34, at 44, 45.\n[4] (1884) 1 R.P.C. 49, at 58.\n[5] (1925) 42 R.P.C. 180, at 208.\n[6] (1896) 14 R.P.C. 46, at 73.\n[7] (1877) 2 A.C. 315, at 320.\n[8] (1887) 2 A.C. 315.\n"}

(Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nLa Banque Canadienne Nationale (Defendant) Respondent;\nand\nThe City of Chicoutimi and Others (Mis-en-Cause) (Two Appeals)\n1934: February 27, 28; 1934: April 24.\nPresent Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF KINIG\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Action in revendication of a cheque\u2014No valvs in controversy\u2014Bank and banking\u2014Insurance company\u2014Cheques drawn by insured for premiums to order of the company\u2014Endorsed by company\u2019s agent and credited to latter\u2019s account by the bank\u2014Moneys not refunded by agent to company\u2014Action by company to recover amount of cheques from the bank.\nThe appellant brought an action in revendication, directed against the respondent bank, of a post-dated cheque for $7,788.02 drawn by the city of Chicoutimi. The cheque had been handed to the appellant company\u2019s agent at Chicoutimi in error as to the amount and the city countermanded payment. The appellant\u2019s purpose in taking its action was merely to get the cheque from the respondent bank in order to remit or tender it back to the city of Chicoutimi.\nHeld that the appeal should be quashed, as the value in controversy from the point of view of the appellant company is insufficient to bring the appeal within the jurisdiction of this court. The other action concerns three cheques amounting to $7,380.14 and interest drawn by the mis-en-cause, the city of Chicoutimi, payable, in payment of insurance premiums, to the company appellant, with whom the city mis-en-cause had fire and workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. Those cheques were delivered by the city mis-en-cause to one, V\u00e9zina, who, at the material times, was acting as agent for the appellant company, and was also mayor of the city of Chicoutimi. All these cheques were delivered to the latter by the city before the premiums, for which they were severally intended to be given in payment, were due. This was done on the instructions of the mayor, (V\u00e9zina), himself. They were all, either cashed by him at the respondent bank\u2019s branch in Chicoutimi, or discounted by him when post-dated, and the proceeds were all deposited by him in his own account at the respondent bank. The agent V\u00e9zina having failed to remit the amount of these cheques to the appellant company the latter, by its second action., claimed the amounts from the respondent bank.\nHeld that the appellant company, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, was not entitled, on the form of action as taken by it, to recover from the respondent bank the amount of the above mentioned cheques. The appellant company might have a claim for damages against the respondent bank, on the ground that, through the latter\u2019s negligence, it deprived the appellant of the advantage resulting from the possession of the cheques, but, at this stage of the case, the appellant company is not entitled to obtain from this Court the right to amend its action and convert it into a claim for damages; per Rinfret J. especially when the appellant still possesses its right against the city of Chicoutimi for the recovery of the premiums.\nPer Rinfret J.\u2014The question whether these cheques were properly paid by the respondent bank is a matter between the bank and the city of Chicoutimi. It was not the appellant company\u2019s funds that the respondent bank appropriated towards the payment so made: the cheques were the city\u2019s cheques and the moneys out of which they were paid were the city\u2019s moneys; and the matter resolves itself into one of accounting between the bank and the city.\nCannon J.\u2014Under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the authority vested in V\u00e9zina to collect premiums due to the appellant company and grant discharges, included the right to endorse cheques for the purpose of making the collection of his commission and of the moneys to be remitted to the appellant sixty days after the issue of the policies or when the amount due for workmen\u2019s compensation premiums would be finally adjusted.\nAppeal from the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 55 K.B. 538) aff.\nAPPEALS from the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgments of the Superior Court Greenshields C.J., and dismissing the two actions brought by the appellant company.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. John T. Hackett K.C. and F. W, Hackett for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C, and A. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal relates to the subject matter of two actions in the Superior Court of Quebec; the one, no. 406, and the other, no. 407. These actions concern certain cheques drawn by the mis-en-cause, the city of Chicoutimi, payable, in payment of insurance premiums, to the appellants, with whom the mis-en-cause had fire and workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. Those cheques were delivered by the mis-en-cause to one V\u00e9zina, who, at the material times, was acting as agent for the appellants and was also mayor of the municipality. All the cheques with which we are concerned were delivered to him by the municipality before the premiums, for which they were severally intended to be given in payment, were due. This was done, as Mr. Blackburn, city treasurer, says, on the instructions of the mayor (V\u00e9zina) himself. They were all, either cashed by V\u00e9zina at the respondent\u2019s branch in Chicoutimi, or, as the bank manager describes it, discounted by V\u00e9zina when postdated. The proceeds of all were \u201cdeposited by\u201d V\u00e9zina, to quote the words of the respondents\u2019 factum, \u201cin his own account\u201d at the respondent bank\nwhich account was a personal one in which V\u00e9zina deposited all moneys which came into his hands whether or not they belonged, or were supposed to belong, to the insurance company, or anyone else. The proceeds of all these cheques were, therefore, credited to the account of V\u00e9zina and on this account he drew cheques for personal and other purposes as he deemed fit.\nThere is some dispute as to whether these proceeds went in reduction of a claim the bank had against V\u00e9zina, but, in the view I take of the appeal, it is not necessary to discuss that point. It is not disputed that the bank gave credit to V\u00e9zina for the proceeds of these cheques, and I see no reason to disagree with the view taken by the courts below that he had personal control over such credit.\nThe cheques, in all of the cases with which we are concerned, were payable to the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, Ltd., although there are slight immaterial differences in the descriptions of the payee. In one case, for example, the description is \u201cNorwich Union Fire.\u201d They were also endorsed by V\u00e9zina with slight, immaterial variations, \u201cNorwich Union Fire Insurance Co., P. V\u00e9zina.\u201d There is no serious dispute that it was well understood by the bank that V\u00e9zina was acting as agent of the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, Ltd., or that the cheque, of which the proceeds were deposited to his credit, were in his hands as such agent.\nTo deal with the cases in numerical order. The first action, no. 406, concerned a postdated cheque for $7,788.02. It was an action in revendication, accompanied by a writ of seizure issued at the instance of the appellants and directed against the bank. There are two points in regard to this cheque, and the second, at all events, is decisive; as to the other, I do not, for the moment, desire to express any opinion.\nThis cheque is said, and I think there is no dispute on the point, to have been drawn and handed to V\u00e9zina in error as to the amount to which the appellants would be entitled. It was roughly $3,000 in excess of the amount for which the cheque should have been drawn. This fact was discovered some time before the maturity of the cheque and after discount of it by V\u00e9zina, and (and this is the second point) the municipality promptly stopped payment of it, and it was, accordingly, not charged against the account of the municipality. In these circumstances, I am unable to perceive any evidence which would enable us to ascribe a value to this document, from the point of view of the appellants, of sufficient magnitude to bring it within the minimum of value required in order to make the appeal competent, viz., $2,000. It is a case in which leave to appeal should have been obtained, and the appeal ought, on that ground, to be quashed with costs.\nThe action no. 407 concerns three other cheques amounting in the aggregate to $7,380.14 and interest. They are dated respectively, December 18, 1930, March 19, 1931, and May 21, 1931. As already mentioned, all these cheques were issued at a time when no premiums were due by the city of Chicoutimi to the appellants. They were issued on the authority of V\u00e9zina (as mayor), and delivered to him as agent of the appellants. The first of the cheques, dated 18th December, 1930, was payable on demand and was cashed on the 20th. The second was dated the 19th of March, 1931, was payable the 12th of August, 1931, and was paid on the 15th of April. It was then credited to V\u00e9zina\u2019s account but not charged to the municipality until later. The cheque of the 21st May, 1931, was payable on demand and was actually paid on the same day and credited to V\u00e9zina\u2019s account.\nNow, these documents, as already observed, were in the hands of V\u00e9zina as agent of the appellants. They were the appellants\u2019 property. Unless V\u00e9zina had authority, I shall have a word to say about this later, to endorse and deliver them to the bank for deposit to the credit of the account mentioned, he was committing a wrongful act in doing so. The bank, as we shall see, was bound to know this. In such a case, unless the agent possessed such authority, a bank, taking a cheque, marking it paid, treating it in such a way as to make it appear on its face as a cancelled cheque and returning it to the drawer, would, prim\u00e2 jade, be wrongfully and unlawfully dealing and interfering with the property of the agent\u2019s principal; and, therefore, would be committing a \u201cfault\u201d by \u201cpositive act\u201d within the meaning of art. 1053 C.C.; and if damage was caused thereby such conduct might constitute an actionable wrong under that article. The elements of this proposition, perhaps, had better be discussed separately.\nFirst, as to the authority of the agent in respect of the endorsement of the cheque and delivery of it to the bank for deposit to the credit of his personal account. In this particular case there was written authority\u2014there was a document in existence defining the authority\u2014and by that authority he had power to collect premiums; and I am going to assume that, if a case arose in which endorsement was a necessary step in the process of collection, the agent had authority to endorse; if, for example, he was in circumstances requiring it, depositing a cheque in an authorized account kept under the name of his principals. The point is, perhaps, open to argument, but I am going to assume that he might, in such circumstances, have done such acts as this under his power of attorney. But, the agent\u2019s actual authority, and it is that which I am now discussing, in so far as it was derived from his power of attorney, must be ascertained from the language of the power. Moreover, when something done by an agent who purports to act under such a written authority is challenged as, an act beyond the limits of that authority, it is necessary that the person relying upon the validity of the act should show\nthat on a fair construction of the whole instrument the authority in question is to be found within the four corners of the instrument, either in express terms, or by necessary implication. Bryant v. La Banque du Peuple[2].\nIn terms, the instrument before us gives no power to endorse. It gives a power to collect. It may be, as I have said, that oases might arise in which endorsement might be necessarily incidental to collection. Although the decision in this case rests upon other grounds, and what I am about to say forms no part of those grounds, I think it advisable to observe that the power to collect cannot imply, least of all imply with such coercive force as to constitute a \u201cnecessary implication,\u201d a general authority to endorse such cheques in the name of the principals; nor can it imply in the sense mentioned, that is to say, necessarily, the authority to endorse for the purpose of depositing the cheque in, or of directing the bank to receive the cheque, or its proceeds, for the credit of an account which the agent uses for depositing and disbursing indifferently his own funds with the funds of his principals.\nActual authority, it is true, might be evidenced by course of dealing, but, where the authority is expressed in writing, parties relying upon a modification of that writing by reason of a course of dealing, as establishing a wider authority than can be found in the writing, have a peculiarly difficult task, especially where the principal is an incorporated company. Actual authority, whether proved by a written document or established by evidence of a course of dealing, means authority derived from the actual assent of the principal; and, when the evidence is of this last mentioned character, it must show, where the principal is an incorporated company, that the company has assented in fact to the possession and exercise of such authority by the agent; and such assent can be operative only if given through the officials or the body which by its constitution are, or is, competent to constitute such assent (Gresham v. Bank of Montreal[3]); and, where authority is already defined by a written instrument, is competent to enter into a binding agreement with the agent for altering the terms and effect of that instrument. Moreover, it must be proved that such assent includes the very transaction, or transactions of the very kind as that, concerning the validity of which the controversy arises.\nIn the hypothetical case already outlined, if the agent\u2019s authority to endorse the cheque and deliver it to the bank for deposit in his personal account were alleged to rest upon evidence supplied by a course of dealing, it would be incumbent on the party alleging the existence of the authority to establish that such course of dealing was inconsistent with the absence of such authority. It would not, for example, be sufficient for this purpose to show that the agent was in the habit of transmitting premiums received by him through cheques drawn in his own name upon a bank account. Assuming that assent to such a procedure were brought home to an official or a body competent to bind the company, as above mentioned, there would still remain a further difficulty. The fact that his principals received payment by cheque drawn on a bank account would not necessarily involve the assumption that the account was an account in which the agent mixed his personal moneys with the moneys of his principal, or an account other than one used exclusively for the purpose of depositing and paying to his principal the moneys of his principal.\nLet us, then, consider the position of the bank with reference to the actual authority of the agent. The point is very clearly covered by the Bills of Exchange Act, which is in these words,\n51. A signature by procuration operates as a notice that the agent has but a limited authority to sign, and the principal is bound by such signature only if the agent in so signing was acting within the actual limits of his authority.\nIt is unnecessary, therefore, to resort to more general principles of law. The bank, in the supposititious case, would be bound to know, and would be held to have accepted these documents from the agent with a knowledge of his actual authority; with, a knowledge, that is to say, of the authority which the agent possessed as between him and his own principal by virtue of the principals\u2019 actual assent. In such a case, where the person dealing with the agent has knowledge, or is deemed in law to have knowledge of the limits of that assent, we are nat concerned with ostensible authority, or with authority by \u201cholding out,\u201d or by estoppel. It must be distinctly understood that I am expressing no opinion upon the effect of the application of these principles to the concrete facts in this case.\nI have felt it necessary to say this, because there are some things in the judgments in the courts below to which, if I clearly understand them, I should, with great respect, have some hesitation in giving my adherence; and because these observations fare directed to topics of commercial and mercantile law, the rules of which affect the great mass of people carrying on business in their every day transactions.\nI have, nevertheless, been forced to the conclusion that the appellants are not entitled to succeed on the case advanced by them at the trial, in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and, indeed, here. I shall not elaborate the reasons; the specific rules of the common law under the heading of \u201cconversion\u201d are not, I am satisfied, specifically in force in the province of Quebec under the civil code. I add that qualification, not because of any particular exception in my mind at present, but because in Quebec as in other parts of Canada, there are very considerable fields of law governed by Dominion statutes, or outside the provincial domain, and I wish to avoid pre-judging any question which might arise in respect of transactions in those fields.\nNotwithstanding the wide power of amendment vested in us, this is not, I think, a case in which that power could be advantageously used. We could not permit, on the record as it stands, a claim to be advanced on the basis which I have indicated above; and, rather than direct or give the appellants an opportunity to make an amendment to their claim, and to proceed to a new trial, under the onerous terms in which alone that indulgence could be granted, it is better, I think, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThere is one further observation which it is desirable, perhaps, to make. It would be a mistake to treat cheques dealt with by a bank, as in the hypothetical case, as pieces of paper simply. A cheque drawn upon a bank in possession of funds out of which it owes a duty to the drawer to pay the cheque on presentation, which, moreover, will be paid on presentation, is not a mere piece of paper. The document in the hands of the payee has a value. In a practical business sense it is worth to him its face value, and, if it is wrongfully destroyed (as, for example, if the pay cheque of a government servant is destroyed by the wrongful act of a third person), he may suffer substantial loss in respect of which he has a remedy under Art. 1053 C.C. If the principles of the common law were applicable, the principal could, in the hypothetical case, recover immediately from the bank the face value of the cheque.\nArt. 1053 C.C., however, does not, apparently, embrace within its ambit the specific doctrines of \u201cconversion\u201d as understood by common lawyers; and, assuming the appellants might, on a case aptly framed and presented, be entitled to recover some substantial sum by way of damages against the bank, still, for the purpose of determining damages, other considerations would come into play, such, for example, as the value of the appellants\u2019 rights against the municipality of Chicoutimi.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that the appellant cannot succeed.\nIn the case bearing appeal no. 406, the appellant revendicates a cheque drawn by the city of Chicoutimi on the bank respondent. The city countermanded payment of that cheque. The bank had no longer any authority to pay it and owed no duty to anybody in respect of the cheque (Bills of Exchange Act, s. 167).\nAssuming, but not admitting, the appellant had, under the circumstances, a right of revendication (see Code of Civil Procedure, art. 946, 2nd parag.), it had no title to the amount of the cheque. In fact, its avowed intention was to get the cheque from the bank to remit or tender it back to the city. That makes it clear that the value in controversy is insufficient to bring the appeal within the jurisdiction of this Court. The appeal must be quashed with costs.\nIn the case bearing appeal no. 407, the cheques were issued by the city of Chicoutimi to the order of the appellant and given to one V\u00e9zina, who was the mayor of the city. They were for premiums on insurance policies against risks under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, although they were handed over to V\u00e9zina before the premiums were due.\nVezina endorsed the cheques in the appellant\u2019s name and deposited them in his own account with the respondent bank. He failed to remit to the appellant the amounts of the several cheques and the appellant now claims these a mounts from the bank.\nThe trial judge held that,\nunder the circumstances disclosed by the proof, the authority vested in Vezina * * * included the right to endorse cheques for the purpose of making the collection.\nOn that ground, amongst others, he dismissed the appellant\u2019s action.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, two of the judges were for (confirming this finding purely and simply. The third one (L\u00e9tourneau J.\u2014forming the majority) arrived in effect at the same conclusion. The finding is based, as I understand it, not particularly on the interpretation of the contract between Vezina and the appellant, but on the weight of all the circumstances established in evidence. While I feel that due consideration would have to be given to the concurrent judgments, I fully appreciate the importance of the observations of the Chief Justice on that point and, like him, I think it is sufficient to say that the appeal fails \u201con the case advanced by the (insurance company) at the trial.\u201d\nIt should be emphasized that actions in conversion are unknown to the law of Quebec (Corporation Agencies Limited v. Home Bank of Canada[4]). It follows that most of the English cases relied on by the appellant have no application here.\nPrimarily, the question whether these cheques were properly paid by the bank, is a matter between the bank and the city. They were the city\u2019s cheques, and the moneys out of which they were paid were the city\u2019s moneys. The main question is whether the bank had the right to charge the city\u2019s account with these cheques.\nV\u00e9zina was a broker, that is to say he\nexercised the trade and calling of negotiating between parties * * * lawful (insurance) transactions. He may have been the mandatory of both parties and have bound both the city and the insurance company by his acts in the business tor which he was engaged by them (Art. 1735 C.C.).\nBut, be that as it may, the cheques delivered to V\u00e9zina did not, of themselves, give any right of action to the insurance company against the bank. They did not operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the bank available for the payment thereof (Bills of Exchange Act, ss. 127, 165). Until the cheques wore accepted, the bank owed exclusively to its customer the duty of paying them.\nThe consequences would be that, even assuming V\u00e9zina received the cheques as agent of the insurance company, the mere giving of the cheques to him did not operate as a payment to the company. The cheques would become payments only in the event of their being ultimately honoured by the bank.\nIn fact, the cheques never reached the insurance company itself; and, at all events, if it be true, as contended by the company, that V\u00e9zina had no power to endorse and cash the cheques, the company has never been paid. The insurance company is bound by the signature of V\u00e9zina only if V\u00e9zina \u201cin so signing was acting within the actual limits of his authority\u201d (Bills of Exchange Act, s. 51). If he was, that is the end of the appellant\u2019s rights, if any, against the bank. If he was not, Vezina\u2019s signature is inoperative (s. 49), and the cheques, now in the hands of the city, will be no answer to the appellant\u2019s claim or action against the city for the insurance premiums due by the latter. In such case, the bank paid to the wrong party.\nBut it was not the appellant\u2019s funds that the bank appropriated towards the payment so made. It was the city\u2019s funds. And the matter resolves itself into one of accounting between the bank and the city.\nAs for the appellant, none of its funds have disappeared. Certain cheques, which gave the appellant no direct right against the bank, are alleged to have been diverted on their way to the appellant. The respondent\u2019s complicity was denied by both courts below. Its good faith, on the facts (as distinguished from any question of constructive notice), was acknowledged in both judgments. The appellant might have a claim for certain damages against the respondent, on the ground that, through the latter\u2019s negligence, it deprived the appellant of the advantage resulting from the possession of the cheques. But I am in entire agreement with my Lord the Chief Justice that, clearly, the appellant has not the right, which it has attempted to assert, of securing the payment of the amounts represented by the cheques under the guise of a claim for damages, if it still retains its full recourse for the premiums against the city of Chicoutimi. Such however would be the situation if, as the appellant contends, Vezina\u2019s endorsements were unauthorized and, consequently, null and void. (Bills of Exchange Act, ss. 49, 139, 166.) Under those circumstances, the appellant\u2019s rights against the city of Chicoutimi are still alive and its original cause of action for the premiums is unaffected.\nIt follows that the appellant\u2019s loss, if any, is not the loss it has claimed in the premises and in respect of which the whole trial has been exclusively conducted.\nThe respondent has a very clear interest in insisting that it should be called upon to account for the impugned cheques only towards the city of Chicoutimi, out of whose funds the cheques were paid. As between the bank and the city, there may be reasons why the city is precluded from disputing V\u00e9zina\u2019s authority to cash the cheques and the bank\u2019s right to charge them to the city\u2019s account. On all those questions, the real debate is between the bank and its customer, not with the appellant.\nThe action as brought could not be maintained and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014In the revendication case (no. 406) I agree with the Chief Justice that the appeal must be quashed with costs for lack of jurisdiction.\nIn the second case, however, I would dismiss the appeal with costs on different grounds.\nV\u00e9zina had the right to collect the premiums, grant discharges and remit the net balance. Mr. M. Jack who handled the Workmen\u2019s Compensation business and Mr. Paul, the assistant manager of the appellant, testified that ever since V\u00e9zina had been handling their business in Chicoutimi, they never looked to their assured directly for the payment of premiums, but left it entirely to Vezina. I, therefore, agree with the learned trial judge and the Chief Justice of Quebec that, under the circumstances disclosed by the proof, the authority vested in V\u00e9zina to collect premiums due to the plaintiff and grant discharges included the right to endorse cheques for the purpose of making the collection of his commission and of the moneys to be remitted to the plaintiff sixty days after the issue of the policies or when the amount due for workmen\u2019s compensation premiums would be finally adjusted. When the cheques in question issued, no premiums were actually due by the city of Chicoutimi to the plaintiff, but V\u00e9zina secured payments in advance, for his own accommodation and convenience.\nWe, therefore, have in this case, at least, for the locality with which we are concerned, an agent having possession of commercial paper belonging to his principal with general authority to indorse such instruments in the course of transacting the business of the principal and for his benefit. If the agent misuse such authority by applying the paper so indorsed to his own private purposes his dealing with it is from beginning to end a violation of his principal\u2019s rights; but third parties taking the paper from him with no knowledge or suspicion of his breach of duty and for value acquire nevertheless an indefeasible title even as against the principal. This was expressly decided, if not elsewhere, at least in The Bank of Bengal v. McLeod[5], and Bryant Powis & Bryant v. Quebec Bank[6]. A passage in Lord Brougham\u2019s judgment in the first mentioned case which has often been cited appears to be applicable to the circumstances of this case:\n\u201cBut it is further said, that even if the expression be read as only amounting to this, the endorsement is to be only made for the benefit of the principal, and not for the purposes of the agent. We do not see how this very materially affects the case, for it only refers to the use to be made of the funds obtained from the endorsement, not to the power; it relates to the purpose of the execution, not to the limits of the power itself; and though the indorsee\u2019s title must depend upon the authority of the indorser, it cannot be made to depend upon the purposes for which the indorser performs his act under the power.\u201d\nThe above quotation is from the judgment of this Court re Ross v. Chandler.5\nThe respondent had not insured the fidelity of V\u00e9zina towards his employers, nor were they bound to see that he would remit regularly the moneys which he owed them after deducting his commission from the premiums which he was alone authorized and in duty bound to collect from their clients in that locality. If the endorsements are irregular and ineffective, as contended by the appellant, why not claim against its debtor, the city of Chicoutimi, unless the appellant is afraid to be met with arguments and objections from the city that would prove and establish the validity of the endorsements?\nThe good faith of the bank is not questioned; they gave value for these cheques and the appellant is the victim of its own imprudence in trusting perhaps too blindly to the honesty and good financial standing of V\u00e9zina. They have no action based on the cheques as payee against the bank. They cannot, under the guise of an action in damages for negligence, succeed under the circumstances disclosed.\nI, therefore, agree with the Chief Justice that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal (Case No. 406) quashed with costs.\nAppeal (Case No. 407) dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Hannay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: G\u00e9rin-Lajoie & Beaupr\u00e9.\n[1] (1933) Q.R. 55 K.B. 538.\n[2] [1893] A.C. 170, at 177.\n[3] [1930] A.C. 659.\n[4] [1925] S.C.R. 706, 722.\n[5] (1849) 7 Moore P.C. 35.\n[6] [1893] A.C. 170.\n5 (1911) 45 S.C.R. 127, at 150-151.\n"}

He then walked faster but as accused was catching up to him he ran diagonally across the road in a southeasterly direction. When he reached the curb on the east side of the road the accused caught up to him and fired a shot at him with a revolver. Accused then took $90 from his pocket and after firing two more shots at him ran across a vacant lot in a northeasterly direction, and on emerging on Hastings street he was recognized by two witnesses with a revolver in his hand. Two other Crown witnesses, Irwin and Brodner, were standing on the southwest corner of Hastings street and Jackson avenue, when they saw two Chinamen run from the northwest corner of Pender street and Jackson avenue (Pender street being one street south and parallel with Hastings street) across Jackson avenue in a northeasterly direction, followed by a third Chinaman who was calling to them in Chinese and gesticulating with his arms, and when the two men reached the curb on the east side of Jackson avenue the rearmost of the two men turned and fired a shot at the man following, who fell. He then \"paused,\" stooped down and fired two more shots at him and he and his companion then ran northeasterly across the vacant lot. The accused attempted to prove an alibi by several Chinese witnesses who swore he was in Victoria from the 2nd until the 12th of November, 1932. The accused was convicted. On appeal the conviction of McDonald J. was affirmed by an equal division of the Court. Counsel for the accused contended before this Court that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that the accused was entitled to have them consider any alternative defence the supporting facts of which appear in the record, and that, as the record shewed that the complainant was chasing the accused, waving his arms and shouting in Oriental, such conduct was sufficient, if the jury believed the evidence, to bring into play the sections of the Criminal Code relating to provocation and self defence. He contended that the failure of the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on the issue of self defence, was a misdirection which entitled the accused to a new trial. Counsel for the accused also contended that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the question of intent, and erred in his charge in not explicitly and fully instructing the jury as to the legal consequences flowing from the two contradictory stories, in respect to the conduct of the parties prior to the shooting, as related by the complainant on one side, and Irwin and Bodner on the other.\nHeld that, under the circumstances of this case, there was no duty on the trial judge to instruct the jury on the issues of provocation or self defence. If it were material to the accused to prove that the words shouted in Oriental by the complainant amounted to provocation the onus was upon him to prove what the words were. In any event provocation, which would reduce murder to manslaughter, is not a defence to the charge as laid. Shooting in self defence would constitute a valid defence provided the accused brings himself within sections 53 and 54 of the Code. It is justifiable to repel an unprovoked attack if the force used by the accused is not meant to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is not more than is necessary for the purpose of self defence. It is justified, even if it does cause death or grievous bodily harm, if it is done under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm to himself, and if he believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his own preservation. There is no evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that the accused when he shot the complainant did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or bodily harm to himself, or that he reasonably believed that he could not otherwise save himself from bodily injury. Such evidence is not in the record. The rule, therefore, that an accused person at trial is entitled to have the jury pass upon all his alternative defences is limited to the defences of which a foundation of fact appears in the record. Even then the rule is not without exception, and one exception is, that it has no application where the accused by his defence (alibi) which he sets up at the trial, has negatived the alternative defence for which he afterwards seeks a new trial.\nThe trial judge instructed the jury as follows: \"If you believe that the accused did what the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the complainant then he would be guilty of the charge laid.\" Counsel for the accused contended that there was misdirection, because the trial judge's statement meant that the accused would be guilty of the crime charged irrespective of his intent, if the jury accepted the evidence of Irwin and Bodner that the complainant was pursuing the other two.\nHeld that the language used by the trial judge is not open to the meaning sought to be put upon it. It was intended to mean, and would be understood by the jury to mean, that if the accused shot and wounded the complainant, with a revolver, in the manner described by the three persons who witnessed the shooting, the accused would be guilty of wounding with intent to murder; or, in other words, if the shooting took place in the manner detailed by the witnesses, the intent was obvious and would be implied. More than that if, under the circumstances of this case, the jury had, without any explanation from the accused as to his intent, reached the conclusion that intent to murder was not established, the verdict would have been perverse.\nHeld also that, as to the inconsistencies between the evidence of the witnesses, Irwin and Bodner, and that of the complainant as to the actions of the parties before the shooting took place, it was for the jury to consider those inconsistencies if they thought they were material; and the jury must have given them full consideration and rejected them because they did not throw any light upon the shooting or the intent of the accused.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (48 B.C. Rep. 24) aff.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing his appeal on equal division of the Court from his conviction by D. A. McDonald J., and a jury, for murder.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] affirming, by an equal division of the court, the conviction of the accused, J. G. Wu (alias Wu Chuck), in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, following the verdict of the jury.\nThe accused was charged:\nThat at the city of Vancouver in the county and province aforesaid, on the sixth day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, J. G. Wu, alias Wu Chuck, unlawfully did wound Wong Toy with intent thereby then and there to murder the said Wong Toy, ***\nThe charge raised two points for consideration, first as to the wounding and second as to the intent.\nThat Wong Toy was wounded at the time and place stated in the indictment is established. He was found by police constable Carstairs, a little before 6 p.m. on November 6, 1932, lying in a pool of blood about fifty feet north of the northeast corner of Jackson avenue and Pender street with three bullet wounds in his body. The manner in which he received his wounds was testified to by three witnesses. First there was Wong Toy himself. He is a Chinese labour contractor and his story is: that, about 5.45 p.m., on November 6, 1932, he was walking along the west side of Jackson avenue in the city of Vancouver going towards Pender street when he observed that the accused was following him. He then began to walk faster and, looking back over his shoulder, saw that the accused had also accelerated his speed. He then began to run, heading southeast across Jackson avenue, and the accused chased after him and reached the sidewalk on the east side of Jackson avenue about the time he (Wong Toy) reached it; that the accused drew a revolver, pointed it at him and fired. The shot struck him in the leg about four inches above the knee and caused him to drop to the sidewalk; that, as he was sitting on the sidewalk leaning on his arm with his hand on the ground, the accused came up close, stooped down and took $90 out of his pocket; that he (Wong Toy) then shouted \"Hold-up, hold-up\" and that the accused fired two more shots at him, hitting him on the right loin near the point of the thigh and also on the right shoulder breaking his collar-bone; that the accused then ran northeast across a vacant lot lying just east of Ferrera Court, which building is on the corner of Jackson avenue and East Hastings street. Wong Toy was taken to the hospital and found to be very severely wounded. He positively identified the accused as his assailant and said he had known him more than two years. Two other persons were eye witnesses of the shooting. They were Elmer G. Irwin and James Bodner. They testified that they were standing on the southwest corner of Jackson avenue and Hastings street and that they had a clear view of Jackson avenue. They say they saw two men running in a northeasterly direction angling across Jackson avenue, followed by a third who was running after them and waving his arms and shouting in Oriental. Irwin's story is that as they approached the sidewalk on the east side of Jackson avenue, the rearmost of the two men turned and fired at the third man who was within a few feet of him; that after the shot was fired the one who did the shooting paused and then \"he kind of stooped a little bit and fired two other shots.\" He says that he and Bodner were more than half a block from where the shooting took place (the plan drawn to scale shews that they were about 250 feet away); that the night was \"kind of dark, a little foggy, just getting dusk.\" He was asked if the man who did the shooting or his companion had touched the body of the victim, and he replied \"I don't think they touched, I didn't see it anyway.\" After the shooting Irwin says he and Bodner went to where the victim was lying but they did not know him, neither had they recognized the man who did the shooting. This man, after firing the third shot, turned and ran in the direction of Ferrera Court.\nBodner testified that when they first saw the third man pursuing the other two he was a few yards behind them, and, that when the two in advance reached the curb of the sidewalk, the pursuer was almost up to them; that one of the pursued turned and shot the pursuer and brought him to his knees; that, after firing the first shot, an interval of about one minute elapsed when the man who had fired the shot stepped up close to the victim and fired two more shots at him. Bodner denied that the shooter had touched the victim with his hands. After firing the third shot he says he turned and ran toward the back of Ferrera Court. The night was about half light and a little foggy.\nFour other persons were in the neighbourhood at the time of the shooting and they were called as witnesses by counsel for the Crown. Two of them were Chinese, Wong Lee Fong and Gong Fay. At the time of the shooting these two were walking westerly along Hastings street when they heard a shot fired, and then two more, and, shortly afterwards, they saw the accused\u2014whom they both had known for between two and three years\u2014emerging from between the two sign-boards on the vacant lot just east of Ferrera Court on Hastings street. When they first saw him he had a revolver in his hand and was running, but he put the revolver in his pocket when he came to a puddle of water lying between the two sign-boards, then, plunging through the water, he ran across Hastings street about ten paces in front of them. They then went down Jackson avenue to where Wong Toy was lying.\nThe other two witnesses were brothers, Jack Massey and Cyrus Massey. They were walking east on Hastings street near Ferrera Court when they heard the noise of three shots, but thought it was the bursting of fire-crackers. They say that about a second or so after they heard these explosions a man ran out from between the sign-boards on the vacant lot just east of Ferrera Court, and ran across Hastings street and then turned towards Princess street. Their attention was attracted when he plunged into the water between the sign-boards. Jack Massey did not attempt to identify the accused but his brother Cyrus did. The probative value of his identification was, however, greatly weakened by his admission that he did not see the accused's face but identified him by his size and, that, before the preliminary examination at the police station at which he identified the accused, a Chinaman had shewn him a photograph of the accused and told him that that was the man and asked him if he would recognize the man represented by the photograph as the man who ran across Hastings street on the occasion in question.\nOn the evening of November 6, after the shooting, an information was sworn out in Vancouver against the accused, but it is established that he went over to Victoria and, under the name of Mark Ark (a name by which he was not known in Vancouver), sailed for China on November 12th on the ss. President Taft (the first boat to sail from Victoria for China after November 6th). When he was asked by the immigration officer for his photograph for identification on his return, he told the officer that he was not returning to Canada. He was arrested in Hong Kong on December 20th on a charge of attempted murder, and arrived back in Vancouver January 16th, 1933.\nAt the trial the only defence he set up was that, on November 6th, 1932, he was in Victoria, B.C., and not in Vancouver at all, and he brought a number of Chinese witnesses from Victoria to establish his alibi. Two of them swore that they saw the accused in Victoria on November 2, 1932, and every day thereafter until he sailed for China on the 12th. Another testified that he saw him in Victoria on November 3rd, and each subsequent day until the 12th. A fourth witness testified that he was present at a banquet given to the accused by his brother-in-law, N. G. Hong, on November 6th; that the banquet commenced around 5.30 p.m. and was all over by seven o'clock, when they went home. The accused did not give evidence at the trial.\nThe jury rejected the evidence as to the accused being in Victoria at the time of the shooting and found him guilty of the charge as laid. The trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment for life.\nThe accused appealed to the Court of Appeal but that court, by an equal division, affirmed the conviction. The accused now appeals to this Court.\nThe chief reasons put forward on behalf of the accused for the granting of a new trial are:\n1. That the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:\nIf you believe that the accused did what the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the complainant then he would be guilty of the charge laid.\nthat this was a misdirection\n(a) Because in effect it withdrew from the consideration of the jury the question of provocation and the issue of self-defence, which defence, it was contended, was still available to the accused notwithstanding that the jury rejected his alibi.\n(b) that the statement meant that if the jury accepted the evidence of Irwin and Bodner that Wong Toy was the pursuer, that nevertheless, the accused would be guilty of the crime charged, irrespective of his intent.\n2. That the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the question of intent.\n3. That the trial judge erred in his charge in not explicitly and fully instructing the jury as to the legal con- sequences flowing from the two contradictory stories, in respect to the conduct of the parties prior to the shooting, as related by the complainant on one side, and Irwin and Bodner on the other.\n1. (a) Counsel for the accused contended that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that the accused was entitled to have them consider any alternative defence the supporting facts of which appear in the record, and that, as the record shewed that the complainant was chasing the accused, waving his arms and shouting in Oriental, such conduct was sufficient, if the jury believed the evidence, to bring into play the sections of the Criminal Code relating to provocation and self defence. He contended that the failure of the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on the issue of self defence, was a misdirection which entitled the accused to a new trial.\nCounsel for the Crown pointed out that the trial judge had instructed the jury on the question of self defence and had read to them sections 53 and 54 of the Criminal Code which set out the law on the subject, and contended that such instruction was sufficient to enable the jury to pass upon the issue.\nThere is no doubt that in the trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and, in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence which forms that foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or otherwise. What is essential is, that the record contains evidence which, if accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid. Where such evidence appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto. The only evidence appearing in the record upon which even an argument could be founded that the accused shot in self defence is that of Irwin and Bodner that, prior to the shooting, the complainant was running after the accused and his companion, waving his arms and shouting in Oriental. What he was saying we do not know. If it were material to the defence to prove that the words amounted to provocation, the onus was upon the accused to prove what the words were. On any event provocation, which would reduce murder to manslaughter, is not a defence to the charge as laid. Shooting in self defence would constitute a valid defence provided the accused brings himself within sections 53 and 54 of the Criminal Code. It is justifiable to repel an unprovoked attack if the force used by the accused is not meant to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is not more than is necessary for the purpose of self defence. It is justified, even if it does cause death or grievous bodily harm, if it is done under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm to himself, and if he believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his own preservation. There is no evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that the accused when he shot the complainant did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or bodily harm to himself, or that he reasonably believed that he could not otherwise save himself from bodily injury. The rule, therefore, that an accused person at trial is entitled to have the jury pass upon all his alternative defences is limited to the defences of which a foundation of fact appears in the record. Even then the rule, in my opinion, is not without exception, and one exception is, that it has no application where the accused, by the defence which he sets up at the trial, has negatived the alternative defence for which he afterwards seeks a new trial.\nThe only defence which the accused set up at the trial was an alibi. In effect he said:\nI did not shoot the complainant as a result of provocation, neither did I shoot him in self defence. At the time of the shooting I was in Victoria and therefore I could not have shot either under provocation or in self defence.\nIt is quite true that the accused did not go into the witness box and swear that he was in Victoria at the time of the shooting, but that is the defence which was set up on his behalf, with his consent and acquiescence, and which he asked the court to accept, and, in my opinion, he is bound by it. The defence that the accused was in Victoria at the time of the shooting was not only inconsistent with, but it negatived the defence now sought to be set up. Under these circumstances I fail to see how any duty could rest on the trial judge to instruct the jury to consider an alternative defence which the accused, by the defence he did set up, declared had no foundation in fact. In Rex v. Philpot[3], the Court of Criminal Appeals in England held that upon an application for a new trial the court would not entertain a case for the appellant inconsistent with the defence set up at the trial. At page 143, Lord Alverstone, Chief Justice, in giving the judgment of the court, said:\u2014\nIt would be a great danger if people could conduct cases on one line in the Court of first instance, and, when that was unsuccessful, conduct them on another line in the Court of Appeal. No case ought to be urged in this Court which is inconsistent with the case set up in the Court below.\nand in Rex v. Deane[4], it was held, upon an appeal from a conviction, that\nthe Court will not entertain a defence which was not, but which could have been, set up at the trial.\nThe accused did not at the trial claim that he shot in self defence. He could not have set up that defence without endangering everything he hoped to achieve by his alibi.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that, under the circumstances of this case, there was no duty on the trial judge to instruct the jury on the issue of self defence. But, assuming such a duty to exist, the trial judge, by explaining to the jury the extent to which, and the circumstances under which, a person unlawfully assailed was justified in using force to defend himself, did, in my opinion, sufficiently instruct them to enable them to properly pass upon the issue.\n1. (b) I entirely disagree with the meaning sought to be placed on the trial judge's statement that the accused would be guilty of the crime charged irrespective of his intent, if the jury accepted the evidence of Irwin and Bodner that Wong Toy was pursuing the other two. The judge's statement makes no reference as to which was the aggressor. The trial judge simply states that if they believe that the accused did what the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the complainant, he would be guilty of the charge laid. It will be observed that he is referring there to what the witnesses said, not to what any one witness said. Now what did the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the complainant? There were three witnesses who saw what the assailant did, and they all agree that he shot and wounded the complainant. That is what the as- sailant did. The complainant himself goes a little further and says that his assailant robbed him as well, but, as the accused is not charged with robbery, that phase of it does not seem to me to be material because the statement simply says that the accused would be guilty of the charge laid and the charge laid was wounding with intent to murder. The language used by the trial judge, in my opinion, is not open to the meaning sought to be put upon it. It means, and I am satisfied, was intended to mean, and would be understood by the jury to mean, that if the accused shot and wounded the complainant, with a revolver, in the manner described by the three persons who witnessed the shooting, the accused would be guilty of wounding with intent to murder; or, in other words, if the shooting took place in the manner detailed by the witnesses, the intent was obvious and would be implied. If, therefore, the trial judge was right in his law\u2014that the wounding, under the circumstances, implied an intent to murder\u2014he not only succinctly stated the law but placed it before the jury in a manner which enabled them to easily understand their duty in respect both to the facts and the law.\nIn Rex v. Monkhouse[5], the accused was charged with wounding with intent to murder, and Coleridge J. on the question of intent charged the jury as follows:\u2014\nIt is a general rule in criminal law and one founded on common sense that juries are to presume a man to do what is the natural consequence of his act. The consequence is sometimes so apparent as to leave no doubt of the intention. A man could not put a pistol, which he knew to be loaded, to another's head and fire it off without intending to kill him; but even there the state of mind of the party is most material to be considered. For instance if such an act were done by a born idiot the intent to kill could not be inferred from the act. ***\nUnder such circumstances as these, where the act is unambiguous if the defendant was sober, I should have no difficulty in directing you that he had the intent to take away life, where death had ensued the crime would have been murder.\nThe same principle was laid down in Rex v. Howlett[6]: In that case the prisoner was indicted for wounding John Allen, with a tin can, with intent to murder him. In summing up to the jury Baron Alderson, after pointing out that they would have to consider whether, in case death had ensued, the accused would have been guilty of murder, instructed them as follows:\u2014 When a deadly weapon, such as a knife, a sword, or gun is used, the intent of the party is manifest; but with an instrument such as the present (a tin can), you must consider, whether the mode in which it was used satisfactorily shews that the prisoner intended to inflict some serious or grievous bodily harm with it.\nIn the case at bar there could be no doubt that had death ensued from the shooting the accused must have been guilty of murder. Therefore, in view of these authorities, I am of opinion that the trial judge was quite right in instructing the jury that if they found that the accused wounded the complainant with a revolver in the manner described by the witnesses, his intent to murder was obvious and would be implied. This objection to the judge's charge therefore fails.\nIn addition to what I have already said on the question of intent, I would be prepared to go further and hold that if, under the circumstances of this case, the jury had, without any explanation from the accused as to his intent, reached the conclusion that intent to murder was not established, the verdict would be perverse. What were the circumstances? The accused had shot the complainant and brought him to his knees. The complainant was either kneeling on the ground or partially sitting on the sidewalk, leaning on his hands. The accused could see that he had no weapon in his hands, and the hospital authorities have established that he had no weapons on him. Having the complainant at his mercy, the accused makes a perceptible pause, then stoops down when close to the complainant and fires two more shots into him. What was the object of stooping? The complainant says to steal his money. The only other suggestion was (and that was by counsel for the accused) that he stooped for the purpose of getting a better shot, or a shot at him in front. The complainant was evidently facing the accused on his hands and knees, for all shots took effect in front, and it may be that the accused stooped so as to be able to shoot him in front with the last two shots. If that be the explanation of the stooping it only demonstrates that the intention of the accused was to murder him. If the stooping was to rob him he was equally guilty. As there was abundant evidence that the accused did the shooting, the jury, in my opinion, in the absence of any explanation of his intention by the accused, were quite right in holding that the intent was sufficiently apparent to justify them in convicting the accused.\n3. Counsel for the accused seemed to be of opinion that, where the counsel for the Crown calls witnesses who give inconsistent stories, he is under an obligation to in some way reconcile these stories, otherwise the jury should take the inconsistencies as shewing that the Crown has failed to establish the charge. In my opinion counsel for the Crown is under no such obligation. I have always understood that it was the duty of the Crown counsel to place before the court the evidence of those who were eye witnesses of the crime with which the accused was charged, whether they give evidence which is consistent with the commission of the crime by the accused or otherwise. I have always considered that counsel for the Crown was in the position of an officer of the court whose duty is to get at the truth irrespective of whether or not the evidence supports the Crown's case. And, when he has put in the evidence of the eye witnesses, he can leave it to the jury to say which of the witnesses they will believe and how much of the testimony of each they will accept.\nThe evidence of the witnesses, Irwin and Bodner, is inconsistent with that of the complainant as to the actions of the parties before the shooting took place, it was therefore for the jury to consider those inconsistencies if they thought they were material; and I have no doubt the jury gave them full consideration and rejected them because they did not throw any light upon the shooting or the intent of the accused.\nConsidering the charge of the trial judge as a whole and the evidence as it appears in the record I see no good reason for differing with the majority of the Court of Appeal. I would, therefore, affirm the conviction and dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1933) 48 B.C. Rep. 24; [1933] 3 W.W.R. 651.\n[2] (1933) 48 B.C.

V, c. 95.\nThe respondent\u2019s action for bodily injuries, sustained by him on the 28th of August, 1931, while giving a hand to the appellant city\u2019s employees, on their invitation, was maintained by the trial judge, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court. Counsel for the appellant before this Court, in view of these unanimous judgments on question of facts, admitted the appellant city\u2019s liability; and the controversy was limited to the validity of the notice of action which the respondent was bound to give to the city prior to the institution of his action. The need of such notice is prescribed by article 535 of the Charter of the City of Quebec, the important part of it being as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding any law to the contrary, no right of action shall exist against the city for damages resulting from bodily injury, caused by an accident * * * unless, within thirty days from the date of such accident or damages * * * a written notice has been received by the city, containing the particulars of the damages sustained. * * * The default of such notice, however, shall not deprive the victims of an accident of their right of action, if they prove that they were prevented from giving such notice by irresistible force (force majeure), or for any other similar (analogous) reasons deemed valid by the judge of the Court.\u201d The appellant city received a written notice of action, contained in a letter from the respondent\u2019s solicitors, dated 9th of January, 1932, four months and ten days after the date of the accident; but the respondent alleged that he had been prevented from giving the notice by irresistible force or by circumstances over which he had no control amounting to irresistible force, or an analogous cause. The principal facts, more fully stated in the judgment, are as follows: Immediately after the accident, the respondent was conveyed to an hospital, where he remained until the 6th of September, 1931; he was unconscious, delirious and apparently suffering from mental trouble, so that he was removed to a clinic hospital for mental diseases where he remained, until the 30th of September; he left the hospital notwithstanding the adverse opinion of the attending physicians; but he returned to the hospital on two different occasions, from the 15th to the 20th of November and from the 14th to the 21st of December; during the intervals, he was under the care of physicians; one doctor testified that, before the beginning of the year 1932, the respondent was not able to attend properly to his business; the respondent himself declared that he had not a complete knowledge of what he was doing during those periods.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 55 K.B. 255), that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent had not been able to give notice of action to the appellant sooner than he did and that his case was falling within the exception clause provided by art. 535 of the appellant\u2019s charter. The condition of the respondent\u2019s mental powers constituted, if not a case of irresistible force (force majeure) in the strict sense of the word, at least precisely one of the analogous causes (raisons analogues) which the legislature intended to foresee and which entitled the trial judge to hold that it was a valid excuse for not having given notice of action within the delay provided by Art. 535.\nHeld also that the knowledge, by some officers or employees of a municipal corporation, of the circumstances of an accident or of a claim made by the injured party does not exempt the latter from giving notice of action in the manner and within the delays prescribed by the civil code or by statute (Jobin v. City of Thetford Mines, [1925] S.C.R. 686 cited); though such knowledge may have some weight in deciding whether the details or particulars contained in a notice given within the delays are sufficient.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Gelly J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action for damages resulting from an accident.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nErnest Lapointe K.C. and J. E. Chapleau K.C. for the appellant.\nR. R. Alleyn K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9, le 28 ao\u00fbt 1931, la victime d\u2019un accident pour lequel il a poursuivi rappelante et lui a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nL\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e responsable de cet accident par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et par la Cour du Banc du Roi1. Sur cette question, les juges furent unanimes. Aussi, devant cette cour, l\u2019appelante a-t-elle admis qu\u2019elle ne pouvait esp\u00e9rer faire infirmer ces jugements concordants; et son argumentation s\u2019est-elle limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019avis donn\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 avant l\u2019institution de l\u2019action.\nLa loi particuli\u00e8re qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec exige un avis sp\u00e9cial avant d\u2019intenter certaines poursuites contre la cit\u00e9. A l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019accident, cette loi (c. 95 du statut de Qu\u00e9bec, 19 Geo. V, 1929) se lisait comme suit:\n535. Nonobstant toute loi \u00e0 ce contraire, nul droit d\u2019action n\u2019existe contre la cit\u00e9 pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de blessures corporelles inflig\u00e9es par suite d\u2019un accident, ou pour dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re ou immobili\u00e8re, \u00e0 moins que, dans les trente jours de tel accident ou de tels dommages et, dans le cas d\u2019accident et de dommages provenant d\u2019une chute sur un trottoir ou sur la chauss\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins que, dans les quinze jours de tel accident et de tels dommages, un avis \u00e9crit n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par la cit\u00e9, mentionnant en d\u00e9tail les dommages soufferts, indiquant les nom, pr\u00e9noms, occupation et adresse de la personne qui les a subis, donnant la cause de ces dommages et pr\u00e9cisant l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ils sont arriv\u00e9s.\nAucune action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ou en indemnit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e contre la cit\u00e9, avant l\u2019expiration de trente jours de la date de la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019avis ci-dessus.\nLe d\u00e9faut d\u2019avis ci-dessus ne prive pas, cependant, les victimes d\u2019accidents de leur droit d\u2019action, si elles prouvent qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9es de donner cet avis par force majeure ou pour d\u2019autres raisons analogues jug\u00e9es valables par le juge ou le tribunal.\nIl s\u2019agit de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 cet article avant d\u2019intenter son action contre la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec.\nEn effet, l\u2019avis qui est exig\u00e9 ne constitue pas une simple mesure de proc\u00e9dure. Il fait partie de la formation m\u00eame du droit d\u2019action contre la cit\u00e9. La l\u00e9gislature, comme elle en avait le droit, a envisag\u00e9 l\u2019avis comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment additionnel du droit d\u2019action lui-m\u00eame, et elle l\u2019a exig\u00e9 \u201cnonobstant toute loi \u00e0 ce contraire\u201d. D\u00e8s 1907, la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de Montreal Street Railway v. Pate-naude[2], pouvait affirmer:\nIl est maintenant de jurisprudence que l\u2019action ne peut \u00eatre port\u00e9e que si l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable, tel que prescrit, et que sans cet avis le droit de r\u00e9clamer en justice n\u2019existe pas.\nCet avis est une condition pr\u00e9alable et essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019existence du droit d\u2019action. Il n\u2019y a pas l\u00e0 une question de prescription. La prescription du droit d\u2019action contre la cit\u00e9 est couverte par les articles 536 et 538 de la charte, qui la fixent \u00e0 six mois \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 le droit d\u2019action a pris naissance, \u201cnonobstant tout article ou disposition de la loi \u00e0 ce contraire\u201d. En vertu de l\u2019article 535, ce n\u2019est pas le droit d\u2019action qui se perd par prescription, si l\u2019avis requis n\u2019est pas donn\u00e9 dans les quinze ou les trente jours (suivant le cas) fix\u00e9s par l\u2019article; c\u2019est le droit d\u2019action qui ne prend pas naissance, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019avis ne soit donn\u00e9, sauf dans les cas d\u2019exception qui y sont pr\u00e9vus. Le droit d\u2019action n\u2019est pas perdu par d\u00e9faut d\u2019agir; au contraire, il ne prend pas naissance \u00e0 moins que la victime n\u2019agisse; il n\u2019existe pas si l\u2019avis n\u2019est pas donn\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable, tel que prescrit.\nL\u2019article 535 ajoute que le droit d\u2019action n\u2019existe pas \u201c\u00e0 moins qu\u2019un avis \u00e9crit n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par la cit\u00e9\u201d. Cet avis doit contenir certains d\u00e9tails et fournir certaines pr\u00e9cisions sur l\u2019accident. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu de s\u2019y arr\u00eater en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car ici la cit\u00e9 ne se plaint pas de la suffisance de l\u2019avis. Mais ce sur quoi il faut insister, c\u2019est que la cit\u00e9 a droit de recevoir \u201cun avis \u00e9crit\u201d; et cet avis doit lui \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que tout autre avis officiel est communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la corporation. Il ne s\u2019agit pas, en effet, d\u2019une simple formalit\u00e9 sans importance, dont le r\u00e9clamant peut \u00eatre dispens\u00e9 ou que l\u2019on peut remplacer par une autre formalit\u00e9 quelconque que le tribunal jugerait suffisante pour en tenir lieu.\nCette exigence de la loi, par exemple, ne peut \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sous pr\u00e9texte d\u2019absence de pr\u00e9judice. Le texte de l\u2019article 535 ne permet pas d\u2019y introduire ce correctif (Carmichael v. City of Edmonton[3]. En particulier, la connaissance de l\u2019accident que certains employ\u00e9s ou certains officiers de la corporation ont pu acqu\u00e9rir individuellement ne peut remplacer l\u2019avis exig\u00e9 par la charte (Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Bradley[4]. L\u2019absence de pr\u00e9judice ou la connaissance des faits par les employ\u00e9s ou les officiers de la cit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre d\u2019un certain poids que dans la question de savoir si un avis qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u dans les d\u00e9lais contient les d\u00e9tails ou les indications suffisantes.\nC\u2019est dans ce sens qu\u2019il faut entendre le passage souvent cit\u00e9 du jugement de cette cour dans la cause de Jobin v. City of Thetford Mines[5]:\nWith the view of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the notice given by the plaintiff was a sufficient compliance with the statute as to the damages claimed for injuries to the mill and such things as may reasonably be considered as incidental or appurtenant thereto, we are in accord. The legislature did not intend that there should be a detailed account of the items of the damage. The purpose of the notice was to give the municipal corporation such knowledge of the claim in respect of which it was given as would enable it to make the necessary inquiries to ascertain, within a reasonable time after the claim arose, the basis of it and the material facts and circumstances affecting (the corporation\u2019s liability. The notice, therefore, was properly treated as sufficient to support a claim for liability for damages caused by the flooding to the mill property itself and to its appurtenances.\nDans cette cause, la loi exigeait de la victime un avis \u201ccontaining the particulars of his claim\u201d. Un avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9; et il s\u2019agissait seulement de savoir s\u2019il contenait des indications suffisantes pour satisfaire les exigences du statut. Mais ce passage du jugement de M. le juge-en-chef Anglin, parlant au nom de la cour, n\u2019a jamais eu l\u2019intention de sugg\u00e9rer que si les officiers de la corporation municipale acqu\u00e9raient la connaissance d\u2019un accident ou d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation, par eux-m\u00eames et en dehors de tout avis tel que requis par la loi, les tribunaux seraient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 traiter la connaissance ainsi acquise comme dispensant la victime de donner l\u2019avis en la fa\u00e7on et dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits.\nNous avons cru n\u00e9cessaire de faire les observations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent\u2014et qui d\u00e9coulent, suivant nous, de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation stricte du texte de l\u2019article 535\u2014\u00e0 cause de certains arguments qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s avoir ainsi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la situation, il nous reste maintenant \u00e0 faire \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise l\u2019application de l\u2019article 535 tel que nous venons de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter.\nL\u2019accident a eu lieu le 28 ao\u00fbt 1931. La cit\u00e9 en a re\u00e7u un avis \u00e9crit par une lettre des procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en date du 9 janvier 1932. L\u2019appelante ne se plaint pas de la suffisance des d\u00e9tails ou des informations contenus dans cette lettre; mais elle soumet que cet avis est tardif. En effet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9 exactement quatre mois et douze jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident. Il est donc indiscutable que l\u2019avis n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits; et le r\u00e9sultat doit \u00eatre que le droit d\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9 contre la cit\u00e9 n\u2019existe pas, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne tombe dans l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue au troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article.\nSans doute l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait remarquer que la cit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas express\u00e9ment invoqu\u00e9 ce moyen. Elle s\u2019est content\u00e9e, dans sa plaidoirie \u00e9crite, d\u2019admettre qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u l\u2019avis et d\u2019ajouter: \u201clequel parle par lui-m\u00eame\u201d. Mais si, comme nous l\u2019avons dit, l\u2019avis est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la formation du droit d\u2019action, c\u2019est au poursuivant qu\u2019il incombe d\u2019invoquer dans son action la r\u00e9ception de cet avis par la cit\u00e9. Il doit n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019all\u00e9guer et la prouver. S\u2019il est dispens\u00e9 de l\u2019envoi de l\u2019avis, c\u2019est \u00e9galement \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il importe d\u2019all\u00e9guer et de prouver la force majeure, ou l\u2019existence d\u2019autres raisons analogues qui le font tomber dans l\u2019exception.\nDans le cas actuel, en tenant compte des plaidoiries \u00e9crites, il nous para\u00eet probable que l\u2019appelante aurait pu faire valoir, m\u00eame pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant cette cour, le moyen de droit r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019absence de l\u2019avis sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9; mais il appert des notes des juges de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi que cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, celle qui a fait l\u2019objet principal de la discussion devant eux. Nous sommes d\u2019avis que rappelante avait \u00e9videmment le droit d\u2019en faire la base de son appel devant notre cour.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le d\u00e9faut d\u2019avis dans les d\u00e9lais requis ne privait pas l\u2019intim\u00e9 de son droit d\u2019action, parce qu\u2019il avait prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de donner cet avis pour une raison qu\u2019elles ont jug\u00e9e valable.\nIl faut reconna\u00eetre que le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l\u2019article 535 laisse au juge de premi\u00e8re instance une certaine discr\u00e9tion dans laquelle le tribunal d\u2019appel, en r\u00e8gle ordinaire, \u00e9vitera d\u2019intervenir. Mais, comme le fait observer M. le juge Rivard en exprimant sa dissidence du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans cette cause-ci, le premier juge doit exercer cette discr\u00e9tion \u201cpar des motifs juridiques et dans le respect du texte de la loi\u201d.\nIci, la loi exige, pour dispenser de lavis, que la victime prouve force majeure ou une autre raison analogue jug\u00e9e valable par le tribunal. Il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019il appartient tout d\u2019abord au juge de premi\u00e8re instance de constater les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fait constitutifs de la force majeure ou de l\u2019excuse analogue. Cependant, pour employer l\u2019expression de M. Bonnecase, dans son Suppl\u00e9ment au Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil de Baudry-Lacantinerie (Suppl\u00e9ment, t. 3\u00e8me, p. 525):\nCela ne signifie pas que les juges du fond doivent ou puissent se laisser aller au gr\u00e9 de leurs inspirations; ils ne se prononceront sainement que s\u2019ils appr\u00e9cient les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fait en fonction d\u2019une notion pr\u00e9con\u00e7ue du cas fortuit et de la force majeure. Pour r\u00e9partir les fonctions respectives du fait et du droit dans une question comme celle-ci, nous croyons donc pouvoir nous inspirer des principes suivis par la Cour de Cassation, en France, tels que nous les trouvons expos\u00e9s dans Demogue, Trait\u00e9 des Obligations (tome 6, p. 646, n\u00b0 602):\nIl appartient souverainement au juge du fait de constater les circonstances de la force majeure, mais il est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de Cassation de reconna\u00eetre si elles pr\u00e9sentent le caract\u00e8re de la force majeure.\nAppliquer \u00e0 l\u2019article 535 le principe ainsi pos\u00e9 veut tout d\u2019abord dire que les tribunaux envisagent comme une question de droit la question de savoir si les faits reconnus comme \u00e9tablis par la preuve ont le caract\u00e8re de la force majeure ou d\u2019une \u201craison analogue\u201d.\nMais, en plus, il s\u2019agit de tenir compte d\u2019un fait justificatif dont la port\u00e9e est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; et il faut donc que le fait de force majeure ou raison analogue soit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement constat\u00e9. Or, malheureusement, dans la cause actuelle, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur dans le texte de la loi qu\u2019il a appliqu\u00e9 aux faits qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier. La loi se lit:\nsi elles prouvent qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9es de donner cet avis par force majeure ou pour d\u2019autres raisons analogues jug\u00e9es valables.\nL\u2019honorable juge a transcrit le texte de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\ns\u2019ils prouvent qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9s de donner cet avis par force majeure ou pour d\u2019autres raisons jug\u00e9es valables.\net il a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner les faits \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du texte ainsi transcrit.\nLe texte cit\u00e9 par le savant juge \u00e9tait celui de l\u2019article 692 de la charte de Qu\u00e9bec tel qu\u2019il existait avant 1929 et, en particulier, en vertu de la loi 6 Geo. V, c. 43, s. 8. Ce texte, qui est \u00e9galement celui de l\u2019article 536 de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et qui para\u00eet semblable \u00e0 celui de plusieurs autres chartes de corporations de cit\u00e9s ou m\u00eame de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des cit\u00e9s et villes dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, avait jusque-l\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme donnant au juge une discr\u00e9tion assez large pour appr\u00e9cier la valeur des raisons qui pouvaient excuser une victime de donner un avis dans le genre de celui qui est exig\u00e9 par l\u2019article 535. Ce texte avait donn\u00e9 lieu, entre autres, \u00e0 deux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans les causes de La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Sigouin[6], et Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cleary[7]. Mais par la loi 19 Geo. V, c. 95, en vigueur lors de l\u2019accident subi par l\u2019intim\u00e9, le texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9, pour la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en introduisant, apr\u00e8s les mots \u201cd\u2019autres raisons\u201d, le mot \u201canalogues\u201d. La cons\u00e9quence en est, ainsi que le faisait remarquer M. le juge Rivard, dans la cause de Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Sigouin[8] (p. 398), que, sous l\u2019ancien texte:\nIl n\u2019appert pas que les autres raisons dont parle (la loi) doivent n\u00e9cessairement s\u2019assimiler \u00e0 la force majeure pour produire le m\u00eame effet: il suffit qu\u2019elles soient jug\u00e9es valables.\nEn vertu du nouveau texte de la charte de Qu\u00e9bec, au contraire, il ne saurait y avoir de doute: il faut une force majeure ou une raison analogue. Analogie veut dire similitude; et il faut donc d\u00e9cider que l\u2019amendement \u00e0 la loi qui r\u00e9git la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en ins\u00e9rant le mot \u201canalogues\u201d, a apport\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article, au moins tel qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par la jurisprudence, une importante modification.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, le jugement qui nous est soumis ne saurait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la r\u00e8gle que nous suivons habituellement lorsque nous nous trouvons en pr\u00e9sence de jugements concordants sur les faits. Ici, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fait en fonction d\u2019une notion inexacte de la loi; et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, nonobstant la divergence importante du texte de la charte actuelle de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, a jug\u00e9 la cause en traitant comme d\u00e9cisifs (\u201cdecisive authorities on the pivotal points of this case\u201d) ses arr\u00eats de Sigouin8 et de Clear y[9], qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus sur des textes diff\u00e9rents. Nous avons donc ici la situation examin\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Robins v. National Trust Co.8 et, de nouveau, dans la cause de Pope Appliance Corporation v. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills9 o\u00f9 Viscount Dunedin dit, \u00e0 la page 273:\nIn a case tried by a judge alone he fulfils the functions of both judge and jury. If, therefore, it can be shown that in the view he has taken there is something which, if addressed to a jury, would be a misdirection, there is no finding of pure fact in the judgment, and the rule, as explained above, does not apply.\nIl nous a donc fallu passer en revue les faits de la cause pour voir si, dans les circonstances, ils r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 la qualification de force majeure ou de forces analogues (6 Demo-gue, Obligations, n\u00b0 543). Il est prouv\u00e9 que, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec. Il y est rest\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 6 septembre. Il affirme, et il semble certain, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu connaissance de son transport ou de son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4tel-Dieu. \u201cIl pr\u00e9sentait des troubles mentaux * * * Il avait de la fi\u00e8vre; il d\u00e9lirait\u201d; et, \u00e0 cause de cela, on l\u2019a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la clinique Roy-Rousseau, o\u00f9 l\u2019on traite les maladies mentales. Il y est rest\u00e9 du 6 au 30 septembre. Il en est sorti \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re date, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019avis des m\u00e9decins. Il y est revenu faire deux autres s\u00e9jours, l\u2019un du 15 au 20 novembre et l\u2019autre du 14 au 21 d\u00e9cembre 1931. Mais dans les intervalles il est rest\u00e9 sous les soins des m\u00e9decins et, \u00e0 \u201cde nombreuses reprises\u201d, il a d\u00fb venir les consulter \u00e0 la clinique.\nD\u00e8s le premier examen on a constat\u00e9 une commotion c\u00e9r\u00e9brale, \u201cune esp\u00e8ce d\u2019\u00e9branlement extr\u00eamement violent transmis au cerveau, aux m\u00e9ninges et qui entra\u00eenait des maux de t\u00eate, du d\u00e9lire, de la fi\u00e8vre, des naus\u00e9es, des vomissements, des vertiges\u201d. Il \u00e9tait, au dire des m\u00e9decins qui l\u2019ont trait\u00e9, dans une \u201ccondition alarmante\u201d. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve qui nous est soumise, il faut conclure que le trouble mental, les maux de t\u00eate, les \u00e9tourdissements, les vertiges, ont continu\u00e9 pendant assez longtemps apr\u00e8s que Baribeau e\u00fbt laiss\u00e9 la clinique Roy-Rousseau pour la premi\u00e8re fois, le 30 septembre, puisque le docteur Albert Brousseau nous dit que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u201ca \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de nous consulter presque chaque semaine dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932\u201d. Ce m\u00e9decin ne pense pas que, avant le commencement de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, Baribeau \u201c\u00e9tait capable de mener ses affaires d\u2019une mani\u00e8re convenable\u201d. Il affirme qu\u2019il \u201cne r\u00e9alisait pas sa situation\u201d. Et l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, lorsqu\u2019on lui demande s\u2019il ressentait des troubles pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait chez lui, r\u00e9pond: \u201cJ\u2019avais pas d\u2019id\u00e9e; je savais qu\u2019est-ce que je faisais, mais j\u2019avais pas d\u2019id\u00e9e de rien.\u201d\nVoil\u00e0 donc les faits auxquels il faut nous demander si nous pouvons appliquer la qualification de force majeure ou de \u201craisons analogues\u201d.\nPar d\u00e9finition traditionnelle, la force majeure d\u00e9signe un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui n\u2019a pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9vu et auquel il est impossible de r\u00e9sister (Art. 17, par. 24 C.C.). L\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement impr\u00e9vu doit \u00eatre irr\u00e9sistible, au-dessus des forces de l\u2019homme, d\u2019un caract\u00e8re insurmontable (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Droit civil, Suppl\u00e9ment de Bonnecase, vol. 3, p. 487, n\u00b0 251). La force majeure correspond \u00e0 la notion d\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 absolue (Ibidem, p. 505, n\u00b0 258). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u201cfait irr\u00e9sistible qui ne laisse aucune possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cution\u201d (Demogue, Obligations, vol. 6, n\u00b0 537). On peut dire que la doctrine et la jurisprudence s\u2019accordent sur les caract\u00e9ristiques de la force majeure que nous venons d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer: on la d\u00e9finit comme une \u201cforce absolument irr\u00e9sistible\u201d et qui rend l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation \u201cradicalement impossible\u201d. Nous avons eu l\u2019occasion encore r\u00e9cemment d\u2019examiner cette question et d\u2019en faire l\u2019application dans la cause de Rivet v. Corporation du Village de St-Joseph[10]. On voit par l\u00e0 toute la difficult\u00e9 de la t\u00e2che qui est impos\u00e9e au r\u00e9clamant qui veut se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019exception contenue dans l\u2019article 535 de la charte de Qu\u00e9bec.\nMais, par cela m\u00eame, nous sommes amen\u00e9s \u00e0 conclure que le l\u00e9gislateur, en y ajoutant les mots: \u201cou pour d\u2019autres raisons analogues jug\u00e9es valables par le juge ou le tribunal\u201d a, sans aucun doute, entendu att\u00e9nuer la rigueur de la loi, qui lui aurait paru autrement excessive. S\u2019il e\u00fbt voulu s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 une condition d\u2019exon\u00e9ration qui r\u00e9sulterait exclusivement de la force majeure\u2014ce qui veut dire, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, fait insurmontable ou d\u2019une impossibilit\u00e9 absolue\u2014le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019ajouter d\u2019autres mots. Tout cela \u00e9tait contenu dans l\u2019expression: \u201cforce majeure\u201d. D\u00e9cider que les \u201cautres raisons analogues\u201d doivent avoir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le caract\u00e8re de la force majeure, ce serait interpr\u00e9ter comme une simple redondance une phrase o\u00f9 il faut, au contraire, suivant les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement re\u00e7ues, t\u00e2cher de donner un sens \u00e0 tous les mots, dont on ne doit pas supposer qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s au hasard, mais, au contraire, qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 dessein dans la loi.\nLa loi exempte de l\u2019obligation de donner l\u2019avis celui qui prouve qu\u2019il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 par d\u2019autres raisons analogues, qu\u2019elle permet au juge ou au tribunal de trouver valables. Analogie, nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, correspond \u00e0 similitude; mais \u00e0 raison m\u00eame du texte adopt\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur, il faut \u00e9videmment se garder de confondre similitude avec identit\u00e9. Il s\u2019ensuit que les raisons que le juge ou le tribunal peut trouver valables, tout en \u00e9tant analogues \u00e0 la force majeure, ne doivent pas n\u00e9cessairement avoir le caract\u00e8re insurmontable de cet obstacle. Autrement le l\u00e9gislateur aurait parl\u00e9 pour ne rien dire; et la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l\u2019exception n\u2019ajouterait rien \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re. Cette deuxi\u00e8me partie, suivant nous, permet au juge de ne pas exiger la preuve de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 stricte et de ne pas s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 ce que Demogue appelle \u201cla notion rigide de force majeure\u201d (Ibidem, p. 658). Comme il le dit encore (p. 665):\nS\u2019il faut tenir la main \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9biteur ne se lib\u00e8re pas trop facilement, il ne faut pas exag\u00e9rer cette id\u00e9e par une sorte de discipline de fer.\nLa d\u00e9mence constitue un cas de force majeure (voir 24 Demolombe, p. 550; Comp. Cass. 18 janv. 1870, Compagnie d assurance ancienne mutuelle, Dev. 1870-1-97). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision de Montr\u00e9al, en 1893[11], que, en principe, le d\u00e9rangement des facult\u00e9s mentales constituait un cas de force majeure qui produirait l\u2019irresponsabilit\u00e9 civile et \u00e9carte l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1053 C.C.\nLes faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause permettent, suivant nous, de d\u00e9cider que l\u2019intim\u00e9 tombait dans l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 535. La preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e9tablit un cas de trouble mental caract\u00e9ris\u00e9. Pendant la p\u00e9riode qui a suivi imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat mental qui rendait absolument impossible l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation de donner l\u2019avis. Sa situation rentrait alors indiscutablement sous la d\u00e9signation de la force majeure. Il a donc prouv\u00e9 que, pour une certaine p\u00e9riode, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de donner l\u2019avis dans des conditions qui satisfont les exigences m\u00eame du premier cas d\u2019exception.\nPendant combien de temps ces conditions ont-elles continu\u00e9? L\u2019appelante nous demande de d\u00e9cider que cette situation avait cess\u00e9 du jour o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a laiss\u00e9 la clinique Roy-Rousseau. Nous ne ferions l\u00e0 qu\u2019une supposition que d\u2019ailleurs la preuve ne nous permet pas de faire. Il est acquis au dossier que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a quitt\u00e9 la clinique malgr\u00e9 les m\u00e9decins. Il est constant que les \u201ctroubles mentaux\u201d, les maux de t\u00eate, les \u00e9tourdissements et les vertiges ont persist\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une \u00e9poque qui va bien au del\u00e0 de celle o\u00f9 la lettre-avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par les procureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce dernier, comme nous l\u2019avons vu, affirme que jusqu\u2019au commencement de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1932, il n\u2019avait \u201cpas d\u2019id\u00e9e de rien\u201d; et le docteur Brousseau nous assure qu\u2019il \u201c\u00e9tait incapable de mener ses affaires d\u2019une mani\u00e8re convenable * * * qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9alisait pas sa situation.\u201d Si l\u2019on relie ensemble ces diff\u00e9rentes constatations, on en arrive \u00e0 ceci: que, \u00e0 raison de son \u00e9tat mental, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de voir \u00e0 ses affaires; et voir \u00e0 ses affaires, cela inclut \u00e9videmment voir \u00e0 initier et \u00e0 conduire sa r\u00e9clamation contre la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. Il nous para\u00eet donc que, dans les circonstances actuelles, le d\u00e9rangement des facult\u00e9s mentales de l\u2019intim\u00e9 constituait, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s septembre, sinon un cas de force majeure dans le strict sens du mot, au moins pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019un de ces cas analogues qu\u2019a voulu pr\u00e9voir le l\u00e9gislateur et qu\u2019il a autoris\u00e9 le tribunal \u00e0 juger comme une excuse valable.\nNous n\u2019ignorons pas que, dans la cause de Lesage v. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[12], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que:\nThe facts, though plaintiff was, while in the hospital, in a more or less delirious condition and, later on, could not leave his house after the accident, do not constitute a valid reason for not giving the required notice, as he was visited by his wife and other relations and, while at home, he was in constant communication with his family and relations.\nCette d\u00e9cision suppose \u00e9videmment que, m\u00eame si la victime ne peut donner l\u2019avis elle-m\u00eame, elle ne satisfait pas, quand m\u00eame, aux exigences de l\u2019article, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019avis n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre donn\u00e9 par un autre. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ce qui para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de P\u00e9tel v. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[13]; et c\u2019est une question que s\u2019est pos\u00e9e la Cour de Revision de Montr\u00e9al dans la cause de Fee v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[14]. Cette question est discut\u00e9e par M. Demogue (Ibid. p. 650, n\u00b0 605).\nNous ne voudrions pas poser de principes trop absolus sur ce point. Dans le cas actuel, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas de repr\u00e9sentant. Personne de ceux \u00e0 qui pouvait incomber, \u00e0 la rigueur, le devoir, m\u00eame moral, de s\u2019occuper de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u2019\u00e9tait au courant des d\u00e9tails de l\u2019accident et ne pouvait donner les indications essentielles pour envoyer l\u2019avis prescrit par la loi. C\u2019est un cas o\u00f9 il ne pouvait se faire remplacer convenablement; et m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une obligation qu\u2019un tiers pouvait ex\u00e9cuter pour lui, son \u00e9tat de maladie ne lui permettait pas de fournir \u00e0 ce tiers les informations n\u00e9cessaires, ni de lui donner les instructions requises pour que cette obligation f\u00fbt ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e (Demogue, ibidem, p. 618). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019obligation n\u2019\u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019ex\u00e9cution que par lui seul; et, \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9tat mental, il \u00e9tait incapable de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ou de la faire ex\u00e9cuter. Nous aurions pu nous demander si, pendant la p\u00e9riode de temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019avis f\u00fbt donn\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des intervalles de lucidit\u00e9. Mais la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 un caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9rangement des facult\u00e9s mentales. Si l\u2019appelante voulait pr\u00e9tendre que, pendant ce temps, il y aurait eu des intervalles lucides o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu agir, c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 elle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablir. Elle n\u2019a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019un incident qui aurait pu nous diriger dans cette voie. C\u2019est celui qui r\u00e9sulterait d\u2019une phrase de la preuve o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 raconte qu\u2019il est all\u00e9 \u201cune fois avec un de ses beaux-fr\u00e8res, en machine, pour voir M. Turcotte des assurances. C\u2019est la seule personne que j\u2019aie \u00e9t\u00e9 voir.\u201d Cet incident aurait pu, sans doute, \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019une investigation plus pouss\u00e9e. Tel qu\u2019il est relat\u00e9, il ne permet certainement pas d\u2019arriver \u00e0 rien de concluant sur le point qui nous occupe.\nIl resterait une question soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, et qui est celle-ci:\nIl semble bien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que, pendant les trente jours qui ont suivi l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 par force majeure de donner l\u2019avis requis; et la question qui se pose est de savoir si, une fois le d\u00e9lai pass\u00e9, l\u2019obligation de donner l\u2019avis subsistait, ou si, au contraire, l\u2019emp\u00eachement pendant la p\u00e9riode des trente jours ne dispense pas d\u00e9finitivement de l\u2019obligation d\u2019avis.\nNous r\u00e9servons notre d\u00e9cision sur ce point pour un cas o\u00f9 elle sera n\u00e9cessaire au jugement de la cause. Dans le cas actuel, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 notre satisfaction qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de donner l\u2019avis plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a fait par une raison de la nature de celles qui sont pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019article 535, et que nous jugeons valable.\nEtant arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que nous venons de dire, nous avons cru devoir en exposer les raisons aussi compl\u00e8tement que possible, car la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec a un droit absolu aux avantages que le l\u00e9gislateur a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de lui conf\u00e9rer dans l\u2019article 535 de sa charte, et il n\u2019appartient pas aux tribunaux d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ou d\u2019appliquer cet article de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 rendre ces avantages illusoires.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chapleau & Th\u00e9riault.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morand, Alleyn & Grenier.\n[1] (1933) Q.R. 55 K.B. 255.\n1 (1933) Q.R. 55 K.B. 255.\n[2] (1907) Q.R. 16 K.B. 541, at 543.\n[3] [1933] S.C.R. 650.\n[4] [1927] S.C.R. 279, at 283.\n[5] [1925] S.C.R. 686, at 687.\n[6] (1929) Q.R. 46 K.B. 397.\n[7] (1930) Q.R. 40 K.B. 80.\n[8] [1927] A.C. 515.\n8 [1927] A.C. 515.\n[9] [1929] A.C. 269.\n8 [1927] A.C. 515.\n9 [1929] A.C. 269.\n[10] [1932] S.C.R. 1, vide pp. 4 to 6.\n[11] (1893) Q.R. 3 S.C. 254.\n[12] (1910) 21 R.L. n.s. 70.\n[13] (1911) 21 R.L. n.s. 71.\n[14] (1917) Q.R. 52 S.C. 336, at 340.\n"}

Act, s. 92 (12)). Sec. 20 of The Solemnization of Marriage Act, Alberta, 1925, c. 39, (requiring parental consent to marriage under a certain age), as amended in 1931, c. 16, (making the consent a condition precedent to a valid marriage except in certain circumstances) is intra vires. (Kerr v. Kerr, [1934] Can. S.C.R. 72).\n\"Solemnization of Marriage\" is not confined to the ceremony itself. It legitimately includes the various steps or preliminaries leading to it. The said statute, in its essence, deals with those steps or preliminaries in the province. The requirement, in the statute, of parental consent is one similar in quality to the other requirements therein concerning the banns or the marriage licences. It is one of the forms to be complied with for the marriage ceremony, and it does not relate to capacity. It is a requirement which a provincial legislature may competently prescribe in the exercise of its jurisdiction in relation to \"the solemnization of marriage in the province\" (B.N.A. Act, s. 92 (12)) and to which it may \"attach the consequence of invalidity absolutely or conditionally\" (Kerr v. Kerr, supra, at 75; Marriage Reference, [1912] A.C. 880).\nIt was pointed out that the judgment does not express any view as to the competency of the Dominion, in the exercise of its proper authority, to legislate in relation to the capacity to marry of persons domiciled in Canada, that question not arising in this case. Dominion legislation, as at stands, does not affect the present case.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1933] 2 W.W.R. 609; [1933] 4 D.L.R. 154, reversed. APPEAL by the Attorney General for Alberta and by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] which, by a majority, affirmed, in the result, the judgment of Simmons, C.J.T.D.,. dismissing the plaintiff's action. The action was for a declaration adjudging that a valid marriage was not effected or entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant and annulling the marriage. The ground of decision of the Appellate Division was that subs. 3 of s. 20 of The Solemnization of Marriage Act, being c. 39 of the statutes of Alberta, 1925, which subs. 3 (making the consent required by s. 20 a condition precedent to a valid marriage except in certain circumstances) was enacted by The Solemnization of Marriage Act Amendment Act, 1931, (c. 16 of the statutes of Alberta, 1931), was ultra vires the legislature of the Province of Alberta.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nD. K. MacTavish for the appellants.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney General of Canada.\n(No one appeared for the respondent.)\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appellant, Gertrude Mary Neilson, by her next friend, her mother, brought this action for a declaration that the ceremony of marriage solemnized between her and the respondent, William Kenneth Underwood, on the 26th day of August, 1932, at the town of Okotoks, in the province of Alberta, was not valid, and to have the said marriage annulled under section 20 of The Solemnization of Marriage Act (c. 39 of statutes of Alberta, 1925), as amended by The Solemnization of Marriage Act Amendment Act, 1931 (c. 16 of statutes of Alberta, 1931).\nSection 20 of The Solemnization of Marriage Act, prior to the 1931 amendment, read thus:\n20. (1) If either of the parties to an intended marriage, not being a widower or widow, is under the age of twenty-one years, then, before a licence is issued in respect of such marriage, or, before the publication of the banns, or in other cases before any such marriage is contracted or solemnized, one of the parties to the intended marriage shall deposit with the issuer of marriage licences, or with the clergyman a consent thereto in form C of the schedule hereto, of the persons hereinafter mentioned.\n(2) The persons whose consent is required are as follows, that is to say:\n(a) the father and mother, or such of them as may be living, of the minor if such minor is under eighteen years of age, and the father, if living, or the mother, if living, if such minor is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years;\n(b) If both the father and mother are dead, then a lawfully appointed guardian or the acknowledged' guardian who may have brought up or may, for three years immediately preceding the intended marriage, have supported the minor.\nBy the Amendment Act of 1931, section 20 was amended by adding at the end thereof the following subsection:\n(3) The consent required by this section shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to a valid marriage unless the marriage has been consummated or the parties have, after the ceremony, cohabited and lived together as man and wife.\nThe undisputed facts are the following:\nOn the 26th day of August, 1932, when Miss Neilson went through a form of marriage with the respondent Underwood, she was slightly over nineteen years and nine months of age, while Underwood was within a few days of Ms twenty-first birthday.\nThe father of Miss Neilson was dead. Her mother was living, and she did not give her consent to the marriage. In fact, she did not know that the ceremony was being performed.\nThe father and mother of Underwood were living. They were also kept in ignorance of the marriage ceremony; and accordingly neither of them gave their consent.\nThe parties to the marriage did not come within any of the exceptions wherein, under the Act, the consent of the parents need not be required.\nThe marriage has not been consummated and the parties have not, after the ceremony, cohabited and lived together as man and wife.\nIt may be added, in order to exclude any possible objection under the statute, that no carnal intercourse had taken place between the parties before the ceremony (subs. 2 of s. 30a, as enacted by c. 16 of the Amendment Act of 1931).\nIt is admitted that the marriage licence was obtained by false affidavits with regard to the age of the parties. The learned trial judge (Simmons, C.J.) dismissed the action because he was of opinion that the granting of a decree of nullity was a matter of discretion. He followed a number of Alberta cases, where it was unanimously held that the legislation, as it stood previous to the Amendment Act of 1931, was directory only, and that the absence of the parental consent did not nullify the marriage. In his view, the \"discretion was not removed from the court\" by the amending legislation; and, under the circumstances of this case, he thought he \"would still have to exercise his discretion against the plaintiff.\" He would \"leave it fairly open for the Court of Appeal\" to deal with the matter.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was unanimously of opinion that in the enactment of the Amendment Act of 1931, \"the legislature had in mind changing the law as laid down in the former decisions\"; there was \"no room for doubt that subs. 3 of s. 20 is mandatory in character and that, if the subsection is within the legislative competency of the Alberta legislature, this marriage must, on the facts of this case, be held to be invalid.\" However, the court, by a majority (Clarke and Lunney, JJ.A., dissenting), came to the conclusion that the amendment of 1931 (subs. 3 of s. 20) was in pith and substance directed, not to the solemnization of marriage, but to the capacity of minors to marry and, as such, \"an encroachment upon the general power of the Dominion to exclusively make laws upon the subject of marriage, excepting only solemnization of marriage.\" As a result, and for that reason only, the court affirmed the judgment in the court below and dismissed the appeal.\nBut McGillivray, J.A., who delivered the judgment of the majority, added this to his reasons:\nIn a case of such importance involving a question upon which there has been such a striking difference of judicial opinion in Canada, it may not be amiss to say that it is hoped that the Attorney General for Alberta may see fit to carry the case to a higher court.\nAs a consequence, special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Appellate Division. The Attorney General for Canada, who was not represented before the courts in Alberta, was permitted to intervene here. He supported the views of the Attorney General for Alberta and he submitted that the provincial legislation was valid.\nThe real question now remaining to be considered, and the only question, is the following:\nIs the requirement as to consent, in the relevant statute, a matter having to do with the solemnization of marriage in the province (in which case it comes within the authority of the provincial legislature), or is it an encroachment upon the general legislative power of the Dominion relating to marriage, out of which the subject of solemnization of marriage \"has been carved\" in the distribution of legislative powers provided by the British North America Act?\nIn this court, the question of the validity of the Alberta legislation is concluded by our decision in the case of Kerr v. Kerr & the Attorney General for the Province of Ontario[2], not yet delivered at the time when judgment in the present case was pronounced by the Appellate Division. The two statutes under consideration in the respective cases are substantially similar; and it is quite clear that the same reasoning and the same ruling must apply to both. Indeed, the material enactments in The Solemnization of Marriage Act Amendment Act, 1931, of Alberta, appear to have been taken from the Marriage Act of Ontario.\nThe whole question depends upon the distinction to be made between the formalities of the ceremony of marriage and the status or capacity required to contract marriage. Solemnization of marriage is not confined to the ceremony itself. It legitimately includes the various steps or preliminaries leading to it. The statute of Alberta, in its essence, deals with those steps or preliminaries in that province. It is only territorial. It applies only to marriages solemnized in Alberta and it prescribes the formalities by which the ceremony of marriage shall be celebrated in that province (Brook v. Brook[3]). It does not pretend to deprive minors domiciled in Alberta of the capacity to marry out-side the province without the consent of their parents. Moreover, it requires that consent only under certain conditions and it is not directed to the question of personal status. Under the provisions of that statute, no clergyman shall solemnize marriage, unless the parties to the intended marriage produce to him the marriage licence prescribed for by the Act, or a certificate of the due publication of banns (sec. 4). The manner in which banns of marriage shall be published and the conditions under which marriage licences are to be issued are dealt with in separate sections of the Act. And among the preliminaries required before the publication of the banns, or before the issue of the licence, or at all events before any marriage is contracted or solemnized, it is enacted by sec. 20 that if either of the parties to the intended marriage is under the age of twenty-one years, a certain consent in a certain prescribed form shall be deposited with the issuer of the marriage licence, or with the clergyman who is to solemnize the marriage. That consent is required, according to circumstances, from the father and mother, or from one of them, or from a lawfully appointed guardian, or from the acknowledged guardian. And it is expressly enacted that the consent so required \"shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to a valid marriage,\" except in certain events not material in the premises. Under the circumstances, the parental consent is a requirement similar in quality to the other requirements concerning the banns or the marriage licences. It is one of the forms to be complied with for the marriage ceremony, and it does not relate to capacity.\nIt is a requirement which a provincial legislature may competently prescribe in the exercise of its jurisdiction in relation to the solemnization of marriage in the province and to which it may \"attach the consequence of invalidity absolutely or conditionally\" (Kerr v. Kerr[4]; Marriage Reference[5]).\nIn this case, parental consent was required \"as a condition of the validity of the solemnization of the marriage within the province.\" Such enactment being legislation within the province's authority and the required consent not having been obtained, it follows that the ceremony itself was void ab initio and that no valid marriage has taken place. The appellant was therefore entitled to the declaration prayed for and her action ought to have been maintained. Unlike the case of Kerr v. Kerr[6], the jurisdiction of the Alberta courts to grant a declaration of nullity is not questioned. It is common ground that the jurisdictional limitations of the courts of Ontario, discussed in the Kerr case(1), present no problem in this appeal.\nIt must further be understood that our judgment does not express any view as to the competency of the Dominion, in the exercise of its proper authority, to legislate in relation to the capacity to marry of persons domiciled in Canada. In the absence of legislation by the Dominion, that question does not arise here and is fully reserved. All that we decide in regard to it is that the Dominion legislation, as it stands, does not affect the present case.\nThe appeal will be allowed and the judgments of the courts below will be set aside. There will be a declaration that subsection 3 of section 20 of The Solemnization of Marriage Act, being c. 39 of the statutes of Alberta, 1925, enacted by The Solemnization of Marriage Act Amendment Act, 1931, (c. 16 of the statutes of Alberta, 1931), is intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta. The action of Gertrude Mary Neilson will accordingly be maintained; and it will be declared that her pretended marriage with the respondent William Kenneth Underwood was null and void and is therefore annulled. There will be no costs to either party or to the interveners.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1933] 2 W.W.R. 609; [1933] 4 D.L.R. 154.\n[2] [1934] Can. S.C.R. 72.\n[3] (1861) 9 H.L.C. 193.\n[4] [1934] Can.

B. died without making any payment, and the college claimed against his estate.\nHeld: The subscription was not binding. The only basis for sustaining it as a binding promise could be as a contract supported by a good and sufficient consideration; and such a consideration could not be found in the subscription paper itself, or in the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence.\nThe words \u201cin consideration of the subscription of others\u201d in the subscription were insufficient to support the promise if, in point of law, the subscriptions of others could not provide a valid consideration therefor; and the fact that others had signed separate subscription papers for the same common object or were expected to do so did not of itself constitute a legal consideration.\nThe statement in the subscription of the purpose for which it was made, and the acceptance of the subscription by the college, did not afford a ground based on the doctrine of mutual promises for holding B.\u2019s promise binding. A reciprocal promise on the part of the college to do the thing for which the subscription was promised could not be implied from the mere fact of the acceptance by the college of such a subscription paper from B.\u2019s hands. And the fact, even if established, that the college made increased expenditures or incurred liabilities on the strength of the subscriptions obtained in the canvass, would not constitute a consideration so as to make B.\u2019s subscription binding, in the absence of anything further indicating a request on B.\u2019s part resulting in expenditures made or liabilities incurred.\nCases reviewed and discussed.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 6 M.P.R. 229, affirmed. APPEAL by the Board of Governors of Dalhousie College, Halifax, claimant, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] allowing the appeal taken by the representatives of the Estate of Arthur Boutilier, deceased, from the decision of His Honour W. J. O\u2019Hearn, Judge of Probate for the County of Halifax, dismissing the Estate\u2019s appeal, from the decision of the Registrar of Probate for the County of Halifax allowing the claim of Dalhousie College for $5,000 against the said estate. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc dismissed the claim. The claim was founded on a subscription by the said deceased to a fund for Dalhousie College.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nG. W. Mason K.C. and W. C. Macdonald K.C. for the appellant\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket, J.\u2014This appeal concerns a claim which was filed in the Probate Court for the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the year 1931, by the appellant College against the respondent Estate for $5,000, stated as having been \u201csubscribed to Dalhousie Campaign Fund (1920)\u201d, and attested by an affidavit of the College Bursar, in which it was alleged that the stated amount was justly and truly owing to the College Corporation.\nThe subscription, upon which the claim was founded, was obtained from the deceased on June 4, 1920, in the course of a canvass which was being conducted by a committee, known as the Dalhousie College Campaign Committee, for the raising of a fund to increase the general resources and usefulness of the institution and was in the following terms: For the purpose of enabling Dalhousie College to maintain and improve the efficiency of its teaching, to construct new buildings and otherwise to keep pace with the growing need of its constituency and in consideration of the subscription of others, I promise to pay to the Treasurer of Dalhousie College the sum of Five Thousand Dollars, payment as follows:\nTerms of payment as per letter from Mr. Boutilier.\nA. 399.\nName Arthur Boutilier.\nDate June 4th, 1920.\nMake all cheques payable to the Treasurer of Dalhousie College.\nSo far as the record discloses, the subscription was not accompanied or followed by any letter from the deceased as to the terms of payment. He died on October 29, 1928, without making any payment on account. It appears that some time after he signed the subscription form he met with severe financial reverses which prevented him from honouring his pledge. That he desired and hoped to be able to do so is evidenced by a brief letter addressed by him to the President of the University on April 12, 1926, in reply to a communication from the latter, calling his attention to the subscription and the fact that no payments had been made upon it. The deceased\u2019s letter, acknowledging receipt of the President\u2019s communication, states:\nIn reply I desire to advise you that I have kept my promise to you in mind. As you are probably aware, since making my promise I suffered some rather severe reverses, but I expect before too long to be able to redeem my pledge.\nThe claim was contested in the Probate Court by the Estate on two grounds, viz.: that in the absence of any letter from the deceased as to terms of payment, the claimant could not recover; and that the claim was barred by the Statute of Limitations. Dr. A. Stanley MacKenzie, who had retired from the Presidency of the University after 20 years\u2019 service shortly before the trial, and others gave evidence before the Registrar of Probate. Basing himself apparently upon Dr. MacKenzie\u2019s statement that in consideration of the moneys subscribed in the campaign referred to, large sums of money were expended by the College on the objects mentioned in the subscription card, between the years 1920 and 1931, the Registrar decided that there was a good consideration for the deceased\u2019s subscription, citing Sargent v. Nicholson, a decision of the Appeal Court of Manitoba[2], and Y.M.C.A. v. Rankin, a decision of the Appeal Court of British Columbia[3], and that no supplementary letter was necessary to complete the agreement. He further held that the deceased\u2019s letter of April 12, 1926, constituted a sufficient acknowledgement to take the case out of the Statute of Limitations.\nAn appeal to the Judge of the County Court sitting as Judge of the Probate Court was dismissed, but on a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, this decision was reversed by the unanimous judgment of Chisholm, C.J., and Mellish, Graham, Carroll and Ross, JJ., on the ground that the subscription was a mere nudum pactum, and that nothing was shewn either by the document itself or by the evidence which imposed any binding contractual obligation upon the deceased in connection therewith. This, I take it, to be the gist of the reasons for the judgment of the Appeal Court as delivered by the learned Chief Justice, and embodies the whole problem with which we have now to deal.\nThere is, of course, no doubt that the deceased\u2019s subscription can be sustained as a binding promise only upon one basis, viz.: as a contract, supported by a good and sufficient consideration. The whole controversy between the parties is as to whether such a consideration is to be found, either in the subscription paper itself or in the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence.\nSo far as the signed subscription itself is concerned, it is contended in behalf of the appellant that it shews upon its face a good and sufficient consideration for the deceased\u2019s promise in its statement that it was given in consideration of the subscription of others. As to this, it is first to be observed that the statement of such a consideration in the subscription paper is insufficient to support the promise if, in point of law, the subscriptions of others could not provide a valid consideration therefor. I concur in the opinion of Chisholm, C.J., that the fact that others had signed separate subscription papers for the same common object or were expected so to do does not of itself constitute a legal consideration. Although there have been some cases in the United States in which a contrary opinion has been expressed, these decisions have been rejected as unsound in principle both by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts and the Court of Appeals of the State of New York. See Cottage Street M.EJ. Church v. Kendall[4]; Hamilton College v. Stewart[5]; and Albany Presbyterian Church v. Cooper[6]. In the last mentioned case the defendant\u2019s intestate subscribed a paper with a number of others, by the terms of which they \u201cin consideration of one dollar\u201d to each of them paid \u201cand of the agreements of each other\u201d severally promised and agreed to and with the plaintiff\u2019s trustees to pay to said trustees the sums severally subscribed for the purpose of paying off a mortgage debt on the church edifice on the condition that the sum of $45,000 in the aggregate should be subscribed and paid in for such purpose within one year. The Court of Appeals held that it must reject the consideration recited in the subscription paper, the money consideration, because it had no basis in fact, and the mutual promise between the subscribers, because there was no privity of contract, between the plaintiff church and the various subscribers.\nA perusal of the reasons for judgment of the Appeal Court of Manitoba, as delivered by Cameron, J.A., in Sargent v. Nicholson[7], already referred to, shews that that court also rejected the contention that it was a sufficient consideration that others were led to subscribe by the subscription of the defendant. In fact Cameron, J.A.\u2019s opinion quotes with approval a passage from the opinion of Gray, C.J., in Cottage Street M.E Church v. Kendall4, that such a proposition appeared to the Massachusetts Supreme Court to be \u201cinconsistent with elementary principles.\u201d The decision of the Appeal Court of British Columbia in Y.M.C.A. v. Rankin[8] fully adopted the opinion of Cameron, J.A., in Sargent v. Nicholson[9], and is certainly no authority for the acceptance of other subscriptions as a binding consideration in such a case as the present one.\nThe doctrine of mutual promises was also put forward on the argument as a ground upon which the deceased\u2019s promise might be held to be binding. It was suggested that the statement in the subscription of the purpose for which it was made, viz.: \u201cof enabling Dalhousie College to maintain and improve the efficiency of its teaching, to construct new buildings and otherwise to keep pace with the growing need of its constituency,\u201d constituted an implied request on the part of the deceased to apply the promised subscription to this object and that the acceptance by the College of his promise created a contract between them, the consideration for the promise of the deceased to pay the money being the promise of the College to apply it to the purpose stated.\nI cannot think that any such construction can fairly be placed upon the subscription paper and its acceptance by the College. It certainly contains no express request to the College either \u201cto maintain and improve the efficiency of its teaching\u201d or \u201cto construct new buildings and otherwise to keep pace with the growing need of its constituency,\u201d but simply states that the promise to pay the $5,000 is made for the purpose of enabling the College to do so, leaving it perfectly free to pursue what had always been its aims in whatever manner its Governors should choose. No statement is made as to the amount intended to be raised for all or any of the purposes stated. No buildings of any kind are described. The construction of new buildings is merely indicated as a means of the College keeping pace with the growing need of its constituency and apparently to be undertaken as and when the Governors should in their unfettered discretion decide the erection of any one or more buildings for any purpose was necessary or desirable.\nIt seems to me difficult to conceive that, had the deceased actually paid the promised money, he could have safely relied upon the mere acceptance of his own promise, couched in such vague and uncertain terms regarding its purpose, as the foundation of any action against the College Corporation. So far as I can discover, there is no English or Canadian case in which it has been authoritatively decided that a reciprocal promise on the part of the promisee may be implied from the mere fact of the acceptance by the promisee of such a subscription paper from the hands of the promisor to do the thing for which the subscription is promised. There is no doubt, of course, that an express agreement by the promisee to do certain acts in return for a subscription is a sufficient consideration for the promise of the subscriber. There may, too, be circumstances proved by evidence, outside the subscription paper itself, from which such a reciprocal promise on the part of the promisee may well be implied, but I have not been able to find any English or Canadian case where it has actually been so decided in the absence of proof that the subscriber has himself either expressly requested the promisee to undertake some definite project or personally taken such a part in connection with the projected enterprise that such a request might be inferred therefrom.\nIt is true that there are expressions in the judgments of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Sargent v. Nicholson[10] and of Wright, J., of the Supreme Court of Ontario, in Re Loblaw[11], which seem to support the proposition that a request from the promisor to the promisee may be implied from the mere statement in the subscription paper of the object for which the subscription is promised and a reciprocal promise from the promisee to the promisor to carry out that purpose from the mere fact of the acceptance of the subscription, but an examination of both these judgments makes it clear that these expressions of opinion do not touch the real ground upon which either of the decisions proceeds.\nThere is no doubt either that some American courts have held that by acceptance of the subscription paper itself the promisee impliedly undertakes to carry out the purpose for which the subscription is made and treated this implied promise of the promisee as the consideration for the promise to pay. This view, however, has been rejected, as pointed out in 60 Corpus Juris, 959, on the ground that the promise implied in the acceptance involves no act advantageous to the subscriber or detrimental to the beneficiary, and hence does not involve a case of mutual promises and that the duty of the payee would arise from trusteeship rather than a contractual promise, citing Albany Presbyterian Church v. Cooper[12], above referred to. No suggestion of mutual promises was made in the last named case, notwithstanding that the subscription there involved was expressly stated to be for the single purpose of erecting a designated church building; neither was it made in the leading New York case of Barnes v. Perine[13], where the subscription was also stated to be for the erection of a specific church edifice.\nAs to finding the consideration for the subscription outside the subscription itself, the only evidence relied upon is that of Dr. MacKenzie that increased expenditures were made by the College for the purposes stated between the years 1920 and 1931 on the strength of the subscriptions obtained in the canvass of 1920. It is contended that this fact alone constituted a consideration for the subscription and made it binding. The decisions in Sargent v. Nicholson[14]; Y.M.C.A. v. Rankin[15]; and the judgment of Wright, J., of the Supreme Court of Ontario, in Re Loblaw[16], adopting the two former decisions, are relied upon to sustain this proposition as well as some earlier Ontario cases: Hammond v. Small[17]; Thomas v. Grace[18]; Anderson v. Kilborn[19]; and Berkeley Street Church v. Stevens[20], and several American decisions.\nThere seems to be no doubt that the first three cases above mentioned unqualifiedly support the proposition relied upon, as regards at least a subscription for a single distinct and definite object, such as the erection of a designated building, whether or not the expenditure would not have been made nor any liability incurred by the promisee but for the promise or not. The earlier Ontario cases relied upon, however, do not appear to me to go that far. They all shew that there was either a direct personal interest on the part of the subscriber in the particular project undertaken or some personal participation in the action of the promisee as a result of which the expenditure or liability was incurred.\nRegarding the American decisions, upon which Sargent v. Nicholson[21] appears to have entirely proceeded\u2014more particularly perhaps on the dictum of Gray, C.J., in Cottage Street M.E. Church v. Kendall[22] than any other\u2014it may be pointed out that there are other American cases which shew that there must be something more than the mere expenditure of money or the incurring of liability by the promisee on the faith of the promise. Hull v. Pearson[23], a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, in which many of the American cases are reviewed, should perhaps be mentioned in this regard. One W. subscribed a certain sum for the work of the German department of a theological seminary. There was no consideration expressed in the memorandum, and there was no evidence of a request on the part of W. that the work should be continued, or of any expenditures on the part of the theological seminary in reliance on such request. Such department had been continued, but there was no evidence that it would not have been continued as it had been for a series of years but for the subscription. It was held that the subscription was without consideration and could not be enforced. Woodward, J., in the course of his reasons, in which the full court concurred, said:\nIt is true that there is evidence that the German department has been continued, but this does not meet the requirement. There is no evidence that it would not have been continued as it had been for a series of years if the subscription of Mr. Wild had not been made.\nAnd further:\nHe undoubtedly made the subscription for the purpose of aiding in promoting the work of the German department; but, in the absence of some act or word which clearly indicated that he accompanied his subscription by a request to do something which the corporation would not have done except for his subscription, there is no such request as would justify a constructive consideration in support of this promise. These latter dicta seem to accord more with the English decisions, which give no countenance to the principle applied in Sargent v. Nicholson[24] and Y.M.C.A. v. Rankin[25] and in the earlier American cases, as is so pointedly illustrated by the judgments of Pearson, J., in In Re Hudson[26], and Eve, J., in In Re Cory[27]. The head note in In Re Hudson26 states:\nA. verbally promised to give \u00a320,000 to the Jubilee Fund of the Congregational Union, and also filled up and signed a blank form of promise not addressed to anyone, but headed \u201cCongregational Union of England and Wales Jubilee Fund,\u201d whereby he promised to give \u00a320,000, in five equal annual instalments of \u00a34,000 each, for the liquidation of chapel debts. A. paid three instalments of \u00a34,000 to the fund within three years from the date of his promise, and then died, leaving the remaining two instalments unpaid and unprovided for.\nThe Congregational Union claimed \u00a38,000 from A.\u2019s executors, on the ground that they had been led by A.\u2019s promise to contribute larger sums to churches than they would otherwise have done; that money had been given and promised by other persons in consequence of A\u2019s promise; that grants from the Jubilee Fund had been promised to cases recommended by A.; and that churches to which promises had been made by the committee, and the committee themselves, had incurred liabilities in consequence of A.\u2019s promise.\nHis Lordship held there was no consideration for the promise. \u201cThere really was,\u201d he said, \u201cin this matter, nothing whatever in the shape of a consideration which could form a contract between the parties.\u201d\nAnd he added:\nI am bound to say that this is an attempt to turn a charity into something very different from a charity. I think it ought to fail, and I think it does fail. I do not know to what extent a contrary decision might open a new form of posthumous charity. Posthumous charity is already bad enough, and it is quite sufficiently protected by law without establishing a new principle which would extend the doctrine in its favour far more than it has been extended or ought to be extended.\nIn the Cory case27 a gift of 1,000 guineas was promised to a Y.M.C. Association for the purpose of building a memorial hall. The sum required was \u00a3150,000, of which \u00a385,000 had been promised or was available. The committee in charge decided not to commit themselves until they saw that their efforts to raise the whole fund were likely to prove successful. The testator, whose estate it was sought to charge, promised the 1,000 guineas and subsequently the committee felt justified in entering into a building contract, which they alleged they were largely induced to enter into by the testator\u2019s promise. Eve, J., held there was no contractual obligation between the parties and therefore no legal debt due from the estate.\nChisholm, C.J., in the case at bar, said that without any want of deference to eminent judges who have held otherwise he felt impelled to follow the decisions in the English cases. I am of opinion that he was fully justified in so doing, rather than apply the principle contended for by the appellant in reliance upon the decision in Sargent v. Nicholson[28], based, as the latter case is, upon the decisions of United States courts, which are not only in conflict with the English cases, but with decisions of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, as I have, I think, shewn, and which have been subjected to very strong criticism by American legal authors, notably by Prof. Williston, as the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia has shewn in his exhaustive and, to my mind, very convincing judgment.\nTo hold otherwise would be to hold that a naked, voluntary promise may be converted into a binding legal contract by the subsequent action of the promisee alone without the consent, express or implied, of the promisor. There is no evidence here which in any way involves the deceased in the carrying out of the work for which the promised subscription was made other than the signing of the subscription paper itself.\nI may add that, had I come to the opposite conclusion upon the legal question involved, I should have felt impelled, as Chisholm, C.J., did, to seriously question the accuracy of the statement relied upon by the appellant that \u201cthis work was done and the increased expenditures were made on the strength of the subscriptions promised,\u201d if that statement was meant to refer to all the increased expenditures listed in the comparative statements produced by Dr. MacKenzie. The statement relied on does not profess to set out verbatim the language of the witness. The record of the evidence is apparently but a brief summary taken down by the Registrar. That the summary is inaccurate was shewn by the admission made on the argument before us that it was not $220,000 which was subscribed in all in 1920, but $2,200,000. The statement produced of expenditures on buildings, grounds and equipment since 1920 shews a grand total for the more than ten years of but $1,491,687\u2014over $700,000 less than the aggregate of the 1920 campaign subscriptions\u2014and this grand total includes over $400,000 for Shirriff Hall, which it is well known was the object of a special donation contributed by a wealthy lady, now deceased, as a memorial to her father. In the light of this correction it becomes quite as difficult to believe that the College Corporation, in doing \u201cthis work\u201d and making \u201cthe increased expenditures\u201d did so in reliance upon the deceased\u2019s subscription, as if the aggregate of the subscriptions had been but $220,000, as the Registrar took the figures down, and the Nova Scotia Supreme Court supposed, and the total expenditures $1,491,687. This evidence would assuredly seem to shut out all possibility of establishing a claim against, the deceased\u2019s estate on any such ground as estoppel.\nThe appeal, I think, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The enactment is of a character that brings it within the class of topics that must be supposed to have been contemplated, in the light of existing experience, as falling within the subject of \u201cincorporation of companies\u201d within the meaning thereof as used in the B.N.A.

Coombs et al.[1], that court had held, by a majority, against the constitutional validity of the section. When it had been attacked in that court the Attorney-General of Canada had been notified, and he intervened. An appeal from that court\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court of Canada had been entered but on settlement of the action the appeal was discontinued. In these circumstances the present reference was made.\nGlyn Osier K.C. and F. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nCharles Lanct\u00f4t K.C. and L. St. Laurent K.C. for the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nI. A. Humphreys K.C. for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This reference by His Excellency the Governor in Council raises the question whether s. 110 of the Dominion Companies Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 27) is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, either in whole or in part. The section provides as follows:\n110. If the directors of the company declare and pay any dividend when the company is insolvent, or any dividend, the payment of which renders the company insolvent, or impairs the capital thereof, they shall be jointly and severally liable, as well to the company as to the individual shareholders and creditors thereof, for all the debts of the company then existing, and for all debts thereafter contracted during their continuance in office, respectively. 2. If any director present when such dividend is declared does forthwith, or if any director then absent does, within twenty-four hours after he becomes aware of such declaration and is able so to do, enter on the minutes of the board of directors his protest against the same, and within eight days thereafter publishes such protest in at least one newspaper published at the place in which the head office or chief place of business of the company is situated, or, if no newspaper is there published, in the newspaper published in the place nearest thereto, such director may thereby, and not otherwise, exonerate himself from such liability.\n3. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to create any liability upon the directors of a mining company by reason of payment of dividends out of funds derived from the operations of such company, if such payment does not reduce the value of the remaining assets of the company so that they will be insufficient to meet the liabilities of the company then existing, exclusive of its nominal paid up capital.\nThe Companies Act has been treated as enacted under the powers of the Dominion Parliament embraced within the residuary clause, as well as such powers as may arise under no. 2 of s. 91, of the B.N.A. Act. In John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[2], it was held that certain provisions of the Companies Act (sections 5, 14, 33, 35 and 37) as well as s. 9 of the present Interpretation Act, are intra vires. The principle of that decision is, as Lord Haldane explained, that the subject matter \u201cIncorporation of Companies with objects not provincial\u201d is a subject which falls within the residuary clause of s. 91 because it is excluded from those embraced with s. 92 by the terms of the section itself. It is also laid down that \u201cIncorporation of Companies\u201d cannot be read in a manner so strict as to limit it to the subject of bringing such companies into being. It was further held that\nthe power to regulate trade and commerce at all events enables the Parliament of Canada to prescribe to what extent the powers of companies the objects of which extend to the entire Dominion should be exercisable, and what limitations should be placed on such powers. For if it be established that the Dominion Parliament can create such companies, then it becomes a question of general interest throughout the Dominion in what fashion they should be permitted to trade.\nThe question of what falls within the subject of \u201cIncorporation of Companies\u201d thus vested in the Parliament of the Dominion under the residuary clause, and what falls within the powers of that Parliament in relation to such companies by virtue of the trade and commerce clause (no. 2 of s. 91) is a question which in particular cases may be delicate and difficult. I think the question now raised is one which presents no very great difficulty. It seems to me legitimate to glance at the state of the law with respect to the incorporation and management of companies existing in England at the time the B.N.A. Act was passed (Croft v. Dunphy[3].) That there may be no inaccuracy as to the state of it I quote some passages from the 5th edition of Lord Lindley\u2019s book on the Law of Companies:\nBy the common law of this country every member of an unincorporated partnership, whether it be an ordinary firm or a joint-stock company with transferable shares, is personally liable for all the debts and engagements of the partnership contracted whilst he is a member of it. (p. 245).\n* * *\n2. With respect to the extent of the liability of the members of a company upon contracts in which it is specially stipulated that the funds of the company alone shall be answerable, and that no member shall be liable beyond the amount of his share, the limit set by contract is the limit of liability:\u2014\nWhere the company is an incorporated company, there never was any difficulty in giving effect even at law to all the terms of the contract; and in the case of companies registered under the Act 7 & 8 Vict., c. 110, it was held that the members were not liable to have execution issued against, them upon judgments obtained against the company on a contract of the description in question; but that the property of the company was alone liable to make good the demands of the judgment creditor; and this was held at law even in cases where the subscribed capital had been exhausted but the whole capital had not been paid up.\nThe same principle was acted on in equity, except that a Court of Equity compelled the shareholders to pay up rateably so much of the capital as had not already been subscribed. This can now be done by a properly constituted action.\nIn all these cases, however, it must be borne in mind that the liabilities which are limited to the funds of the company, are those only which are expressly so limited by the contracts with the creditors; the liabilities to other persons are unlimited.\nCompanies governed by the Companies Act, 1862, may, although unlimited, limit their liability by special contract, and where they do so the principles above adverted to will be applicable. But as under the Companies Act, 1862, judgments against a company cannot be enforced against its members, questions as to their individual liability can scarcely arise except when a company is being wound up. (pp. 250-251.)\n* * *\nPassing now to the subject of limited liability by statute, the first point which has to be borne in mind is that the moment a society of any kind is incorporated, its members cease by common law to be in any way liable for the debts and engagements of the body corporate. Moreover, although by common law it has always been lawful for the Crown to create corporations, the Crown has no power by common law to create a corporation and at the same time to render its members individually liable for its debts, the whole of that branch of the law which relates to the liability, as distinguished from the non-liability, of the members of incorporated companies for the debts and engagements of such companies, is of modern growth and is based upon statutory enactments. These enactments will be examined hereafter in connection with the subjects of execution and winding up, but it may be useful to state generally in the present place that\u2014\n1. The liability of the members of a company governed by the Letters Patent Act depends on the terms of its charter or letters patent, the Crown being empowered by the Act in question to limit their liability or not.\n2. The liability of the members of a company governed by the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act is limited to the extent of their unpaid-up shares in the capital of the company.\n3. The liability of the members of a company empowered by a special Act of Parliament to sue and be sued by a public officer depends on the terms of such Act, but will almost invariably be found to be unlimited.\n4. The liability of the members of a banking company governed by 7 Geo. 4, c. 46, is unlimited.\n5. Subject to the exceptions presently to be noticed, the extent of the liability of the members of a company formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1862, depends upon whether the company is registered with limited liability or not. If the company is registered with, limited liability, its members are not liable beyond the amount for which they have undertaken to be responsible; but if the company is not so registered, its members are liable to the full amount of the company\u2019s debts and engagements, whatever that may be. The liability, however, of each member is merely a liability to contribute with others; and such liability can only be enforced by winding up the company. No execution can issue against a member upon a judgment obtained against the company.\nThe exceptions above referred to are as follows:\u2014\n1. Even if the company is registered with limited liability, the liability of the directors will be unlimited if the memorandum of association so provides.\n2. If a company carries on business for six months with less than seven members, all the members cognizant of the fact are severally liable for the debts contracted by the company during that time, and may be sued accordingly.\n3. The Act contains stringent provisions to compel limited companies and their officers to use the word \u201climited\u201d as part of the name of the company in matters relating to its business; and persons signing or authorizing the signature on behalf of such a company of any bill of exchange, promissory note, cheque, or order for money or goods, in which the word limited is not used as directed, are themselves liable for the amount, unless the same is duly paid by the company.\n4. The liability of limited banking companies issuing notes is unlimited, in respect of such notes.\n5. Although a company may be registered without limited liability, the liability of its members may be limited by special contract.\n6. The liability of the members of companies not formed under the Act but registered under it, is as to all matters occurring after registration the same as the liability of members of companies formed and registered under the Act. But as to other matters the extent of liability is the same as if no registration had taken place. Existing companies with unlimited liability, whether registered as such under the Act of 1862 or not, may be registered as limited companies, and if so registered, the liability of their members as to matters occurring after registration becomes limited also. But banking companies existing at the date of the passing of the Act and registering under it as limited companies, are bound to give certain notices to their customers before the privilege of limited liability can be claimed as against them. (pp. 252-4.)\nLegislation relating to companies, therefore, provided, broadly speaking, for the constitution of the companies; for the conditions under which membership could be acquired; for the management by directors or other managers; the terms and conditions upon which profits should be divided or dividends declared; the conditions under which the capital of the company could be increased or diminished; the responsibility of the members of the company in respect to the debts of the corporation; the responsibility of the directors in respect to such debts. It does not follow, of course, as a logical conclusion, because enactments had been passed in relation to these subjects in Great Britain and were on the statute books some years before the passing of the B.N.A. Act, that they are of necessity included within the subject \u201cIncorporation of Companies\u201d within the meaning of s. 92 (11). But they afford evidence, and such evidence could be accumulated indefinitely, that such topics naturally, if not inevitably, engage the attention of the legislature when it is dealing with the subject of the constitution of joint stock companies.\nReading the term \u201cIncorporation of Companies\u201d in light of the existing experience in Great Britain, as well as in this country, such subjects naturally fall within any practical scheme for the incorporation of companies. Let us consider this a little more in detail.\nThe limitation of the resort of the creditors of the company to the funds of the company itself; the terms and conditions of such limitation, and the terms and conditions of the liability of individual members of the company in respect to the debts of the company, are subjects which would appear to be necessary for consideration and determination.\nThen, if you are to limit the recourse of the creditors to the assets of the company, inevitably arises the question, what protection is to be given as to the preservation of such assets? What protection, for example, against improper division amongst shareholders under the guise of profits. So, with regard to the position of the managers\u2014managers who are invested with powers and responsibilities. It appears to me that you are strictly within what might properly be called the defining of the constitution of the company when you are making provision for limiting the liability of shareholders in respect of the debts of the company; when you are making co-ordinate provisions for the protection of the assets of the company in the interests of the creditors of the company; when you are providing safeguards against the malfeasance of the managers and, particularly, when, in the interests of persons dealing with the company, you are providing safeguards against the improper or colourable employment by the managers or the shareholders of their powers, in wasting the assets of the company.\nIt seems to me to follow from all this that s. 110, as we have it before us, is an enactment of a character that brings it within the class of topics that the legislature must be supposed to have contemplated as falling within the subject of \u201cIncorporation of Companies\u201d as used in the British North America Act.\nThe question submitted is answered in the negative.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W.

V, c. 36 (Dom.)\u2014Constitutional validity\u2014\u201cBankruptcy and Insolvency\u201d (B.N.A. Act, s. 91 (21)).\nThe Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933, 23-24 Geo. V, c. 36, is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. The matters dealt with come within the domain of \u201cbankruptcy and insolvency\u201d within the intendment of s. 91 (21) of the B.N.A. Act. The Act discussed with regard to its aim, its features, its comparison with existing bankruptcy or insolvency legislation, and the history of bankruptcy and insolvency law.\nREFERENCE to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35) of the following question:\nIs The Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933, 23-24 Geo. V, chapter 36, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, either in whole or in part, and, if so, in what particular or particulars, or to what extent?\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and F. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nC. Lanct\u00f4t K.C. and L. St. Laurent K.C. for the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nI. A. Humphries K.C. for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The history of the law seems to show clearly enough that legislation in respect of compositions and arrangements is a natural and ordinary component of a system of bankruptcy and insolvency law.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Act, as it now exists, proposals for compositions and arrangements cannot be dealt with before a receiving order or assignment has been made. This, however, was not always the case. Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1919, a proposal for composition or arrangement could be made prior to an assignment or receiving order.\nThe Winding-up Act contains brief provisions, in sections 65 and 66, which, in substance, differ very little indeed from the legislation now before us; although this, no doubt, is subject to the important qualification, that the provisions of the Winding-up Act apply only in the case of a company which is in course of being wound up. Similar provisions affecting the subject matter of this legislation are to be found in Canadian legislation before and after Confederation. The powers conferred upon the court under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933, come into operation when a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a \u201ccompany which is bankrupt or insolvent or which has committed an act of bankruptcy within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act or which is deemed insolvent within the meaning of the Winding-up Act,\u201d and its \u201cunsecured creditors or any class of them.\u201d The important difference, as already observed, between the provisions of the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act and those of the Bankruptcy Act itself in relation to compromises and arrangements is that the powers of the first named Act may be exercised notwithstanding the fact that no proceedings have been taken under the Bankruptcy Act or the Winding-up Act. The Act, however, creates powers, which can be exercised in case, and only in case, of insolvency.\nFurthermore, the aim of the Act is to deal with the existing condition of insolvency, in itself, to enable arrangements to be made, in view of the insolvent condition of the company, under judicial authority which, otherwise, might not be valid prior to the initiation of proceedings in bankruptcy. Ex facie it would appear that such a scheme in principle does not radically depart from the normal character of bankruptcy legislation. As Lord Cave impliedly states in Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue[1], \u201cthe exclusive legislative authority to deal with all matters within the domain of bankruptcy and insolvency is vested in Parliament.\u201d\nMatters normally constituting part of a bankruptcy scheme, but not in their essence matters of bankruptcy and insolvency may, of course, from another point of view and in another aspect be dealt with by a provincial legislature; but, when treated as matters pertaining to bankruptcy and insolvency, they clearly fall within the legislative authority of the Dominion.\nThe argument mainly pressed upon us in opposition to the validity of the legislation was that\nIt does not endeavour to treat equally all contracts of debts between the debtor and his creditors but allows the interest of some of them to be sacrificed in the interest of the company and of other classes of creditors. We think an adequate answer to this objection is put forward in the argument on behalf of the Attorney-General for the Dominion. Apart altogether from the judicial control over the proceedings, there is the circumstance that the legislation applies to insolvent companies only; and, consequently, that it is within the power of any creditor to apply for a winding-up order or a receiving order. It seems difficult, therefore, to suppose that the purpose of the legislation is to give sanction to arrangements in the exclusive interests of a single creditor or of a single class of creditors and having no relation to the benefit of the creditors as a whole. The ultimate purpose would appear to be to enable the court to sanction a compromise which, although binding upon a class of creditors only, would be beneficial to the general body of creditors as well as to the shareholders. We think it is not unimportant to note the circumstance to which our attention was called by counsel for the Attorney-General for the Dominion that the court may order shareholders to be summoned although they are not authorized to vote.\nThe judgment of Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014This is a reference by the Governor General in Council submitting for hearing and consideration of this Court the following question:\nIs The Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933, 23-24 Geo. V, chapter 36, ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, either in whole or in part, and, if so, in what particular or particulars, or to what extent?\nThis Act is designed to apply to insolvent or bankrupt companies; and it is contended on behalf of the Dominion that Parliament could pass this legislation under section 91, par. 21, which gives it paramount jurisdiction to make laws concerning bankruptcy and insolvency. The provinces represent that in enacting it Parliament disregarded their exclusive jurisdiction under section 92, par. 13, in relation to property and civil rights in the province.\nThe whole argument before us was finally directed to one point: Are the proceedings contemplated by the Act, in pith and substance, bankruptcy or insolvency enactments within the fair and ordinary meaning of these words? One of the features which distinguishes this Act from the Bankruptcy Act now in force is that, under the latter, a composition or arrangement cannot be proceeded with before a receiving order or assignment has been made. Another difference is that under the Bankruptcy Act the secured creditor is dealt with on the footing that he may realize his security or value or surrender the same; it is only in respect of what he claims apart from the security that he is affected by the composition or arrangement. It was pointed out also that similar provisions giving binding effect to this approval by a certain majority of creditors are found in our legislation before and after Confederation.\nThe Insolvent Act of 1864, 27-28 Vict., ch. 17, sec. 9;\nThe Insolvent Act of 1869, Canada, 32-33 Vict., ch. 16, secs. 94 et seq.;\nThe Insolvent Act of 1875, Canada, 38 Vict., c. 16, secs. 54 et seq.\nAs far as Lower Canada is concerned, it may be of interest to note that chapter 87 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1859, allowed the issue of a capias if the debtor \u201chad refused to compromise or arrange with his creditors, or to make a cession de biens,\u201d and provides that the debtor may be discharged if, when the affidavit for capias was made, he had \u201cnot refused to compromise or arrange with his creditors.\u201d\nMoreover, I find that, before and since Confederation, arrangements with the creditors have always been of the very essence of any system of bankruptcy or insolvency legislation. Civil rights and the sanctity of contracts are certainly affected by clause 5 under which a minority of creditors would be bound by the vote of a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of creditors present and voting, either in person or by proxy, if the agreement or compromise to which they agreed be sanctioned by the court. I find that this feature existed long before Confederation and was at that time generally accepted.\nPardessus, Droit Commercial, vol. 3, \u00e9d. 1843, p. 92, no. 1232, says:\n1232. Les cr\u00e9anciers d\u2019un failli ont presque toujours int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire avec lui un arrangement quelconque, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019\u00e9prouver les lenteurs et les embarrass d\u2019une union qui finit souvent par consumer la fortune du d\u00e9biteur. Mais, comme rarement tous sont d\u2019accord, et qu\u2019il est naturel de pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019un grand nombre prendra les arrangements les plus convenables \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat commun, on a cru devoir faire c\u00e9der la volont\u00e9 de la minorit\u00e9 \u00e0 celle de la majorit\u00e9; les cr\u00e9anciers pr\u00e9sents ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 admis \u00e0 d\u00e9cider pour les absents.\nCette minorit\u00e9, ces absents, doivent au moins avoir l\u2019assurance que de m\u00fbres r\u00e9flexions ont dirig\u00e9 ceux dont le voeu doit devenir une loi pour eux. Tel est l\u2019objet des r\u00e8gles prescrites pour la validit\u00e9 du concordat.\nUnder number 1236, classes or categories having different interests are already recognized by this author, and he adds (No. 1237):\nLe concordat est valablement consenti par la majorit\u00e9 des cr\u00e9anciers pr\u00e9sents, pourvu que les sommes dues aux personnes qui forment cette majorit\u00e9 \u00e9galent les trois quarts de la totalit\u00e9 des cr\u00e9ances v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es et affirm\u00e9es, ou admises par provision, dues \u00e0 des cr\u00e9anciers ayant droit de prendre part \u00e0 la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du concordat.\nTherefore, the very clause objected to in our Act of 1933 seems to be copied from the law of bankruptcy as it existed in France in 1843, when this work was published.\nUnder our system and the English Bankruptcy Act of 1914, bankruptcy legislation deals with the proceedings necessary for the distribution, under judicial authority, of the property of an insolvent person among his creditors. It assumes the commission of an \u201cact of bankruptcy\u201d followed by a petition to the court for a receiving order for the protection of the estate. The property of the debtor then vests in an official receiver. The debtor must submit a statement of affairs to the official receiver who calls a meeting of the creditors. The debtor is examined; and if no composition or scheme of arrangement is approved, he is adjudged bankrupt; and his property becomes divisible among his creditors and vests in a trustee.\nTherefore, if the proceedings under this new Act of 1933 are not, strictly speaking, \u201cbankruptcy\u201d proceedings, because they had not for object the sale and division of the assets of the debtor, they may, however, be considered as \u201cinsolvency proceedings\u201d with the object of preventing a declaration of bankruptcy and the sale of these assets, if the creditors directly interested for the time being reach the conclusion that an opportune arrangement to avoid such sale would better protect their interest, as a whole or in part. Provisions for the settlement of the liabilities of the insolvent are an essential element of any insolvency legislation and were incorporated in our Insolvent Act of 1864; and such a deed of composition and discharge could be validly made either before, pending or after proceedings upon an assignment, or for the compulsory liquidation of the estate of the insolvent. What was considered as being within the scope of the word \u201cinsolvency\u201d when it was used in section 91 of the B.N.A. Act is to be found in the preamble of the 1864 Insolvency Act, which reads:\nWhereas it is expedient that provision be made for the settlement of the estates of insolvent debtors, for giving effect to arrangements between them and their creditors, and for the punishment of fraud.\nSee also: Cushing v. Dupuy (1); Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue (2).\nI therefore reach the conclusion that arrangements as provided for by this Act are and have been, before and since Confederation, an essential component part of any system devised to protect the creditors of insolvents and, at the same time, help the honest debtor to rehabilitate himself and obtain a discharge.\nI would, therefore, answer the question submitted to us in the negative.\nThe question submitted is answered in the negative.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Quebec: Charles Lanct\u00f4t.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Ontario: I. A. Humphries.\n[1] [1928] A.C. 187.\n"}

By his will W. appointed his widow to be executrix and left her \u201cthe right to use such part of the income and principal of my estate as may reasonably be necessary for her support and maintenance.\u201d W. died in 1919 and his widow died in 1931. W.\u2019s residuary legatee sued the widow\u2019s executrix for an accounting of W.\u2019s estate. The trial judge held that it was for the court to determine what was reasonably necessary for the widow\u2019s support and maintenance and her right to encroach upon the corpus of the estate was limited in amount to what the court deemed reasonably necessary; and he made a reference to the Master to take an account and to ascertain what amount of W.\u2019s estate remained or ought to be in the hands of the widow\u2019s executrix. Accounts were filed before the Master but vouchers were lacking; also the Master was of opinion that the widow had brought herself within the law as to liability and onus for mixing trust property with one\u2019s own (Lupton v. White, 15 Ves. 432); and he did not go through the accounts, though he referred to them on occasions during the hearing. He held that a certain passing of accounts by the widow on February 16, 1922, was binding upon the parties, found the amount in her hands when she came to Toronto in September, 1922, and, in view of the investments at the latter date, fixed 6% as a fair rate at which to fix her income from the property, and, on evidence, fixed amounts per year (with certain items added) to be allowed her for reasonable support and maintenance, and made his report on that basis. The widow\u2019s executrix appealed from his report to a Judge, and then to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the appeals being dismissed, and she then appealed to this Court.\nHeld that, while it is not for the Master, as a rule, without further direction, to apply the principle as to liability and onus for mixing trust property with one\u2019s own (Lupton v. White, supra, at 436), appellant must, on the record of the hearing, be taken, to the extent stated infra, to have agreed on the method of procedure adopted by the Master, and, to such extent, could not now object thereto (In re Pratt, 12 Q.B.D. 334, at 341); but this agreement applied only to the period after the widow came to Toronto in September, 1922, and only to the method in calculating a reasonable allowance for support and maintenance; the receipts, therefore, should be taken from the accounts (not by fixing a percentage as aforesaid); and the widow should have received credit for all sums shown by the accounts to have been expended for her reasonable support and maintenance from February 16, 1922, aforesaid, until she arrived in Toronto in September, 1922; from that time appellant was bound by the method adopted by the Master of ascertaining reasonable annual amounts for support and maintenance regardless of the accounts.\nHeld, further, that it was proper for the widow to purchase and maintain a property in Toronto as a home, and it was not necessary for her to live alone in it or to live in an apartment; but this real property (purchased in the widow\u2019s name), and certain furniture, were purchased with funds of W.\u2019s estate and were assets of that estate passing to W.\u2019s residuary legatee.\nHeld, further, that there was jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Hendrickson v. Kallio, [1932] O.R. 675; Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36; s. 2 (b), defining \u201cfinal judgment\u201d); and Ontario Cons. Rule 506, referred to. In the result, the appeal was allowed and the matter referred back to the Master to take the accounts in accordance with the judgment of this Court.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing her appeal from the judgment of Garrow J. dismissing her appeal from the report of the Master.\nThe plaintiff is a sister of, and the sole surviving residuary legatee under the will of, John W. Weeks, late of Sydney, Nova Scotia, where he died on January 25, 1919. The defendant is the executrix of the will of Elizabeth M. Weeks, who was the widow of the said John W. Weeks and executrix of his estate and who died at Toronto, Ontario, on February 24, 1931.\nThe will of the said John W. Weeks provided as follows:\nI appoint my wife, Elizabeth M. Weeks, sole Executrix of this my last Will.\nI give, devise and bequeath all my property real and personal of every kind and description and wheresoever situate unto my said wife during her life.\nI authorize and empower my said Executrix to sell and dispose of any part of the real or personal property of my estate in her discretion, and to execute the necessary conveyance and assignments of the same.\nMy said Executrix shall have the right to invest the moneys of my estate in first mortgages of real estate, bank stock, Government and Municipal bonds or such other safe and sufficient security as may deem advisable. My said Executrix shall have the use of all my property real and personal during her lifetime. She shall have the right to use such part of the income and principal of my estate as may reasonably be necessary for her support and maintenance wherever she may choose to reside. My Executrix shall also have the right to use such part of the moneys of my estate as may be necessary for the upkeep and other purposes of my estate. After her death I direct that the balance of my estate remaining in her hands shall be divided between my brother, the Rev. William W. Weeks, and my sister, Carrie Dumaresque. Should my brother, William W., predecease my said sister, the whole of said balance shall go to my said sister and her heirs. In the event of the death of my said sister, her heirs shall take her share of my estate.\nIn the action the plaintiff complained of the use made by the said Elizabeth M. Weeks of the capital and income of the estate of the said John W. Weeks, and claimed from defendant an accounting of said estate.\nThe action was tried before Wright J., who held that, under the will of John W. Weeks, his widow had only the right to encroach upon the corpus or capital of his estate for her reasonable support and maintenance in excess of what the income of the estate might furnish her with; that it was for the court to determine what was reasonably necessary for her support and maintenance, and her right to deal with or encroach upon the corpus of the estate was limited in amount to what the court deemed reasonably necessary for that purpose; that the object of the will was to provide for her support and maintenance out of the estate without regard to any private means that she might have of her own. He made a reference to the Master of the Court at Toronto to take an account of the estate of John W. Weeks and to ascertain what amount of said estate remained or ought to be in the hands of the executrix of the widow\u2019s estate.\nThe Master found that the accounts of the estate of John W. Weeks were passed by his widow (executrix) in the province of Nova Scotia on February 16, 1922, and that that audit should be treated as binding on the parties; that the assets then amounted to $13,415.08, and that the widow afterwards received and got in certain proceeds which brought the total to $20,494.03, which was the amount she had when she came to Toronto, Ontario, in September, 1922. In the course of his reasons he said:\nIn September, 1922, $8,500 was invested in mortgages bearing 7%; $4,000 invested at 8%; $1,250 in bonds at 5\u00bd%. Balance owing on Reside sale $5,525 at 7%. The foregoing investments were good trustee investments. The said Elizabeth M. Weeks was a trustee as well as executrix and she should have continued the investments in trustee investments. During the period from 1922 to the time of her death such investments would have brought here easily on an average of 6%. * * * I am, therefore, of opinion, and so hold, that the said Executrix could have kept this money out on good trustee investments at 6%. The executrix, not having kept the Estate in her hands, after coming to Toronto, properly employed there is no fixed rate of interest chargeable under all the circumstances against her, Toronto General Trusts Co. v. Hogg[1]. But, as I say, looking at the rate of interest on the investments she then had and what she could have obtained, 6% is a just and fair rate by which to fix her income. I think allowing the deceased Elizabeth M. Weeks say $294.03 moving from Sydney to Toronto and to settle in any apartment house, there would be in capital account $20,200 on her arrival in Toronto. This, I hold, is my starting point.\nI cannot concede to the argument of Mr. Tansey that Elizabeth M. Weeks had a right under the terms of the Will of the late John W. Weeks to buy real property if in her discretion she found it necessary, etc. The will of the late John W. Weeks * * * gives his executrix ample authority to sell any part of the real or personal property of his Estate in her dis- cretion. But nowhere is there any authority to purchase real estate. Here authority to invest the moneys of his Estate (that means proceeds of real estate sold) in first mortgages of real estate, bank stock, government municipal bonds, or such other safe and sufficient security as she may deem advisable. These latter words would follow the ejusdem generis rule and be interpreted similar securities. Buying land in her own name was not investing money in first mortgages in real estate. First mortgages are usually only 50% to 60% of the value of the lands. Also, as I have stated, she was a trustee and bound to invest in trustee securities.\nThere was no evidence tendered to show it would be more costly to live in one of the many beautiful comfortable well heated single woman\u2019s apartments than to buy a large house such as 73 Dewson street, so I cannot accede to Mr. Tansey\u2019s argument as to the purchase of this property. I see no authority for her to do so and I hold that by the will and the Trustee Act she should not have done so.\nThe income on the principal of the Estate of $20,200 would have yielded say $1,200 a year. Now, then, in the words of the judgment and the said Will would that sum be an amount reasonably necessary for her support and maintenance. If so, then she had no right to encroach on the corpus. If not sufficient what would be the yearly encroachment? Having found Mrs. Weeks\u2019 income on $20,200 would be in round numbers $1,200, what should she be allowed for reasonable necessary support and maintenance?\nHe discussed the evidence at length and found that from October, 1922, to October, 1926, the sum of $1,300 a year was ample for the widow\u2019s reasonably necessary support and maintenance, and $2,000 a year for the remaining years of her life, in addition to certain allowances for doctors, hospitals and nurses. He found that the amount that should be in the estate of John W. Weeks (and therefore in the hands of defendant as executrix of his widow\u2019s estate) at the date of his widow\u2019s death was $13,363.38 less the funeral expenses and reasonable expenses for monument.\nThe reasons of the Master are further stated and quoted from in the judgment now reported.\nAn appeal by the defendant from the Master\u2019s report was dismissed by Garrow J. and an appeal by the defendant from the judgment of Garrow J. was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The questions for determination on the appeal are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nH.F. Parkinson K.C for the appellant.\nH.J. McLaughlin K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014This action was tried before the late Mr. Justice Wright, who held that according to the true construction of the will of John W. Weeks, Clergyman, deceased, the widow, the late Elizabeth M. Weeks, was entitled to encroach upon the corpus of the estate for the amount reasonably necessary for her support and maintenance, and the learned trial judge further directed a reference to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to take an account of the said estate, and to ascertain what amount remained or ought to be in the hands of the executrix of the estate of the late Elizabeth M. Weeks, and reserved the question of costs and further directions until the Master should have made his report.\nThe late Reverend John W. Weeks died at the City of Sydney, in the Province of Nova Scotia, on or about the 25th day of January, 1919. The widow moved to the City of Toronto in September, 1922, and died there, on or about the 24th day of February, 1931.\nThe Master found that the accounts of the estate had been passed by the widow before the Registrar of the Court of Probate of the County of Cape Breton on or about the 16th day of February, 1922. The respondent contended that the receipts in the hands of the widow when she came to Toronto were $20,925.64, while the appellant contended that the amount was only $19,450.64. The Master held that the audit of the accounts in Cape Breton was binding upon the parties and that the total receipts in the hands of the widow when she came to Toronto were $20,494.03. From this sum, the Master deducted $294.03 for moving expenses, leaving a balance in September, 1922, of $20,200, and this, the Master said, was his starting point. Accounts were prepared and filed before the Master, although vouchers were lacking. The Master said in his reasons that in September, 1922, $8,500 was invested in mortgages bearing 7% interest, $4,000 invested at 8%, $1,250 in bonds at 5\u00bd%, and a balance owing on a real estate sale carried interest at 7%. These, the Master held, were trustee investments and it was the duty of the widow to continue them in trustee investments. He considered that in view of the investments the widow had in September, 1922, 6% was a just and fair rate at which to fix her income, although it was not established that she actually received that amount. The Master then proceeded to inquire whether $1,200 per year would be reasonably sufficient for the support and maintenance of the widow, and said that, if so, she had no right to encroach on the corpus; and, if not sufficient, he should ascertain what the amount of the yearly encroachment should be. The appellant called two witnesses to prove a reasonable amount for support and maintenance and the respondent called three witnesses. These witnesses testified mostly as to the cost of their own support and maintenance. From an analysis of the evidence of these witnesses, with some references to the accounts, the Master found that from October, 1922, to October, 1926, $1,300 per annum was a fair and reasonable amount to allow the widow for her support and maintenance. In the same way, the Master found that $2,000 a year was a reasonable sum for the remaining years. The Master then proceeded to summarize the accounting as follows:\nShortage on income.....................................................................................................\n$3,866 67\nShortage on interest on income as it depreciated....................................................\n700 00\nAdditional allowances for doctors, nurses and hospital...........................................\n1,534 95\nNurses for last illness...................................................................................................\n735 00\n$6,836 62\nThe Master, therefore, found that the corpus should have been encroached upon only by the above total, and that the amount that should be in the hands of the appellant was $20,200 less $6,836.62, namely, $13,363.38. In his reasons, the Master said:\nI have not dealt with the accounts as filed; they were not proved before me. No vouchers were presented for payment and I do not think that anything can be gained in an endeavour to reconcile the accounts kept by the deceased, Elizabeth M. Weeks, and her niece, Mrs. Baker. The moment Mrs. Weeks departed from her duty as trustee to keep the estate invested in trustee investments and followed that up by dealing with the bonds, buying and selling them as her own; that is, buying bonds from the estate and putting them in her own name, she quite fully brought herself within the law as laid down in Halsbury, volume 28, page 208, and Lupton v. White[2]; Cook v. Addison[3]. Even apart from these cases, the purchases of the Dewson street property prevented one from determining how much of the estate of John W. Weeks was in existence at the death of his executrix, so that I have not audited the accounts that were filed with me. Neither counsel made any attempt to prove them before me and the whole matter was tried before me by showing what the estate was and what would be a proper amount reasonably necessary for the support and maintenance of Elizabeth M. Weeks, and I have determined the matter on that basis. * * * I, therefore, find that the amount that should be in the estate of the late John W. Weeks is $13,363.38 less the funeral expenses and reasonable expenses for monument.\nCounsel for the appellant contended before us that the Master did not carry out the judgment of the learned trial judge, and that he did not take an account of the estate, and that the Master had no authority to fix the income of the widow at so much per annum, or to fix a sum for support and maintenance at so much per annum, but that the Master should have gone over the accounts, item by item, and made his report; or, if it was not possible to make a report from the accounts, he should have so stated.\nIn Lupton v. White[4], supra, the Lord Chancellor said, page 436:\nIf the result is, that the Master cannot take the account, it is clearly not for him, without a farther direction, to apply the great principle, familiar both at law and in equity, that, if a man, having undertaken to keep the property of another distinct, mixes it with his own, the whole must both at law and in equity be taken to be the property of the other, until the former puts the subject under such circumstances, that it may be distinguished as satisfactorily, as it might have been before that unauthorized mixture upon his part. There may be cases, in which the Master may charge parties upon that principle; but it must be under the direction of the Court; who will judge whether the case is proper. I agree entirely with the Master, that under these circumstances he cannot take such an account as this Decree calls for. The consequence is, that upon farther directions it must either be referred back to the Master, with a direction to guide him as the mode of charging the defendants, where he cannot take the account satisfactorily; or an issue must be directed; taking care not to overlook the principle I have mentioned, which throws the proof upon the defendants.\nCounsel for the respondent, however, urged before us that the parties proceeded before the Master and expressly or impliedly consented to the method of procedure. Before any evidence was taken, the Master said:\nIt is agreed between counsel that, I fix the amount of property she had when she came to Toronto, decide on the contentions of both parties as submitted to me to-day, and then proceed to find out what the reasonable support and maintenance of the deceased was in Toronto; subject, however, to my disposing of the contention of Mr. McLaughlin that certain expenditures made by the deceased, Mrs. Weeks, were not proper expenditures for her support and maintenance. A little later, counsel for the appellant said:\nI understand, sir, that the method on which your Lordship wants us to approach this subject is not so much in regard to the accounts which have been kept, as to ascertain what would be reasonable and necessary under the circumstances for her support and maintenance?\nTo this the Master replied:\nYes. For instance, Mr. Tansey, I suppose you could find in Toronto fifty widows of clergymen who would know definitely what it cost them to live in as respectable a condition as the widow of such a clergyman should keep up. I know several myself, but I do not know anything about what it costs them. It is up to you to prove that.\nCounsel for the appellant then called the appellant and among other questions asked her: \u201cNow, Mrs. Baker, getting to the question of expenses. Taking the ordinary expenses over a term of years, that is, from 1922 until the time of her death, just ordinary expenses, what would you say was a fair average a year for Mrs. Weeks herself?\u201d To this, the appellant answered: \u201cI should say about $2,000. I did not make it up at all.\u201d\nA little later the Master asked the appellant concerning some question of income. \u201cDo your accounts shew that? Do you know that?\u201d To which the appellant answered, \u201cYes.\u201d In fact the accounts were referred to on many occasions. The appellant then called Frances Lorway and among many questions, stated to her as follows: \u201cI want you to give the Court, as nearly as possible, first, what is your ordinary and average rate of expenses in living in Toronto.\u201d The respondent then called three witnesses who testified, among other things, as to living costs in Toronto.\nIn In re Prat[5], Bowen, L.J., said:\nThere is a good old-fashioned rule that no one has a right so to conduct himself before a tribunal as if he accepted its jurisdiction, and then afterwards, when he finds that it has decided against him, to turn round and say, \u201cYou have no jurisdiction.\u201d You ought not to lead a tribunal to exercise jurisdiction wrongfully.\nIt will be observed, however, that the statement of the Master as to the agreement between the parties on the method of procedure referred only to the period after the late Elizabeth M. Weeks came to Toronto, namely, in the month of September, 1922, and, secondly, that it referred to the method to be pursued in calculating a reasonable allowance for support and maintenance only. As indicated in the foregoing, the accounts were passed on or about February 16, 1922. The receipts to that date were $16,500 and the disbursements were $3,084.08, leaving a balance on hand of $13,415.08. To this sum the Master added the following sums as receipts between February 16, 1922, and the arrival of the widow at Toronto:\nProceeds of sale 46 Rigby Road......................................................\n$5,825 00\n\u201c \u201c \u201c Victory Bond.......................................................\n300 00\n\u201c \u201c \u201c Automobile..........................................................\n600 00\n\u201c \u201c \u201c Furniture..............................................................\n328 95\n\u201c \u201c \u201c Acousticon..........................................................\n25 00\nThese sums made a total of $20,494.03, and the Master found that the widow had these receipts belonging to the estate when she arrived in Toronto in September, 1922. As before stated, the Master said in his reasons: \u201cI have not dealt with the accounts as filed; they were not proved before me.\u201d It is clear, however, that the receipts should be taken from the accounts; and it is also clear that the late Elizabeth M. Weeks should have received credit for all sums shewn by the accounts to have been expended for her reasonable support and maintenance from February 16, 1922, until she arrived in Toronto. From that time, the appellant was bound by the method of procedure adopted by the Master of ascertaining reasonable annual amounts for her support and maintenance regardless of the accounts. So far as income was concerned, however, this should have been ascertained from the accounts for the whole period after February 16, 1922, that is, both before and after the widow arrived in Toronto.\nWe are further of opinion that it was proper for the late Elizabeth M. Weeks to purchase and maintain the property known as 73 Dewson street as a home, and that it was not necessary for her to live alone in it or to live in an apartment unless she so desired. This real property, however, and certain furniture, were purchased with funds of the estate of the late John W. Weeks, and these are assets of that estate passing to the respondent under his will. On the question of jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, we were referred to Consolidated Rule 506, which provides as follows:\nEvery report or certificate of a Master shall be filed and shall be deemed to be confirmed at the expiration of fourteen days from the date of service of notice of filing the same, unless notice of appeal is served within that time.\nIn Hendrickson v. Kallio[6], it was held by the Court of Appeal of Ontario that an order made by a single judge of the Supreme Court dismissing an appeal from the report of a special referee to whom the trial of an action for an accounting had been referred, pursuant to sections 66-71 of the Judicature Act, was a final order, because it determined the merits of the action and the real rights of the parties. In his judgment, at page 679, Mr. Justice Middleton distinguished the cases of Clarke v. Goodall[7], Dunn v. Eaton[8] and Hesseltine v. Nelles[9]. The latter cases were, however, before the 1920 Amendment to the Supreme Court Act which defines \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as any judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding.\nWe are of opinion, therefore, that there is jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\nThe appeal will, therefore, be allowed; but, under all the circumstances, without costs here and before the Court of Appeal and before the late Mr. Justice Garrow, and the matter will be referred back to the Master to take the accounts in accordance with the above judgment\nAppeal allowed, without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamport, Ferguson & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLaughlin, Johnston, Moorhead & Macaulay.\n[1] [1932] Ont.

He had a wife and four children. By his will he gave his wife the third part of his real estate and personal property for her life; then, by clause 2 (the construction of which was in question) he gave to his younger son, W., \u201call my real estate consisting of the farm on which i now reside, situated at Cape John and also all my personal property subject to his mother\u2019s claim and also to\u201d arrangements for building a house and for carrying on the work of the farm for the maintenance of the family until W. reached 21 years of age, but \u201cin the event of his dying before he comes to that age, then all my real estate and personal property shall go to my oldest son l., he at the same time assuming all the responsibilities and liabilities involved in these arrangements.\u201d By the subsequent clauses the testator gave to his son L. and to his daughter M. each a sum to be paid by W. \u201cafter he comes into possession of the property\u201d and to the testator\u2019s daughter N. a sum to be paid by W. after N. reached the age of 21.\nHeld: The words in clause 2 giving to W. \u201call my real estate consisting of the farm on which i now reside, situated at Cape John\u201d should, in view of their context and the other provisions of the will, be construed as a gift of all the testator\u2019s real estate, including the wood lot as well as the farm; the words \u201cconsisting of the farm,\u201d etc., being rejected as a mere falsa demonstratio.\nSlingsby v. Grainger, 7 H.L. Cas. 273, discussed and distinguished.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 7 M.P.R. 255, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] reversing (Hall J. dissenting) the judgment of Graham J.[2].\nThe question was one of title to land, the parties respectively claiming through deeds from different grantors, and the rights of these grantors depended upon the proper construction of a will. The material facts of the case, the provisions of the will in question, and the question for determination, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. for the appellant.\nG. F. Henderson K.C and D. K. MacTavish for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This action was brought against the two appellants and one, Edwin A. Rice, for partition of a lot of woodland containing 400 or 500 acres, situate at Middle Stewiacke, Colchester Co., Nova Scotia.\nThe appellant claimed that it owned in fee simple a nine-twelfths undivided interest in this wood lot, having acquired title thereto by a series of deeds from the oldest son and two daughters of one, Alfred Archibald, who died in the year 1875. The respondents claimed that they were the owners of the entire lot under a succession of deeds from the only other child of Alfred Archibald, his youngest son, to whom they alleged his father devised it by his last will and testament executed on August 24, 1875.\nIt is admitted that Alfred Archibald was seized in fee of the lot at the time of the execution of his will and at the time of his death. The whole question involved in the appeal is as to whether, upon the construction of the will, the wood lot was devised to the testator\u2019s youngest son, or whether there was an intestacy with respect to it.\nThe testator owned in addition to the wood lot in question a farm at Cape John, Pictou Co., upon which he and his family resided, which with the wood lot, distant, the trial Judge states, about 50 miles from the farm, comprised the whole of his real estate. The testator left surviving him his widow, two sons and two daughters, the name of the oldest son being Leander Gordon, and the name of the youngest Walter Henry.\nThe learned trial Judge held that there was an intestacy in respect of the wood lot and that as a result the plaintiff by its deeds acquired a nine-twelfths undivided interest in it, while the defendants through their deeds from the youngest son acquired an undivided interest in the remaining three-twelfths. The trial judgment was reversed on appeal to the Supreme Court en banc per Ross and Carroll, JJ., who held that all the testator\u2019s real estate was devised to the youngest son, Walter Henry. Hall, J., agreed with the learned trial Judge, Graham, J., that the devise to Walter Henry did not cover the wood lot.\nBy para. 1 of his will the testator gave and bequeathed to his wife the third part of his real estate and personal property during the period of her natural life. Para. 2 with which the dispute is principally concerned reads as follows:\nI give and bequeath to my youngest son Walter Henry all my real estate consisting of the farm on which i now reside, situated at Cape John and also all my personal property subject to his mother\u2019s claim and also to the following arrangements, viz: That a house is to be built as soon as convenient, part of the material of which is already prepared, and the work of the farm is to be carried on as before for the maintenance of the family until the said Walter Henry shall arrive at the age of twenty-one. But in the event of his dying before he comes to that age, then all my real estate and personal property shall go to my oldest son Leander Gordon, he at the same time assuming all\u2019 the responsibilities and liabilities involved in these arrangements.\nPara. 3 gives and bequeaths to the testator\u2019s oldest son, Leander Gordon, the sum of $500 \u201cto be paid to him by his brother Walter Henry after he comes into possession of the property.\u201d Para. 4 gives and bequeaths to the testator\u2019s oldest daughter, Margaret, the sum of $200 which was also \u201cto be paid to her by her brother Walter Henry after he comes into possession of the property.\u201d Para 5 gives and bequeaths to the testator\u2019s youngest daughter, Nettie, the like sum of $200 which was \u201cto be paid to her by her brother Walter Henry after she arrives at the age of twenty-one.\u201d A codicil executed a few weeks later, merely changed the amounts of the legacies to the daughters from $200 to $100 each.\nThe words which create the difficulty are the words by which the testator described the land devised to Walter Henry, viz: \u201call my real estate consisting of the farm on which I now reside, situated at Cape John.\u201d This phrase, standing by itself, is capable of two different meanings: first, that the subject of the devise was all the testator\u2019s real estate and that this consisted only of the farm on which he then resided situated at Cape John; and, second, that the subject of the devise was only that portion of his real estate which consisted of the farm. If the first be adopted as the intended meaning, the general words \u201call ray real estate\u201d would obviously be the governing words of the devise and the subsequent words, in that view, might be disregarded as a mere falsa demonstratio in the light of the admitted fact that the testator at the time was seized in fee, not only of the farm at Cape John, but of the wood lot at Middle Stewiacke. If, on the other hand, the phrase be read in the suggested alternative sense, no question of falsa demonstratio arises, for in this view there is no repugnance or inconsistency between the two expressions \u201call my real estate\u201d and \u201cconsisting of the farm on which I now reside,\u201d etc.\nIn support of the latter construction the learned counsel for the appellant primarily relies upon the language of the phrase itself. He argues that the word \u201call\u201d is applicable to the whole phrase and not merely to the words \u201cmy real estate,\u201d and that the words \u201cconsisting of the farm,\u201d etc., consequently form a necessary part of the description of the intended devise and limit the meaning of the whole description to the farm. Secondarily, he contends that there is nothing in any of the other provisions of the will which in any way modifies or alters the meaning of the phrase as indicated upon its face.\nIf the phrase alone be considered, dissociated from its context and all other provisions of the will and having regard only to the admitted fact that the farm did not in truth comprise all the testator\u2019s real estate, we should not have hesitated to accede to the argument that it ought to be construed in a sense which does not import a false or erroneous description rather than in a sense which does. The decisive question, however, is: what was the testator\u2019s real intention respecting this devise, as indicated, not by the quoted phrase itself, but as indicated by its context and the terms of the will as a whole? It may be that, looking at the phrase itself, it should be treated prima facie as embodying but one complete description limiting to the farm only the land intended to be given, seeing that such a construction eliminates all repugnance and inconsistency between the general words \u201call my real estate\u201d and the qualifying words \u201cconsisting of the farm,\u201d etc., and yet that, when its immediate context and the other provisions of the will as a whole are considered, such a construction of the isolated phrase may be found to be entirely out of accord with other provisions of the will upon which it bears and which bear upon it, and out of accord with the testator\u2019s true intention as evidenced by the entire will.\nWhen the immediate context and the other provisions of the will are examined, it is seen that the gift to Walter Henry comprises not only \u201call my real estate consisting of the farm,\u201d etc., but also \u201call my personal property\u201d; that the whole is subject to the antecedent gift to his mother, viz: \u201cthe third part of my real estate and personal property\u201d for the term of her natural life, and to the specified stipulations as to the building of a house and the continuation of the work on the farm as before for the maintenance of the family until Walter Henry attains the age of 21; that the subject-matter of the gift-over to Leander Gordon, which is only to take effect in the event of Walter Henry not attaining the age of 21 and is also described as \u201call my real estate and personal property,\u201d is subject to his assumption of \u201call the responsibilities and liabilities involved in these arrangements\u201d; and that the two legacies to Leander Gordon and Margaret (the oldest daughter) for $500 and $200 respectively are to be paid by Walter Henry \u201cafter he comes into possession of the property\u201d and the other $200 legacy to Nettie (the youngest daughter) \u201cafter she arrives at the age of twenty-one.\u201d\nThese provisions, we think, make it perfectly clear, not only that the will was intended to make complete provision for the testator\u2019s wife and all his children, but to dispose of his entire estate\u2014real estate and personal property alike\u2014for that purpose, regardless of whether the farm constituted all the testator\u2019s real estate or not. The description of the subject-matter of the gift to the testator\u2019s wife is unmistakably incapable of any other meaning on its face than that it embraces one-third of all the testator\u2019s real estate and personal property of whatever it consisted. Similarly, the description of the subject-matter of the gift-over to Leander Gordon is incapable of any other meaning on its face than that it embraces all the testator\u2019s real estate and personal property, of whatever it consisted, subject, of course, to the antecedent gift to his mother and his assumption of the responsibilities and liabilities attached to the principal gift to Walter Henry. To construe the particular words \u201cconsisting of the farm,\u201d etc, as denuding the general words \u201call my real estate\u201d of the comprehensive sense which they undoubtedly bear in respect of both the gift to the testator\u2019s wife and the gift-over to Leander Gordon and read them as a cutting down of the description of the subject-matter of the principal gift to Walter Henry out of which the gift-over to Leander Gordon entirely proceeds, rather than as a mere declaration as to what all his real estate did consist of, seems to me to be repugnant, not only to the grammatical and obvious meaning of the words \u201call my real estate\u201d themselves, but repugnant to the real intention of the testator as evidenced by the terms of the whole will.\nThe significant linking together of the three gifts in para. 2 itself points directly to the conclusion that the words \u201call my real estate\u201d are to be understood in the same sense in regard to each. The provisions for the payment by Walter Henry of the three legacies afford additional evidence to the same effect, for it is impossible to believe that the testator could have intended that his youngest son, who was clearly charged with the responsibility for carrying on the work of the farm as before for the maintenance of the entire family until he should attain the age of 21, and with the payment of the three legacies provided as a further bounty to the oldest son and the two daughters after he should come into possession of the property, should take less from the principal gift to him than the older son would take from the gift-over in the event of the former\u2019s death before attaining his majority. Such a construction obviously entails an intestacy as to all real estate, other than the farm, in the one case and not in the other\u2014a construction which can only be justified by clear and unambiguous language.\nWe think, therefore, that the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal correctly construes the words \u201call my real estate\u201d as the leading words of the phrase in question, affording a complete description of what the testator really had in his mind as the subject-matter of the devise to Walter Henry, and that the addition of the particular words relied upon by the appellant are not in truth a necessary part of that description but an independent and erroneous declaration that all the testator\u2019s real estate consisted of the farm on which he resided. In other words, that the expression \u201call my real estate\u201d is to be read in its natural grammatical sense and not as \u201call that portion of my real estate consisting of the farm,\u201d etc.\nIn Sling shy v. Grainger[3], upon which the appellant\u2019s counsel so strongly relied, there was no such collocation of language as that contained in the will in the case at bar, though there was a gift and a gift-over which related one to the other. In that case both gifts were entirely of personal property, which was composed of consols, reduced annuities and bank stock. The testatrix by her will, which she wrote herself, left to her brother\neverything I may be possessed of at my decease for his life; and should he marry, and have children of his own, to those children after; but should he die a bachelor, I leave the whole of my fortune now standing in the Funds to E.S.\nThe question, not dissimilar to the question now involved, was whether E.S. took the whole fortune of the testatrix or only that part of it which was then standing in the funds. The case was considered by Lord Chancellor Chelmsford and Lords Cranworth, Wensleydale and Kings-down. Lords Cranworth and Wensleydale agreed with the Judges of the Court of Appeal that the words \u201cnow standing in the Funds\u201d excluded the bank stock and limited the bequest only to that portion of the fortune of the testatrix which answered the description of \u201cnow standing in the Funds.\u201d The Lord Chancellor and Lord Kings-down expressed great doubt upon the point but stated that, in view of the fact that Lords Cranworth and Wensleydale agreed with the view of the Appeal Court, they would not dissent. The headnote of the case enters them, however, as dubitante. Lord Cranworth in his reasons himself stated that the portion of the argument which had had most weight with him was that founded on the principle of falsa demonstrate, and in this connection said: I certainly should have entirely acceded to that at once if the expression, \u201cmy fortune,\u201d had not been so connected with \u201cnow standing in the Funds\u201d as to make the latter a part of the description of the former. If it had been, I wish to dispose of the whole of my fortune to my niece, which fortune is now standing in the Funds, that I should have taken to be a mere falsa demonstratio that would not have affected the generality of the first gift.\nHe also discussed the argument that the subject-matter of the gift and the gift-over must be the same, and in this connection said:\nNow, I do not think that is a fair argument, more particularly when I observe that the testatrix has used different words: instead of saying, \u201cI leave everything that I may be possessed of at my death\u201d the expression [in the gift-over] is, \u201cI leave my fortune now standing in the Funds.\u201d It would seem, therefore, that she meant something different because she has expressed it differently. At all events, I do not think it is a necessary conclusion that she meant her god-daughter to have everything that she clearly intended her brother to have if he married and had children.\nLord Wensleydale said:\nIf we may speculate on what the testatrix may probably have intended to say, we should possibly be right in conjecturing that she meant the whole of her fortune (with the exception of the small legacies specifically mentioned), to be enjoyed by the appellant in the event of the testatrix\u2019s brother dying a bachelor. But she has not said so. She has left to him everything she may foe possessed of at her decease for his life, and should he die a bachelor, then not the whole she shall be possessed of, but \u201cthe whole of my fortune now standing in the Funds,\u201d making a distinction between that and the whole of her property.\nI think it impossible to construe this bequest of \u201call my fortune,\u201d and the addition \u201cnow in the Funds,\u201d as a falsa demonstratio, as it would probably have been a bequest of all my fortune distinctly, with an addition such as this, \u201cand that fortune is now in the Funds.\u201d\nIt will be noticed that in the case cited the words relied upon as words of restriction or limitation were used in relation to the subsequent gift-over and not in relation to the antecedent principal gift upon which it entirely depended, while in the case now under consideration the critical phrase occurs in the description, not of the subsequent gift-over, which comprises all the real estate and personal property of the testator, but of the prior gift, upon which the gift-over depends, and that the qualifying, words were added to a descriptive expression which was not identical with that used in describing the antecedent gift, while in the present case precisely the same words are used in relation to both the prior gift and the subsequent gift-over, apart from the alleged qualifying words themselves. Neither the case of West v. Lawday[4], nor In re Brockett[5], nor any of the other cases referred to by the appellant\u2019s counsel, presents any such significant features as those pointed out in the will which we are now called upon to interpret.\nWe have, therefore, concluded that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The lease was dated the 6th day of April, 1927, and made for the term of five years, from the first day of May, 1927, subject, however, to the right of renewing the lease for a further period of five years from the expiration thereof. The material parts of the lease are as follows: \u201c5. The lessee shall have the right to transfer its right in the present lease or sublet any part or portion of the above leased premises, subject however to the lessee continuing at all times responsible for the due fulfilment of all its obligations under (the present lease. * * * Right of Renewal. The lessee will have the right of renewing the present lease for a further period of five years from the expiration hereof, for the rental of sixteen thousand dollars per annum during the said additional period of five years, and subject otherwise to all the other terms and conditions of the present lease, provided it gives the lessors notice in writing not later than the first of November nineteen hundred and thirty-one that the lease is so renewed.\u201d On the 12th day of November, 1930, the Delco light Company transferred and made over unto one Joseph Ostro \u201call the unexpired term to be accounted and reckoned as and from the first day of January (1931) of that certain lease\u201d * * * and specifically the right \u201cof renewing the said lease for a further period of five years on giving to the lessor notice in writing prior to the first day of November, nineteen hundred and thirty-one.\u201d On March 12, 1931, Ostro wrote to the appellant company, giving it notice that he intended \u201cto exercise the option mentioned in the lease and to remain in possession * * * of the premises * * * for a further period of five years from the 1st of May, 1932.\u201d On April 13, 1931, Ostro, by notarial deed, which he caused to be signified upon the respondents, declared and notified them that he exercised the right of renewal. On April 18, 1931, the appellant company evidently unaware that Ostro had already done it wrote to him acknowledging receipt of his letter of the 12th of March, 1931, and advising him of the necessity of giving himself notice to the respondents as to the exercise of the right of renewal. On the 30th of October, 1931, the appellant company, being aware of some financial embarrassment of Ostro, had a notarial document served on the respondents to the effect that the appellant \u201cdisavowed the action of Ostro in renewing the lease for a further period of five years.\u201d The respondents, on November 6, 1931, advised the appellant that they held it responsible for the fulfilment of its obligations under the lease for the renewal period of five years. On August 5, 1932, the Selby estate brought action, both by principal and incidental demands, against the Delco company, claiming rental for the premises for the months of May, June, July and August, 1932, altogether a sum of $5,333.32, which was contested by the Delco company, but the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously maintained the action.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 56 K.B. 263), that, under the circumstances of this case contained in the headnote and more fully stated in the judgment now reported, the respondents\u2019 action should be maintained. Among the rights, derived from the contract which the Delco company was expressly authorized to transfer, was comprised the right of renewal. To the right of renewal was attached the condition that it shall be \u201csubject otherwise to all the other terms and conditions of the present lease.\u201d And among the other terms and conditions to which the right of renewal was so made subject, there was the condition that, if the right of transfer is exercised by the Delco company, it shall be \u201csubject, however, to (the company) continuing at all times responsible for the due fulfilment of all its obligations under the present lease\u201d (or contract); one of the obligations being, of course, the payment of the rent. From the moment that the Delco company assigned to Ostro its right of renewal, the assignment necessarily carried with it, on the part of the company, the liability for the rent during the last period of five years, if the renewal was duly effected by Ostro. Now, the notice of renewal given by Ostro to the respondents, which did not require to be accepted by them, was sufficient to bind them and to effect a renewal of the lease ipso facto.\nUnder the terms of the original contract, in order to renew the lease, the Delco company had to give the Selby estate a notice in writing not later than the 1st November, 1931. The right of renewal was expressly transferred to Ostro. The transfer carried with it the right by Ostro to request the Delco company itself to give the notice in writing if that were required to insure the renewal. Ostro, in due time, notified the Delco company of his intention to exercise the option. The legal result was that, by force of the terms of the transfer, the Delco company was bound to carry out its obligation to have the lease extended and to give the notice itself if it were necessary.\nThe question whether the transfer of the lease and the rights thereunder is the transfer of \u201cdroit de cr\u00e9ance\u201d requiring service upon the Selby estate before Ostro could acquire possession available against the estate, is a question solely for the Selby estate itself. It might have been raised by that estate, but it was not open to the Delco company, who was bound to make good the transfer to Ostro (Arts. 1570 C.C. & seq.).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., and maintaining the respondents\u2019 action for rent.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. and G. B. Foster K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The Selby estate (respondents) leased to the Delco Light Company (appellant) a store on St. Catherine street west, Montreal.\nThe lease was dated the 6th day of April, 1927, and was made for the term of five years, from the first day of May, 1927, subject, however, to the right of renewing the lease for a further period of five years from the expiration thereof.\nThe material parts of the lease, which it is necessary to consider for the purposes of our decision, were agreed to as follows:\n5. The lessee shall have the right to transfer its right in the present lease or sublet any part or portion of the above leased premises, subject however to the lessee continuing at all times responsible for the due fulfilment of all its obligations under the present lease.\n* * * Right of Renewal\nThe lessee will have the right of renewing the present lease for a further period of five years from the expiration hereof, for the rental of sixteen thousand dollars per annum during the said additional period of five years, and subject otherwise to all the other terms and conditions of the present lease, provided it gives the lessors notice in writing not later than the first of November nineteen hundred and thirty-one that the lease is so renewed.\nOn the 12th day of November, 1930, the Delco Light Company transferred and made over unto one Joseph Ostro\nall the unexpired term to be accounted and reckoned as and from the first day of January (1931) of that certain lease, etc.\nThe pertinent parts of that transfer read as follows:\nThe said lease shall expire on the thirtieth day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-two with the right unto the said party of the second part of renewing the said lease for a further period of five years on giving to the lessor notice in writing prior to the first day of November nineteen hundred and thirty-one.\nConsideration\nThe present lease is thus made for and in consideration of the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) which the said party of the first part acknowledges to have received from the said party of the second part at the execution hereof, whereof quit.\nAnd in further consideration the said party of the second part binds and obliges himself to pay to the said William Dunbar Selby et al. at the office of Frank H. Hopkins in the city of Montreal as the said William Dunbar Selby et al. may indicate in writing, an annual rent of fourteen thousand dollars ($14,000.00) until the thirtieth day of April nineteen hundred and thirty-two, and in the event of the said party of the second part availing himself of the right to renew the said lease for a further period of five years to pay an annual rental of sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000.00) during the said term, which said rental is payable in and by equal consecutive monthly payments on or before the tenth day of each month.\nThe said party of the second part declares to have taken communication of the lease above mentioned and binds and obliges himself to fulfil to the exoneration of the party of the first part all the clauses and conditions of the said lease.\nThe delay to give notice of renewal expired on the 1st of November, 1931. On March 12, 1931, Ostro wrote to the Delco company, in accordance with the terms of the lease and of the transfer thereof,\nI hereby give you notice that I intend to exercise the option mentioned in the said lease and to remain in possession as lessee of the premises therein described for a further period of five years from the 1st of May. 1932.\nOn the 13th day of April, 1931, Ostro made a notarial declaration of renewal of the lease, wherein he doth hereby declare to avail himself of the right to renew said lease for a further period of five years, as stipulated in said lease, and doth hereby renew said lease for a further period of five years and he has requested us, said notary, to notify said lessors accordingly.\nThe lessors therein referred to were the Selby estate; and the notary duly served on them a copy of that declaration.\nShortly after this had been done, Mr. A. N. Taylor, real estate section, on behalf of the Delco Company, acknowledged receipt of the letter addressed by Ostro to the company, on the 12th day of March, 1931, giving notice that he intended \u201cto exercise (his) option to extend the lease.\u201d Mr. Taylor added:\nLest there may be a possible misunderstanding on the subject, I write to call your attention to the provision in the assignment of the lease to you whereby the right to renew this lease for a further period of five years is expressly assigned to you and that it will be necessary for you to give the notice provided for in the lease to effect such extension, there being no right reserved in the Delco-Light Company to give such notice.\nOn May 28, 1931, Mr. F. H. Hopkins, representing the Selby estate, wrote a letter to Mr. E. A. Lowden, c\/o Frigidaire Corporation, Toronto. In a word, the explanation for addressing the letter in that way was that Frigidaire Corporation had taken over the lease from the Delco company. The Frigidaire Corporation administered the affairs of the Delco company in Canada. They were both owned by the same corporation (General Motors), and they had the same general manager (Mr. Shannon). As the appellant relied for his argument on this letter of May 28, 1931, we think, in all fairness, it ought to be set out in full:\nWhen I was sick at home just recently a declaration of renewal of lease dated April 13, 1931, by Joseph Ostro, no. 3341, was left at my house, wherein, by virtue of the lease between the Selby estate and your company, that is the Delco Light Company, dated the 6th of April, 1927, under no. 22957, of R. H. Barron\u2019s minutes, the lessee therein, being the Delco Light Company, had the right, under a special clause of right of renewal therein inserted, to renew said lease for a further period of five years, that is, from the 1st of May, 1932, until the 30th of April, 1937, inclusive, for the rental of $16,000.00 per annum.\nI cannot understand why this was sent to me as the estate and myself personally have never recognized Joseph Ostro in any particular in connection with the lease which we have with your company, nor do we at this time, but I presume you were sent a similar notice, and that this is simply to confirm the fact that in your lease with him, which you had with you when you saw the writer at the beginning of your transaction with Ostro, that you had made a lease with him for the full period including the option as covered in your lease with the Selby estate, and that you had made arrangements with the Bank of Montreal to take care of the payments to the Selby estate throughout this entire period to the 31st of April, 1937.\nI would have written you earlier on this had I not been laid up and away from the office, and I am dropping you this note in case you have not been sent a copy of this notice, as this estate has no interest in the notice whatever, which was drawn up by Paul Labadie, N.P., under his number 3341, dated April 13, 1931.\nTo this letter came a reply from Mr. Lowden, Canadian manager for both the Delco company and the Frigidaire company. The reply was dated June 2, 1931, and the first paragraph thereof reads as follows:\nThanks for your letter of May 28. Mr. Ostro has already served us with a paper, of which I attach a copy, and I have written the head office of the Frigidaire Corporation arranging to have the transfer made from the Delco-Light Company to the Frigidaire Corporation, and also have asked the head office to proceed with the necessary papers for the renewal of the second five-year period according to Mr. Ostro\u2019s request, as this is in accordance with our agreement with him.\nOur object in referring to Mr. Lowden\u2019s letter is only to show that Mr. Lowden, as manager of the appellant company in Canada, transmitted to Mr. Hopkins, representing the Selby estate, a copy of the notice of renewal sent by Ostro to the Delco company. Further, he did so in terms conveying to the Selby estate that Ostro\u2019s notice had the approval of the company and was in accordance with our agreement with him.\nWe do not lose sight of the fact that Mr. Lowden\u2019s authority was disputed by the appellant. There is no controversy on the point that he was acting as manager in Canada for both the Delco company and the Frigidaire company. But it is stated that, as such, he had no power to bind the Delco company to a lease involving a total liability of $80,000. We may assume that this was true. This was not, however, what Mr. Lowden was doing by sending with his approval a copy of Ostro\u2019s notice of renewal.\nThe liability of the Delco company for the first five years\u2019 period of the lease, and the further liability for the subsequent five years resulting from the renewal, were both covered, as we will show presently, by the original contract and by the transfer to Ostro, the validity whereof is not even questioned. Incidentally, it may be pointed out, the transfer to Ostro was signed and executed on behalf of the appellant by Mr. M. A. Morison; and when Mr. Morison was asked under whose authority he executed the transfer, he stated he had received such authority and instructions from Mr. E. A. Lowden.\nWhen Mr. Lowden, on June 2, sent Ostro\u2019s notice of renewal to the Selby estate and gave it the stamp of approval of the Delco company, he was not thereby involving that company into a new liability; he was merely acting in accordance with the terms of the transfer to Ostro and, as we will see later, fulfilling one of the obligations the company had undertaken towards its assignee. He was doing something which the company was bound to do. We have no doubt that his authority to do at least that cannot, in the premises, be challenged by the appellant.\nAs a consequence of the initial letter from Mr. Hopkins, a certain correspondence was subsequently exchanged between the latter and Mr. Lowden, in the course of which Mr. Lowden undoubtedly put on the lease and the transfer a construction hardly to be reconciled with the stand now taken by the Delco company in the present litigation. As this judgment develops, it will be noticed that our interpretation of the two documents is substantially in agreement with that of Mr. Lowden. Since, however, his authority to engage the liability of the company for the last period of five years was not admitted, and since, in our view of the case, his participation in the matter could not affect the rights of Ostro, or of the Selby estate, we do not intend, with regard to that point, to base our decision on the letters written by Mr. Lowden. We will, therefore, omit referring to them, as it would only obscure the sequence of the essential facts.\nOn June 18, 1931, Mr. A. N. Taylor, of the real estate section, apparently apprehending that his letter of April 18 might not be fully understood, again wrote to Ostro; and from that letter we extract the following paragraphs:\nThe original lease has been assigned to you and with it the right to an extension if you elect to have the lease extended. Consequently, this notice should be given by you and any new lease which may be entered into for the extended period should be between you and the landlord. Neither the Delco-Light company nor the Frigidaire Sales Corporation should be in any way a party to the lease or assume any disability in connection with the same.\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Salisbury of the Frigidaire Sales Corporation and will ask that if there is any misunderstanding of the matter by either of you that I be communicated with further. This will again show the close connection, at least in relation to the lease of the premises on St. Catherine street, between the Delco company and the Frigidaire Sales Corporation. It may be noted here that the authority of Mr. Taylor, in all matters concerning this case, is admitted; and, in fact, invoked by the appellant.\nOn the 30th day of October, 1931, the Delco-Light Company caused to be served upon Ostro and the Selby estate respectively a protest reciting the facts as it understood them, stating that Ostro was then\nin default in payment due the (Delco company) of the rent for the month of October, 1931; and\nand that the company\ndisavows the purported renewal made by the said Joseph Ostro of the said lease * * * and hereby notifies the said lessors that the company will not be responsible for the rental of the said premises after the 30th day of April, 1932.\nWhereupon, on November 6, 1931, the Selby estate wrote to the Delco company, advising them that\nin view of the exercise of the right of renewal for a further period of five years, from the 1st of May, 1932, of the lease from the Selby estate to the Delco company, dated 6th April, 1927, which right of renewal has been exercised both notarially and by correspondence, the Selby estate look to the Delco company and all concerned as being responsible for the fulfilment of the obligations incurred by reason of this renewal.\nThe Delco company was further advised in the same letter that the protest served on the 30th October, 1931, was of no force and effect, and did not in any way alter the situation or relieve the Delco company of its liability.\nUnder the above circumstances, the Selby estate brought action, both by principal and incidental demands, against the Delco company, claiming rental for the premises for the months of May, June, July and August, 1932, altogether a sum of $5,333.32, which was contested by the Delco company, but which the Superior Court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously maintained.\nThe Delco company now brings the whole matter by way of appeal to this court and argues that the trial court and the appeal court both erred in failing \u201cto take into account the true character of the rights and obligations of the appellant by reason of the assignment and renewal clause of the lease\u201d; in failing \u201cto take into consideration the true character of the assignment by appellant to Joseph Ostro\u201d; in failing \u201cto take cognizance of the Selby estate\u2019s refusal to recognize Ostro\u2019s alleged renewal for the added term of five years, which estopped respondents from invoking same at a later date\u201d; in failing \u201cto observe * * * that the contract was only with Delco Light Company, and that any option of renewal binding upon it should come from it.\u201d\nThe appellant again raised the matter of the authority of Lowden; but we have already stated why we did not deem it necessary to discuss that question.\nOur views must first be stated in respect to the terms of the lease and of the assignment thereof to Ostro, as well as to the rights and obligations deriving therefrom with regard to all parties concerned.\nThe Delco company was expressly given \u201cthe right to transfer its right in the present lease.\u201d It was also given \u201cthe right of renewing the present lease for a further period of five years\u201d at a higher rental per annum, but \u201csubject otherwise to all the other terms and conditions of the present lease.\u201d\nThe appellant attempted to distinguish between its obligations during the first five years of the lease (which, according to it, were alone designated under the expression \u201cpresent lease\u201d) and its obligations during the subsequent five years, in respect of which the company urged the court to decide that they did not come under the designation of the \u201cpresent lease,\u201d but really constituted a new lease. The argument was stated as follows: The right of renewal was not a right of extension of the existing lease, but a right to have a new lease. The Delco company was responsible for all its obligations under \u201cthe present lease\u201d (i.e., for the first five years); but it had no obligations under the new lease, if Ostro availed himself of the right of renewal which had been transferred to him.\nWe are unable to accede to the proposition that, in the notarial document signed by the appellant and the respondents on the 6th day of April, 1927, the expression \u201cpresent lease,\u201d wherever found, refers only to the first five years and not to the renewal period. The expression, we think, throughout the document, and particularly in the material sections of it dealing with the right to transfer and the right of renewal (above set out), has reference to the document itself in full, and that is to say: to the whole of the contract between the parties. Among the rights, derived from the contract, which the Delco company was expressly authorized to transfer was comprised the right of renewal. To the right of renewal is attached the condition that it shall be \u201csubject otherwise to all the other terms and conditions of the present lease.\u201d And among the other terms and conditions to which the right of renewal is so made subject, there is the condition that, if the right of transfer is exercised by the Delco company, it shall be \u201csubject, however, to (the company) continuing at all times responsible for the due fulfilment of all its obligations under the present lease\u201d (or contract); one of the obligations being, of course, the payment of the rent.\nFrom the moment that the Delco company assigned to Ostro its right of renewal, the assignment necessarily carried with it, on the part of the company, the liability for the rent during the last period of five years, if the renewal was duly effected by Ostro.\nIt was under those conditions that the Delco company expressly transferred to Ostro its right of renewing the lease; and again we are unable to agree with the appellant in its interpretation of the terms of that transfer. It was not, as the appellant contends, a transfer whereby the\nappellant divested itself of all and any interest, intention and power to exercise the right of renewal on its own behalf and gave such right as it might in the premises to Ostro.\nThe appellant could not have divested itself in that absolute way without the consent of the Selby estate. Under its contract with the estate, the appellant had been given the right of renewal to which certain conditions were essentially attached and without which the right of renewal itself would not have existed. It was that right with all its conditions which the appellant transferred to Ostro. For that transfer, it stipulated and was paid a substantial consideration in money. It is not necessary to enter here into the discussion whether a transfer of that character is a sublease or an assignment. Laurent (vol. 25, no. 188) says that, so far as the legal effects are concerned, the two words are synonymous and that: \u201cLa tradition ignore la diff\u00e9rence que Ton veut \u00e9tablir entre sous-louer et c\u00e9der son bail\u201d (p. 215). The view of the transaction most favourable to the appellant is to treat it as an assignment of its right of renewal. The assignment could be made only with all the conditions and obligations attached thereto. It would be a fallacy to say that, after the transfer, the Delco company ceased to have any interest whatever in the exercise of the right of renewal. It had ceded or sold that right for a consideration. It was bound, therefore, to make good the transfer; and that carried with it the obligation towards Ostro of doing and making all that would be necessary to insure the exercise by Ostro of the right of renewal and to keep the lease alive for the subsequent five years. That was part of the bargain for which the Delco had been paid. It followed that if, under the terms of the lease with the Selby estate, it was a condition that the notice required to exercise the right of renewal should be given by the principal lessees, the Delco company, that company, having bargained with Ostro to make good to him its right of renewal, became bound to itself give the required notice, if that were necessary to enable Ostro to exercise the option assigned to him.\nIt should further be said that we must also disagree with the appellant when it states that all that Ostro got by the transfer from the Delco company was\na mere right of offer of renewal * * * depending upon whether or not he was, in the opinion and consideration of the respondents, a desirable person.\nThe contention put forward by the appellant was that the right of renewal, in so far as the appellant was concerned\nwas an open offer, but not so as to Ostro, in regard to whom the respondents had an opportunity to accept or reject his notice.\nSuch a contention is not in accord with the true legal relations resulting from the contracts between the parties. The Delco company had an absolute right of renewal, a right which could be exercised by the mere giving of a notice in writing to the Selby estate not later than the 1st of November, 1931. This did not require any new agreement or the signature of any new document between the Selby estate and the company. There was not to be a new lease. The original contract contains the whole of the agreement of the parties with regard to it; and, as held both by the trial judge and by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the renewal would be effected by the sole fact that, and as soon as, the lessee sent the notice therefor to the lessors. It was that absolute right which was transferred by the Delco company to Ostro; and, through the transfer, Ostro acquired a right of renewal just as complete and as extensive as the right of renewal which the Delco company itself had been given by the Selby estate.\nThis was an absolute right of renewal which (provided the conditions were fulfilled) was not in any way subject to the acceptance or the control of the Selby estate. If the notice in writing was given, the renewal took place ipso facto. The Selby estate became bound by it, and the lease was automatically extended for the further period of five years stipulated therein. The whole matter was entirely left at the option of the lessee; and the lessor was powerless to repudiate the option, if it was exercised within the terms of the lease. As soon as it was so exercised, and without anything more being required, the lease with all its conditions became extended for the further period agreed upon, and the Selby estate was bound to respect it.\nIt follows that, as stated by Mr. Justice St. Jacques:\nLes propri\u00e9taires ne pouvaient pas refuser \u00e0 Ostro l\u2019exercice de ce droit; ils avaient donn\u00e9 leur consentement d\u2019avance, et ils ne pouvaient rien faire pour se d\u00e9lier.\nA similar observation was made by Mr. Justice Bond.\nBut it must also be added that the Selby estate was bound by the notice of renewal only within the terms of the contract, to wit: with the express condition that the Delco company would remain obligated to pay the rent; and that obligation was part of its undertaking towards Ostro as a consequence of the transfer for which it received the lump sum of $2,500.\nAfter what we have said so far, the only question remaining to be considered is whether the right of renewal was properly exercised and whether, as a consequence, the lease of the store premises was extended for the further period of five years, for the rent of which, in the present case, the respondents try to have the appellant held responsible.\nUnder the terms of the original contract, in order to renew the lease, the Delco company had to give the Selby estate a notice in writing not later than the 1st November, 1931. The right of renewal was expressly transferred to Ostro. The transfer carried with it the right by Ostro to request the Delco company itself to give the notice in writing, if that were required to insure the renewal. Ostro, in due time, notified the Delco company of his intention to exercise the option. The legal result was that, by force of the terms of the transfer, the Delco company was bound to carry out its obligation to have the lease extended. However, it is unnecessary to go so far in the present case, for Ostro did not wait for the Delco company to give the . required notice. He himself caused a notarial declaration of renewal to be served upon the estate. This, further, was in accord with the advice given to him on behalf of the Delco company by Mr. Taylor, whose authority is not disputed. In Mr. Taylor\u2019s two letters (April 18th and June 18th, 1931), Mr. Taylor took the stand that it would be necessary for Ostro to give the notice. It happened that that was precisely what Ostro had already done. It is true that Mr. Taylor also contended that no right was reserved in the Delco company to give such notice, or that neither the Delco company, nor the Frigidaire company\nshould be in any way a party to the lease, or assume any disability in connection with the same.\nA clear distinction, however, must be made between the two contentions put forward by Mr. Taylor on behalf of the company. The advice to Ostro that he should himself send the notice remains as a fact which the company may not be allowed to dispute in the stand it is now taking in the present case. But the contention that the right to renew the lease was not reserved in the Delco company and that it should not in any way be a party in the lease or assume any liability in connection with it was a contention of law to which the courts below refused to accede; and, on that point, we find ourselves in full accord with them. Having regard to the terms of the transfer, and to the advice given to Ostro by Mr. Taylor on behalf of the Delco company, we fail to see how the company may be heard to say that the notice given by Ostro was not an effective notice to renew the lease within the terms of the contract between the parties. It may be that the Selby estate might have questioned the right of Ostro to give that notice. It is impossible for us to understand how the appellant can do so.\nIt was said that the transfer of the lease and the rights thereunder was the transfer of a \u201cdroit de cr\u00e9ance\u201d which should be assimilated to the sale of rights of action against third persons covered by Art. 1570 & seq. of the Civil Code, the consequence being that, as the transfer to Ostro had not been served upon the Selby estate, Ostro had no possession available against that estate.\nThis objection, in our view, is not open to the Delco company. We are willing to assume, for the purposes of the argument, that, as Laurent puts it (vol. 25, no. 200):\nEn principe, il n\u2019intervient aucun lien juridique entre le bailleur principal et le sous-preneur;\nand that, as a consequence, the sub-tenant has no direct right of action against the principal lessor.\nWe may assume also that the Selby estate was not bound to recognize the possession or the status of Ostro; and this may have been true both under the civil code (Art. 1571) and under its contract with the Delco company, whereby the latter remained responsible for the due payment of the rent, notwithstanding any transfer to Ostro. In our view, that was exactly what Mr. Hopkins, writing on behalf of the Selby estate, wished to convey to the Delco company when he sent his letter of May 28, 1931. We think Mr. Justice St. Jacques, in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, correctly stated the meaning and purport of that letter in the following passage of his reasons for judgment:\nLe sens v\u00e9ritable de cette lettre est que les propri\u00e9taires voulaient bien prendre leurs pr\u00e9cautions vis-\u00e0-vis le locataire originaire, et ne rien faire qui p\u00fbt \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, en quoi que ce soit, comme novation de l\u2019obligation que ce locataire avait assum\u00e9e pour toute la dur\u00e9e du bail.\nThe letter was not, as urged by the appellant, a repudiation \u00f3f Ostro\u2019s notice. In our view, it showed the contrary intention, for it draws the attention of Mr. Lowden to the fact that Ostro\u2019s notice must have been given as a consequence of the lease made\nwith him for the full period, including the option as covered in your lease with the Selby estate;\nand that, as a result, the Delco company has no doubt\nmade arrangements with the Bank of Montreal to take care of the payments to the Selby Estate throughout this entire period to the 31st of April, 1927.\nThe letter, therefore, clearly contemplates the new situation created by the notice from Ostro as having the effect of prolonging the lease for the subsequent period of five years. That being the construction put by all courts upon that letter, perhaps it is unnecessary to point out that the letter was addressed to Mr. Lowden and that, if the appellant is unwilling to assume responsibility for the letters written by Mr. Lowden, it should not be permitted to rely upon part only of the correspondence exchanged between Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Lowden. If the letter is used for the limited purpose of showing the opinion of Mr. Hopkins after he received the notice from Ostro, we do not think it is of much consequence. If Mr. Hopkins intended to repudiate the notice, the proper way, if not the only way, was to communicate that intention to Ostro, which he did not do. Under all the circumstances, we think the letter of May 28 was certainly open to the construction put upon it by the two courts; and its purpose was not the repudiation of Ostro\u2019s notice; but, on the contrary, an assertion of the Selby estate\u2019s right against the Delco company, as a consequence of the right of renewal exercised by Ostro.\nThe notice of renewal did not require to be accepted by the Selby estate. In the circumstances of the present case, the notice given by Ostro was sufficient to bind the Selby estate and to effect a renewal of the lease, as provided for in the contract between the appellant and the respondents. At all events, the appellants cannot be heard to contend otherwise.\nThe action of the respondents was therefore rightly maintained and the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Harmen.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mann & Mackinnon.\n[1] (1934) Q.R. 56 K.B. 263.\n"}

Keating, Deceased.\n1934: May 17; 1934: June 15.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWill\u2014Administration and distribution of estate\u2014Postponement of conversion into money of testator\u2019s shares of stock in company\u2014Shares apparently unsaleable and no dividends received\u2014Ultimate realization on shares on liquidation of company\u2014Rights as between tenants for life and remaindermen as to moneys realized\u2014Manner of distribution among shareholders of moneys received by company for its assets\u2014Directions of will.\nK. died in 1912. In his will, after certain bequests, he devised and bequeathed the remainder of his property to his trustee to carry out the trusts of the will, which included conversion into money \u201cin such manner and at such times as he may deem proper,\u201d direction to invest and power to change investments, direction for payments to K.\u2019s widow out of income for maintenance, direction for division, after the widow\u2019s death (which occurred in 1916), of the balance of the net income of the estate among his children, and, by para. 14, direction that the capital of the estate be kept intact until at least one year after the death of K.\u2019s last surviving child or of K.\u2019s last surviving grand-child which might be living at K.\u2019s death, whichever event should last happen, and then that the whole estate be distributed in a manner set out.\nThe estate left by K. included 250 ordinary shares of the capital stock of a company, of the par value of \u00a310 each. No dividends were paid and the shares were apparently unsaleable, until an expropriation of the company\u2019s property which was followed in 1920 by a voluntary liquidation of the company for the purpose of distributing its assets, which apparently consisted wholly of the sum awarded for the expropriation and interest thereon. This interest was distributed on account of the arrears of dividends accumulated on the company\u2019s preference shares. The principal sum awarded was distributed \u201cby way of return of capital\u201d pro rata among the preference and ordinary shareholders pursuant to a direction of the court in England. In the years 1920-1922 the trustee of K.\u2019s estate received from the company\u2019s liquidator sums aggregating $20,212.78.\nAppellant, one of K.\u2019s children, contended that the said sum of $20,212.78 received by the trustee should be apportioned between capital and income in accordance with the rule laid down in In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trusts, 24 Ch. D. 643; that the postponement of conversion of the shares was for the benefit of the estate\u2014for the benefit both of the remaindermen and of the life tenants; and the said rule should be applied, so as to do justice as between life tenants and remaindermen, by dividing the funds received in such a way that they would respectively be in the same position as if it had been possible to convert the shares to advantage on the testator\u2019s death or within one year thereafter; that even if the sums when received by the trustee were capital realizations, that fact would not exclude the application of the equitable principle invoked.\nHeld: (1) The adjudication of the English court that the principal sum of the award should be distributed \u201cby way of return of capital,\u201d etc., was not conclusive upon the parties to this appeal, as that direction was made on an originating proceeding to determine the respective rights of the preference and ordinary shareholders upon the winding up of the company, and was not also a determination of the respective rights of the life tenant and reversioner under the will of any shareholder.\n(2) The sums when received by the trustee were clearly capital realizations (In re Armitage, [1893] 3 Ch. 337; Inland Revenue Commissioner v. Burrell, [1924] 2 K.B. 52; Hill v. Permanent Trustee Co. of New South Wales Ltd., [1930] A.C. 720). The will itself excluded the application of the rule invoked. The application thereof asked for by appellant would effect a reduction of capital and be contrary to the said express direction in para. 14 of the will. The sums in question must remain in their entirety as part of the capital of the estate.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1934] O.R. 71, affirmed in the result. APPEAL (on leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario) by C. Sedley Keating, one of the children of Edward H. Keating, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing (Middleton, J.A., dissenting) his appeal from the judgment of Jeffrey J. (on motion for determination of a question arising in the administration of the estate of said deceased), holding that the whole of certain sums of money realized by the executor of the estate of the said deceased out of 250 shares of the common stock of the Halifax Graving Dock Co. Ltd., part of the assets of the said estate, (said sums being realized upon the winding-up of the company), should be credited to capital only.\nThe appellant is one of the beneficiaries under the will of the said deceased, being entitled as life tenant to a share in the net income from the residuary estate after the payment of certain legacies and annuities. He claimed that the moneys realized as aforesaid should be apportioned as between income and capital in accordance with the rule in In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trusts[2]. This claim was rejected by the judgments appealed from.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nR.L. Kellock for the appellant.\nMcGregor Young K.C. for infant respondents and respondent charities.\nK.F. MacKenzie K.C. for the executor and trustee of the deceased\u2019s estate.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014The late Edward H. Keating died on the 17th day of June, 1912. Among the assets which passed to the trustee were 250 ordinary shares of the capital stock of the Halifax Graving Dock Company, Limited, of the par value of \u00a310 each. This company was an English company incorporated about the year 1886. In 1890 preference stock was created, amounting to 7,400 5% cumulative shares of the par value of \u00a310 each. When the company went into liquidation, as hereinafter mentioned, there were 7,400 preference shares outstanding and 7,365 ordinary shares of the same par value. The company carried on the business of a dry dock until an explosion occurred on the 6th day of December, 1917, when the property was severely damaged. About the time the repairs were completed, namely in May, 1918, the property was expropriated by the Dominion Government.\nCompensation amounting to about $1,400,000 was awarded to the company by the Exchequer Court of Canada on July 6, 1920, with interest at 5% from the date of expropriation. Thereafter the company went into voluntary liquidation for the purpose of distributing its assets, which apparently consisted wholly of the moneys received from the expropriation proceedings. No dividends had been paid on either preferred or ordinary shares of the company, and apparently there was no accumulated income available for distribution as dividends, as the only income distributed on the liquidation was the interest received from the Dominion Government upon the award. This interest was distributed on account of the arrears of dividends accumulated upon the preference shares. The principal amount of the award was distributed \u201cby way of return of capital\u201d pro rata among the preference and ordinary shareholders pursuant to a direction of the court in England.\nUpon the distribution of the assets, the Royal Trust Company, executor and trustee of the estate of the late Edward H. Keating, received from the liquidator the sum of $20,212.78 in the following amounts at the following times:\nNov. 13, 1920.......................................................................................\n$ 9,250 00\nMay 23, 1921.......................................................................................\n10,029 37\nOct. 19, 1921........................................................................................\n905 25\nApr. 19, 1922.......................................................................................\n28 16\nIt should also be mentioned that in the inventory filed by the trustee on the application for letters probate, the shares were listed as of no value. They were then unsaleable, and continued to be apparently unsaleable and of no value until the expropriation.\nBy his last will and testament, the testator made certain specific bequests and then devised and bequeathed the whole of the remainder of his real and personal property to the trustee to carry out the trusts created by the will.\nSome of the remaining provisions are very important.\n4. In trust that the said trustee may sell, collect and convert into money all such parts of my estate as shall not consist of money in such manner and at such times as he may deem proper.\n5. I direct that after paying my just debts and funeral expenses all moneys belonging to my estate not already well invested are to be invested by my trustee for the benefit of my estate and in such securities as he may consider proper and best and that the said trustee may from time to time at his discretion vary or transpose any investments for others which may be deemed preferable.\n6. I direct that my said wife is to be paid monthly out of the net income from my estate the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars or four thousand two hundred dollars per annum during her lifetime for her use and maintenance and for the maintenance of my unmarried daughter Jessie and that this is to be a first charge against the revenues of my estate after paying the annuities in the next succeeding clause 7.\n* * * *\n8. After the death of my said wife if she survives me or after my death if I survive her I direct that the following disposition is to be made, viz.,\n* * * *\n10. I direct that the balance of the net income of my estate after deducting the annuities and amounts reserved in the three preceding clauses, 7, 8, and 9, is to be divided equally among my surviving children, Jessie, Heloise, Agnes and Sedley, and paid in monthly or quarterly instalments subject to the following express provision and stipulation, viz., that if in any year the share coming to my daughter Jessie under such division should amount to less than two thousand dollars per annum I direct that she is to receive that amount (viz: $2,000) in full per annum until her marriage and that the remaining balance only is in that event to be equally divided between Heloise, Agnes and Sedley my intention being that she is to be assured and is to receive at least $2,000 per annum for her sole use and enjoyment until her marriage.\n* * * *\n14. I direct that the capital of my said estate shall be kept intact and only the income derived therefrom distributed as I have in this my last will and testament directed until at least one year after the death of my last surviving child or of my last surviving grand\u2011child which may be living at the time of my death which ever event shall last happen\u2014when I direct that the whole of my said estate shall be distributed amongst my next-of-kin as provided by \u201cThe Statute of Distribution\u201d or any other law providing for the devolution of estates in force in the Province of Ontario in so far and providing that my said next-of-kin are my own lineal descendants. In the event of there being no lineal descendants of my own then living I direct that the whole of my said estate shall in that case be distributed equally among the following charitable institutions or among so many of them as may then exist, viz:\nThe Toronto Dispensary for the relief of the Sick Poor.\nThe Nursing Mission (Hayter Street), Toronto.\nThe Nursing Mission (Beverley Street), Toronto.\nThe West End Creche, Toronto.\nThe Sick Children\u2019s Hospital, Toronto. The Home for Incurable Children, Toronto.\nThe Children\u2019s Aid Society, Toronto.\nThe Association for the Relief of the Poor, Halifax, N.S.\nThe Benevolent Fund of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers, Montreal.\nThe Benevolent Fund of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London, G.B.\n15. I appoint the Royal Trust Company of Canada my executor and trustee for the purposes aforesaid and I request that a copy of this my will be furnished to each of my children as soon as it can conveniently be done after my death.\nThe testator\u2019s widow died on December 3, 1916.\nThe appellant contends that upon the true construction of the last will and testament of the deceased the said sum of $20,212.78 received by the trustee should be apportioned between capital and income in accordance with the rule laid down in In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trusts[3]. An application was made by the appellant and Heloise J. Macklem before Mr. Justice Jeffrey by way of originating notice for determination of the question. Mr. Justice Jeffrey held that the whole sum should be credited to capital only. From this order an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, dismissed the appeal.\nFrom this order the appellant, C. Sedley Keating, now appeals to this Court.\nIn In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trusts3, it was decided that where a testator has bequeathed his residuary personal estate to trustees upon trust for conversion, with power to postpone such conversion at their discretion, and to hold the proceeds upon trust for a person for life with remainders over, and such residue includes outstanding personal estate, the conversion of which the trustees, in the exercise of their discretion, postpone for the benefit of the estate, and which eventually falls in some years after the testator\u2019s death\u2014as, for instance, a mortgage debt with arrears of interest, or arrears of an annuity with interest, or moneys payable on a life policy\u2014such outstanding personal estate should, on falling in, be apportioned as between capital and income by ascertaining the sum which, put out at interest at 4 per cent. per annum on the day of the testator\u2019s death, and accumulating at compound interest calculated at that rate with yearly rests and de- ducting income tax, would, with the accumulations of interest, have produced, at the day of receipt, the amount actually received; and the sum so ascertained should be treated as capital, and the residue as income.\nIt was contended by the respondents that the adjudication of the court in England that the principal amount of the award should be distributed \u201cby way of return of capital\u201d pro rata among the preference and ordinary shareholders was conclusive and binding upon the parties to the appeal. That direction, however, was made on an originating proceeding to determine the respective rights of the preference and ordinary shareholders upon the winding up of the company, and was not also a determination of the respective rights of the life tenant and reversioner under the will of any shareholder.\nIn Hill v. Permanent Trustee Company of New South Wales, Limited[4], a company sold substantially the whole of its lands and other assets and ceased to carry on business. In 1926 a dividend was declared and paid as \u201ca distribution of capital assets in advance of the winding up.\u201d No question arose in the appeal as to that dividend. In November, 1927, the company declared and paid a dividend, stating that it was paid out of the sale of breeding stock. Upon an originating summons issued by trustees, who held over two-thirds of the shares issued, the Supreme Court held that the dividend should be treated as capital of the trust estate. Upon appeal to the Privy Council, it was held that the dividend should be treated as income of the trust estate. In delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, Lord Russell of Killowen said, at page 729:\u2014\nThese being the relevant facts of the case the point for decision is capable of statement thus: Is the sum of \u00a319,380 \u201cnet income or profits to be derived from such investment or investments,\u201d or is it \u201ccapital of my said trust estate?\u201d\nThe question which thus arises is one which may frequently occur when investments, representing a settled trust fund, include shares in a limited company which are not restricted to a fixed rate of dividend. So long as such a company is a going concern and is not restricted as to the profits out of which it may pay dividends, it may distribute as dividends to its shareholders the excess of its revenue receipts over expenses properly chargeable to revenue account. The balance to the credit of profit and loss account may in many cases be divided as dividend even if the company\u2019s capital account is in debit; and such a distribution by way of dividend would, prima facie, be \u201cincome or profits\u201d of the trust share, and belong to the tenant for life; it would not be \u201ccapital of my trust estate.\u201d On the other hand, if the company instead of distributing the same balance as dividends, resolved upon liquidation, the shareholder would be repaid his share capital and in addition the share of surplus assets in the liquidation attributable to his shares. The moneys received by the shareholder in the liquidation may be swollen by reason of the fact that the company has in its possession undivided profits, but no part thereof would belong to a tenant for life as income; it would all be corpus of the trust estate.\nFrom this it would appear that moneys paid in respect of shares in a limited company may be income or corpus of a settled share according to the procedure adopted, i.e., according as the moneys are paid by way of dividend before liquidation or are paid by way of surplus assets in a winding up. Each process might appear to involve some injustice, the former to the remainderman, the latter to the tenant for life.\nAnd at pages 730 and 731:\u2014\nA limited company when it parts with moneys available for distribution among its shareholders is not concerned with the fate of those moneys in the hands of any shareholder. The company does not know and does not care whether a shareholder is a trustee of his shares or not. It is of no concern to a company which is parting with moneys to a shareholder whether that shareholder (if he be a trustee) will hold them as trustee for A. absolutely or as trustee for A. for life only * * * If such moneys or any part thereof are to be treated as part of the corpus of the trust estate there must be some provision in the trust deed which brings about that result. No statement by the company or its officers that moneys which are being paid away to shareholders out of profits are capital, or are to be treated as capital, can have any effect upon the rights of the beneficiaries under a trust instrument which comprises shares in the company.\nAnd at page 734:\u2014\nTheir Lordships desire to say a word in reference to In re Armitage[5]. * * * The legal position in that case was quite plain. The old company had sold its assets (including accumulated profits) to the new company for a price which produced surplus assets in the winding up of the old company to the amount of \u00a39 5s. 6d. for each share of the old company upon which only \u00a38 per share had, in fact, been paid up. Upon no theory could it be said that any part of the \u00a39 5s. 6d. was payable to the tenant for life. The moneys paid were all surplus assets distributed in a winding up and took the place in the trust estate of the shares themselves. The difference between the \u00a39 5s. 6d. and the \u00a38 was a profit to the trust estate, just as if the shares had been sold and had realized \u00a39 5s. 6d. per share; but no part of the \u00a39 5s. 6d. was income of the tenant for life.\nIn In re Armitage; Armitage v. Garnett 5, a testator gave his estate upon the usual trusts for conversion and investment, with a power to postpone conversion and a direction that during the interval all income produced by the property in its actual state should be treated as income for the purposes of his will. He bequeathed one-third of the residue to A. for life and after her death upon further trusts. Part of the residue consisted of \u00a310 shares in a company with \u00a38 per share paid up. Some years after the testator\u2019s death, the company was wound up and reconstituted and the new company paid for the testator\u2019s shares \u00a39 5s. apiece, being \u00a31 5s. per share more than had been paid up. This excess arose from two funds, one of which consisted of profits which the directors had retained to meet contingencies. It was held, on appeal, that the right of the tenant for life of shares is only to receive dividends and bonuses in the shape of dividends declared during his life, and that the \u00a31 5s. per share, though it was profits., was not income to which the tenant for life was entitled but must go to capital. Lord Justice Lindley said, pages 345 and 346:\nThe company was wound up, and the assets of the company were distributed amongst the registered shareholders * * * Those undivided profits of course could have been divided as dividends if the company had so thought fit. * * * The moment the company got into liquidation there was an end of all power of declaring dividends and of equalizing dividends, and the only thing that the liquidator had to do was to turn the assets into money, and divide the money among the shareholders in proportion to their shares. * * * What does a man mean when he leaves shares to a tenant for life? He means that that tenant for life shall have the income arising from the shares in the shape of dividends or bonuses declared during the lifetime of the tenant for life. He does not mean that the tenant for life shall receive profits in any other sense. He does not mean him to have such profits, for example, as arise by a realization of shares; he never dreamed of such profits going to the tenant for life. * * * This conclusion is completely in accord with Bouch v. Sproule[6], which at least, after reviewing a great mass of conflicting cases, established the rational principle that what a tenant for life is to take under an ordinary bequest of shares is what is declared as dividends or bonuses in the shape of dividends during the lifetime of that tenant for life.\nLopes, L.J., was also of opinion that as the company was voluntarily winding up and had not previously declared dividends in respect of the excess, the latter was not income but capital and did not go to the tenant for life. A.L. Smith, L.J., agreed with Lord Justice Lindley.\nThe appellant pointed out that the shares of the Halifax Graving Dock Company, Limited, were retained by the trustee until the receipt by him of the proceeds of the shares in the winding-up, and that it was for the benefit of the estate that the conversion of the shares should be postponed rather than that they should have been sold at a sacrifice in the years 1912 or 1913. He urged that the postponement was for the benefit of the remaindermen as well as for the benefit of the life tenants, and submitted that the rule set out in In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trusts[7] was evolved for the purpose of doing justice as between life tenant and remainderman, by dividing the funds received in such a way that they would respectively be in the same position as if it had been possible to convert the shares to advantage on the death of the testator or within one year thereafter.\nNow there is no doubt that the sums of money received by the trustee, when received, were capital realizations. In re Armitage; Armitage v. Garnett[8]; Inland Revenue Commissioner v. Burrell[9]; and Hill v. Permanent Trustee Company of New South Wales Ltd.[10] The appellant, however, contends that, although the sums when received by the trustee may have been capital realizations, there is nothing in that fact to exclude the application of the equitable principle illustrated by In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trusts7. In my opinion, however, the will itself excludes the application of the rule. By paragraph 14 of the will, the testator directs that the capital of the estate is to be kept intact, and only the income derived therefrom distributed until at least one year after the death of the last surviving child or of the last surviving grand\u2011child living at the death of the testator, whichever event may last happen. The application of the rule asked by the appellant would effect a reduction of capital and would, in my opinion, be contrary to the express direction of the testator as set out in paragraph 14 of the will.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the sums in question must remain in their entirety as part of the capital of the estate, as was held by Mr. Justice Jeffrey and by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors the appellant: Mason, Foulds, Davidson, Carter & Kellock.\nOfficial Guardian (for infant respondents): McGregor Young.\nSolicitor for the Public Trustee (representing respondent charities): C.M.

That congregation entered the United Church of Canada in 1925, when The United Church of Canada Act (Dom., 1924, c. 100) came into force. G. remained a member of the congregation until her death in 1929. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc held (6 M.P.R. 465, affirming judgment of Graham J., ibid) that the gifts should be paid to the Home and Foreign Mission Funds respectively, of the Presbyterian Church in Canada (that is, the continuing Presbyterian Church in Canada, so called, not merged in nor associated with the United Church of Canada) (hereinafter called the \u201cContinuing Presbyterian Church\u201d). The United Church of Canada (but no other parties interested) appealed to this Court. It claimed that the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as it existed before the said Act, became a constituent part of the United Church of Canada without the loss of its identity, and that the gifts in question should pass to the United Church of Canada. Held: The United Church of Canada was not entitled to the gifts (Fraser v. McLellan, [1930] Can. S.C.R. 344); and its appeal failed.\nThis Court expressed no opinion on the question of the right of the Continuing Presbyterian Church to the gifts as against other parties interested, as residuary legatees or as next of kin; that question (which the appellant church had no status to raise) not being before it.\nTherefore the said decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, in the result remained undisturbed.\nAPPEAL (by leave of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc) by The United Church of Canada from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] affirming (Hall J. dissenting) the judgment of Graham J.[2], holding that certain bequests in the will of Jessie Gray, deceased, should be paid to the Home Mission Fund and the Foreign Mission Fund, respectively, of the Presbyterian Church in Canada (that is, the Continuing Presbyterian Church in Canada, so called, not merged in nor associated with the United Church of Canada).\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and G. W. Mason K.C. for the appellant.\nGlyn Osier K.C. and E. M. Macdonald for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont J. was delivered by\nLamont, J.\u2014On July 7, 1921, Jessie Gray, a resident of Hopewell, in the County of Pictou and Province of Nova Scotia, made her last will and testament. By that will she left bequests as follows:\u2014\n\u201cTo the Home Mission Fund of the Presbyterian\nChurch in Canada\u201d. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \u2026. $500 00\n\u201cTo the Foreign Mission Fund of the Presbyterian\nChurch in Canada\u201d. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 00\nShe died on the 12th day of September, 1929. At the date of the will and for many years previous thereto Jessie Gray was a member of the St. Colomba congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, at Hopewell. That congregation voted to enter the United Church of Canada, and entered that church on June 10, 1925, when The United Church of Canada Act (Statutes of Canada, 1924, chapter 100) came into force. Jessie Gray remained a member of the said congregation up to the date of her death.\nOn the 31st day of December, 1931, the executors named in the will took out an originating summons calling upon The United Church of Canada; The Presbyterian Church in Canada, not merging in nor associated with The United Church of Canada (hereinafter called \u201cThe Continuing Presbyterian Church\u201d);and a number of others who were beneficiaries under the will, to cause an appearance to be entered for them, respectively, to the summons, which was an application for an order to determine whether the bequests above mentioned should be paid to The United Church of Canada or The Continuing Presbyterian Church, or, if to neither, how otherwise.\nThe matter came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Graham, of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, who held that the bequests should be paid to The Continuing Presbyterian Church. On appeal to the Supreme Court, en banc, that court affirmed the decision of Mr. Justice Graham (Hall J. dissenting). The United Church, by leave, now appeals to this Court.\nThe United Church bases its claim to the bequests upon The United Church of Canada Act, which was assented to on July 19, 1924, but did not come into force generally until June 10, 1925.\nThe various sections of the Act received consideration from this court in the case of In re Estate of Eliza Patriquin, deceased\u2014Fraser v. McLellan[3]. In that case Eliza Patriquin bequeathed $100 to the Trustees of the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church, and the residue to the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church. The will was made January 5, 1924, and Eliza Patriquin died May 2, 1926. The will was, therefore, made before the Union, and she died subsequent thereto. On June 10, 1925, the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church became part of The United Church of Canada, and an application was made to this court for an order declaring that The United Church was entitled to both bequests. It was held by this court that, as both the bequest and the residue were to benefit the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church, and that, as that congregation had been divided, the congregation of The United Church was no longer identical with the congregation which it had been Eliza Patriquin\u2019s intention to benefit, and, therefore, The United Church was not entitled to receive the bequests.\nI agree with my brother Crocket, whose judgment I have had an opportunity of reading, that, in view of the principle laid down in the Tatamagouche case4, The United Church, in the case before us, is not entitled to receive the bequests. Although in the Tatamagouche case4 the bequests were to a congregation and in the present case are to \u201cFunds,\u201d yet the funds which the testatrix intended to augment were funds controlled and administered by the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Both funds were then managed by boards or committees which were appointed by the General Assembly and which acted under such regulations as the Assembly from time to time adopted. Can it be said that funds which, although intended for missionary purposes, are controlled and administered by the General Council of The United Church, are the funds which the testatrix desired to augment by her bounty? In view of the decision in the Tatamagouche case[4], it seems to me the answer must be in the negative.\nAs to the claim of the Continuing Presbyterian Church. As the case was framed and as the parties went to trial there were three parties before the court: there were the two churches and one of the next of kin, and the court was called upon to decide whether or not either church or the next of kin was entitled. Both of the Nova Scotia courts decided in favour of the Presbyterian Church. From the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, neither the Trustees who took out the originating summons, nor the next of kin, has appealed. The only party disputing the claim of the Continuing Presbyterian Church is The United Church of Canada. Under the pro- ceedings taken here, all we have to do is to determine the right of The United Church to the bequests. That claim failing, the Continuing Presbyterian Church is entitled to maintain its judgment. It is entitled to maintain it, not on the ground that it has been established that it is the same entity as the Presbyterian Church in Canada prior to the Union\u2014on that question I express no opinion\u2014but because The United Church, which is the only one in a position to dispute its right to the bequests, has no claim whatever thereto. Whether under the Act the Continuing Presbyterian Church would be entitled as against the next of kin is a question which is not before us. As Lord Herschell said in Cox v. Hakes[5],\u2014\nThe function of a Court of Appeal is to deal with the judgment before it for review, and not to pronounce opinions on a point of law which may remove a difficulty from the path of a litigant in future proceedings.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket, J.\u2014The claim of the appellant, The United Church of Canada, to these bequests rests entirely on its submission that the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as it existed before the coming into force on June 10, 1925, of The United Church of Canada Act, Statutes of Canada, 1924, c. 100, became a constituent part of the ecclesiastical corporation constituted by that statute under the name of The United Church of Canada without the loss of its identity and that it therefore still existed as before within the new corporation.\nIn Fraser v. McLellan[6], in re the Estate of Eliza Patriquin, deceased, who had made a will before The United Church of Canada Act came into effect, leaving a bequest to the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church at Tatamagouche, N.S., this Court unanimously decided that that congregation, having become a part of The United Church of Canada under the provisions of The United Church of Canada Act, which purported to merge the Presbyterian Church in Canada, The Methodist Church and The Congregational Churches of Canada, in the new corporation constituted by that statute, was not the same entity to which the testatrix made her bequest and therefore could not take it. In delivering the judgment of the court Smith, J., said:\u2014\nThe sole question for determination is whether or not that congregation, under the circumstances that have since arisen, comes now within the description in the will or has become something so different that it does not now answer to the description.\nAnd, after pointing out that The United Church of Canada was incorporated by The United Church of Canada Act as \u201can entirely new and distinct legal entity\u201d:\nIt cannot be said that a congregation of The United Church of Canada at Tatamagouche is the same religious organization as was within the contemplation of the testatrix in making this bequest to the Tatamagouche Preshyterian Church.\nThis decision is conclusive, so far as this Court is concerned, as to the appellant The United Church of Canada\u2019s claim that it is entitled to the bequests now in question on the ground that \u201cthe Presbyterian Church in Canada is a constituent part of such Church without loss of identity,\u201d which must mean that the Presbyterian Church in Canada still exists as the same entity as formerly within the fold of the United Church. Upon no other ground could it possibly be contended that the Home and Foreign Missions Funds of the United Church of Canada are the Home and Foreign Mission Funds of the Presbyterian Church in Canada as the last named church existed before The United Church of Canada Act came into force. To hold that the several church organizations described in that Act as the negotiating churches, viz., the Presbyterian Church in Canada, The Methodist Church, The Congregational Union of Canada and The Congregational Union of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, were all constituted a single church under the new name of The United Church of Canada without loss of their identity, would necessarily imply, not only that each continued to exist within the new church corporation as a distinct and separate body as formerly, but that each retained the right to control its own internal affairs within The United Church without reference to the others, which was clearly never intended by the incorporating Act.\nThe appellant, The United Church of Canada, having no right or interest itself in these bequests, it follows, in my opinion, that it has no status on this appeal to challenge the right of the respondent, The Presbyerian Church in Canada, to receive them as against any other party or persons. The executors of the will, upon whose application the originating summons was issued for the determination of the questions therein framed, have not appealed from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc. Neither have any of the residuary legatees or next of kin, the only parties, other than the Presbyterian Church in Canada and The United Church of Canada, who could in any possible contingency be entitled to receive the moneys bequeathed to the Home Mission Fund and the Foreign Mission Fund of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and all of whom, as it seems, were duly cited to appear in the action and thus afforded an opportunity of being heard upon the question of the possible lapsing of the bequests because of there being no Home Mission Fund or Foreign Mission Fund of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as contemplated by the testatrix,\u2014which is obviously the only ground upon which they or any of them could become entitled to share in the bequeathed moneys. Both the trial court and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc decided that the bequests should be paid to the Home Mission Fund and the Foreign Mission Fund respectively of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as designated in the two questions, viz., \u201cthe Presbyterian Church in Canada (that is, the continuing Presbyterian Church in Canada, so called, not merged in nor associated with the United Church of Canada)\u201d, or in other words to the two designated funds of the Presbyterian Church in Canada as it now exists and functions. The decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia must be taken, so far as that court is concerned, to have been conclusive of the whole action and the questions for the determination of which it was brought, not only as between the Presbyterian Church in Canada and The United Church of Canada, but as between either of these churches and the residuary legatees and next of kin. It excludes the residuary legatees and next of kin of the testatrix, so far as these bequests are concerned, just as conclusively as it excludes The United Church\u2014precisely as it would have excluded both the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the residuary legatees and next of kin had the decision been in favour of The United Church. Leave to appeal from this judgment to this Court was granted only to The United Church of Canada, which is the only appellant here represented, though Isabella Munro, one of more than twenty nieces and nephews, named as residuary legatees in the will, appealed in her own behalf from the judgment of Graham, J., to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, as well as The United Church, and was heard by separate counsel before that Court. The sole question, therefore, for determination before this Court on the present appeal is as to whether the appellant, The United Church of Canada, is itself entitled to the bequests, which the testatrix made to the Home and Foreign Mission Funds of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. This question having been decided against the appellant in accordance with the decision in the Tatamagouche case[7], and no appeal having been taken from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc by either the executors of the will or any of the residuary legatees or next of kin, who were content to accept that judgment, it cannot now, in my opinion, be disturbed on this appeal at the instance of a body which could have no possible concern with any controversy, if there were any, between the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the executors of the will or any of the residuary legatees or next of kin.\nThe fact that The United Church of Canada Act carried or purported to carry into the new church corporation thereby constituted the \u201cBoard of the Presbyterian College, Halifax,\u201d or any other holding corporation, which had previously been charged with the administration of the property and moneys given or bequeathed to the Home and Foreign Mission Funds of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as the latter church formerly existed and functioned, and that this particular Board or any other holding corporation still existed at the time of the death of the testatrix in September, 1929, for the purpose of administering, not the Home and Foreign Mission Funds of the Presbyterian Church in Canada as formerly, but the Home and Foreign Mission Funds of the newly constituted United Church of Canada, manifestly could not bring the latter funds within the description of the former, as used in the will, unless the Presbyterian Church in Canada itself continued to exist within the new church corporation as formerly without loss of its identity. It comes back to the question of identity precisely as in case of a congregation of The United Church and a Presbyterian congregation in communion with the Presbyterian Church in Canada, as Smith, J., pointed out in delivering the judgment already referred to in Fraser v. McLellan[8], in considering the $100 bequest to \u201cThe Trustees of the Tatamagouche Presbyterian Church.\u201d He said:\nThe bequest of $100, therefore, is to a corporation which, perhaps, continues to exist, but it is nevertheless necessary to consider, even if that be so, whether or not it is a corporation for carrying into effect the object that the testatrix had in view, namely, to hold or expend the bequest for the benefit of the \u201cPresbyterian Church at Tatamagouche.\u201d It would seem that the same principle should be applied as in the case of the other bequest.\nThe church or congregation there described had become a church or congregation of The United Church of Canada. The clear ground of the decision was that The United Church of Canada did not answer the description of the Presbyterian Church in Canada as the latter church existed before The United Church of Canada Act came into effect.\nWe are not called upon to consider and consequently express no opinion as to whether the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is right or wrong as between the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the residuary legatees or next of kin.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Held: (1) A conclusive answer was found in the terms of s. 65 (1) of the Prince Edward Island Highway Traffic Act (placing the onus of proof that the damage \" did not arise through\" the negligence of the owner or driver upon the owner or driver); the submission of the question to the jury would have been irrelevant and futile; the most a finding of contributory negligence could have proved would be that the injury was not entirely or solely caused by S.'s negligence, and this would not have been enough to discharge the onus imposed by s. 65 (1) (the construction and effect of s. 65 (1), and its application with regard to a finding of contributory negligence, discussed). (2) On the evidence such finding could not reasonably have been made. (3) Although contributory negligence had been pleaded, yet, at the trial, the whole defence was that said car was not the one which struck the plaintiff, that it was elsewhere at the time of the accident, and there was no suggestion of reliance upon the question of contributory negligence nor any request to direct the jury upon it; therefore appellant could not now complain of non-direction to the jury upon it.\nIn s. 65 (2) of said Act (providing that, in an action for damage sustained by reason of a motor vehicle upon a highway, a person driving it with the consent, expressed or implied, of the owner, \"shall be deemed to be\" the agent or servant of the owner and to be employed as such and \" shall be deemed to be\" driving it in the course of his employment) the words \"shall be deemed to be\" must be construed as creating a conclusive, not a rebuttable, presumption. APPEAL (by special leave granted by the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc) from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc ([1]) dismissing (on equal division of the court) the present appellant's appeal from the judgment of Saunders J., upon the verdict of a jury, that the plaintiff (respondent) recover the sum of $1,500 against the defendants in the action.\nThe action was against one Sentner and the present appellant company for damages for injury caused to the plaintiff by being struck by a motor car, alleged by the plaintiff to have been driven by the defendant Sentner (whose negligent driving was alleged to have caused the accident) and to have been owned by the defendant company (the present appellant).\nThe material facts of the case and questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nT. A. Campbell K.C. and D. L. Mathieson for the appellant.\nJ. J. Johnston K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket, J.\u2014This is a running down case which was tried in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island before Mr. Justice Saunders and a jury.\nThe respondent, McNally, a fireman in the employ of the Canadian National Railways, was driving his own auto mobile to Kensington on the night of July 13, 1932, accompanied by a Mr. and Mrs. Paquet and a girl friend of the latter. When approaching the town his left rear tire went down. He pulled over to his right side of the road, stopped his car close to the ditch, dimmed his headlights and got out with Paquet to replace the injured tire. Paquet went be hind the car to jack up the rear axle while McNally proceeded to remove the nuts on the rear left wheel. While so engaged another car came along from the direction of the town at a high rate of speed and ran down and demolished a horse drawn unlighted wagon proceeding in the same direction on the other side of the road a few feet ahead of the parked car. After smashing the wagon the running down car careened across the road; struck McNally, threw him forward into the gutter and proceeded on its way until it disappeared in the darkness and fog which prevailed at the time, without its identity being recognized by any of the persons left at the scene of the accident.\nMcNally was found lying on his back unconscious. One of his arms and five ribs were broken and he suffered other injuries, which confined him to a hospital for over two months and incapacitated him for his employment for over six months.\nSubsequent investigation having revealed the fact that a young man named Sentner had borrowed a used Ford coach from the appellant company at Charlottetown, had driven the borrowed car to Kensington with two other men to attend a public dance on the night of the accident and had run down a wagon at the same place while driving out of Kensington with his two companions with whom he had been drinking, the respondent brought this action against Sentner as the driver and the appellant as the owner of the car which had caused his injuries, to recover damages for these injuries and the loss of wages resulting therefrom.\nS. 65 (1) of the Prince Edward Island Highway Traffic Act provides:\u2014\nWhen loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle upon a highway the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver shall be upon the owner or driver.\nAnd s. 65 (2):\u2014\nIn an action for the recovery of loss or damage sustained by a person by reason of a motor vehicle upon a highway, every person driving such motor vehicle who is living with and as a member of the family of the owner thereof and every person driving such motor vehicle with the con sent, expressed or implied, of the owner thereof shall be deemed to be the agent or servant of the owner of such motor vehicle and to be employed as such and shall be deemed to be driving such motor vehicle in the course of his employment, but nothing in this sub-section shall relieve any person deemed to be the agent or servant of the owner and to be driving such motor vehicle in the course of his employment from the liability of such damages.\nIn virtue of these statutory provisions it was only necessary for the plaintiff, in order to maintain his action against both defendants, to prove that his injuries were caused up- on a highway by a motor vehicle of which the appellant was owner and which Sentner was driving at the time with the appellant's consent. It was then for the defendants to prove that McNally's injuries did not arise from the negligence or improper conduct of Sentner. No serious question seems to have been raised on the trial as to the appellant's ownership of the Ford coach which Sentner drove to Kensington on the night in question, or as to his having obtained the appellant's permission to use it for that purpose, so that practically the whole issue in controversy between the parties on the trial, as it was con ducted, was as to whether this was the car which had struck McNally.\nThe learned trial Judge directed the jury that this was the crucial point in the case and summed up very clearly and completely the evidence of Sentner and all other de fence witnesses which had been adduced in an effort to prove that, notwithstanding the undisputed fact that he had run down a wagon in the same locality on the night in question and continued on his way without stopping, there was no other car parked on the roadside opposite the wagon at the time and that he had neither struck McNally nor in any manner come in contact with his car. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff against both defendants, assessing the damages at $1,500.\nThe defendant, Poole & Thompson, Limited, moved the Court en banc to set aside the verdict against it and enter judgment in its favour. Sentner did not join in this motion, which was heard before Chief Justice Mathieson and Mr. Justice Arsenault, the main grounds argued being that there was not sufficient evidence of the identity of the car to reasonably warrant the verdict, that the appellant was not legally liable for the damage upon a proper construction of s. 65(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, and that there was evidence of contributory negligence and the learned trial Judge had not instructed the jury upon this question.\nThe learned Chief Justice held, as to the evidence concerning the identity of the car, that there was nothing on this ground to support the verdict but conjecture, and was of opinion also that the evidence established contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which would debar him from recovering. For these two reasons he thought the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for both defendants.\nMr. Justice Arsenault, on the other hand, held that there was sufficient evidence of the identity of the car to support the verdict and no evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which would have justified the learned trial Judge in leaving that question to the jury, even had counsel representing the defendants separately not failed, as they did, to request that he do so. His Lordship fully discussed the construction of s. 65(2) of the Highway Traffic Act, which the learned Chief Justice in his view of the case had not considered it necessary to do, and held that its effect was to render the appellant liable for any damage which Sentner had caused while driving its car, even though he may not in point of fact have been driving the car as its agent or servant in the usual sense of these words. He, therefore, held that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe result of this division of opinion was that the verdict of the jury and the trial judgment entered thereon stood.\nThe Supreme Court of the Province having granted special leave to appeal to this Court, we are now called upon to pronounce upon substantially the same questions as those argued in the provincial Court en banc.\nAfter as careful an examination of the two opposing judgments as I have been able to make and of all the relevant evidence to which we have been referred on the question of the identification of the motor car that struck the plaintiff, I feel bound to say that I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Arsenault that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the verdict for the respondent upon this question\u2014the only issue the jury was required to determine.\nIt was an issue upon which the jury might well enough have found either way upon a consideration of the whole evidence, and depending in its final analysis upon the credibility of Sentner's story that, although he had run down and smashed the wagon and continued on his way without stopping, he did not strike the plaintiff's or any other car, and that no car was parked at the time at or near the spot where he had run down the wagon. Much stress was laid upon the fact that no marks were found on the borrowed car after it was returned to the appellant's garage to indicate that it had been damaged in any way on its left side, though its front iron bumper had been broken and removed and laid inside the car. The defence sought to account for the breaking of the bumper by the fact that it had been welded and that the impact with the wagon was sufficient to break it. The bumper, however, was not broken at the weld, and, as there was indisputable testimony that the rear bumperette on the McNally car had been caught and bent straight back on its left side, breaking the iron arm by which it was attached to the frame of the car, and also that the running down car was, immediately after passing the McNally car, ob served to be throwing up gravel and heard to be making a clicking noise as it passed over the railway crossing a short distance beyond and Sentner himself admitted that he had afterwards been held up by its dragging and finally catching behind the front wheel, the probability would seem to lie on the side of the inference that it was broken by striking the rear bumperette of the McNally car rather than by striking the rear wheels of a light wooden carriage, as contended. If there were nothing else I should think that this evidence alone would have afforded abundant justification for the jury's verdict.\nWith regard to the contention that there was evidence of contributory negligence as to which the learned trial Judge should have instructed the jury, it seems to me a conclusive answer to it is found in the terms of s. 65(1) of the Highway Traffic Act above quoted.\nThat enactment, as the present Chief Justice of this Court (then Duff, J.), construing an identically similar section in the Manitoba Motor Vehicle Act in Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel ([2]), clearly pointed out, creates against the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, by reason of which loss or damage has been proved to have been sustained by any person upon a highway, a rebuttable presumption of negligence, which must be disproved before either can escape liability therefor. The presumption thus created can be rebutted only by proof that the injury claimed for \"did not arise through the negligence or improper con duct of the owner or driver.\" The onus of proving that fact is explicitly placed on the owner or driver. The result is that, once it is proved in any action that the plaintiff was in fact injured upon a highway by a motor vehicle, he is, under the provisions of s. 65(1), entitled to judgment against the driver, at least, of the motor vehicle by which he was so injured if upon the whole case there is no such evidence as would reasonably warrant a finding that the injury did not arise through the driver's negligence or improper conduct.\nApplying the enactment in this sense to the case at bar, what would have been the result if the question of contributory negligence had been submitted to the jury and the jury had found that there had been some negligence on the part of the plaintiff which materially contributed to cause the injury? Would such a finding have established the fact that the plaintiff's injury did not arise through Sentner's negligence or improper conduct within the meaning of s. 65(1)? It would assuredly not have established that there was no negligence or improper conduct on the part of Sentner which contributed to cause the injury. On the contrary, it would have established that the injury was caused in part by the negligence of the plaintiff and in part by the negligence of Sentner, or, in other words, that the real proximate and direct cause of the injury was the combined negligence of the two and that neither could by the exercise of due care have avoided it. The most a finding of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff could be said to prove, had such a finding been made, would be that the injury was not entirely or solely caused by Sentner's negligence or misconduct. This in my opinion would not have been enough to discharge the onus stated in the subsection. Proof that his negligence or improper conduct did not entirely or solely cause the injury claimed for, is not proof that the injury \"did not arise through\" his negligence or improper conduct, which is the fact the subsection explicitly enacts must be proved in order to rebut the statutory presumption which it creates, unless indeed these controlling words of the subsection are construed to mean \"did not entirely or solely arise through\" the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver. I cannot think, having regard to the reason and purpose of the enactment and the context in which the words are used, that they are reasonably capable of any such con- struction. The submission of the question of contributory negligence to the jury would, therefore, have been quite irrelevant and futile.\nApart from this consideration, however, I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Arsenault that in the circum stances disclosed by the whole evidence a finding of contributory negligence could not reasonably have been made against the plaintiff.\nAnother consideration which, I think, would completely dispose of this ground of appeal is that, notwithstanding both defendants in their separate statements of defence pleaded contributory negligence, the whole defence on the trial was in reality an alibi: that the Sentner car was not near the scene of the accident when McNally was injured, but in Kensington. Their counsel accordingly did not suggest at any stage of the trial that they were relying in any way upon the question of contributory negligence and made no request to the learned Judge to give any direction to the jury in reference to it. Having thus themselves to all intents and purposes abandoned that plea, they surely cannot now be heard to complain that the learned trial Judge should have directed the jury upon it.\nAs to the contention that the words \"shall be deemed to be,\" as used in s. 65(2), should be construed as creating only a rebuttable and not a conclusive presumption, I am of opinion that they must be construed in the latter sense. It is manifest from the whole language of this subsection that the intention of the Legislature was to make every owner of a motor vehicle responsible for any loss or damage resulting from its operation on a highway, provided that such loss or damage occur while it is being driven by a person with his consent, express or implied. To give the words \"shall be deemed to be\" only a prima facie effect, as if the words \"until the contrary be shown\" immediately followed them, would defeat the clear intent of the section. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. L. Mathieson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. B.

Painton, [1894] P. 151, at 159-160.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe plaintiff (the present respondent) propounded for probate an alleged will of William Everton Wright, deceased, made on March 1, 1932. Objections were made to the granting of probate. The cause was removed from the Surrogate Court of the County of Essex into the Supreme Court of Ontario. The plaintiff sought to estab- lish the will. His action was dismissed by Raney J. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That court made an order that the costs of the trial and appeal be taxed, and that, upon payment by the defendants (other than one Barbara Brown, who was the main beneficiary under the will and was, upon consent, made a party defendant by order of the Court of Appeal) to the plaintiff of the amount thereof within ten days after taxation, the judgment of Raney J. be set aside and a new trial be had, but, in default of such payment of costs being made, that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal be allowed and that it be declared that the will was well proved and ought to be established, and that probate be granted. From that judgment an appeal was brought to this Court.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions for determination are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Crocket J., now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nS.L. Springsteen for the appellants.\nJ.M. Baird K.C. for the Official Guardian (representing the infant, Wilda Yager), supporting the appeal.\nR.S. Rodd for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I entirely agree in the conclusions of my brother Crocket as well as in the reasons by which those conclusions are supported. My purpose in adding what I am now saying is merely to note that the law is well established and well known and that, as applicable to this appeal, it is best, as well as completely, stated in this passage from the judgment of Lord Davey (then Davey L.J.) in his judgment in Tyrrell v. Painton[1]:\n* * * the principle is, that wherever a will is prepared under circumstances which raise a well\u2011grounded suspicion that it does not express the mind of the testator, the Court ought not to pronounce in favour of it unless that suspicion is removed.\nCROCKET J. (Duff C.J., and Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Hughes JJ. concurring)\u2014This appeal arises out of a petition presented by the respondent Ferris in the Surrogate Court of the County of Essex, Ontario, for the granting to him, as the sole executor named therein, of probate of the alleged last will and testament of William E. Wright, deceased, late of the city of Windsor. Wright died on April 8, 1932, without issue, leaving surviving him as his nearest of kin his brother George Wright and the latter\u2019s daughter Wilda, who had been legally adopted a few weeks after her birth by the testator and his wife but had left the testator\u2019s home in the autumn of 1930, seven or eight months after her adopted mother\u2019s death, to pursue a nurse\u2019s training course when sixteen or seventeen years of age, and later\u2014in January, 1932\u2014while employed as a domestic servant, married a young man named Yager in the State of Michigan. The will, of which the respondent sought probate, was executed on March 1, 1932, presumably when Wright was unaware of Wilda\u2019s marriage, and left or purported to leave all his real and personal estate, valued by the executor at $6,000 real and $330 personal property, to one Barbara Brown, of the City of Detroit, in the State of Michigan, described therein as the testator\u2019s cousin, subject to the payment of a legacy of $500 to his \u201cadopted daughter Wilda Norena Wright, of Windsor, Ontario.\u201d On February 20, 1930, a few weeks after his wife\u2019s death, Wright executed a will leaving a duplex house and lot on Hall Ave., which was subject to a mortgage for $5,820, to two of his deceased wife\u2019s sisters, Leah Riach and Etha Riach, share and share alike, and the entire residue of his estate, real and personal, to his said adopted daughter, Wilda Norena Wright, provided she should live to attain the age of twenty-one years, and, in the event of her not doing so, leaving all to the said Leach Riach and Etha Riach in equal shares. On July 27, 1931, he made a second will, revoking that of February 20, 1930, and leaving his whole estate to Leah Riach and Etha Riach in equal shares, subject to the payment of a legacy to his adopted daughter of $200.\nThe Misses Riach entered a caveat objecting to the probate of the will of March 1, 1932, on the ground of mental incapacity on the part of the testator and undue influence and fraud on the part of Barbara Brown. The usual citations having been issued, the proceedings were removed, on the respondent\u2019s application, from the Surrogate Court to the Supreme Court for trial. The removal order directed that the respondent be made plaintiff and the four appellants defendants in the action, but Miss Brown, the principal beneficiary, was omitted as a party.\nThe action was tried before the late Mr. Justice Raney, who refused to order the will to probate and dismissed the action with costs.\nAt the opening of the hearing before the Court of Appeal for Ontario of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the trial judgment, attention having been called to the omission of the principal beneficiary as a party to the action, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that he appeared for her as well as for the executor, and consented that an order should be made adding Miss Brown as a party defendant as though she had originally been made a party by the removal order. The appeal was then argued, and, though the argument seems to have occupied three days, judgment was pronounced instanter at its conclusion, so that we have before us only the formal order of the court without any of the reasons therefor. By the formal order Miss Brown was directed to be added a party defendant as though she had been declared to be one originally in the removal order; the costs of the trial and of the appeal were directed to be taxed and upon payment thereof by the defendants, other than Miss Brown, to the plaintiff within ten days after taxation, the trial judgment was ordered to be set aside and a new trial held; otherwise the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was to be allowed and the will of March 1, 1932, declared to be well proved, with a direction to the proper court to grant probate thereof to the plaintiff as the executor named therein, with costs of the trial and of the appeal to be paid by the defendants, other than Miss Brown, to the plaintiff forthwith. From this judgment the appellants now appeal to this Court.\nIt is quite apparent from his written opinion that the learned trial judge\u2019s refusal to admit the impugned will to probate was entirely grounded upon the fact that the evidence for the defence had raised in his mind some suspicion as to the genuineness of the will and that the plaintiff had failed to discharge the onus which His Lordship held rested upon him to remove such suspicion under the authority of the two rules laid down by Baron Parke in Barry v. Butlin[2], as expounded in Fulton v. Andrew[3], and in Tyrrell v. Painton[4]. Though he does not precisely state what this suspicion was, the last two paragraphs of his reasons for judgment clearly indicate that it entirely concerned the conduct of the beneficiary, Miss Brown, and the question of the exercise of undue influence and fraud by her, as alleged in the statement of defence. Notwithstanding His Lordship\u2019s statement that the question he was discussing was not the question of the proof of undue influence but the question of judicial suspicion, within the language of Lord Lindley, as quoted by him from Tyrrell v. Painton[5], he immediately adds:\u2014\nSuch a suspicion having been raised by the evidence for the defence, the onus was upon the plaintiff to remove it. The plaintiff did not discharge that onus.\nIf Miss Brown had taken the witness stand she might have admitted the truth of all the items in the evidence which went to raise suspicion in the mind of the Court, and yet she might conceivably have convinced the Court that there was no fraud or coercion on her part within the definition of undue influence. She might, for instance, have convinced the Court that everything she did was within the limits of legitimate persuasion. But the executor Plaintiff\u2014and I must assume Miss Brown concurring\u2014preferred to leave the judicial suspicion where the evidence for the defence left it. They must take the consequences.\nNot only does His Lordship here distinctly state that the suspicion he entertained had been raised by the evidence for the defence, but he quite as distinctly says that had Miss Brown taken the witness stand she might have admitted the truth of all the items in that evidence which went to raise that suspicion and yet have convinced him that everything she did was within the limits of legitimate persuasion, but that the plaintiff and Miss Brown had chosen to leave that suspicion where the evidence for the defence left it and that they must therefore take the consequences. No finding is made one way or the other, either upon the issue as to Wright\u2019s testamentary capacity at the time of the execution of the will or as to the question of his having actually comprehended what he was doing when he did execute it. Neither is any finding made one way or the other as to the question of the testator having executed the will with full knowledge and appreciation of its contents and effect but as the result of the exercise upon him of undue influence or fraud by or in behalf of Miss Brown.\nThe soundness, therefore, of the trial judgment turns entirely upon the question of the onus probandi and the validity of the learned trial judge\u2019s obvious assumption that under the three cases above cited the burden lay upon the plaintiff, not only to prove that Wright was of sound and disposing mind and memory and actually comprehended what he was doing when he executed the will, but to prove, as well, that he was not induced to execute it by undue influence or fraud.\nAfter reviewing what he regarded as the salient facts of the case and stating that the facts as found by him brought the case within the principle of the rules laid down by Baron Parke in Barry v. Butlin[6], His Lordship quotes these rules as follows:\u2014\n(1) The onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will; and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator, and\n(2) If a party writes or prepares a will, under which he takes a benefit, that is a circumstance that ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court, and calls upon it to be vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument, in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed, and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased.\nThen he quotes the dictum of Lord Hatherley, regarding Baron Parke\u2019s second rule, from Fulton v. Andrew[7] as follows:\u2014\nThere is one rule which has always been laid down by the Courts having to deal with wills, and that is, that a person who is instrumental in the framing of a will, * * * and who obtains a bounty by that will, is placed in a different position from other ordinary legatees who are not called upon to substantiate the truth and honesty of the transaction as regards their legacies. * * * But there is a farther onus upon those who take for their own benefit, after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown upon them the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\nand adds that these\nrules of law have since been observed in a line of cases of the highest authority. And under later cases there has been a further expansion, so that, as pointed out by Lord Justice Lindley in Tyrrell v. Painton[8], \u201cThe rule in Barry v. Butlin[9] is not confined to the single case in which a will is prepared by or on the instructions of the person taking large benefits under it, but extends to all cases in which circumstances exist which excite the suspicion of the Court; and wherever such circumstances exist and whatever their nature may be it is for those who propound the will to remove such suspicion.\u201d\nIt will be observed that in neither of Baron Parke\u2019s two rules nor in neither of the respective dicta of Lord Hatherley and Lindley, L.J., as quoted, is there any specific mention of the question of procuring the execution of a will by fraud or misrepresentation or undue influence of any kind, and that, apart from Lord Hatherley\u2019s statement regarding the throwing upon those who take for their own benefit, after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will, the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction, the only expressions which can be relied upon to support the proposition that the onus resting upon a party propounding a will includes the negativing of undue influence, in a case where circumstances exist which create suspicion, are the expressions \u201cthat the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator,\u201d and \u201cthat the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased.\u201d Both these expressions no doubt imply, not only that the testator was of sound and disposing mind and memory at the time he executed the will, but that he actually comprehended what he was doing when he executed it. Though it may be that they on their face comprise freedom from fraud and duress, we do not think that the three cases from which His Lordship quoted can properly be said to establish the principle that the onus probandi resting upon a party propounding a will for probate extends in all cases, where circumstances of suspicion are disclosed, to the disproof or negativing of an allegation or suspicion of undue influence or fraud. For instance, Baron Parke himself says in Barry v. Butlin[10]:\nThe strict meaning of the term onus probandi is this, that if no evidence is given by the party on whom the burthen is cast, the issue must be found against him. In all cases the onus is imposed on the party propounding a will. It is in general discharged by proof of capacity and the fact of execution, from which the knowledge of and assent to the contents of the instrument are assumed, and it cannot be that the simple fact of the party who prepared the will being himself a legatee is in every case and under all circumstances to create a contrary presumption and to call upon the Court to pronounce against the will unless additional evidence is produced to prove the knowledge of its contents by the deceased.\nAnd, again:\u2014\nAll that can be truly said is, that if a person, whether attorney or not, prepares a will with a legacy to himself, it is, at most, a suspicious circumstance, of more or less weight, according to the facts of each particular case; in some of no weight at all, as in the case suggested, varying according to circumstances; for instance, the quantum of the legacy, and the proportion it bears to the property disposed of, and numerous other contingencies; but in no case amounting to more than a circumstance of suspicion, demanding the vigilant care and circumspection of the Court in investigating the case, and calling upon it not to grant probate without full and entire satisfaction that the instrument did express the real intentions of the deceased.\nAnd, after reviewing the salient facts:\u2014\nWe think, therefore, on the whole, that the evidence of the factum, coupled with the strong probabilities of the case, is sufficient to remove the suspicions which naturally belong to the case of all wills prepared by persons in their own favour, especially when made by persons of weak capacity. The undue influence and the importunity which, if they are to defeat a will, must be of the nature of fraud or duress, exercised on a mind in a state of debility, are insinuated but not proved.\nWhitehead\u2019s [one of the beneficiaries] authority and power over his master [the testator] is, no doubt, sufficiently established; but that such authority and power were in any way exercised to procure this will to be made is only conjecture; and there is nothing like proof of authority or control of any kind on the part of Butlin or Percy [the other two beneficiaries].\nFulton v. Andrew[11], notwithstanding the oft quoted dictum of Lord Hatherley, will be found to be of practically the same effect when the complete exposition of that case by Lord Chancellor Cairns and the other law lords taking part is closely examined. That was a case, where a jury had found that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will generally, but that he did not know and approve of the contents of the residuary clause, by which, after a number of bequests to relatives and friends, the residue was left to the two executors, both of whom had been instrumental in the framing of the will, and with reference to which there was a discrepancy between the instructions for the will and the will itself. It was contended that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury upon the latter issue in telling them that they were to take this discrepancy into consideration and, having done so, to determine whether the testator had known and understood the residuary clause; that he ought to have told them that they ought to consider simply whether the testator at the time of executing his will was unconscious of and did not approve of the residuary clause owing to mental prostration as alleged in the defendant\u2019s particulars. The Judge of the Court of Probate, who had directed that the two questions of fact indicated and others, which are not now relevant, should be tried by a jury at the Assizes, made absolute a rule to enter the verdict for the propounders of the will, and granted probate of the whole will. It was ordered, on appeal to the House of Lords, that probate of the will should be recalled and another order made granting fresh probate of the will, omitting the residuary clause. The decision turned entirely on two questions: 1st, whether, where a will is read over to or by a testator of sound and disposing mind and memory, and he duly executes it, it must be taken that he knew and approved of its contents; and, 2nd, whether with respect to the finding on the residuary clause it was contrary to the evidence. It had been contended that an absolute and fixed rule of law had been established by a series of cases that proof of the reading of a will by or to a competent testator and his execution thereof was always conclusive of knowledge and approval of its contents, and that no evidence against that presumption could be received. Lord Cairns said, as to this, that he thought\nit would be greatly to be deprecated that any positive rule as to dealing with a question of fact should be laid down, * * * unless the Legislature has, in the shape of an Act of Parliament, distinctly imposed that rule.\nAfter citing Baron Parke\u2019s dictum containing the two rules above set forth, he quoted from Lord Penzance\u2019s charges to the jury in Atter v. Atkinson[12], and Guardhouse v. Blackburn[13]. In the first of these cases Lord Penzance said to the jury:\u2014\nOnce get the facts admitted or proved that a testator is capable, that there is no fraud, that the will was read over to him, and that he put his hand to it, and the question whether he knew and approved of the contents is answered. Commenting upon Lord Penzance\u2019s qualification that there must be no fraud, Lord Cairns says:\u2014\nIf Your Lordships find a case in which persons who are strangers to the testator, who have no claim upon his bounty, have themselves prepared, for their own benefit, a will disposing in their favour of a large portion of the property of the testator; and if you submit that case to a jury, it may well be that the jury may consider that there was a want, on the part of those who propounded the will, of the execution of the duty which lay upon them, to bring home to the mind of the testator the effect of his testamentary act; and that that failure in performing the duty which lay upon them, amounted to a greater or less degree of fraud on their part. The qualification of Lord Penzance in the charge I have read may entirely apply to such a case.\nAmong the statements quoted from the charge in Guardhouse v. Blackburn[14] are the following:\u2014\nAlthough the testator knew and approved the contents, the paper may still be rejected on proof establishing beyond all possibility of mistake that he did not intend the paper to operate as a will.\nAlthough the testator did know and approve the contents, the paper may be refused probate if it be proved that any fraud has been purposely practised on the testator in obtaining his execution thereof.\nSubject to this last preceding proposition, the fact that the will has been duly read over to a capable testator on the occasion of its execution, or that its contents have been brought to his notice in any other way, should, when coupled with his execution thereof, be held conclusive evidence that he approved as well as knew the contents thereof.\nRegarding these directions Lord Cairns says:\u2014\nIt appears to me that, consistently with the rules mentioned by Lord Penzance, the jurors here may not have been satisfied that there was a proper reading of the will to the testator, or may have been satisfied, after hearing all the facts submitted to him by Mr. Justice Mellor, that there was on the part of those who propounded the will such a dereliction of duty, such a failure of duty on their part, as amounted to that degree of fraud to which Lord Penzance refers in the rules I have mentioned.\nLords Chelmsford, Hatherley and O\u2019Hagan all entirely agreed with the Lord Chancellor\u2019s observations. Nothing, apart from the dictum of Lord Hatherley, is to be found in the entire report of this case to support the proposition that any further onus lies upon a party propounding a will for probate, than to satisfy the court that the testator was of sound and disposing mind and memory and that he knew and approved of its contents when executing it. There is no suggestion anywhere in the Lord Chancellor\u2019s speech that, once it appears that a competent testator formally executed a will with full knowledge of its con- tents, the party propounding it must also prove that he was not induced to execute it by any undue influence or fraud. The whole report of the case points quite the other way. Lord Hatherley himself, who fully concurred, as stated, in all the Lord Chancellor had said, added the following observation:\u2014\nOne is strongly impressed with the consideration that, according to the natural habits and conduct of men in general, if a man signs any instrument, he being competent to understand that instrument, and having had it read over to him, there is a very strong presumption that it has been duly executed, and that very strong evidence is required in opposition to it in order to set aside any instrument so executed.\nThat portion of Lord Justice Lindley\u2019s dictum in Tyrrell v. Painton[15], which is above quoted, may perhaps well bear the construction, which the learned trial judge has placed upon it. When, however, it is considered in the light of the language immediately following, it will be seen that what this eminent Lord Justice of Appeal had in his mind, when he spoke of the onus lying upon those who propounded the will \u201cto remove such suspicion,\u201d was the suspicion that the testator did not know and approve the contents of the will. His words are:\u2014\nto remove such suspicion, and to prove affirmatively that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the document, and it is only where this is done that the onus is thrown on those who oppose the will to prove fraud or undue influence, or whatever else they rely on to displace the case made for proving the will.\nClearly there is no suggestion in this dictum, when considered in its entirety, that any further onus lies upon a party propounding a will than to prove the testamentary capacity of the deceased and that when the testator executed the instrument he fully realized what he was doing. The dictum, of course, assumes that all the formalities required by law have been duly complied with. Indeed, it is as positively stated as it could well be that, once it is affirmatively proved that the testator, being, of course, of sound and disposing mind and memory, did know and approve of the contents of the will, the onus is placed on those who oppose its admission to probate to prove that, notwithstanding the fact that the testator fully knew and appreciated what he was doing when he executed the will, he was induced to do so by some fraud or undue influence having been practised upon him. Moreover, in another passage of his reported opinion he says:\u2014\nNow, in my opinion, this will of the 9th [which the defendants were propounding in their counter-claim as the true last will of the deceased] was executed under such suspicious circumstances that he [the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, before whom the trial took place] ought to have said: \u201cDo the defendants affirmatively establish to my satisfaction that the testatrix knew what she was doing when she executed this will?\nThe President, he pointed out, had only addressed himself to the question of fraud and held that the burden of proving that lay on the plaintiff (the party opposing the will) and that he had not discharged himself of that burden, so that in that case, as in the case at bar, there was no finding as to whether the testatrix knew what she was doing when she executed the will, though in the case cited the trial judge held that fraud had not been proved, while in the present case the trial judge, as already pointed out, makes no finding one way or the other upon either question. Had the Tyrrell case been tried by a jury, Lord Justice Lindley adds:\u2014\nThe question for the jury would be, did the testatrix know and approve of that will, and the jury should be told that it was for J. Painton [the defendant who sought its admission to probate] to prove that she did.\nAssuming that in the case in behalf of a plaintiff seeking to establish the validity of a will, there may be such circumstances of apparent coercion or fraud disclosed as, coupled with the testator\u2019s physical and mental debility, raise a well-grounded suspicion in the mind of the court that the testator did not really comprehend what he was doing when he executed the will, and that in such a case it is for the plaintiff to remove that suspicion by affirmatively proving that the testator did in truth appreciate the effect of what he was doing, there is no question that, once this latter fact is proved, the onus entirely lies upon those impugning the will to affirmatively prove that its execution was procured by the practice of some undue influence or fraud upon the testator. This, it seems to me, is the real effect of the three cases upon which the learned trial judge relied, and is precisely the principle stated by Lord Chancellor Cranworth in Boyse v. Rosborough[16], and distinctly approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Craig v. Lamoureux[17], in which latter case the judgment of the majority of this Court (Fitzpatrick, C.J., dissenting)[18], in which Barry v. Butlin[19], Fulton v. Andrew[20] and Tyrrell v. Painton[21] were all considered, was reversed. The exact language of the Lord Chancellor in stating this principle in Boyse v. Rosborough16 is set out in the syllabus of the Privy Council\u2019s decision in Craig v. Lamoureux17 as follows:\u2014\nWhen once it is proved that a will has been executed with due solemnities by a person of competent understanding, and apparently a free agent, the burden of proving that it was executed under undue influence rests on the person who so alleges.\nThis point Lord Cranworth, in Boyse v. Rosborough16, said was beyond dispute, notwithstanding he had suggested that a will, which had been executed under coercion or the influence of fear or in consequence of impressions created in the testator\u2019s mind by fraudulent representations, could not in contemplation of law, though it might with strict metaphysical accuracy, be properly described as a true expression of the testator\u2019s will. It should perhaps be added that, in that case as in the present, undue influence was the point on which the defendants really relied on the trial and on the appeal, and that the deceased\u2019s alleged mental infirmity was put forward rather as tending to shew the probability that such influence might have been successfully exercised than as being such as would of itself invalidate the will.\nWhile the trial judge in the present case, as pointed out, made no specific finding that the testator did know what he was doing when he executed the will, it is perfectly clear from his review of the facts that he accepted without question the testimony of both the subscribing witnesses to the will\u2014Miss Burns and Mr. Taylor. Miss Burns was a stenographer who had been employed for 15 years in the office of Mr. Baker, a Windsor conveyancer, who did Wright\u2019s conveyancing business and who, it seems, had prepared his previous wills of February 20, 1930, and July 27, 1931. Wright, who had suffered for some months from high blood pressure and Bright\u2019s disease, became seriously ill late in December, 1931, and was confined to bed and under the care of Mrs. McLaughlin, a practical nurse, for five or six weeks until February 8. According to Mrs. McLaughlin\u2019s testimony, which the trial judge accepted, he had experienced frequent and various illusions during this period, and the learned trial judge found that his mental condition, when he was under Mrs. McLaughlin\u2019s care, was one of intermittent dementia. He recovered, however, from this acute illness and was able to be up and about more or less from the time Mrs. McLaughlin left until a day or two before his death. It appears that some time before Mrs. McLaughlin\u2019s employment Wright had consulted Baker about changing his will and communicated to him some instructions therefor, but that Baker had himself died while Wright was confined to bed. After his recovery from the illness referred to, some time in February, he went to Baker\u2019s office where Miss Burns was still employed, and requested her to draw a new will. Although after some hesitation she promised to do so, she decided, apparently after Wright had left her, to have the will drawn by a barrister, and arranged with Mr. Taylor, a practising barrister in Windsor, to draw it for him. She sent to him a written memorandum with the instructions she had taken from Wright. Mr. Taylor accordingly drafted the will for her and when it was ready brought it to her office for execution by Wright. He swore that he read the will over to Wright, whom he had not previously known, and that he seemed to understand it thoroughly\u2014as thoroughly as any testator that he ever drew a will for, and that he had not any idea at all that the man was ill; that he shewed no appearance whatever of any mental incapacity; that he was standing up all the time he was in the office and seemed absolutely intelligent; and that he had no hesitation whatever in saying he knew exactly what he was talking about. Miss Burns corroborated Mr. Taylor\u2019s statement as to the reading over of the will and as to the filling in by Mr. Taylor in her and Wright\u2019s presence of a blank which had been left in the typewritten copy as prepared by Mr. Taylor for the name of the executor. An examination of the original will itself confirms Miss Burns\u2019 testimony as to the latter fact. In addition to the evidence of the two subscribing witnesses to the will, two physicians, who had attended Wright at different times, not only during the period when he was confined to bed in January and the early part of February, but afterwards, testified in the plaintiff\u2019s case that in their opinion Wright at all times when they saw him was of sound and disposing mind and memory\u2014fully capable of making a will. A local alienist, who had been called in to examine Wright at Mrs. McLaughlin\u2019s suggestion, after consultation with his attending physician and with a brother of the Misses Riach, and who had talked with Wright for over an hour, also testified that in his opinion Wright was perfectly sane.\nThe evidence of both attesting witnesses to the will and of these physicians having been accepted without question by the learned trial judge and there being nothing discoverable in the entire case to cast any well-grounded suspicion upon it, we are of opinion that it must be taken that Wright was of sound and disposing mind and memory when he executed the will of March 1st, and that he was fully aware of what he was doing when he did execute it, and that that will was consequently entitled to be admitted to probate, failing affirmative proof of the defendants\u2019 allegation that he was prevailed upon by fraud and undue influence on the part of Miss Brown to execute it.\nAs to this allegation we think that the evidence upon which the defendants relied to establish it is wholly insufficient to warrant an affirmative finding.\nFor these reasons the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Benjamin H.

Elliott (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nCanadian Credit Men\u2019s Trust Association, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1934: October 15; 1934: December 12.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket, Hughes and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nBankruptcy\u2014Trusts and trustees\u2014Real Property\u2014Person becoming registered owner of land, and making mortgage thereon (with covenant for payment), for benefit of company\u2014Transfer from him to company made but not registered\u2014Authorized assignment by company under Dominion Bankruptcy Act\u2014Indemnity claimed by registered owner (as trustee) against company\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy (as cestui que trust) against liabilities in connection with land and mortgage.\nW. Co. purchased lands in Winnipeg in the province of Manitoba, and title was taken in appellant\u2019s name. Appellant made a mortgage, for W. Co.\u2019s benefit, on part of the lands, with the usual covenant for payment. Appellant delivered to W. Co. transfers of the lands. These were not registered. In 1931 W. Co. made an authorized assignment under the Dominion Bankruptcy Act, and respondent was appointed trustee, and became possessed of the said transfers and of certain documents of title. The assignment was duly registered against the lands in the land titles office. On instructions from respondent\u2019s clerk (not authorized by the inspectors of the estate) to get title in respondent\u2019s name, respondent\u2019s solicitor (who did not then know that part of these lands was mortgaged) prepared a transfer direct (to save expense) from appellant to respondent, which was executed but was found objectionable in certain respects in the land titles office and was not registered, and respondent did not pursue this further. It offered to return the transfer. Respondent took over the management of the lands, collected rents, and paid thereout certain interest, taxes and insurance premiums. Appellant claimed that respondent had assumed the relation to appellant of cestui que trust and was bound to indemnify him against liabilities in connection with the trust property, including liability under appellant\u2019s mortgage covenant.\nHeld: The claim for indemnity failed. In view of respondent\u2019s position under the Bankruptcy Act (provisions of which were considered and discussed in this regard), the equitable rale as to a trustee\u2019s right to indemnity from a beneficial owner was not applicable to the case. Graham v. Edge, 20 Q.B.D. 683, cited. Hardoon v. Belilios, [1901] A.C. 118, and Castellan v. Hobson, L.R. 10 Eq. 47, distinguished.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 42 Man. R. 60, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing (Robson J.A. dissenting) his appeal from the judgment of Donovan J.[2] dismissing his action; in which action he claimed that he, as trustee, was entitled to be indemnified by the defendant, as cestui que trust, against liabilities to which the plaintiff was or might be subject in connection with certain lands, and particularly against his liability under a covenant in a certain mortgage which he had made on part of the said lands. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Hughes J. now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ. B. Coyne K.C. for the appellant.\nW. A. T. Sweatman K.C. for the respondent.\nDuff C.J.\u2014The general principle of equity is well known that a trustee is entitled to indemnity in respect of all expenses properly incurred in the execution of his trust. This right may always be enforced against the trust estate in respect of which he has incurred a debt or liability and in certain circumstances against the cestui que trust personally. It is only with this last mentioned right that we are concerned in this appeal.\nThe right to be indemnified by the creator of the trust, or by a third person, may arise either by the operation of the general equitable principle or from contract express or implied. The general principle is that when a trustee holds property in trust for an absolute beneficial owner, who is mi juris, the cestui que trust is bound to indemnify the trustee personally in respect of liabilities which arise from the mere fact of legal ownership. It is not material that the beneficiary did not create the trust or did not request the trustee to incur the liability. The question before us is whether these principles are applicable when the cestui que trust becomes bankrupt and his property passes by force of the statute to the trustee in bankruptcy.\nWe are not concerned with any question as to a charge upon the trust property for the amount of the debt or liability incurred or as to the right of the trustee to enforce his claim against the bankrupt estate as a creditor. The contention raised is that the trustee in bankruptcy is personally responsible just as any individual would be who had accepted a transfer of the trust property as purchaser from the cestui que trust.\nThe result of the bankruptcy is that the trustee\u2019s personal remedy against the bankrupt is suspended and he may lose it altogether. That involves a hardship, no doubt; but then, bankruptcy and insolvency usually do involve such hardships.\nAfter carefully considering Mr. Coyne\u2019s able and elaborate argument, my conclusion is that, the property of the bankrupt, vesting, as it does, by operation of law in the trustee in bankruptcy in his official capacity (who is declared by the statute to be \u201cin the same position as if he were a receiver of the property, appointed by the court,\u201d with the duty primarily of applying and distributing the property for the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors (pursuant to the statutory scheme)), effect cannot be given to the principle of equity in the manner contended for unless there is something in the statute expressly or impliedly requiring it. I find nothing having that effect.\nI think the reasoning of Lord Esher in Graham v. Edge[3] is in point.\nThese considerations apply mutatis mutandis to the contention that the trustee in bankruptcy is under a personal obligation to indemnify the appellant as transferee of the mortgaged property.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket, Hughes and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ. was delivered by\nHughes J.\u2014In the year 1906 R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, purchased lands in the city of Winnipeg. Title was taken in the name of the appellant who was the president and an important shareholder in the company. On April 3, 1907, $25,000 was borrowed to erect a building on part of the lands and a mortgage with the usual covenant for payment was made by the appellant. On September 18, 1912, the appellant delivered to R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, a transfer of the encumbered property and, on July 15, 1913, a transfer of the unencumbered property; and these transfers and a certified copy of the certificate of title to the encumbered property and a certificate of title to the unencumbered property were in the possession of R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, at the time of the authorized assignment hereinafter discussed and were turned over to the respondent. No payments of principal were made on the mortgage.\nOn February 16, 1931, the company made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act and on March 9, 1931, the respondent was appointed trustee. The assignment was duly registered against the real properties in the Land Titles Office. The respondent took over the management of the properties and paid certain interest, taxes and insurance premiums out of the rents as received. Shortly after the assignment a clerk of the respondent wrote the respondent\u2019s solicitors enclosing the above transfers, certificate of title and certified copy of certificate of title respectively, with instructions to put the titles in the name of the respondent, or, in the event of objection by the Land Titles Office, in the name of the respondent as trustee for R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited. The inspectors of the estate did not authorize these instructions. Mr. Richards, now the Honourable Mr. Justice Richards of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, was then head of the firm of solicitors acting for the respondent. He did not notice that the letter of instructions contained a certified copy only of one of the certificates of title and assumed that each property was clear of encumbrance. To save expense, Mr. Richards prepared a transfer covering both properties from the appellant directly to the respondent and did not register the transfers to R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited. The new transfer was then sent to the appellant\u2019s solicitor for execution and was returned duly executed. The Land Titles Office rejected the transfer because one parcel was encumbered, and because of some objection about the way in which the transferee was described. Mr. Richards then first knew that there was a mortgage on one of these properties. The respondent offered to return this transfer to the appellant. The trustee, of course, knew from the time of its appointment as trustee on or about March 9, 1931, that the appellant had executed the transfers to R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, that the transfers had not been registered and that one parcel comprising the west halves of lots three and four in block K on plan 16 was subject to a mortgage for $25,000 and interest. At the time of the trial the respondent had on hand from these properties $1,390 without deducting its collection charges.\nThe appellant brought this action against the respondent both in its personal and in its representative capacity for indemnity in full against all liabilities by reason of his alleged trusteeship for the respondent including his liability on the covenants of the mortgage on part of the lands.\nThe action was tried by the Honourable Mr. Justice Donovan and dismissed. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and the appeal was dismissed, the Honourable Mr. Justice Robson dissenting. From this judgment the appellant now appeals to this Court.\nThe appellant contends that, since the right and obligation of indemnity go with the relationship of trustee and cestui que trust and are part of it, when a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act succeeds as cestui que trust, his position is not different from that of any other cestui que trust; and that, if there is a difference, the burden falls on the cestuis que trustent of the trustee, namely, the estate. The appellant further contends that the respondent had an option whether it would or would not assume the relationship, but it assumed it by taking over the property and is bound by estoppel personally to indemnify the appellant.\nThe general principles of such indemnity are discussed in Hardoon v. Belilios[4]. The question raised on that appeal was whether the plaintiff, who was the registered holder of fifty shares in a banking company which was being wound up, was entitled to be indemnified by the defendant, who was the beneficial owner of the shares, against calls made upon the plaintiff in the winding-up of the banking company. The shares in question had been placed in the plaintiff\u2019s name by his employers, Benjamin & Kelly, who were share-brokers. The plaintiff never had any beneficial interest in the shares; but he was registered as their holder on April 3, 1891. A provisional certificate of his ownership was made out, and he signed a blank transfer of the shares, and the two documents were held by Benjamin & Kelly. The certificate and transfer afterwards came into the hands of one Coxon, who acted on behalf of a syndicate formed to speculate in the shares of another company. The defendant financed the syndicate and the provisional certificate and blank transfer of the shares were, with other securities, pledged by Coxon with the defendant as security for advances. In October, 1891, the plaintiff\u2019s provisional certificate was exchanged for an ordinary certificate which the defendant had in his possession at the commencement of the action. In March, 1892, dividends were paid on the shares. The defendant demanded and received these. The syndicate lost money and, in October, 1892, the defendant became the absolute owner of the shares. The judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was delivered by Lord Lindley. Their Lordships point out that the parties stood to one another in the position of trustee and cestui que trust and that the fact that the parties never stood in the relation of vendor and purchaser is immaterial. All that is necessary to establish the relation of trustee and cestui que trust is to prove that the legal title was in the plaintiff and the equitable title in the defendant. Justice requires that the cestui que trust, who gets all the benefit of the property, should bear its burden unless he can shew some good reason why his trustee should bear it himself. The obligation is equitable and not legal, and the legal decisions negativing it, unless there is some contract or custom imposing the obligation, are irrelevant. Where the only cestui que trust is a person sui juris, the right of the trustee to indemnity against liabilities incurred by him by his retention of the trust property has never been limited to the trust property; it extends further and imposes upon the cestui que trust a personal obligation enforceable in equity to indemnify his trustee. In the above case, their Lordships refer with approval to Balsh v. Hyham[5]. In that case, the trustee sought indemnity in equity, not against a liability incidental to the ownership of the trust property, but against a liability incurred by him by borrowing money at the request of and for the benefit of his cestui que trust. The court decided that the plaintiff was entitled to relief on the ground \u201cthat a cestui que trust ought to save his trustee harmless as to all damages relating to the trust.\u201d Lord Lindley points out in the Hardoon case[6] that this language, although open to criticism if applied to cestuis que trustent who are not sui juris and also sole beneficial owners, shews plainly enough that it was taken for granted as well settled that, speaking generally, absolute beneficial owners of property must in equity bear the burden incidental to its ownership. Their Lordships also refer with approval to In re The German Mining Co.; Ex parte Chippendale[7], a case where the shareholders of a mining company were held liable personally to indemnify the directors against payments made by the latter in discharge of debts contracted by them but which payments created no legal obligation on the company enforceable at law, and could not be recovered by the directors from the company by an action at common law. The fact that the defendant in Hardoon v. Belilios6 supra, did not create the trust on which the plaintiff held the shares when they were first placed in his name affords no defence to the defendant. Although the defendant did not create the trust, he accepted a transfer of the beneficial ownership of the shares, first as mortgagee and afterwards as sole beneficial owner, with full knowledge of the fact that they were registered in the plaintiff\u2019s name as trustee for the original purchasers. By the acceptance, the defendant became the plaintiff\u2019s cestui que trust. In the Hardoon case6, the Judicial Committee approve the language of James V.C. in Castellan v. Hobson[8]. In that case H had bought shares on the stock exchange. The name of B, who had consented to hold the shares was given as transferee. C, the original vendor, executed a transfer to B but, owing to the circumstances of the company, B could not be registered. It was held that H was liable to indemnify C for calls. James V.C. states that it is not a question of vendor and purchaser but a question of trustee and cestui que trust, and that the trustee was entitled to indemnify from the \u201creal equitable owner.\u201d\nIn Wise v. Perpetual Trustee Company[9], the Judicial Committee considered an appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which the point involved was whether trustees of a club who had incurred liability under onerous covenants in a lease were entitled to indemnity not only out of the club property to which their lien as trustees extended, but also against the appellant as a member of the club who with the other members, through the committee of management and otherwise, had so far assented to what had been done as to have become cestuis que trustent of the lessees. Their Lordships were satisfied that the relation of trustee and cestui que trust had been created. They refer, in their judgment, to the Hardoon case[10], and again point out that although the right of trustees to indemnity is recognized as well established in the simple case of a trustee and an adult cestui que trust, the principle by no means applies to all trusts, and it cannot be applied to cases in which the nature of the transaction excludes it. The appeal was, accordingly, allowed.\nIt is clear that when on the 9th day of November, 1906, the appellant, at the request of R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, took title to the lands in question in his name, the relationship of trustee and cestui que trust existed between the appellant and R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, and that, when he executed the mortgage for $25,000, he became entitled to indemnity in respect of the mortgage obligations from R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited. It is also clear that the relationship of trustee and cestui que trust existed between the appellant and R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited, at least down to September 18, 1912, in respect to the mortgaged parcel and to July 15, 1913, in respect to the unencumbered parcel, at which dates the appellant delivered transfers respectively to R. J. Whitla & Company, Limited. By these transfers the appellant purported to convey to the company all his estate and interest in the lands in question. After that, his position is not so clear. The appellant maintains that this transfer did not change the relationship and that the appellant still remained a trustee for the company, and refers us to the Real Property Act, R.S.M. 1913, ch. 171. Section 88 provides that every transfer, when registered, shall operate as an absolute transfer of all such right and title as the transferor had; but nothing contained in the section shall preclude any transfer from operating by way of estoppel. Section 97 provides that in every instrument transferring an estate or interest in land subject to mortgage under that system, there shall be implied a covenant by the transferee indemnifying the transferor against liability under the mortgage. Section 98 provides that a transfer shall, until registered, be deemed to confer on the person intended to take title a right or claim to registration.\nIt is now convenient to consider some of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 9 provides for a voluntary assignment by a debtor. Section 9, subsection 6, provides that upon the appointment of a trustee by the creditors, the Official Receiver shall complete the assignment by inserting as grantee the name of such trustee and that thereupon the assignment shall, subject to the claims of secured creditors, vest in the trustee all the property of the debtor. Section 9, subsection 7, provides that every assignment of property other than an authorized assignment made by an insolvent debtor for the general benefit of his creditors shall be null and void. Section 39 provides that the trustee shall in relation to acquiring and retaining possession of the property of the debtor be in the same position as if he were a receiver of the property appointed by the court. Section 40 provides that the trustee shall, on the making of a receiving order or an authorized assignment, forthwith insure and keep insured in his official name all the insurable property of the debtor. Section 43 provides that the trustee may, with the permission in writing of the inspectors, (a) sell, (aa) lease, ***(k) elect to retain for the whole or part of its unexpired term, or to assign or disclaim, any lease of or other temporary interest in any property forming part of the estate of the debtor. Section 104 provides that demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise or breach of trust, shall not be provable in bankruptcy; but, save as aforesaid, all debts and liabilities to which the debtor is subject at the date of the making of the authorized assignment shall be deemed to be debts provable in bankruptcy. The court shall value all contingent claims and after, but not before, such valuation, every such claim shall be deemed a proved debt to the amount of its valuation. Section 106 provides that if a secured creditor realizes his security, he may prove for the balance due to him after deducting the net amount realized. If he surrenders his security to the trustee, he may prove for his whole debt. Section 107 provides that a secured creditor who does not either realize or surrender his security may value his security and claim a dividend on the balance; and that the trustee may redeem the security at the assessed value. Section 113 provides that, subject to the provisions of section 107, no creditor shall receive more than one hundred cents on the dollar and interest. Section 120 provides that a creditor may prove for a debt not payable at the date of the authorized assignment as if it were payable presently and may receive dividends equally with the other creditors, deducting only an allowance for interest. Section 121 provides for priorities of claims. Section 123 provides that all ordinary debts shall be paid pari passu. Section 127 provides for the disallowance of claims by the trustee and for appeals to the court from such disallowances. Section 151 provides that where the debts of the bankrupt are paid in full, the court may annul the adjudication of bankruptcy and that, in such event, all acts of the trustee shall be valid, but the property of the debtor who was adjudged bankrupt shall vest in such person as the court may appoint or, in default of such appointment, revert to the debtor for all his estate or interest therein on such terms and subject to such conditions, if any, as the court may declare by order; and that, for the purposes of the section any debt disputed by a debtor shall be considered as paid in full if the debtor enters into a bond with approved securities to pay any amount recovered with costs. In view of the above provisions, it seems clear that the position of the respondent in the case at bar is somewhat analogous to the position of the official liquidators in Graham v. Edge[11]. In that case, an order having been made for the winding-up of an unregistered company under the Companies Act, 1862, the court directed under section 203 of the Act that certain land, vested in trustees for the company subject to a rent charge, should vest in the official liquidators appointed for the purposes of the winding-up. The plaintiffs were the owners of the rent charge upon the land. They sued the liquidators in their personal capacity to recover arrears of the rent charge from them as terre-tenants. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the action ought to be stayed as being manifestly groundless. In that case the liquidators held possession for five years and it was contended, as in the case at bar, that they had elected and were personally liable. Lord Esher points out that the power to appoint the official liquidators was given by section 92 of the Act which provided that the liquidators were appointed \u201cfor the purpose of conducting the proceedings in winding up a company and assisting the Court therein,\u201d and that section 203 provided that the court might direct that all property, real and personal, belonging to or vested in the company or to or in any person in trust for the company should vest in the official liquidators by his or their official name or names. Lord Esher then proceeds to say that the meaning is that the property shall vest in the official liquidator, not in his personal capacity, but in his official capacity as official liquidator appointed by the court to assist in the winding-up of the company. The contention of the plaintiff is dealt with that the position of the official liquidators was the same as that of a trustee in bankruptcy under the English statute, who had a power to disclaim onerous property. No such power existed in the official liquidators who, therefore, could not be personally liable on the ground of election. Lord Justice Bowen was of the same opinion. He said that it could not really be suggested that the defendants had done anything but submit to the operation of section 203 by which the property was vested in them in their official name; and that they were not clothed with the property in any capacity other than that of official liquidators, subject to the directions of the court, and that there was no colour for suggesting that they were personally liable.\nI have endeavoured to indicate the sections of the Bankruptcy Act which may be relevant to this case but, at the risk of repetition, I again point out that the respondent had by section 43 (k) a power to disclaim a lease but that nowhere was there power in the trustee to disclaim this property. I am of opinion that this is not a case for the application of the equitable rule of indemnity as in the Hardoon case[12] where the defendant cestui que trust was the beneficial owner of the shares. The respondent in the circumstances of this case does not come within the words \u201csole beneficial owner\u201d or \u201cabsolute beneficial owner,\u201d Hardoon v. Belilios12, supra, or within the words \u201creal equitable owner,\u201d as used by James, V.C., in Castellan v. Hobson[13], supra; or within the more common words expressing the same legal concept, namely, \u201cbeneficial owner.\u201d In this connection, at the risk of another repetition, I refer back to section 151 of the Bankruptcy Act. A case similar to the case at bar may very easily be visualized where the debts are paid in full without selling the property held in trust for the debtor at all and where, under that section, the property may revert to the former debtor.\nI should also add that if between November 9, 1906, and September 18, 1912, and possibly up to the assignment in bankruptcy, the appellant had paid off the mortgage and had recovered a judgment for indemnity against the company, he would have had to prove his claim as a secured or ordinary creditor. In this action, without payment, he asks for indemnity in full. To this he is not entitled.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The latter alleged that, in 1914, it purchased the right of way from the then owner, predecessor in title of the appellants, paid him in full for all the coal required to be left for the support of the right of way and that by virtue of the transfer itself, it was entitled to such support.\nHeld that the judgment of the Board dismissing the appellants\u2019 application (40 Can. Ry. Cas. 361) should be affirmed.\nIn the absence of some plain language in the contrary sense, of which there is none, section 197 of the Railway Act, which was not enacted until 1919, cannot be so construed as to prejudice the rights of the parties as settled by the transaction between them in 1914.\nAlso, the agreement between the former owner and the railway company, dated the 5th March, 1914, but not finally completed by transfer until the 28th September, 1914, should be construed and interpreted in the light of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council given on the 6th July, 1914.\nAPPEAL by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, from an order of that Board (No. 49760, of April 20, 1933)[1], dismissing the appellants\u2019 application to fix the amount of compensation payable to them in respect of coal lying under the right of way of the respondent railway.\nThe questions upon which leave to appeal was granted by the Board are stated in the judgment now reported. Section 197 of the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, reads as follows:\nThe company shall, from time to time, pay to the owner, lessee, or occupier of any such mines such compensation as the Board shall fix and order to foe paid, for or by reason of any severance by the railway of the land lying over such mines, or because of the working of such mines being prevented, stopped or interrupted, or of the same having to be worked in such manner and under such restrictions as not to injure or be detrimental to the railway, and also for any minerals not purchased by the company which cannot be obtained by reason of the construction and operation of the railway.\nThe appeal was dismissed with costs, and the questions answered in the affirmative.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. A. Walker K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff, C.J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners. By order of the Board dated 2nd June, 1933, leave was granted to appeal upon two questions which are stated thus:\n1. Whether the Board\u2019s judgment is correct in holding that section 197 of the Canadian Railway Act has no bearing on the application of the applicants; and that the applicants cannot invoke its provisions in support of their application?\n2. Was the legal effect of the transfer from Robert Kelly to the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway Company, dated 28th September, 1914, to vest in the railway company not only the right of way thereby transferred, but the right to subjacent and adjacent support?\nIt will be convenient first of all to give very briefly the material facts:\nIn 1914, Robert Kelly, the predecessor in title of the appellants, was the owner of the quarter-section now in question with the mines and minerals thereunder. On the 28th of September that year, Kelly transferred to the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway Company, the predecessor in title of the respondents, 8\u00b764 acres required for company\u2019s right of way through this quarter-section by a transfer which reserved all mines and minerals. Before the execution of this transfer by Kelly, the railway company had taken all the proceedings required by the Railway Act then in force for the expropriation of the land. Notice of expropriation had been served upon Kelly, by which the company offered to pay him $3,769; this amount including compensation at the rate of $50 per acre for the injurious affection of 27\u00b785 acres of coal rights.\nAn order for immediate possession had been granted on the 6th September, 1912, which provided that the railway company should make application upon four days\u2019 clear notice to determine what, if any, amount should be paid into court, as security for the payment of any compensation to which the parties entitled to the mineral rights might be found entitled. A further order was made on the 6th September, 1912, directing the sheriff to put the railway company in possession of the right of way, on the company\u2019s undertaking to pay into Court as security for compensation such sum as might be fixed by a judge, after determination by the Board of a pending application for permission to work the minerals under the railway right of way. Upon the 20th March, 1913, upon the application of Robert Kelly and others, the Board made the following order:\nThat the applicants be, and they are hereby granted leave to work and excavate the coal lying under the right of way of the railway company on section 8, township 55, range 24, west of the 4th meridian, in the province of Alberta, as shown on the plan on file with the Board under file Nos. 20827 and 20827\u00b71, subject to and upon the following conditions, namely:\u2014\n1. The coal not already mined under the right of way of the railway company to be left in place; and in the Kelly mine the coal to be left in place under the right of way and under additional strips fifteen and twenty-five feet in width outside the right of way on the northwest and southeast sides respectively.\n2. Two levels, eight feet wide, and seven feet high, to be constructed to each mine, the levels to be seventy feet apart and the timbers to be placed inside this measurement.\n3. The posts and timbers under the right of way to be of tamarack posts to be seven inches in diameter and the roof timbers eight inches by five inches, and placed on edge.\n4. All work within the limits set forth in paragraph 1 to be done under the supervision of an engineer of the railway company, who shall have the right of access to the mine at any time in order to examine timbers in the levels under the right of way.\n5. Where the coal has already been taken out under the right of way the applicants shall notify the railway company of the true position of the levels abandoned.\nIt is admitted that the effect of the Board\u2019s order, as regards the quarter-section in question, was to reduce the area injuriously affected in respect of right to coal from 27\u00b785 acres to 8\u00b764 acres. In April, 1913, an order was made fixing an amount payable into court under the previous order at the sum of $4,000.\nOn the 5th March, 1914, Robert Kelly and the railway company entered into an agreement which, in part, is as follows:\nThat the proceedings taken by the Railway Company for the expropriation of its right of way over the land above set out and as described in the notice to treat served in respect thereof are settled by the railway company agreeing to pay, and it hereby agrees to pay to Robert Kelly the sum of two thousand nine hundred and twenty-two dollars and sixteen cents ($2,922.16) and by Robert Kelly transferring and he hereby agrees to transfer free from encumbrance in fee simple but reserving the mines and minerals (the land in question).\nThis agreement was carried out by a transfer dated September 28th, 1914. The rights of Robert Kelly to the coal now in question were afterwards acquired by the appellant Elizabeth Berg, and the undertaking of the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway subsequently became vested in the respondent company.\nThe first question with which we have to deal is whether or not section 197 of the Railway Act, that was passed after the transfer of September, 1914, applies to such a case.\nNow, the reciprocal rights of the parties were determined by the transfer of September, 1914. The obligation of the railway company to compensate Kelly for land taken, as well as for injurious affection in respect of coal rights and otherwise, was discharged by payment of the sum named, while the railway company received title to the land subject to the reservation of the mines and minerals, including the right to vertical and lateral support for the railway. The Board has so decided, and, even if the Board\u2019s decision on this point were open to review before us, we should not disagree with it (Davies v. James Bay Railway Co.)[2]. In the absence of some plain language in the contrary sense, of which there is none, section 197, which was not enacted until 1919, cannot be so construed as to prejudice the rights of the parties as settled by the transaction between them in 1914.\nIt was also pressed upon us with a great deal of vigour that the transaction between Kelly and the railway company must be interpreted in the light of a decision of the Supreme Court of Ontario which was afterwards held by the Privy Council to be erroneous. The agreement between Kelly and the railway company, as already observed, was dated the 5th March, 1914. The decision of the Privy Council was given on the 6th July. The agreement between Kelly and the railway company was not finally completed by transfer until September 28th, 1914. I do not know on what grounds we should be justified in holding, for the purposes of this appeal, that the agreement should not be construed according to law.\nI think the learned Chief Commissioner was right in his view upon this point.\nIt would not be competent to us to find that the learned Chief Commissioner ought to have held on the evidence before him that the parties were dealing on some other basis and, indeed, on the interrogatories as framed, no such question is before us.\nIn the result, both interrogatories ought to be answered in the affirmative.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Woods, Field, Craig & Hyndman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George A. Walker.\n[1] [1933] 40 Can. Ry. Cas. 361.\n[2] (1914) 19 C.R.C. 86.\n"}

J. and Cannon, Crocket, Hughes and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA IN BANCO\nCourts\u2014Judgments\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Res judicata \u2014 Arbitration \u2014 Appeal\u2014Action for balance due under contract\u2014Dismissal of application to set aside default judgment and give leave to defend\u2014Appeal dismissed from refusal to set aside judgment, but reference made under terms of contract\u2014Reference, and report of findings\u2014Objection to jurisdiction\u2014Confirmation of report\u2014Appeal therefrom.\nPlaintiff (appellant) recovered judgment by default against respondent City for $14,432.11, the balance due on a construction contract, which the City had held back as protection against workmen\u2019s claims threatened under a wage clause in the contract. An application by the City to open up the judgment was dismissed and the City appealed. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco dismissed its appeal but, the contract having, by agreement, been laid before it, and its attention called to the fact that certain workmen had begun an action against the City on the basis of the said wage clause, it ordered a stay of execution as to $5,000, discontinuance of the workmen\u2019s action, and arbitration of the workmen\u2019s claims before the City Engineer (as referee named in the contract). Before the Engineer, plaintiff objected to his jurisdiction to proceed, on the ground, inter alia, that the contract was merged in the judgment. Before proceeding, the Engineer prepared a stated case for directions, but the Court, on application to fix a date for hearing it, directed him to proceed without delay to hear evidence. He found that $2,879.43 was due by plaintiff to workmen to comply with the contract terms. Plaintiff, treating the report as an award made under the terms of the contract, moved the Court to set it aside on the said jurisdictional ground and on the ground that it purported to set up a new contract between plaintiff and its workmen. The Court referred the matter back to the Engineer for definite findings on a point as to rate of wages. The Engineer filed a supplementary report. The City then moved for an order confirming both reports and to make them a rule of court, and plaintiff moved to set aside the award. The Court, by a majority, granted the City\u2019s motion and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s motion. From that judgment plaintiff brought the present appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The jurisdiction of the Engineer to investigate and report depended entirely upon the jurisdiction of the Court in banco to make the order of reference; and this order, not having been appealed from at the proper time, could not now be reviewed; plaintiff, therefore, could not how impeach the award on the ground that the rights of the parties to the contract had become merged in the default judgment (which ground was the basis of objection to the jurisdiction of the Court in banco to make the order and of the Engineer to proceed under it); and there was no uncertainty or manifest error of law on the face of the award.\nAs to the order of reference of the Court in banco:\nPer Duff C.J.: The Court in banco had discretionary authority to set aside the default judgment, and had jurisdiction to grant the stay, and to impose, as a term of its refusal to set aside the judgment, that the amount, if any, found due by the contemplated award should be treated as payment pro tanto on account of the judgment; which was in substance the effect of its decision. It is gravely questionable whether this Court had jurisdiction to hear an appeal from that judgment; and whether, if jurisdiction existed, the judgment dismissing the appeal having been acted upon, any appeal would not have been barred exceptione personali. But whether appealable or not, it was a judgment of a Court of general jurisdiction, possessing (with some reservations not here material) authority to pronounce conclusively, subject to appeal if the law gave an appeal, upon any question of its own jurisdiction; and, disregarding any question of personal estoppel by acceptance of the judgment, the Court in the subsequent proceedings was bound by its own judgment (Samejima v. The King, [1932] Can. S.C.R. 640, at 647).\nPer curiam: Had the City defended the action it would have been entitled under the contract to withhold moneys due by it to plaintiff to make good to workmen any deficiency in the wages found to be payable to them under the wage clause; and the result of the proceedings taken under the order of reference was precisely the same as that which would have followed had the Court set aside the default judgment and allowed the City to defend; and was one which seemed to meet the justice of the case as it was brought before the Court with concurrence of both parties to the contract.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1].\nThe plaintiff company recovered judgment, in default, of defence, against the defendant city for $14,432.11, the balance payable under a contract between it and the city for construction by it for the city of sidewalks, etc.\nCertain workmen had claimed that they had been paid by the plaintiff wages below that required by clause 12 of the contract, and they brought action against the city and the plaintiff in regard to the same.\nThe contract provided (inter alia) as follows:\n12. The rate of wages to be paid by the Contractor for labour and truckage shall not be less than the rate paid by the City for similar classes of labour and truckage. The rate of wages for other workmen or mechanics shall be that current for workmen or mechanics engaged in the respective trades in the City of Halifax.\n15. Any dispute or difference between the parties hereto\u2014\n(a) in respect to the proper amount payable under this agreement or the proper amount of any certificate of the Engineer for any work done, or the final settling of accounts, or\n(b) arising out of or relating to this memorandum of agreement, including the plans, drawings, specifications and details of the work to be done and material supplied, or the construction and meaning thereof, or\n(c) In any other way arising out of or concerning this agreement or the work to be done thereunder shall be referred to the Engineer, whose sole written decision thereon shall be absolutely final, binding and conclusive between the parties hereto, and all persons concerned and every such reference and decision, may be made a rule of court as a submission or as an award respectively, and no action or other proceedings shall be instituted or prosecuted in reference to any matter so in dispute or difference until the said matter is so referred to the Engineer and he has given his written decision thereon, and then only for the purpose of enforcing such decision.\n17. (1) If the Contractor fails to pay for any labour or materials after payment is due, the City may appropriate any amount due the Contractor under this contract, or any amount held by the City by way of deposit as security for this contract, and apply the same or any part thereof towards the payment of such liabilities and the amount of any such payment shall be considered payment out of the amount due to the Contractor, or out of the value of the work performed or materials provided.\n(2) If the Contractor and any labourer, or any person who has provided material, cannot agree as to the amount due, the Engineer shall immediately after notice to the parties concerned, hear and determine any question as to such amount, and the amount so found to be due by the Engineer shall be final and conclusive between the parties.\n(3) The City shall not in any way be liable for any such wages or materials or for any payment or appropriation made under this section, nor shall the City be bound to act under this section or to make any such appropriation.\n\u201cEngineer\u201d (defined in the contract) meant the city engineer of the said city.\nThe city applied for leave to reopen the judgment entered against it by the plaintiff and to defend the action. Hall J. dismissed the application[2]. The city appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco. That court[3] dismissed the appeal, but, the contract having been laid before it by agreement of counsel and its attention called to the fact of the workmen\u2019s action, it ordered a stay of execution as to $5,000 for 30 days, with leave to apply for a further extension; it also ordered that the workmen\u2019s action be discontinued and that proceedings to arbitrate the workmen\u2019s claims be proceeded with without delay before the city engineer.\nOn objection by counsel for the plaintiff as to the engineer\u2019s jurisdiction to proceed, on the ground, inter alia, that the contract was merged in the judgment, the engineer, before proceeding with evidence, prepared a stated case to the Supreme Court for directions, but the court, on application to fix a date for hearing, directed him to proceed without delay to hear evidence. He did so and made a report. The plaintiff moved to set it aside. The court referred the matter back to the engineer to make definite findings upon a certain point, and the engineer accordingly filed a supplementary report. The above proceedings are set out with some further particularity in the judgment of Crocket J. now reported. The city moved for an order confirming both reports and to make them a rule of court so that they might be enforced as upon a judgment; and the plaintiff moved to vacate and set aside the award. The court granted the city\u2019s motion and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s motion (Hall and Doull JJ. dissenting). It was from this judgment that the plaintiff\u2019s present appeal was brought. R. McInnes K.C., for the appellant.\nC. P. Bethune for the respondent.\nDuff C.J.\u2014I entirely concur with my brother Crocket. The substantial question involved is whether or not there was manifest error of law on the face of the award.\nThe issue as to jurisdiction disappears when the true nature of the order of the full court of the 18th of February, 1933, is understood. It is explained in the reasons of Mellish, J.:\n\u201cProceedings on the judgment to the exent of $5,000 were,\u201d he says, \u201cstayed to enable the city to proceed under said clause 15 of the contract, and have the question in dispute as to whether clause 12 of the contract had been complied with by the contractors determined\u201d and the further amount due to the labourers by the contractors under the terms of the contract ascertained. \u201cSubject to this the appeal was dismissed with liberty to apply for further directions.\u201d\nThere can be no doubt that the Full Court had discretionary authority to set aside the judgment by default, or that it had jurisdiction to grant the stay, and to impose as a term of its refusal to set aside the judgment, that the amount, if any, found due by the contemplated award should be treated as payment pro tanto on account of the judgment. That, as Mellish J. points out, is, in substance, the effect of the Full Court\u2019s decision of February.\nIt is gravely questionable whether this court had jurisdiction to hear an appeal from this judgment; and whether, if jurisdiction existed, the judgment dismissing the appeal having been acted upon, any appeal would not have been barred exceptione personali. In any case, no appeal was attempted, and whether appealable or not, it was a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction, possessing (with some reservations not here material) authority to pronounce conclusively, subject to appeal if the law gave an appeal, upon any question of its own jurisdiction; and, disregarding any question of personal estoppel by acceptance of the judgment, the court in the subsequent proceedings was bound by its own judgment (Samejima v. The King)[4]. In view of this qualification introduced into the order of Hall J., the appellants, obviously, were precluded from impeaching the award on the ground that the rights of the parties to the contract had become merged in the default judgment; and I agree that there is no manifest error of law on the face of the award, and that the award is not void for uncertainty.\nAn award can be set aside, (1) when it has been improperly procured, and (2) on the ground of misconduct of the arbitrator. \u201cMisconduct\u201d is in this relation a term of very comprehensive denotation, and includes ambiguity and uncertainty in the award, as well as manifest error of law on the face of the award. The appellants have not established the existence of any of these grounds.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket, Hughes and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This case has already been before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc three times.\nThe first appeal to that Court was against a judgment of Mr. Justice Hall dismissing an application of the City to reopen a judgment by default which had been entered against it at the suit of the appellant for $14,432.11 and costs. This amount was a balance due on a contract for the construction of sidewalks, curbs, etc, which the City had held back to protect itself against claims which were being threatened against it by certain workmen, under a fair wages clause contained in the contract, requiring the contractor to pay them not less than the rate paid by the City itself for similar classes of labour. The Supreme Court dismissed this appeal but, the contract having been laid before it by agreement of counsel and its attention called to the fact that an action had been begun by certain of the workmen against the City for wages on the basis of the fair wages clause, it ordered a stay of execution as to $5,000 for thirty days with leave to apply for a further extension. It ordered at the same time that the workmen\u2019s action be discontinued and proceedings to arbitrate the workmen\u2019s claims before the City Engineer be proceeded with without delay. When the hearing came on before the City Engineer counsel for the contractor objected to his jurisdiction to proceed with the reference on the ground, inter alia, that the contract was merged in the judgment. The Engineer before proceeding with any evidence prepared a stated case to the Supreme Court for directions, but the Court, on an application by him to fix a date for hearing the proposed case, directed him to proceed without delay to hear evidence. In the end he found that the minimum rate of wages contemplated by the contract was 40 cents per hour, and that the sum of $2,879.43 was due by the contractor to some 159 workmen if the terms of the contract were complied with. The men had been paid at the rate of 35 cents per hour.\nThe contractor, treating the report as an award made under the terms of the contract, moved the Supreme Court to set it aside on the jurisdictional ground already mentioned, as well as upon the ground that it purported to set up a new contract between the company and its workmen. On this motion there was a marked difference of opinion among the members of the Court as to whether the Engineer had made any finding which could safely be acted upon as to what the rate was which the City was paying for similar classes of labour during the currency of the contract, but a majority of the Court decided that the matter be referred back to the Engineer to make a definite finding upon this point. Mellish and Carroll, JJ., thought the finding already reported was sufficient.\nThe Engineer accordingly filed a supplementary report, whereupon the City moved for an order confirming both reports as awards made by the Engineer, \u201csitting as arbitrator in the matter of an arbitration between the Scotia Construction Co. Ltd. and certain workmen\u201d and to make them a rule of court so that they might be enforced as upon a judgment. The majority of the Court granted this motion, Hall and Doull, JJ., dissenting, and the case now comes before us on appeal from the last named judgment.\nThe judgment on appeal concerns only the confirmation of the two awards or findings of the Engineer. No appeal was taken from the judgment of the Court en banc staying execution and referring the matter in controversy to the Engineer for investigation and report. Although that judgment was in a sense an interlocutory proceeding it was nevertheless, to quote the language of Duff, J., in delivering the judgment of this Court in Diamond v. The Western Realty Co.[5], \u201ca final decision in the sense that in the absence of appeal it became binding upon all parties to it.\u201d The jurisdiction of the Engineer to investigate and report depended entirely upon the jurisdiction of the Court to make the order of reference, and, this order not having been appealed from at the proper time, we are of opinion that we cannot now review it. In the words of Lord Macnaghten in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin[6], quoted by Duff, J., in Diamond v. The Western Realty Co.[7], \u201cif the decision was wrong, it ought to have been appealed from in due time.\u201d So far, therefore, as that question is concerned, it must be taken to have been already settled.\nAll the objections which are now urged against the validity of the Engineer\u2019s awards or findings, save one, are in reality grounded on the alleged extinction of the contract with all its fair wages and arbitration provisions by reason of its merger in the default judgment. This was the whole basis of the objection to the jurisdiction of the Court en banc to make the order of reference and of the Engineer to proceed under it. Though these questions are not now open for the reason already stated, it may not be inappropriate to observe that, notwithstanding the contract was dead as between the City and the Company, it was expressly agreed by counsel for both parties that it should be laid before the Court for consideration on the first appeal from Mr. Justice Hall\u2019s judgment, and that it was thus that the dispute regarding the alleged breach of the fair wages clause and the claims of the workmen upon it were brought to the Court\u2019s attention, and, moreover, that, had the City defended the original action instead of deliberately allowing judgment to pass against it by default, it would have been entitled under clause 17 to withhold any amount due by it to the Company to make good to the workmen any deficiency in the wages found by the Engineer to be payable to these workmen under the fair wages clause. The result of the proceedings which have been taken by the order of the Court, therefore, is precisely the same as that which would have followed had it set aside the judgment by default and allowed the City in to defend, and is one which seems to meet the justice of the case as it was brought before the Court with the concurrence of both parties to the contract.\nApart from the jurisdictional grounds the single ground put forward against the validity of the judgment now on appeal is that the awards or findings were bad for manifest error of law because of their uncertainty and indefiniteness. While one perhaps might have expected the Engineer to be more explicit in his supplementary finding in view of the reason given by the Court for sending the case to him a second time, I agree with the majority of the Judges that it cannot well be taken to be other than a finding that the rate which the City paid for similar work performed by itself during the currency of the contract was 40 cents an hour, and that the contractor had not, therefore, fully paid these workmen the wages they were entitled to receive under the fair wages clause. In my opinion this objection cannot be sustained. The awards being good on their face, we cannot go behind them in the absence of any fraud or misconduct on the part of the Engineer in the performance of the duty which the Court committed to him, of which there has been no suggestion. We must assume that he has rightly and regularly performed that duty.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Russell McInnes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

Hart, George Colby and Alex Wilkie (Defendants)\n1934: October 9, 10; 1934: November 20.\nPresent:\u2014Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. and Maclean J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Motor vehicles\u2014Servant disobeying orders in allowing another person to drive car\u2014Duty of servant to keep proper look-out and exercise control over person driving for him\u2014Collision\u2014Liability of master\u2014Quantum of damages. The respondent's action arose out of a collision between two motor vehicles on a public highway running easterly from the city of Edmonton through Mundare and Vegreville. The collision occurred about five and one-half miles west of Mundare at a place distant about 72 feet from the common crest of an incline of the highway going westerly and a shorter and steeper incline going easterly. A spreader had gone over the road sometime before the collision and had pushed considerable loose gravel to the northerly half of the road. Apparently both eastbound and westbound traffic had been using the southerly half of the road considerably, and on this half there were two well defined wheel tracks, the southerly one of which was 2\u00bd or 3 feet from the southerly edge of the travelled part of the highway. The appellant company had in its employ as driver the defendant Colby. Sometime before the day of the collision, Colby had, contrary to the instructions of his employer, arranged with the defendant Wilkie, a licensed driver of many years experience and of good record, to come on the truck with him and to help by occasional driving and other work, Colby paying Wilkie from time to time small sums for these services. Both Colby and Wilkie drove alternately from Edmonton, through Mundare, to Vegreville and back to Mundare; and Wilkie drove westerly towards Edmonton after leaving Mundare, the wife of Wilkie also occupying the driving seat. As the truck came towards the incline on which the collision occurred, it was proceeding on the southerly half of the road in the wheel tracks, and after passing a horse drawn vehicle, continued up the hill in the southerly wheel tracks. Wilkie testified that, when his truck was approximately 65 feet from the place of the collision, he saw an eastbound car coming very fast and decided to swing the wheels towards the north ditch and had the right front wheel at the north edge of the road and the truck pointing northwesterly when it was struck at the left front by the eastbound motor vehicle which was heading northeasterly and out of control. Colby, in his evidence, stated that it was only when Wilkie pulled the truck towards the ditch at the north side that he, Colby, had the first intimation that a motor vehicle was approaching from the west and that he then shouted to Wilkie to \"look out.\" The eastbound car was owned by the defendant North Star Oil Company and driven by the defendant Hart; in it was one Kuproski as a passenger, who was killed by the force of the collision. The action was brought by the widow of Kuproski against both employers and drivers and against Colby as employee in charge. The trial judge gave judgment against all the defendants in favour of the respondent and her three children for a total sum of $24,100, which judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The appellant company was the only defendant who appealed to this Court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division ([1034] 2 W.W.R. 7), that the appellant company was liable. The defendant Colby, in his capacity of employee of the appellant, was present in the front seat of the cab of the motor truck while the defendant Wilkie was driving. It was within the scope of his employment and it was his plain duty to see that the truck was driven with reasonable care; to that end to keep a proper look out and to exercise such control as might be necessary for the purpose of preventing mistakes or faults on the part of Wilkie. His failure to do so constituted negligence in his capacity of servant of the appellant, negligence for which the appellant company is therefore responsible.\nPer Cannon and Hughes JJ. and Maclean J. ad hoc.\u2014As to the contention of the appellant that, assuming there was negligence on the part of Wilkie, it should have been held that Colby's act in permitting Wilkie to drive was outside the scope of Colby's employment, an unauthorized act to effect a purpose of Colby for which the appellant employer was not liable, held that Colby was in charge and in legal control of the truck although the actual driving had been temporarily turned over to Wilkie, and that Colby continued to have, within the scope of his employment, a duty to keep a proper look out and a duty to see that the truck was in the proper side of the road, considering the rights of other traffic; Colby, when he gave the actual driving to Wilkie,. did not divest himself of the above duties, which were not outside the scope of his authority merely because it was outside the scope of his authority to permit Wilkie to drive the motor truck.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Ewing J. and maintaining the respondent's action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported. Thomas N. Phelan K.C. and Sydney Wood for the appellant.\nN. D. Maclean K.C. for the respondent Kuproski.\nA. M. Sinclair K.C. for the North Star Oil Company.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket J. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur with my brother Hughes. I prefer to rest my concurrence on the ground upon which Mr. Maclean based his argument on behalf of the respondent Albina Kuproski.\nColby was present in the front seat of the cab of the motor truck while Wilkie was driving. He was there in his capacity of employee of the appellant. It was within the scope of his employment and it was his plain duty to see that the truck was driven with reasonable care; to that end to keep a proper look-out and to exercise such control as might be necessary for the purpose of preventing mistakes or faults on the part of Wilkie. His failure to do so constituted negligence in his capacity of servant of the appellant; negligence for which it is, therefore, responsible. That he failed to keep a look-out, that he failed to exercise anything like proper control over the driving is plain from his own evidence, and it was, moreover, so found by Mr. Justice Ewing, the trial judge; who also found in effect that this negligence was a direct cause of the collision.\nI quote textually from the judgment of the learned judge:\nIn the case at bar Colby not only permitted Wilkie to drive but he sat in the front seat of the cab with Wilkie and Mrs. Wilkie without making any effort to see that Wilkie drove properly. Wilkie approached the crest of the hill on the wrong side of the road, but Colby apparently not only did not interfere but he did not even keep any lookout to see that driving in this manner did not result in a collision. His own evidence is that he did not see the approaching car until the impact owing to the fact that he was looking at Mrs. Wilkie and the driver. Had Colby been looking he could have seen the approaching car in time to have so directed Wilkie that the collision would have been avoided.\nThis finding, with which the Appellate Division concurred, and with which I fully agree, is conclusive upon the issue in dispute between the appellant and the respondent Albina Kuproski. The following observations by Lord Justice Pickford in the course of his judgment in Ricketts v. Thos. Tilling, Ltd.[2] are precisely in point:\nIt was admitted that the driver of this motor omnibus was alongside the man who was driving, and it is admitted that he was negligent. I entirely accept, of course, the proposition that, in order to make the owner liable, there must be negligence on the part of the person for whose acts the owner is responsible\u2014his servant, either regularly or for that occasion only. * * * In this case I say it is admitted that the driving was negligent. It is admitted that the driver was sitting by the man who was driving and he could see all that was going on\u2014he could control what was going on. It seems to me that the fact that he allowed somebody else to drive does not divest him of the responsibility and duty he has towards his masters to see that the omnibus is carefully, and not negligently, driven.\nAs to the matter of damages, I have nothing to add to what has been said by the judges of the Appellate Division and by my brother Hughes.\nThe judgment of Cannon and Hughes J.J. and Maclean J. ad hoc was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014This action arose out of a collision between two motor vehicles which occurred on the afternoon of July 25, 1933, on a public highway running easterly from the city of Edmonton through Mundare and Vegreville. The collision occurred about five and one-half miles west of Mundare at a place distant about 72 feet from the common crest of an incline of the highway going westerly and a shorter and steeper incline going easterly. A spreader had gone over the road some time before the collision and had pushed considerable loose gravel to the northerly half of the road. Apparently both eastbound and westbound traffic had been using the southerly half of the road considerably, and on this half there were two well defined wheel tracks, the southerly one of which was 2\u00bd or 3 feet from the southerly edge of the travelled part of the highway.\nThe appellant Gillespie Grain Company Limited had in its employ as a driver the defendant George Colby. Sometime before the day of the collision, Colby had, contrary to the instructions of his employer, arranged with the defendant George Wilkie to come on the truck with him and to help by occasional driving and other work. Colby paid Wilkie from time to time small sums for these services. The reason underlying the arrangement was that Colby drank considerably and was out frequently late at night and as a result was, with his advancing years, at times too tired to do the work alone. On several occasions, Mrs. Wilkie also went along.\nOn the morning of the accident, Colby drove the truck from the appellant's warehouse at Edmonton and picked up Wilkie and Mrs. Wilkie at their home. Colby drove from Edmonton to Mundare where each person had a glass of beer. Wilkie testified that he drove from Mundare to the Vegreville elevator of the company. Each person had one or two glasses of beer at Vegreville. Colby testified that he drove back to Mundare but Wilkie said that he drove. At Mundare each person had another glass of beer. It should here be mentioned that Wilkie was a licensed driver of ten or twelve years' experience who owned a motor vehicle and who had had, according to the evidence, no motor vehicle accident previous to the one in question in this action. Wilkie drove the truck westerly towards Edmonton after leaving Mundare. All three occupied the driving seat on which there were two cushions. Wilkie sat behind the wheel at the left and occupied one cushion. Mrs. Wilkie and Colby, according to Colby, sat on the other cushion. As the truck came towards the incline on which the collision occurred, it was proceeding on the southerly half of the road in the wheel tracks. I am not at all suggesting that Wilkie was not entitled, where the vision ahead was clear, to use the southerly half of the road as long as he did not interfere with the rights of other traffic. Some distance east of the place of the collision, the truck turned farther to the south, passed a horse-drawn vehicle and then turned into the wheel tracks again. The truck continued up the hill on the southerly half of the road. Colby said that the crest would then be \"only two hundred and fifty feet or so away.\" Colby said that he was \"kind of sitting sideways,\" \"sort of talking to Mrs. Wilkie with one eye on her and one on Alex.\" He said: \"I was kind of sitting sideways, looking at them. I wasn't watching ahead.\" He added in another place in the record that he was \"looking with kind of one eye out,\" that the truck moved over to the north side of the road and that later Wilkie pulled the truck towards the ditch on the north side, shouted \"Look out, George,\" and that this was the first intimation that he, Colby, had that a motor vehicle was approaching from the west. Wilkie said that after he passed the horse-drawn vehicle, he swung the truck back to the wheel tracks, continued up the incline and began gradually to edge over to the right side of the road. He noticed a \"dust cloud a long way off\" and turned a little more to his right. Then he noticed the top of a motor vehicle dip out of sight on the west side of the crest and he pulled over to his right side. Then the car came into sight again. At this time the truck was, according to Wilkie, on the north side of the road. The truck was then approximately 65 feet from the place of the collision. He saw that the eastbound car was coming very fast; he decided to swing the wheels towards the north ditch and had the right front wheel at the north edge of the road and the truck pointing northwesterly when it was struck at the left front by the eastbound motor vehicle which was heading northeasterly and out of control.\nThe eastbound car was owned by North Star Oil Company Limited, driven by the defendant Ronald L. M. Hart, and in it the late Anton J. Kuproski was a passenger. The latter was killed by the force of the collision. The driver, L. M. Hart, suffered a loss of memory as a result of concussion and was not able to testify as to the happenings immediately before the collision.\nThe action was brought by the administratrix of the estate of the deceased against the employer and driver of the eastbound car and against the employer and driver of the truck and against Colby, as employee in charge.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ewing without a jury. The learned trial judge gave judgment against all the defendants. He found that Hart, an employee of North Star Oil Limited, was negligent in approaching the crest of the hill at a very high rate of speed \"to the extent at least that his car was not under reasonable control\"; and further that he was negligent in not keeping a proper look-out. He found that Wilkie was negligent in approaching the top of the hill on the \"wrong\" side of the road and in not keeping a look-out for approaching vehicles \"to the extent that it was possible to see vehicles.\" He found as a fact that Wilkie continued on the south side of the road without materially slackening speed until the truck was within 60 feet of the scene of the accident. Speaking of Colby, the learned trial judge said:\nColby not only permitted Wilkie to drive but he sat in the front seat of the cab with Wilkie without making any effort to see that Wilkie drove properly. Wilkie approached the crest of the hill on the wrong side of the road, but Colby apparently not only did not interfere but he did not even keep any look-out to see that driving in this manner did not result in a collision. * * * Had Colby been looking he could have seen the approaching ear in time to have so directed Wilkie that the collision would have been avoided.\nI think that Colby's negligence in permitting Wilkie to drive and taking no steps to see that he drove properly was an effective cause of the accident.\nThe learned trial judge fixed the damages as follows:\nTo the plaintiff in her own right\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $13,000\nTo the plaintiff in the right of Ernest Kuproski\u2026.. 1,800\nTo the plaintiff in the right of Bernard Kuproski\u2026 3,800\nTo the plaintiff in the right of Gladys Kuproski\u2026. 5,500\nAll defendants appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, both as to liability and as to quantum of damages. The appeals were dismissed with costs.\nFrom the judgment of the Appellate Division, Gillespie Grain Company Limited, now appeals to this Court.\nThe appellant contended before us that the judgment of the learned trial judge as affirmed by the Appellate Division was erroneous in the following respects.\n(1) It should have been held that the sole cause of the collision was the negligence of Hart.\n(2) It should have been held that there was no negligence on the part of Wilkie.\n(3) It should not have been held that Colby was negligent or that his negligence was an effective cause of the collision.\n(4) Assuming there was negligence on the part of Wilkie, it should have been held that Colby's act in permitting Wilkie to drive was outside the scope of Colby's employment, an unauthorized act, to effect a purpose of Colby for which the appellant employer was not liable.\n(5) The assessment of damages was unreasonable and extravagant.\nIt will be convenient to discuss these contentions in the above order, taking the first two contentions together. During the course of the argument before us, counsel were advised that this Court could not in view of the evidence interfere with the findings of the learned trial judge, affirmed by the Appellate Division, that both drivers Hart and Wilkie were negligent. It is true that the Chief Justice, in whose judgment Mr. Justice Mitchell concurred, was of opinion that the onus was not on the plaintiff to prove negligence, he having apparently overlooked the fact that the case was one of collision; but the remaining three judges in appeal confirmed the findings of negligence made by the trial judge and it does not appear that in any of these judgments in appeal or in the judgment of the learned trial judge, there was any misplacing of the onus of proof.\nWe now proceed to consider the contention of the appellant that Colby was not negligent. It was argued by the appellant that the negligence found against Colby by the learned trial judge was founded upon the fusion of two essential and indispensable elements, the one being the permitting of Wilkie to drive, and the other being the failure of Colby to take steps to see that he drove properly; and that accordingly the whole finding must fall if either of the essential elements failed. The appellant then proceeded to argue that it was not negligence on the part of Colby to permit Wilkie to drive as Wilkie was to the knowledge of Colby an experienced, licensed driver of good record and that therefore the finding of negligence against Colby could not be supported because of the failure of one of the essential elements. It is not necessary to decide whether it was or was not, in the circumstances of this case, negligence on the part of Colby in permitting Wilkie to drive contrary to the instructions of his employer, and whether such act, if negligent, was an effective cause of the collision, because we are of opinion that we must look at all that the learned trial judge had to say about Colby's conduct and not confine ourselves to the more specific finding urged by the appellant. In addition to the latter finding, the learned trial judge said, as above stated, that as the truck approached the crest of the hill on the \"wrong\" side of the road, Colby did not keep any look-out to see that driving in this manner did not result in a collision and that, if Colby had been looking, he could have seen the approaching car in time to have so directed Wilkie that the collision would have been avoided. The conclusions of the learned trial judge as to the negligence of Colby were affirmed by at least three judges of the Appellate Division and, in our opinion, there was ample evidence to support them.\nWe now come to the fourth contention of the appellant that, assuming there was negligence on the part of Wilkie, it should have been held that Colby's act in permitting Wilkie to drive was outside the scope of Colby's employment, an unauthorized act, to effect a purpose of Colby for which the appellant employer was not liable. It should here be mentioned that in the province of Alberta there was not any statutory liability for damages imposed on the owner of the truck qua owner. Rupert Settle, an officer of the appellant, testified at the trial that one condition of Colby's employment was that he should see that nobody else should have \"anything to do with that truck,\" that Colby was to be the sole driver and that Colby understood that clearly. Colby testified at the trial that he was in charge of the truck and Wilkie testified that every time they came back to the elevator, Colby resumed the actual driving. It must be clear, therefore, that Colby was in charge and in legal control of the truck although the actual manipulations of the steering wheel and the gears had been temporarily turned over to Wilkie. It cannot be said that Colby had thereby freed himself, as employee of the appellant, of his ordinary duties of keeping a proper look-out, or seeing that the truck was on the proper side of the road, considering the rights of other traffic, although it may very well be that when Wilkie assumed the driving, he also assumed duties of keeping a proper look-out and keeping the truck on the proper side of the road, considering the rights of other traffic. In other words, it may be said that as the truck approached the place of the collision, Wilkie had a duty to keep a proper look-out also and a duty to drive the truck on the proper side of the road, considering the rights of other traffic; and that Colby continued to have, within the scope of his employment, a duty to keep a proper look-out and a duty to see that the truck was on the proper side of the road, considering the rights of other traffic. We are not of opinion that Colby when he gave over the actual driving to Wilkie divested himself of the above duties or that the above duties were outside of Colby's authority merely because it was outside the scope of his authority to permit Wilkie to drive at all. Now the learned trial judge said that Wilkie approached the crest of the hill on the \"wrong\" side of the road and that Colby not only did not interfere but he did not even keep any look-out to see that driving in this manner did not result in a collision. Earlier in his judgment the learned trial judge found that the truck continued on the left side of the road until within 60 feet of the scene of the accident, which would be within 132 feet of the crest of the hill. On this finding, Colby had had ample time and opportunity, as the person in charge of the truck, to have directed Wilkie earlier and farther back on the hill or, if necessary, before he reached the hill, to get the truck to the north side of the road.\nMany cases were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the appellant's contention that the instructions of the employer to Colby not to permit any other person to drive the truck constituted a delimitation of the employee's authority, and that the employee was acting wholly outside the scope of his authority at the time of the collision. Counsel for the respondent contended on the other hand (a) that Colby's conduct was merely improper conduct within the scope of his employment or (b) that Colby was in charge of the truck at all times and retained a duty to keep a proper look-out and to see that the truck was on the proper side of the road, considering other traffic.\nBeard v. London General Omnibus Company[3]. The facts in this case were that at the end of a journey the conductor of an omnibus belonging to the defendants, in the absence of the driver and apparently with the purpose of turning the omnibus in the right direction for the next journey, drove it through some side streets, and while so doing negligently ran down the plaintiff. At the trial the plaintiff gave no evidence that the conductor was authorized by the defendants to drive the omnibus in the absence of the driver. At the close of the plaintiff's case judgment was entered for the defendants. In the Court of Appeal, judgment in favour of the defendants was affirmed.\nReichardt v. Shard[4]. The defendant was the owner of a motor car which was being driven by his son. The defendant was not in the car, but his driver was sitting beside the son. A collision occurred between the defendant's car and a car belonging to the plaintiff, owing to the negligent driving of the defendant's son. In an action for damages caused by the collision, the defendant stated that he allowed the son to use the car, but never allowed him to go out with it without the driver. A County Court judge, after a verdict of a jury, gave judgment against the defendant. The defendant appealed to the Divisional Court, which dismissed the appeal. The Court of Appeal likewise dismissed an appeal to it. Lord Justice Buckley, with whose conclusion Lord Justice Phillimore and Lord Justice Pickford agreed, said that it appeared to him to be a reasonable view to take that the learned County Court judge was entitled to say that, having regard to the person who accompanied the son, there was no evidence to go to the jury that the defendant had given up control of the car.\nRicketts v. Thos. Tilling, Ltd.[5]. The facts, shortly, in this case were that at the end of a journey, the conductor on an omnibus belonging to the defendants, in the presence of the driver, who was seated beside him, for the purpose of turning the omnibus in the right direction for the next journey, drove it through some side streets so negligently that it ran down the plaintiff. At the trial the judge, upon what he considered the authority of Beard v. London General Omnibus Co.[6], held that there was no evidence that the conductor had authority from the defendants to drive the omnibus and entered judgment for the defendants. It was held in the Court of Appeal that there was evidence of negligence on the part of the driver in allowing the omnibus to be negligently driven by the conductor and that there should be a new trial. The case was unlike the case at bar in that the conductor was an inexperienced driver, but the case was like the case at bar in that the proper driver was also sitting on the box. Buckley, Lord Justice, page 646, said:\nIt seems to me that the driver, who was authorized to drive, had the duty to prevent another person from driving, or, if he allowed another person to drive, to see that he drove properly. He was sitting beside the conductor and the driving by the conductor was conducted in his presence. He could not delegate his authority. It is a question for the jury whether the effective cause of the accident was that the driver committed a breach of his duty (which was either to prevent another person from driving or, if he allowed him to drive, to see that he drove properly), or whether the driver had discharged that duty.\nHe distinguished Gwilliam v. Twist[7], and stated that the question in the latter case was not the question in Ricketts v. Thos. Tilling Ltd.[8] and added,\nIt is not here said that there is a liability in the master because the driver delegated to the conductor. The question is whether the driver had properly discharged his duty of not letting that other person drive while he sat by, or, if he did let him drive while he sat by, then of seeing that he drove properly. It was a question for the jury whether the accident arose from a breach by the driver of the duty which he owed to his master as driver.\nPhillimore L.J. stated, page 649, that the questions really were whether the driver was still in charge of the omnibus and whether the accident happened because he neglected his duty. Pickford L.J. also wrote a judgment and some of his words are so applicable to the present case that it is proper that they should be quoted verbatim:\nIt is admitted that the driver was sitting by the man who was driving and he could see all that was going on\u2014he could control what was going on. It seems to me that the fact that he allowed somebody else to drive does not divest him of the responsibility and duty he has towards his masters to see that the omnibus is carefully, and not negligently, driven. But it seems to me that, where a man is entrusted with the duty of driving and controlling the driving of a motor omnibus, and is sitting alongside a person who is wrongfully driving and the motor omnibus is negligently driven and thereby an accident happens, there is evidence at any rate of negligence on the part of that driver in having allowed that negligent driving. I do not at all say that on an investigation of the facts it might not appear that the act of negligence was so sudden and unexpected that he had no reason to see it; and therefore it would come back to the question of whether he was responsible for allowing the other man to drive. It seems to me at any rate that there is evidence of negligence on his part, he being there and still having the duty of the controlling and the driving of the omnibus, in allowing the omnibus to be negligently driven whereby the accident happened.\nOf course, the actual driver may oust and keep ousted the regular driver from charge or control by fraud, force or duress, and the employer may not be liable although the regular driver is sitting beside the actual driver and the car is operated so negligently that an accident occurs. Kuhmo v. Laakso[9].\nCoogan v. Dublin Motor Co.[10]. The facts in this case were that the defendants had hired a motor car to T. The chauffeur in charge of the car, in violation of his instructions, permitted T. to drive. While T. was driving, the plaintiff was run down and injured. The chauffeur stated that he was forbidden to allow passengers to drive, that when passing along Monk street he saw the plaintiff step out in front of a tram, that he told T. to pass the tram on the right hand and that he put on the emergency brake, but he was too late to avoid a collision. It was held by the Divisional Court that in allowing T. to drive the chauffeur was acting outside the scope of his authority, and that the defendants were not liable. Gibson J. said that the owner of the car gave control to an expert, who had no power to abandon his trust. Kenny J. concurred with Gibson J. This case is not very helpful to us as the report does not indicate that the regular driver, as in the case at bar, failed to keep a proper look-out or to direct the actual driver where to go. In fact it rather indicates the contrary.\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appellant is liable.\nWe now come to the fifth point, namely the quantum of damages. The learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment referred to the life expectancy of the deceased as 39\u00b7072 years instead of the correct figures, 31\u00b7072, but Mr. Justice McGillivray stated in his reasons that the learned trial judge had on request informed the Appellate Division that in fact he had used the correct figures of 31\u00b7072 in arriving at his conclusions. It was pointed out by counsel for the appellant that the learned trial judge had not before him the figures for joint expectancies and that, moreover, he had made excessive use of the life expectancy figures and had allowed in the aggregate sums exceeding the present value over the life expectancy period of $100 per month the largest sum which the widow said the deceased had been giving to the family shortly before his death. Rowley v. London and North Western Railway Co.[11]; Phillips v. London and Southern Railway Co.[12]. There was, however, considerable evidence that the deceased was a good salesman and that in more normal times he had earned much larger sums than he was earning just before his death and we cannot say that the trial judge did not take these facts also into consideration or that he was not entitled so to do. There is no doubt that the amount awarded by the learned trial judge was generous, to say the least, but the amount has been affirmed by the Appellate Division. Under all the circumstances, it is not a case in which we can properly interfere. Cassette v. Dunn(3), Smith v. C.N.R.(4). An appeal from the latter judgment was dismissed by this Court on May 15, 1924.\nThe present appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs to the respondent, Albina Kuproski.\nNorth Star Oil, Limited, which was added as a party respondent by Order dated September 11, 1934, is not entitled to costs either of that Order or on this appeal. This defendant appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, but did not appeal to this Court, and was not entitled to intervene under Supreme Court Rule 60.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1934] 2 W.W.R. 7.\n[2] [1915] 1 K.B. 644, at 650.\n[3] (1900) 2 Q.BD. 530.\n[4] 31 T.L.R. 24.\n[5] [1915] 1 KB. 644.\n[6] (1900) 2 Q.B.D. 530.\n[7] (1895) 2 Q.B.D. 84.\n[8] [1915] 1 K.B. 644.\n[9] [1931] O.R. 630.\n[10] 49 Ir.

His debts, etc., amounted to $331,343.26.\nHeld (Crocket J. dissenting): Under the Act, the amount of the debts, etc., should be deducted from the total of the said sums of $175,429.11, $184,884.86, and $50,000; and succession duty levied only on the difference.\nThe method of determining \u201cthe dutiable value of property\u201d under s. 5, providing for allowance for debts, etc., applies to all property upon which succession duty is imposed, namely, all \u201cproperty passing on the death of any person\u201d as defined in the Act.\nJudgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, 7 M.P.R. 367, reversed.\nPer Crocket J., dissenting: In levying the duty against the insurance moneys and the gift inter vivos, there should be no allowance for debts, etc., under s. 5. Under the Act, the duty is to be assessed and levied distributively on the component parts of the property passing in the hands of the individual successors to whom it goes or has gone; and the allowance for debts, etc., is deductible only from such properties as are liable by law for the deceased\u2019s debts.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] given on a special case stated for the opinion of the said Court. The following facts are taken from the said special case, as agreed to for the purposes of the appeal on the question submitted.\nArchibald Fraser, late of Edmundston in the Province of New Brunswick, died on October 10, 1932, while resident and domiciled in said province. He had made his last will on December 18, 1930, whereby he appointed the defendants to be executors and trustees. The will was admitted to probate and letters testamentary were issued to defendants, who filed, in accordance with the provisions of The Succession Duty Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 15, and amending Acts, an Affidavit of Value and Relationship, with all proper schedules. According to the schedules filed the testator was, at the time of his death, seized and possessed of assets, liable for the payment of debts, encumbrances and expenses allowable under the provisions of s. 5 of The Succession Duty Act as deductions, of the gross value of $175,429.11. The funeral expenses, debts, encumbrances and Probate Court fees, as set forth in the Affidavit of Value and Relationship and Schedule thereto, allowable as deductions under the provisions of said s. 5, amounted to $331,343.26. In addition to the above assets the testator had insurance on his life, payable to his wife and to his children, which yielded the beneficiaries the net sum of $184,884.86. It was agreed that this latter sum formed no part of the estate and was not subject to its debts and liabilities. The schedules also disclosed that within five years before his death the testator had made a gift inter vivos to a daughter of a sum of $50,000.\nThe Proper Officer made no assessment of duty on the said assets of the gross value of $175,429.11, but made an assessment (computed in accordance with clauses of sec. 11 of the Act) on the sum of $234,884.86, which was the total amount of the said sums of $184,884.86 and $50,000. In making such assessment he allowed debts, encumbrances and expenses to the extent only that there were assets in the estate liable for the payment of debts and encumbrances and made no allowance for debts, encumbrances and expenses beyond the amount of the assets in the estate available to pay same.\nThe plaintiff claimed that the assessment made by the Proper Officer was correct. The defendants claimed that under the provisions of the Act the debts, encumbrances and expenses amounting to the sum of $331,343.26, should be deducted not alone from the value of the assets forming the estate and liable to the payment of debts, encumbrances and expenses, amounting to the sum of $175,429.11, but from the value of all the property passing on the death of the testator, amounting to the sum of $410,313.90, and that duty should be assessed only on the difference, that is to say on the sum of $78,970.64.\nThe question which the court was asked to determine was (clause 16 of the special case) whether, under the provisions of The Succession Duty Act, the debts, encumbrances and expenses should be deducted only from the value of the assets of the estate, liable for the payment of such debts, liabilities and expenses, or whether the debts, encumbrances and expenses should be deducted from the value of all the property passing on the death of the testator within the meaning of the Act, including both the assets liable for the payment of debts, encumbrances and expenses and the property not so liable.\nThe Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick held (Hazen C.J. dissenting)[2] that under the provisions of the Act the debts, encumbrances and expenses should not be deducted from the value of all the property passing on the death of the testator within the meaning of the Act, including both the assets liable for the payment of debts, encumbrances and expenses and the property not so liable.\nFrom this judgment the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. By its judgment now reported, the appeal was allowed with costs throughout, Crocket J. dissenting.\nR. B. Hanson K.C. for the appellant.\nW. H. Harrison K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff C.J. and Cannon, Hughes and Maclean (ad hoc) J.J.) was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal raises questions touching the construction and application of the Succession Duty Act of New Brunswick. The charging section is section 3 and is in the following words: 3. For the purpose of raising a revenue for Provincial purposes, and except as herein expressly otherwise provided, there shall be levied and paid for the use of the Province a duty to be called \u201cSuccession Duty\u201d on all property passing either in whole or in part on the death of any person, and such duty shall be computed, assessed and levied in the manner in this Chapter provided.\nIt is to be observed that the subject of the duty which is to be levied and paid under that section is \u201call property passing either in whole or in part on the death of any person.\u201d Then, the duty is to be computed, assessed and levied \u201cin the manner in this chapter provided.\u201d\nComing at once to section 5 upon the scope and application of which the controversy mainly turns. The purpose of that section is plainly stated: for specified purposes certain definitions are to be applied and allowances and deductions made. The opening words, which specify the subject matter in respect of which the section is to be operative, are these:\nIn determining the dutiable value of property, or the value of a beneficial interest in property * * *\nNow, in the interpretation clause (section 2 (d)), we find this definition of \u201cdutiable value\u201d:\n\u201cDutiable value\u201d means the value to which any rate is applied for the purpose of computation under section 11.\nThen, turning to section 11, there are these words:\n11. The rates by which succession duty is to be computed shall be as follows:\nThat is the section which enacts what the rates are to be by which succession duty is to be computed.\nTo summarize: Succession duty is (by section 3) to be levied and paid on all property passing in whole or in part on the death of any person. \u201cDutiable value\u201d means the value to which any rate prescribed under section 11 is to be applied, and, under section 11, the rate prescribed is the rate by which succession duty is to be computed. The plain result of all this is that succession duty is to be ascertained by applying the appropriate rate, under section 11, to the value\u2014\u201dthe dutiable value\u201d\u2014of \u201call property passing in whole or in part on the death of any person.\u201d\nThen, in section 5, we have a provision for determination of \u201cthe dutiable value of property.\u201d If it had not been for the judgment of the court below, I do not think I should have had any difficulty in concluding that this necessarily means the dutiable value of the property upon which succession duty is imposed by the enactment of section 3; that is to say, \u201call property passing in whole or in part on the death of any person.\u201d Then, by definition, under s. 10 (1) (b), as amended by 22 Geo. V, c. 14, such property includes (inter alia) dispositions inter vivos, not made bona fide five years before the death of the deceased, and, under s. 10 (1) (f), monies received under certain types of policies of insurance.\nAs it appears to me, these provisions are expressed in words which have an ordinary, grammatical, and natural sense, and, construing them according to that sense, they give a plain and intelligible result; the result I have just indicated.\nMr. Justice Baxter, with the concurrence of Mr. Justice Grimmer, in an able judgment, has given his reasons for thinking that \u201cproperty,\u201d under section 5, is not used in the sense in which it is used in section 3, that it does not include property not forming part of the estate of the deceased in the ordinary sense, that is to say, property not, in fact, passing on death. This he seems to deduce from a principle he lays down: that in providing for allowances the enactment must be taken to have in contemplation, as regards debts for which allowance is to be made, only property out of which by law such debts are payable; and the learned judges seem to have been influenced by difficulties they detected in respect of the working out of the directions expressed in the section concerning allowances and deductions. With respect, I think there is nothing in the enactments of section 5 inconsistent with the view that they are applicable to all property subject to duty under section 3.\nThere are several powerful reasons against the acceptance of this restricted interpretation propounded by the learned judges. One is that, so construing section 5, the statute contains no provision for ascertaining the dutiable value of property which passes on death only by force of the statutory fiction. Another is: it is not easy to see why, if such property is, by force of the statutory fiction, to be subject to the duty imposed by the statute, it should not also, by force of the same fiction, be subject to the provisions of the statute by which dutiable value is to be determined; and there are at least two provisions of the Act which I am unable to reconcile with the assumption that the Legislature recognized any such distinction in respect of the application of section 5.\nFirst: Section 3, which is the charging section, embraces such property, and the plain direction given by section 3 is that the duty, as regards all property in respect of which it is to be levied, \u201cshall be computed, assessed and levied in the manner in this chapter provided.\u201d Computation necessarily involves the application of the provisions of section 11, which, in turn, necessarily involves, reading the terms of section 3 in light of the provision of section 2 (d), a determination of dutiable value. In other words, the determination of dutiable value is an essential step in the computation of duty. This plain imperative direction by section 3 seems, therefore, unambiguously to contemplate the provisions of section 5 which contains the only provisions of the statute giving directions for the ascertainment of \u201cdutiable value.\u201d\nThen, the language of section 10, which creates the fiction, is this:\nProperty passing on the death of any person shall be deemed to include for all purposes of this Chapter the following property:\nThe words \u201cfor all purposes of this chapter\u201d are as plain, as unequivocal, as words could be. Apart from some controlling context, it is impossible to give these words a construction which would exclude section 5 from the operation of the fiction. There is no controlling context. Section 10 appears to me to afford an insuperable obstacle to the acceptance of the view I am considering.\nIt must not be forgotten that we are dealing with a taxing statute and, where the language of such a statute has an ordinary, grammatical, and natural meaning, the courts are bound, subject, of course, to any controlling context, to give effect to that meaning, quite regardless of what the consequences may be.\nI do not think it necessary for the purposes of this appeal to examine in detail the operation of section 5. I do not see that any greater difficulty arises in applying the earlier branch of the section to property which constructively passes than in applying it to property which actually passes. As regards the second branch of the section, it seems to me, and in this I agree with Baxter and Grimmer JJ., that it deals with particular items of property subject to some special charge; it does not contemplate the liability of the assets of the deceased to be applied in payment of debts. On this point, I cannot accept the argument of the Attorney-General. There may be difficulties in working out the section, but I cannot discover any ground upon which a court of law can justify itself in excluding from the operation of the section property which only fictionally passes. These reasons seem sufficient for the disposition of the question before us, as stated in paragraph 16 of the stated case.\nThe answer is, as regards the first alternative stated in the question submitted, in the negative; and, as regards the second alternative, in the affirmative.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nCrocket J. (dissenting)\u2014The testator died seized and possessed of real and personal property of the total value of $175,429.11, which passed directly to his executors and trustees and were available for the payment of outstanding debts and encumbrances. In addition to these assets there were several insurance policies on his life payable to his wife, his two sons and his daughter, which yielded $184,884.86, and a gift inter vivos of $50,000 which he had made to his daughter within five years of his death. These insurance moneys and the gift inter vivos, while not liable in any way for the testator\u2019s debts, were liable to the payment of succession duties under s. 10 of the New Brunswick Succession Duty Act as \u201cproperty passing\u201d on his death. As the testator\u2019s debts together with his funeral expenses and the probate court and proctor\u2019s fees amounted to $331,343.26\u2014a sum more than $150,000 in excess of the gross value of the properties passing directly to the executors and trustees\u2014the Succession Duty Officer made no assessment upon these properties, but levied a duty upon, the insurance moneys passing to the widow and the deceased\u2019s two sons severally and upon the insurance moneys and the gift inter vivos passing to the daughter, without making any allowance in respect of these items or classes of property by way of deduction for debts, encumbrances and expenses under s. 5 of the Act.\nThe appellants contended that under the provisions of s. 5 the debts, encumbrances and expenses should be deducted from the gross value of all the property passing or deemed to have passed within the meaning of the Act, that is to say, from the sum of the assets of the estate proper, which were liable for the payment of such debts, encumbrances and expenses, and of the insurance moneys and gift inter vivos, which were not liable therefor. A stated case was submitted to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court for the decision of the question thus raised before the Succession Duty Officer. The Court decided, per Grimmer and Baxter, JJ., Hazen, C.J., dissenting, that the debts, encumbrances and expenses should not be deducted from the value of all the property passing on the death of the testator within the meaning of the Act, including both the assets liable for the payment of such debts, encumbrances and expenses and the property not so liable. It is from this decision the present appeal is taken.\nIt is apparent from this statement and the form of the question submitted for the opinion of the Appeal Division that, although the problem arises upon the provision for the allowance of debts, encumbrances and expenses, which is found only in s. 5, its solution primarily involves a consideration of the governing principle of the Act, viz: whether it imposes the duty upon the aggregate value of all property passing or deemed to pass, collectively, including gifts inter vivos and insurance moneys, which are not liable for the deceased debts, etc., as well as of all other properties actually passing or intended to pass on his death, which are liable therefor, or whether its governing principle is that the duty shall be assessed and levied distributively in the hands of the individual successors, to whom it severally passes or is intended to pass or has previously passed. The appellants\u2019 claim is founded entirely upon the former hypothesis. It follows that if the latter hypothesis, and not the former, is found to be the true intendment of the Act, the question must be answered against the appellants as it was by the Appeal Division.\nThe appellants\u2019 counsel relies upon s. 2 (a), (d), (g) and (h) and ss. 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 as establishing \u201cthat the duty is a tax imposed on all property passing or deemed to pass on the death of a testator,\u201d and argues that the sum of $410,313.97 is the gross value of the estate in the case at bar for succession duty purposes under the provisions of the Act, and $78,970.71 its \u201caggregate value,\u201d determinable by deducting from the gross value the sum of $331,343.26 allowed for debts, encumbrances and expenses under s. 5. After a careful examination of all the provisions relied upon and of the entire Act, I find it impossible to accede to the contention that the Succession Duty Officer should have deducted the whole amount of the debts and expenses allowance from the gross value of all properties liable to duty without regard to whether they are severally liable to the payment of the testator\u2019s debts, secured or unsecured, or any of the expenses specified in s. 5.\nThe section chiefly relied upon by the appellants\u2019 counsel is s. 3, the so-called charging section of the Act. This section undoubtedly enacts that the duty shall be levied \u201con all property passing either in whole or in part on the death of any person\u201d but it leaves the computation, assessment and levying of the duty to be made \u201cin the manner in this chapter provided.\u201d That duty cannot be assessed and levied upon all such property is, I think, clearly evidenced by the provisions of s. 7, which provides that no duty shall be computed in reference to certain estates and descriptions of property. That the word \u201call\u201d does not denote in any event that the computation, assessing and levying is to be made upon the property in the aggregate is shewn, in my opinion, by the provisions of s. 11, which in reality is the section by which succession duty is to be computed. See s. 8. S. 11 does not purport to fix any uniform duty which is to be applicable to all classes and descriptions of property alike, but provides that the \u201crates by which succession duty is to be computed shall be\u201d etc. These rates vary, not only according to \u201cthe aggregate value of the property passing on the death\u201d of the deceased, but according to the relationship which the person or persons, to whom \u201cthe property passes either in whole or in part,\u201d bears to the deceased. It is in this section that we find the expression, \u201cthe aggregate value of the property passing on the death,\u201d upon which the appellants so much rely. This, however, is but one factor which enters into the fixing of the appropriate rate by which the duty is to be computed. Another factor, equally important, is the degree of relationship, if any, which the person or persons, to whom any property passes, bears to the deceased, and still another is the fact whether any successor to whom any of such property passes resides within or out of the province. Throughout its six subsections there are several references to property in addition to those already quoted, For instance, in subs. (2) we find the expression: \u201cIf the value of the property passing to or for the benefit of any one of the persons mentioned in subs. (1)\u201d exceeds, etc. In subs. (3): \u201cIf any property subject to duty passes on the death of any person, either in whole or in part, to or for the benefit of any lineal ancestor or descendant,\u201d etc., and in the same subsection the expression: \u201cIf the aggregate value of a property passing on the death of such person,\u201d and in subs. (5) the expression \u201cIf any property subject to duty passes on the death of any person, either in whole or in part, to or for the benefit of any person in any other degree of consanguinity to the deceased,\u201d etc. It will be seen from these quotations from s. 11 that the term \u201caggregate value\u201d is not used in the sense of indicating the subject matter upon which the succession duty is imposed, but only for the purpose of determining one of the factors which the proper officer must consider in computing the duty which is to be assessed and levied upon the different portions of the property which is subject to duty.\nWhen s. 5 is examined, around which more than any other section the issue perhaps centres, it will be seen that it does not itself purport to determine either the \u201caggregate value\u201d or the \u201cdutiable value\u201d of any property, or even to lay down, as I read it, a complete code for determining its dutiable value. It does prescribe the basis upon which \u201cthe dutiable value of property, or the value of a beneficial interest in property\u201d is to be determined, viz: its fair market value as at the date of the death of the deceased, and immediately enacts that \u201callowance shall be made for reasonable funeral expenses, debts, encumbrances,\u201d and for probate court and proctor\u2019s fees, subject to the explicit proviso that \u201cany debt or encumbrance for which an allowance is made shall be deducted from the value of the land or other subject of property liable thereto,\u201d and that an allowance shall not be made for certain descriptions of debts indicated in clauses (a) and (b) or \u201cmore than once for the same debt or encumbrance charged upon different portions of the estate.\u201d The term \u201cdutiable value\u201d is defined by s. 2 (d) as meaning simply \u201cthe value to which any rate is applied for the purpose of computation under s. 11.\u201d There is no mention either of \u201caggregate value\u201d or of \u201cthe property passing on the death\u201d of the deceased anywhere in the section. The introductory clause: \u201cIn determining the dutiable value of property, or the value of a beneficial interest in property,\u201d the mandatory proviso above quoted, and the whole context of the section appear to me to point to but one conclusion, viz: that the duty is intended to be assessed and levied distributively on the component parts of the property passing in the hands of the individual successors to whom it goes or has gone, and that the debts and expenses allowance is deductible only from such properties as are liable therefor.\nI can find nothing in ss. 3, 5 and 11 or in any other section of the entire Act to indicate that the duty is assessable and leviable upon the gross value of all property passing or deemed to pass, as a whole, and that the debts and expenses allowance is to be deducted from such gross amount, regardless of whether some or any of the properties passing or deemed to pass cannot in any manner be made legally liable for the payment of such debts and expenses.\nMr. Justice Baxter, who wrote the judgment of the Appeal Division, has exhaustively and lucidly expounded all the relevant provisions of the Act. I need add to those I have particularly discussed only ss. 19 and 22, the former of which enacts that the duty imposed shall be a lien upon the property out of which it is payable, while the latter frees the executor or trustee from any personal liability to pay the duty on any property to which any legatee, donee or other successor beneficially entitled, so long as he does not transfer such property without deducting therefrom the duty to which it is liable.\nFor these reasons I concur in the decision of the Appeal Division and would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hanson, Dougherty & West.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Co., a coal dealer, was allowed a revolving line of credit by respondent bank, which held security by way of hypothecation under s. 88 of the Bank Act on its coal and a general assignment of book debts. Appellant company shipped coal to E. Co. under a consignment agreement whereby (inter alia) the title to and ownership of the coal should remain in appellant until sale thereof by E. Co., E. Co. was to keep appellant\u2019s coal separate and apart from other coal, E. Co. was to pay certain freight, insurance and other expenses, it guaranteed the payment for all sales made by it remaining unpaid for 120 days, its compensation for its services and expenditures consisted solely of surplus realized on its sales over appellant\u2019s regular circular of prices, and it was to account, with particulars, to appellant at specified times, and make payment in accordance therewith within 7 days thereafter, interest being chargeable on amounts not so paid. By the agreement as finally made, a clause, contained in an earlier document, that appellant\u2019s share should be collected first and the funds should not foe confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of E. Co., but should be held separately and should immediately be deposited to appellant\u2019s account in a bank designated by appellant, was \u201ccancelled and annulled.\u201d In practice E. Co. deposited the proceeds of sales of all coal, including appellant\u2019s coal, in one account in respondent bank, and made its payments to appellant by cheques upon its general checking account in that bank. Certain moneys and negotiable instruments (drawn or taken in E. Co.\u2019s name) received by E. Co. from sales of appellant\u2019s coal and deposited in the bank during a time immediately preceding E. Co.\u2019s going into bankruptcy, were applied by the bank against E. Co.\u2019s indebtedness to it. Appellant claimed that the bank was not entitled to these as against appellant; that the moneys, etc., were in E. Co.\u2019s hands subject to a fiduciary obligation to appellant, that this fiduciary obligation was transmitted to the bank with the moneys, etc., the bank having, it was alleged, received them with notice of the obligation and with knowledge that the application thereof by E. Co. in liquidation of its debt to the bank would be a breach of that obligation. Held: Appellant\u2019s claim failed.\nPer Duff C.J. and Crocket J.: Even assuming that the proceeds of sales of appellant\u2019s coal were, as between E. Co. and appellant, held subject to a fiduciary obligation to appellant, that the bank had knowledge that the deposits of such proceeds were earmarked, and that the bank manager knew of the existence of a \u201cconsignment agreement,\u201d yet appellant\u2019s conduct precluded it from claiming the moneys as trust moneys; from disputing that, as to the proceeds of sales, the relation between it and E. Co. was that of creditor and debtor and not of cestui que trust and trustee. Appellant, in consenting to the deposit of the proceeds of the sales of its coal in E. Co.\u2019s account, mixed with E. Co.\u2019s moneys, combined with E. Co. in representing to the bank that these proceeds, so deposited, were not subject to any trust, but were moneys which E. Co. was authorized to deal with on the footing of moneys loaned to it by appellant. There was nothing in the evidence to displace the presumption that the bank followed the natural course in such circumstances, and treated the moneys as any reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position must have expected them to be treated, viz., as moneys placed at the disposition of E. Co.\nPer Rinfret J.: The agreement between appellant and E. Co. allowed E. Co. to deposit the proceeds of sales in E. Co.\u2019s general account and to use such proceeds (and dispose of them as its own) between the settlement dates, subject only to the obligation of remitting payments to appellant at the specified times; therefore E. Co.\u2019s relation to appellant, as to such proceeds, was not that of agent or trustee, but the relation was that of debtor and creditor. On this ground alone appellant failed. But further, on the evidence in the case, there were no circumstances likely to arouse the bank\u2019s suspicion that E. Co. was depositing appellant\u2019s money or using its funds without right.\nPer Cannon J.: Under the agreement E. Co. could, and did, mix with its own moneys the proceeds of sales of the coal supplied by appellant and use such proceeds for the purposes of its own business, provided it made the periodical payments under the agreement. In respect of such proceeds E. Co. was not a trustee but merely a debtor. Therefore, even had the bank been put upon enquiry and become fully acquainted with the arrangement between appellant and E. Co., it could have said that there was no trust which it was bound to recognize. And the evidence did not show any bad faith on the part of the bank.\nPer Hughes J.: On the evidence it must be taken (and the findings at trial were not sufficient in their extent to contradict) that the bank took the money and negotiable instruments in good faith and for value, and with no knowledge of unauthorized application thereof by E. Co.; and therefore\u2014regardless of whether E. Co. was a debtor or trustee of appellant in respect of the proceeds of sales of appellant\u2019s coal\u2014in view of the established rules of law with regard to dealings in money and negotiable instruments between parties in such a position as E. Co. and the bank, the appellant\u2019s claim against the bank could not succeed.\nHenry v. Hammond, [1913] 2 K.B. 515; London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons, [1892] A.C. 201; Thompson v.

APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] which reversed the judgment of Hazen C.J.[2] who held (as expressed in the formal judgment):\nthat all moneys received by the defendant from the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, from March 3rd, 1932, to the date of the bankruptcy of the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, in the form of money, cheques, promissory notes and bills of exchange by way of deposit, discount and collection, and which were the proceeds of the plaintiff\u2019s coal sold by the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, were the property of the plaintiff, for which the defendant must account and pay to the plaintiff.\nThe Appeal Division allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal, with costs, and ordered entry of judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim, with costs.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nC. F. Inches K.C. for the appellant.\nA. N. Carter for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed. The ground upon which that conclusion is based can be stated briefly.\nThe Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, were acting as factors for the appellants in the sale of their coal during a period which, I shall assume, lasted from May, 1931, until the Coal Docks went into bankruptcy in the spring of 1932. A draft agreement was drawn which is dated the 1st of May, 1931, the pertinent clauses of which are these:\nThe Factor agrees to receive as full compensation for all its services and expenditures such surplus amounts as the Factor may obtain and collect in excess of the Principal\u2019s regular circular of prices in effect at the time of shipment f.o.b. shipping point as aforesaid and to look for payment solely to such surplus so realized and collected from such sales made by the Factor. Such compensation shall not be deducted by the Factor until the Principal\u2019s share of such sale has been collected and paid to the Principal.\nThe Factor agrees to collect, as agent of the Principal, all accounts for coal sold by the Factor hereunder, it being understood that the Factor shall acquire no right to any such moneys so collected or to become due on such accounts, except as to said surplus. The Principal\u2019s share shall be collected first as aforesaid, and such funds shall not be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of the Factor, but shall be held separately and shall immediately be deposited to the account of the Principal at the or such other bank or banks as the Principal shall designate.\nEvery four weeks the Factor shall notify the Principal the amount of such collections and deposits and also the amount of any and all accounts remaining unpaid.\nThe Factor hereby guarantees the payment of all sales of coal made by it hereunder, and agrees that any account for coal sold hereunder which shall remain unpaid for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days, shall be deemed uncollectible, and the Factor shall thereupon make return and pay to the Principal on such account in the same manner as if collection had actually been made.\n* * *\nThe Factor will keep said anthracite coal separate and apart from all other coal and commodities, * * *\n* * *\nThe title to and ownership of all the coal shipped hereunder shall be and remain in the Principal until sale thereof by the Factor.\nThis agreement does not appear to have been executed by the Coal Docks. On the 24th of April, 1931, it was sent by Blizard, the President of the Coal Docks, to the appellants. On the 19th of June, 1931, it was returned to Blizard with some changes which are not material signed by the appellants. On the 11th of November, 1931, the formal agreement governing the relations of the parties at the material times was executed. It is convenient to reproduce it textually:\nAgreement, made this 11th day of November, 1931, by and between the M. A. Hanna Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Ohio, one of the United States of America, and having its head office at the city of Cleveland, in the state of Ohio, party of the first part, hereinafter called the \u201cPrincipal,\u201d and Eastern Coal Docks Limited, a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the province of New Brunswick and having its head office in the city of Saint John in said province, party of the second part, hereinafter called the \u201cFactor.\u201d\nWitnesseth:\nWhereas, under date of May 1, 1931, the parties hereto entered into a certain factor\u2019s agreement with reference to the sale of coal by the Factor as agent for the Principal,\nWhereas, through inadvertence, the said factor\u2019s agreement provided that it was to run from date thereof, to wit, the first day of May, 1931, until the 31st day of March, 1932, although the intention of the parties was that said factor\u2019s agreement should cover all coal shipped by the Principal to the Factor after November 1st, 1930, and certain coal was delivered prior to May 1, 1931, and\nWhereas, it is desired to amend said factor\u2019s agreement with respect to the manner of accounting by the Factor to the Principal for the proceeds from coal sold. Now, therefore, it is agreed by and between the parties hereto that said factor\u2019s agreement of May 1, 1931, shall be and the same is hereby amended as follows:\nThe term of said agreement shall be from November 1, 1930, to the thirty-first day of March, 1932.\nIn lieu of making payments to the Principal as in said factor\u2019s agreement provided, the Factor shall account to the Principal regularly in periods covering four (4) weeks\u2019 operation, giving kinds, sizes and amounts of all coal sold and delivered and the total sales money value thereof, also the amount in dollars of the collections made, and the amounts by periods of all customers accounts receivable representing sales made less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the end of said period.\nOf the amounts so collected the Factor shall remit to the Susquehanna Collieries Limited, Montreal, on behalf of the Principal, a remittance determined in the following manner:\nValue of all coal shipped hereunder at Principal\u2019s regular circular of prices in effect, at time of shipment f.o.b. shipping point, as in said factor\u2019s agreement provided or such other value as may from time to time be mutually agreed upon.........................................................................$\nPlus freight paid by Principal from shipping point to vessel\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.................................................$\nTotal........................................................................ $\nLess previous remittances...................................... $\nBalance................................................................... $\nLess value of Principal\u2019s coal on Factor\u2019s doc calculated as follows: (each size and grade to be calculated separately)\nAverage value of Principal\u2019s coal per ton, in effect at the\ntime of shipment, as shown on consignment memorandums..........................................................$\nFreight rate per ton.................................................$\nMarine insurance per ton.......................................$\nSteamer rate per ton..............................................$\nCustoms duty per ton.............................................$\nStevedoring per ton...............................................$\nTotal per ton value................................................$\nInventory......tons at $...........per ton.................... $\nAccounts receivable representing sales made within one\nhundred and twenty (120) days..................... $\nTotal.................................................................. $\nAmount of remittance........................................ $\nThe Factor shall make payments of such accounts and remittances in time for them to arrive in Montreal not more than seven (7) days after the last day of each accounting period. The Principal shall be entitled to interest at the rate of six per centum (6%) per annum on the amount so due from said seventh day until paid.\nAll bills covering coal sold hereunder by Factor shall be invoiced by Factor, \u201cEastern Coal Docks, Limited, agent for the M. A. Hanna Company.\u201d That part of said agreement dated May 1st, 1931, which reads: \u201cThe Principal\u2019s share shall foe collected first as aforesaid and such funds shall not be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of the Factor, but shall be held separately and shall immediately be deposited to the account of the Principal at the.............or such other bank or banks as the Principal shall designate.\u201d\nshall be and the same is hereby cancelled and annulled.\nExcept as herein specifically amended said factor\u2019s agreement of May 1, 1931, shall be and remain in full force and effect.\nThe Coal Docks proceeded to sell coal under this arrangement. They kept one account with the respondent bank in which they deposited their own moneys and the moneys of the appellants received from the sale of their coal. Returns and remittances were made pursuant to the agreement down to the 15th of March, 1932. On that date the final remittance was made, and it appears to have covered everything to which the appellants were entitled up to the 3rd of March, 1932. During the months of March and April, the Coal Docks paid into their account moneys received from the sale of the appellants\u2019 coal and these moneys were applied by the respondent Bank in liquidation of the indebtedness of the Coal Docks.\nOn behalf of the appellants, it is contended that these moneys were in the hands of the Coal Docks subject to a fiduciary obligation to them, that this fiduciary obligation was transmitted to the Bank with the moneys; the Bank having, it is alleged by the appellants, received the moneys with notice of the obligation and with knowledge that the application of these moneys by the Coal Docks, in liquidation of their debt to the Bank, would be a breach of that obligation.\nBy the agreement of the 1st of May, it was provided, as we have seen, that the appellants\u2019 share in moneys due upon sales \u201cshould be collected first,\u201d and that these funds should \u201cnot be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds\u201d of the Coal Docks, but should \u201cbe held separately and * * * immediately be deposited to the account of\u201d the appellants at a bank to be designated by them.\nBy the agreement of November 11th, this last mentioned clause was explicitly \u201ccancelled and annulled.\u201d In lieu thereof, these two clauses appear:\nIn lieu of making payments to the Principal as in said factor\u2019s agreement provided, the Factor shall account to the Principal regularly in periods covering four (4) weeks\u2019 operation, giving kinds, sizes and amounts of all coal sold and delivered and the total sales money value thereof, also the amount in dollars of the collections made, and the amounts by periods of all customers accounts receivable representing sales made less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the end of said period.\n* * * *\nThe Factor shall make payments of such accounts and remittances in time for them to arrive in Montreal not more than seven (7) days after the last day of each accounting period. The Principal shall be entitled to interest at the rate of six per centum (6%) per annum on the amount so due from said seventh day until paid.\nIt is not disputed that, in agreeing upon the terms of the contract of the 11th November, the parties contemplated that the Coal Docks should follow the course they did actually pursue, in depositing moneys received from sales of the appellants\u2019 coal with their own moneys in the same account.\nI do not think it is necessary to determine whether or not the moneys so deposited, which were the proceeds of the sales of the appellants\u2019 coal, were, as between the Coal Docks and the appellants, held subject to a fiduciary obligation to the appellants. It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal, in my judgment, to decide whether or not, in an action between the appellants and the Coal Docks, for example, the Coal Docks could have set up the Statute of Limitations in answer to the action. I have come to the conclusion that the conduct of the appellants precludes them from disputing that, as regards the proceeds of the sales, the relation between them and the Coal Docks was that of creditor and debtor, and not the relation of cestui que trust and trustee.\nI accept, for the purposes of this judgment, the finding of the learned Chief Justice, in which he imputes knowledge to the Bank that the deposits of the proceeds of the sale of the appellants\u2019 coal were earmarked. I accept his finding also that the manager knew of the existence of a \u201cconsignment agreement.\u201d The appellants, in my judgment, in consenting to the deposit of the proceeds of the sales of their coal in the Coal Docks\u2019 account, mixed with the Coal Docks\u2019 moneys, combined with the Coal Docks in representing to the Bank that these proceeds, so deposited, were not subject to any trust, but were moneys which the Coal Docks were authorized to deal with on the footing of moneys loaned to them by the appellants. I have carefully examined the whole of the evidence, and, accepting the finding of the learned Chief Justice, there is, I think, nothing in the evidence to displace the presumption that the Bank followed the natural course in such circumstances, and treated these moneys as any reasonable person in the position of the appellants must, I think, have expected them to be treated, viz., as moneys placed at the disposition of the Coal Docks.\nI do not think it is necessary to consider whether or not the reasoning followed by Lord Selborne in Towle v. White[3], by Lord Justice James and by Lord Justice Mellish in the same case (Ex parte White; In re Neville[4]), would, in view of the explicit provisions of the documents, apply to this case, and govern the reciprocal rights of the parties themselves. It is sufficient, for the disposition of this appeal, that the appellants by reason of their conduct are precluded from claiming these moneys as trust moneys.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s contention that it is entitled to claim as its own certain bills of exchange, promissory notes and money received by the respondent bank from Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, (hereinafter called the Docks Company) is professedly based on two written documents dated May 1st and November 11th, 1931.\nThe document dated November 11th was really the final outcome of the negotiations between the appellant and the Docks Company initiated by the document dated May 1st. On the evidence, there is abundant justification for the statement of Grimmer, J., speaking for the majority of the Appeal Division, that\nAs a matter of fact, though the consignment agreement was executed by the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. at an earlier date, yet the correspondence between these parties and their principals shews that it was not intended to take effect without alterations which were not finally made until 11th November, 1931.\nMoreover, the transactions between the Docks Company and the respondent bank, which are put in question by the appellant, all took place on and after March 3rd, 1932. This was several months after the execution of the second document which, to all appearances, would be the governing agreement during the material period of time. It is, however, interesting\u2014and it seems to me very important for the purposes of this case\u2014to compare the May document and the November document. In November, the parties, instead of drafting a new document, proceeded by the more complicated method of inserting in their agreement some of the provisions of the earlier document by mere reference thereto and of setting out in full only the amendments they had definitely agreed upon as a consequence of their negotiations. And the result of the case depends upon the true effect of these amendments on the contract finally arrived at.\nLong previous to the 1st of May, the appellant had been supplying coal to the Docks Company on a buy and sell basis.\nThe proposition contained in the May document was that the appellant would undertake to furnish anthracite coal to the Docks Company f.o.b. vessels at certain coal piers at Philadelphia or New York City. The Docks Company was to pay all freight, transportation and discharging charges on the coal, including cargo insurance and also all the assessments, licences, rent, storage and sale expenses and all charges of whatsoever nature incurred within the Dominion of Canada. It was further to insure the coal in the name of the appellant.\nThe Docks Company was to use its best efforts to sell the coal; and, until the sale thereof, the title to and ownership of all the coal shipped was to remain in the appellant.\nThe company was to receive as full compensation for all its services and expnditures such surplus amount as it might obtain and collect in excess of the appellant\u2019s regular circular of prices in effect at the time of shipment, and to look for payment solely to such surplus so realized and collected from the sales made by the company.\nThe company guaranteed the payment of all sales of coal made by it remaining unpaid for a period of 120 days; the company agreeing thereupon to make return and pay to the appellant on such sales in such manner as if collection had actually been made.\nThere were numerous other provisions mainly concerned with the relations of the parties at the termination of the agreement and which are not material here. But special attention must be given to the clauses of the agreement dealing with the collection of moneys and the remittance thereof by the Docks Company to the appellant. That question had been the main subject of discussion between them from May to November; and the amendments brought into the agreement definitely executed on November 11th were accepted on both sides as defining these matters about which up to that time the parties were not ad idem.\nIn the May document, the proposition was, to quote verbatim:\nThe Factor agrees to collect, as agent of the Principal, all accounts for coal sold by the Factor hereunder, it being understood that the Factor shall acquire no right to any such moneys so collected or to become due on such accounts, except as to said surplus\n(that is to say: the amount obtained in excess of the appellant\u2019s regular circular of prices already mentioned above).\nThe Principalis share shall be collected first as aforesaid, and such funds shall not be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of the Factor, but shall be held separately and shall immediately be deposited to the account of the Principal at the............or such other bank or banks as the Principal shall designate.\nEvery four weeks the Factor shall notify the Principal the amount of such collections and deposits and also the amount of any and all accounts remaining unpaid.\n* * *\nThe Factor agrees upon receipt thereof immediately to endorse, assign and deliver to any bank chosen by the Principal and operating in the City of Saint John any and all promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness representing and based upon such sales of coal to be held by said bank for collection subject to this agreement and as collateral to the sale price of said coal due the principal.\nThe agreement executed on November 11th departed from this system in a radical measure. In lieu of making payments to the appellant as was provided in the May document, and that is to say: by immediately depositing the funds to the account of the appellant at a bank which it was to designate; and in lieu of simply notifying the appellant every four weeks of the amounts of collection and of the deposits so made, the Docks Company was to account to the appellant in periods covering four weeks\u2019 operations\nof all coal sold and delivered and the total sales money value thereof, also the amount in dollars of the collections made, and the amounts by periods of all customers accounts receivable representing sales made less than 120 days prior to the end of said period. Of the amount so collected, the company was to remit to the appellant or on its behalf, only a portion thereof in a certain specified manner, into the details of which it is unnecessary to enter, except to note that it was not to include the accounts receivable representing sales made within 120 days, and that the company\u2019s equity in the coal (i.e. freight, insurance, steamers, customs duty, stevedoring and other charges paid by the company) was to be deducted.\nThe amount of the remittance was calculated in that way at the end of each period of four weeks\u2019 operations; and it was provided that the company\nshall make payments of such accounts and remittances in time for them to arrive in Montreal not more than seven days after the last day of each accounting period.\nThe appellant was entitled to interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum\non the amount so due from said seventh day until paid.\nFinally, it was specially agreed that that part of the May document which read as follows:\nThe Principal\u2019s share shall be collected first as aforesaid and such funds shall not be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of the Factor, but shall be held separately and shall immediately be deposited to the account of the Principal at the............or such other bank or banks as the Principal shall designate.\n\u201cshall be and the same is hereby cancelled and annulled.\u201d\nIn my view, these were modifications going to the very essence of the relations between the appellant and the Docks Company. They were brought about through the negotiations extending from the 1st of May until the agreement was executed on the 11th of November.\nIn the meantime, the appellant\u2019s auditors had been in Saint John several days in an endeavour to find a working mode of operation; and the officials of both companies had had conferences with a view to obtaining arrangements satisfactory to each side. The method of calculating the remittances and also the method in which the funds collected would be dealt with by the Docks Company during the periods preceding remittance time were the methods recommended by the appellant\u2019s auditors and fully understood and accepted by the officials of the appellant.\nThe understanding was and the effect of the agreement was, more particularly in the light of the changes agreed to in November, that there was to be no special and separate account at a bank designated by the appellant and into which the funds were to be deposited, or to which the promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness were to be endorsed, assigned or delivered, to be held by the said bank for collection. This is further confirmed in that, as a matter of fact, no such bank was ever designated by the appellant; and, as a matter of practice, the operations were never carried out in that way.\nUnder the agreement, both upon its construction and upon the way it was understood and carried out by the parties, the funds were not to be held separately, but they were allowed to be confused, mixed or commingled with the other funds of the Docks Company, and they were to be deposited or delivered, not at a special bank or into a special bank account, but into the general bank account of the Docks Company. The result is that in the meantime, that is, during the interval between periodic remittances, the Docks Company had the use of the funds as if they were its own and the appellant trusted to the company\u2019s ability to reimburse them in due course.\nThe appellant went into that agreement with complete understanding of its purport. The report of the appellant\u2019s auditors recommending the mode of operations adopted in the November agreement had drawn the attention of the appellant to the fact that this system of settlement would give the Docks Company the use of certain amounts from collections which would otherwise immediately be payable to the appellant. The appellant also knew, through the same report, that, as collections were made, they were deposited in a general bank account of the Docks Company. In point of practice, all remittances to the appellant without exception were made by means of cheques drawn by the Docks Company on this general account. The company never opened a special bank account, nor were they asked by the appellant to do so. No commercial paper was ever taken in the name of the appellant. The bills of exchange were drawn and the promissory notes were made in the name of the Docks Company. Consequently, of course, the appellant never received any. I repeat that each and every remittance the appellant received from the Docks Company was made in the form of a cheque drawn upon that company\u2019s general account. All these circumstances showing how the agreement was carried out are strong indications of how the parties understood the agreement and support the view already expressed as to its intention and its meaning.\nI, therefore, come to the conclusion that the agreement of November 11th allowed the Docks Company to deposit the proceeds of the sale of the appellant\u2019s coal in the Docks Company\u2019s general account and to use the proceeds thereof between the settlement dates, subject only to the obligation of remitting to the appellant a sum of money equivalent to the collections at the end of the remittance period agreed upon between the parties.\nAs a consequence, the relation of the Docks Company towards the appellant in respect of the funds collected was not that of agent or trustee, but the relation between them was that of debtor and creditor (Henry v. Hammond[5]). The Docks Company had the use of the funds and could dispose of them as its own; and, in that aspect of the question, it is, of course, immaterial whether they disposed of it in favour of the bank respondent or in favour of other persons.\nOn this ground alone, I think the appeal would fail; and it makes it unnecessary to discuss the further question whether the circumstances of the case were such that the bank was put on inquiry; for, in the words of Lord Herschell, in The London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[6]:\nWhen it is said that a person is put on inquiry the result in point of law is that he is deemed to know the facts which he would have ascertained if he had made inquiry. He cannot better his position by abstaining from so doing. On the other hand, his position cannot be worse than it would have been had he made inquiry and been in possession of the result of it.\nI feel, however, like Lord Macnaghten, in that same case (at p. 224), and I am unwilling to pass by in silence the question whether in the premises the bank was bound to inquire, lest I should seem to intimate a doubt for which, in my opinion, there is no occasion.\nIt should be remembered that, as far back as December, 1930, the bank and the Docks Company had entered into an agreement whereby the bank agreed to loan and advance to the company the moneys required for the purpose of enabling it to carry on and finance its coal business. In consideration of a revolving line of credit of $50,000 to be opened by the bank, the company agreed to give and did give the bank security by way of hypothecation, under sec. 88 of the Bank Act, and an assignment of all book debts due or thereafter to become due to the company. This was done on the security of all coal, coke and firewood then owned or which might be owned by the Docks Company, from time to time while any advance made under said credit remained unpaid, and which then or might thereafter be in or on the wharves, and warehouses, railway cars, freighters or property of the Docks Company or adjacent thereto in the city of Saint John. The agreement was duly filed in the office of the registrar of deeds, and, pursuant to it, the Docks Company transferred and assigned to the bank all debts, demands or choses in action then due or thereafter to become due.\nEver since December, 1930, as between the bank and the Docks Company, the business of the latter was conducted under the terms of the agreement so entered into and so registered. From the inception, in December, 1930, and, in my view, for the whole period extending up to November 11th, 1931, the Docks Company\u2019s business was placed on the basis that they purchased their coal from the wholesale dealers, and they were strictly the owners thereof. The appellant, no doubt, attempted in the November agreement to make its terms retroactive from November 1st, 1930; but it is needless to say that it was not within the power of the parties to that agreement to make those terms effective against the respondent and thus summarily set aside the rights already vested in the bank.\nIn July, 1931, the bank was approached by the Docks Company with a view of finding out upon what terms it would be willing to finance a plan of business whereby the appellant would ship its coal to the Docks Company on a consignment basis. As a result of the interviews had and the correspondence exchanged between the company and the local manager of the respondent at Saint John, the company was told that the bank did not approve the plan and that, pursuant to express instructions from the bank\u2019s head-office, if the company entered into the proposed agreement with the appellant, it would have to transfer its account to another bank. I do not think anything can be made out of the fact that, in his last letter of instructions to the local manager in Saint John, the bank\u2019s general manager finally yielded to the idea that a trial of the proposition might be made for a few months, as it is not shewn that this suggestion was ever communicated to the officials of the Docks Company. In point of fact, no understanding of any kind in connection with shipments of coal on a consignment basis is proven to have been arrived at between the manager of the local branch and the Docks Company. As between them, upon the evidence, matters were left where they stood when the company was told that, if they went into the consignment agreement with the appellant, they would have to take their account to another bank.\nThe bank was never shown either the document of May 1st or the agreement of November 11th; and it was never made aware of its contents. Matters went on as between the bank and the company in the same way as they had been going on before. Moneys were deposited as usual in the same general account. Bills of exchange and promissory notes were drawn or made exclusively in the name of the Docks Company. There was nothing to bring home to the bank that anything had been changed in the company\u2019s business, or that they had entered into a factor\u2019s agreement. And this is true of the whole dealings up to the very end.\nThe appellant laid much stress on the fact that for a certain time, in 1931 and 1932, the Docks Company was in the habit of making two deposits daily accompanied by two separate deposit slips on which certain notations appeared. There were also certain markings on the bills and promissory notes discounted by the bank. It was strongly urged that this was of a nature to arouse suspicion.\nI confess my inability to agree with the suggestion. The two daily deposits were made in the general bank account in existence from the beginning of the operations, and the practice of making the notations on the deposit slips had started long before the date of the consignment agreement with the appellant. These markings or notations were not brought to the attention of the responsible officials of the bank. When heard at the trial, they testified that they had not noticed them; and all witnesses having knowledge of banking practice stated these markings or notations were usual; they were made by customers for office records and they conveyed no meaning to the bank. No attempt was made to shake that testimony by adducing evidence to the contrary. It was rather the other way, the Docks Company\u2019s officials and employees all stating that they did not attach any importance to these markings and they were put there merely for office checking purposes.\nSuch were therefore the circumstances. Never at any time was the bank told that the Docks Company were in fact operating on consignment for anybody. After the consignment agreement, there was no apparent change in the company\u2019s usual method of banking. The president of the company had told the bank, indeed had written to the bank that, if the proposed arrangement was effected, the receipts would be deposited in another bank, or, at least, in a separate bank account and notes or drafts would be endorsed over to that bank or to that account; also that the drafts and notes would be made by the Docks Company as agents. Nothing of that character was ever done.\nThe bank had told the Docks Company that, in case the consignment agreement was executed, the company would not be allowed to mix the funds and it would have to carry its account to another bank. There is no evidence of any subsequent interview having taken place after that between the company\u2019s officials and the bank\u2019s local manager. As late as September 29th\u2014and, therefore, more than two months after the last letter exchanged or the last interview between the president of the Docks Company and the bank manager\u2014the monthly statement sent by the company continued to show the anthracite coal as being still subject to the bank\u2019s lien. The coal was not sold by the Docks Company ostensibly as agent. The commercial paper was not dealt with in such a way as to indicate that there was a principal. Everything pointed to the fact that the proposed arrangement had fallen through. Why should the bank become suspicious? Up till then, it had no reason to suppose it was not dealing with honest people. Prom these people the bank was receiving, as it had been in the habit of receiving for a long time before, moneys and negotiable instruments and it was taking them in the ordinary way to cover its current advances (See Lord Macnaghten in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[7]). The bank had no reason to doubt they had full authority to dispose of these moneys or securities as belonging to them or as being at their disposal, or to pay them into their bank account. (Thompson v. Clydesdale Bank[8], per the Lord Chancellor at p. 288, per Lord Watson at p. 289). It need hardly be remembered that we are in the field of mercantile operations having to do with currency and with negotiable instruments, where \u201cit is expedient and necessary that reasonable and safe facilities should be afforded\u201d (per Lord Herschell in the Simmons case[9]; and see Union Investment Company v. Wells[10]). Furthermore, we are discussing commercial transactions in moneys, bills and notes deposited or presented for discount by a company against whose goods, accounts, book debts, commercial paper and choses in action the bank held a general assignment. The bank was not to be expected to inquire into the source of the moneys deposited or into the authority of the Docks Company to draw the bills or to take the notes in its own name. In that respect, it could safely trust that the company\u2019s customers would not accept the bills or give the notes in that form if these bills or notes were not strictly in accordance with the true character of the transactions thereby represented.\nThe bank held its general assignment which, on its face, covered exactly the same kind of property in April, 1932, as in December, 1930, at the beginning of its operations with the Docks Company. It had every reason to assume that if the Docks Company went into any agreement with some outside party of a nature in any way to affect the comprehensive rights it held under the assignment, this would not be done without its consent and even its participation. In addition, there was the fact that the proposition had been actually submitted to the bank and turned down by it; and the further fact that, the proposition having been so turned down, the bank heard nothing about it subsequently.\nThe appellant points to an odd sentence in a vague conversation, and, of course, to the notations and the marks already adverted to and also to the fact that at a certain time the monthly statements sent by the Docks Company to the bank failed to show anthracite coal. I do not see that these facts had any real significance, more particularly having regard to the general trend of events proved in this case. \u201cIt is easy enough,\u201d as was said by Lord Herschell in the Simmons case[11],\nto make an elaborate presentation after the event of the speculations with which the bank managers might have occupied themselves in reference to the capacity in which the broker who offered the bonds as security for an advance held them. I think, however, they were not bound to occupy their minds with any such speculations. And, in my view, the same thing may be said of the respondent. I cannot find, in the present case, evidence of circumstances likely to arouse the suspicion that the Docks Company was depositing the appellant\u2019s money or using its funds without right\u2014far less, if such a condition be required for the appellant\u2019s success, evidence of circumstances reasonably giving rise to \u201ca suspicion of something wrong combined with a wilful disregard of the means of knowledge\u201d (per Willes, J., in Raphael v. Bank of England[12]), or evincing \u201ca design or fixed purpose to avoid knowing\u201d (per Lord Selborne in The Agra Bank v. Barry[13]).\nAll this discussion, however, in my view of the case and as already stated, is only supplementary. I have felt that I should express myself on the subject because of the argument addressed to us by the appellant, but my view is that, in respect of the funds in dispute, the true relations between the appellant and the Docks Company were those of debtor and creditor, with the consequence that the appellant has no just and valid claim against the respondent.\nI conclude that the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick reversing the decision of the trial judge, Hazen, C.J., who declared the title to certain moneys and negotiable instruments paid to and discounted with the respondent by the Eastern Coal Docks, Ltd., and being the proceeds of retail sales of hard coal shipped in wholesale lots by the appellant to the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd., to be in the appellant, and ordered a reference to determine the amount of damages. The Court of Appeal held that these moneys and negotiable instruments belonged to the respondent, (1) as transferee from the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. when owner, and (2) as a bona fide holder for value.\nIn December, 1930, the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd., while carrying on a hard and soft coal business in Saint John, N.B., buying coal from wholesale dealers, including the appellant, and selling it locally, made an arrangement with the respondent under which it was granted a revolving line of credit of $50,000 for its fuel business on the security of a hypothecation under s. 88 of the Bank Act on all its coal and also on a general assignment of its book debts and various powers in connection with the loans and security.\nTwo accounts were opened by the respondent under the arrangement: (a) The company\u2019s checking account into which the respondent paid the loans made under the credit and on which the company could draw cheques; (b) The bank\u2019s security account, against which the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. could not draw cheques, but in which it deposited the proceeds of its sales of coal, whether cash, notes or drafts, which were taken by the respondent and deducted from the loan then outstanding.\nWhen the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. made this banking arrangement, it was purchasing and continued to purchase anthracite coal outright from the appellant.\nIn July, 1931, the company informed Mr. Harper, the respondent\u2019s manager at Saint John, that they contemplated an arrangement to sell appellant\u2019s coal on consignment.\nAfter corresponding about this proposal with the general manager in Montreal, Harper wrote Blizard, the President of the Coal Company, that the bank would have to call all loans made to the company and close their account if the company entered into the arrangement as disclosed. They intimated, however, that, if the company would segregate the consignment coal from that subject to the bank\u2019s lien, would place drafts for the consignment coal for collection only and remit the proceeds only upon payment and not by way of discount, the bank might consider the proposal; otherwise not. Thereupon, on July 25th, Blizard undertook, in the event of the proposal being acted upon, to deposit the receipts in a separate bank account and to endorse the notes or drafts to the bank for collection only and deposit after payment.\nAfter further correspondence, the head office in Montreal was willing to make a trial of the proposal outlined in Harper\u2019s letter of July 27th to Mr. Roy, which said:\nWe will have a separate account on our books, in which moneys received from the sale of this coal will be deposited, * * * [The drafts] will be placed for collection only, and our customers will make these drafts as agents.\nIt is clear that no consignment arrangement had then been made with the Eastern Goal Docks Ltd., as on that same date, August 12th, the coal company sent a list of accounts to be paid to the bank and wrote:\nIn addition to the above, we have a stock of American anthracite here, approximately $51,500, which will become part of the consignment agreement * * * if we go into that deal with them. On this basis M. A. Hanna Company would have an equity in this coal for its invoice value $42,728.03, but at the present time this $42,728.03 stands as an Account Payable and the stock of coal as part of your security under Section 88.\nIn August also Mr. Robinson, the Assistant Manager of the respondent at Saint John, under Mr. Harper\u2019s instructions, told Mr. Thompson, the Secretary Treasurer of the company, that the bank could not allow them to mix the Hanna funds with their own; and Thompson promised that he would not.\nThe suggested proposal, so far as the bank was informed, was not acted upon. The statement forwarded by the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd., under date of September 29, showing 2,320 tons of American anthracite on hand on September 17th, and therefore subject to the bank\u2019s lien, would confirm the fact that the proposed consignment arrangement had not yet been effected. It was only on November 11th that a definite arrangement was made with regard to the sale on consignment of coal by the appellant to the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. The radical changes made to the proposal bearing date May 1st were to the following effect:\n(a) The Eastern Coal Docks was to account to the appellant regularly in periods covering four weeks\u2019 operation, giving amounts of coal sold, amounts in dollars of the collections made, and the amounts by periods of all customers\u2019 accounts receivable representing sales made less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the end of said period;\n(b) Of the amounts so collected, the Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. were to remit to the Susquehanna Collieries Limited, on behalf of the appellant, a remittance made up according to a certain schedule which included as a deduction accounts receivable made within 120 days and certain charges;\n(c) The Eastern Coal Docks was required to make payments of the account and remittances in time to arrive in Montreal not more than seven days after the last day of each accounting period;\n(d) The Eastern Coal Docks was required to pay 6 per cent interest on all overdue amounts;\n(e) The following very important clause in the draft agreement dated May 1st, 1931, was cancelled:\nThe Principal\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] share shall be collected first as aforesaid, and such funds shall not be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of the Factor, but shall be held separately and shall immediately be deposited to the account of the Principal at the or such other bank or banks as the Principal shall designate.\nFrom the foregoing facts, it is fair to say that up to and after November 11th, 1931, the appellant had allowed the Eastern Coal Docks to use the proceeds of the sale of the coal and to deposit them in the latter\u2019s general account, without restriction or complaint. The settlement of accounts between the appellant and its client gives the latter the use of an equivalent amount from collections which would otherwise be immediately payable to Hanna. The memorandum accompanying the report indicates that, at least up to the 17th September, 1931, the appellant allowed collections from customers to be made by the Eastern Coal Docks and deposited in their general bank account, and not in the appellant\u2019s name; and I believe that the agreement of November 11th approved this arrangement, as it relieves the Eastern Coal Docks of any obligation to deposit moneys in a separate account in the appellant\u2019s name and requires them only to remit every four weeks, not including accounts receivable representing sales made within 120 days.\nAppellant\u2019s witness E. G. Thompson swears that either Mr. Baile, President of the Susquehanna Collieries Ltd., or Mr. Scott, the attorney of the appellant, said to Mr. Blizard, when the agreement was completed in November, that the Eastern Coal Docks was to have the use or possession of the money between the settlement dates; and that the only gamble they were taking was the amount of one month\u2019s remittance. It would appear that the appellant was then quite content to permit its customer to collect the proceeds of the consignment coal, deposit the money in its own account and use it for its own purpose, provided that it made a remittance every four weeks calculated on the basis contained in the agreement of November 11th.\nBetween October, 1931, and March, 1932, The Eastern Coal Docks, in its own name and on its own account, drew cheques against the respondent in favour of Susquehanna Collieries, a subsidiary of the appellant, and representing remittances aggregating over $68,000. These cheques were positive notice to the appellant that the Eastern Coal was paying the proceeds of the consignment coal to the respondent and discounting drafts for its price with the respondent. As the appellant did not object to this procedure, or give the respondent notice that it objected to the payments so made, it would show the inanity of any suggestion that the Eastern Coal Docks in paying the moneys and cheques or negotiating the drafts and notes was doing so improperly or with a defective title.\nThe appellant, at page 21 of its factum, after discussing the situation, says:\nIf these are the facts, there may have been no breach of trust in the Factor depositing the moneys in the general account in the first instance, but they were put there for an express purpose, with the knowledge of the bank manager, and the bank manager, who was undoubtedly watching the account, with knowledge of the beneficial ownership of the moneys in the plaintiff, was guilty of breach of trust in refusing to allow the Factor to remit to its principal at the end of the month; it converted the money to its own use with knowledge of the trust, and refused to allow the Factor to remit to its principal.\nThe trial judge found that the bank manager must have known that these moneys were the appellants\u2019 property, while the Court of Appeal found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove this essential element of their claim.\nThe remittances were made, through advances made by the respondent, until, in March, 1932, a representative of the Consolidated Coal, which had been selling to the Eastern Coal Docks soft coal, told the respondent\u2019s manager that they owned an unpaid claim of $28,000; and as Mr. Harper had learned shortly before that an English coal company had also a claim, he refused to make further advances, except for wages, after March. Early in May, 1932, the Eastern Coal Docks went into liquidation owing the bank about $7,000 above its securities.\nIn their statement of claim, the plaintiffs allege that on the 12th May and June 1st, 1932, by two letters, they notified the defendant that the moneys and securities deposited with them by the Eastern Coal Docks from March 3rd to May 8th, 1932, were the property of the plaintiffs and demanded the return thereof; and they allege that the defendant knew or should have known that said moneys, bills of exchange, promissory notes were the property of the plaintiffs.\nHave the appellants proven their exclusive ownership and the knowledge which would deprive the respondent of the protection which it claims from the following sections of the Bills of Exchange Act?\n3. A thing is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of this Act, where it is in fact done honestly whether it is done negligently or not.\n53. (1) Valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted by\n(a) Any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract;\n(b) An antecedent debt or liability.\n56. (1) A holder in due course is a holder who has taken a bill, complete and regular on the face of it, under the following conditions, namely:\u2014\n* * *\n(b) That he took the bill in good faith and for value, and that at the time the bill was negotiated to him he had no notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it.\n74. The rights and powers of the holder of a bill are as follows:\n* * *\n(b) Where he is a holder in due course, he holds the bill free from any defect of title of prior parties, as well as from mere personal defences available to prior parties among themselves, and may enforce payment against all parties liable on the bill.\nIt appears from the above quotation from the appellant\u2019s factum that the parties take the common ground that the Eastern Coal Docks Company committed no breach of trust in depositing the moneys and securities in their general account. Have the appellants proven their allegation that the respondent, through their manager\u2019s knowledge, became trustees and are now bound to pay to the appellants the proceeds of the hard coal sold by their customer under their agreement?\nTo completely constitute a trust, four elements are required: (a) A trustee; (b) A beneficiary; (c) Property the subject-matter of the trust; (d) An obligation enforceable in Court of Equity on the trustee to administer or deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiary. There must be an equitable interest based on a conscientious obligation which can be enforced against the legal owner of the property alleged to be the subject-matter of the trust. Otherwise there is no trust.\nAppellant does not contend that an \u201cexpress trust\u201d was created by express terms. Can they contend that an \u201cimplied trust\u201d existed from the conduct of the parties to this transaction? It is difficult for the court to consider that it was the intention of the parties that a trust should be created because, as pointed out above, the course of action of the appellant and the coal company in dealing with these securities and in accepting advances from the bank show that the latter had no intimation whatsoever that the deposit of these moneys and bills receivable to the credit of their customer was in any way objectionable to the appellants. Can it be said that a \u201cconstructive\u201d trust arises in this case? Do we find a trustee having received in his capacity as trustee property which, though not composing an express trust, he is not entitled to retain for his own benefit? Or is this the case of a stranger to a trust having received property belonging to the trust in circumstances which do not entitle him to retain it as against the beneficiary? If either of these questions must be answered in the affirmative, such property would be held subject to a constructive trust for the beneficiaries under, and on the terms of, the original trust.\nBut, is there evidence of an original trust? Under the agreement, the coal company could and did mix with their own moneys the proceeds of the coal supplied by the appellant and use the proceeds for the purposes of their business, provided they made a payment to the appellant every four weeks. These facts, taken with the provision for the payment of interest on overdue remittances, which was subsequently (Jan. 21, 1932) insisted on by the appellant, and the form of the accounts accompanying the remittances; go far to show that the relation existing after, as well as before, November 11, 1931, was that of debtor and creditor. See Henry v. Hammond[14]:\nIt is clear that if the terms upon which the person receives the money are that he is bound to keep it separate, either in a bank or elsewhere, and to hand that money so kept as a separate fund to the person entitled to it, then he is a trustee of that money and must hand it over to the person who is his cestui que trust. If on the other hand he is not bound to keep the money separate, but is entitled to mix it with his own money and deal with it as he pleases, and when called upon to hand over an equivalent sum of money, then, in my opinion, he is not a trustee of the money, but merely a debtor. All the authorities seem to me to be consistent with that statement of the law.\nHalsbury\u2019s Laws of England (2nd Ed.), Vol. 1, p. 247, s. 420, says:\nWhere money is intrusted to an agent by his principal or received by him on his principal\u2019s behalf, it depends upon the terms of the agency whether the agent is bound to keep the money separate or is entitled to mix it with his own. In the former case the agent will be a trustee, in the latter a debtor.\nThis case is distinguishable from Reid-Newfoundland Co. v. Anglo-American Telegraph Co.[15], because the money sought to be recovered did not come into the possession of the respondents owing to an unauthorized and improper use of the appellants\u2019 property. I would be inclined to find that we have here a mere debt arising out of transactions in respect of property, namely, coals, as to which property, no doubt, it may possibly be said that the coal company was in a sense a trustee. They were employed to sell the coals, and to receive the money for them; but they were under no obligation to keep the money so received as a separate fund, but were entitled to mix it with their own moneys, and they were merely debtors for the amount of the ultimate balance due, at the end of each period, as above detailed.\nIt cannot be said that the coal company fraudulently converted to its own use or fraudulently omitted to account, under the terms of article 355 of the Criminal Code, because it was agreed between the parties that the proceeds of the coals would form an item in a debtor and creditor account between the coal company and the appellant; and the latter relied only on the personal liability of the company as its debtor. The proper entry of the proceeds of the coal in the accounts, according to the forms prepared by the appellant, was a sufficient accounting, and in such case no fraudulent conversion of the amount accounted for can be deemed to have taken place.\nTherefore, even if the respondent had been put upon inquiry and had become fully acquainted with the arrangement between the appellant and the coal company,\nit could have said that there was no trust which it was bound to recognize, for none was created by the instrument. So even if the [respondent\u2019s] manager was wilfully shutting his eyes to that which was visible to him, yet, had he looked at it, it would have done the [Bank] no harm.\nI agree with the above quoted views of Grimmer and Richards, JJ., on this point and rely also on the authorities quoted by them.\nNow then, if the idea of an original trust be eliminated, how can the appellant succeed? Is the constructive notice relied upon by the trial judge sufficient to make the respondents liable?\nTheir manager, Harper, was never informed that the Eastern Coal Docks had actually entered into a consignment agreement; their returns for August 12 and September 29 plainly showed that they had not; and no such agreement was in fact made until November 11th. There is no evidence that the draft or final agreement was ever communicated to the respondent. Harper, some time after November 11, became aware that the Eastern Coal Docks were receiving consignment coal when he noticed the segregation of the hard and soft. It may be said that he should have inquired at this stage into all particulars as to the consignment agreement. But he had the promise of both Blizard and Thompson and had made his own position quite clear. He was surely entitled to rely on their honesty and integrity without laying himself and the respondent open to a charge of fraud for having done so.\nCredit, not distrust, is the basis of commercial dealings; mercantile genius consists principally in knowing whom to trust and with whom to deal, and commercial intercourse and communication is no more based on the supposition of fraud than it is on the supposition of forgery.\nper Bowen, L.J., in Sanders v. Maclean[16].\nI agree with Grimmer, J., who observed also that The learned Chief Justice has not found that Harper was acting in bad faith but has simply pointed out the things which he infers that he knew or must have known. I cannot find in the evidence anything to convince me that the bank manager was acting mala fide. Had the learned Chief Justice found actual fraud or wilful shutting of the eyes of the manager I would have considered that it proceeded from his observation of the demeanour of the witness on the stand and would not have felt at liberty to interfere with it. But he simply finds knowledge of certain facts, which knowledge is not incompatible with good faith. The burden of establishing mala fides rests upon the plaintiff. I do not think that it has been discharged.\nMr. Harper may have been negligent in not distrusting Blizard and Thompson, but this falls far short of dishonesty which alone would affect the bank. See Raphael v. Bank of England[17]. In Agra Bank, Ltd. v. Barry[18], Lord Hatherley said at pp. 154-155:\nTo say that a suspicion of this sort must have crossed his mind, and that if he did not act upon this suspicion he is to be held guilty of a wilful determination not to have his eyes opened, would be to say what is not warranted. It would be perfectly monstrous to hold any doctrine of that sort. He is amply relieved from that by what had previously taken place.\nMoreover, the appellant had been trusting Blizard and Thompson throughout, not even troubling to inform the bank of their alleged claim of ownership to the proceeds of the coal. The suggestion that Harper acted fraudulently because he did not distrust Blizard cannot avail.\nKekewich, J. seems to have been under the impression that relying on the broker\u2019s honesty, did not alter the result. But to my mind it makes the whole difference.\nper Lord Halsbury in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[19].\nThe only consideration likely to engage his [i.e. the bank manager\u2019s] attention is whether the security is sufficient to justify the advances required.\n(ibid) per Lord Herschell at p. 223. Even if the bank manager knew that the hard coal came from the appellant, under some sort of consignment agreement entered into at a date that was ignored by him, that the company continued to make two bank deposits as had been their practice since June 1st, 1931, long before the alleged consignment agreement, this would not be sufficient to establish any bad faith in the respondent.\nI also believe that the notations on the deposit slips and the prefacing of the ledger references on the requisition slips, drafts and notes in some instances with the letters S (for Susquehanna) and H (for Hanna) are not sufficient to dispel the presumption of good faith of the manager, supported as it is by the sworn evidence of all witnesses heard on both sides, On their face, none of these notes were payable to the company as agents for the appellants. It would be very difficult to hold as a fact that these letters, used for the purpose they were, fixed the respondent with notice that they represented the proceeds of Hanna or Susquehanna coal. It would be contrary to the rule that constructive notice is not extended to commercial transactions. A person taking a negotiable instrument in good faith and for value obtains a title valid against all the world. And I believe, after reading carefully the record, that it discloses no evidence of bad faith; the appellant failed to satisfy me that there was anything that actually excited the suspicion in the bank manager\u2019s mind that there was something wrong in his transactions with the coal company, or in the latter\u2019s dealing with the appellant. Because of this absence of suspicion, the taker of these negotiable instruments cannot be said to be in bad faith, to have deliberately shut his eyes to the facts or to have put any suspicions aside without further inquiry. See London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[20], per Lord Herschell at p. 221.\nIn Union Investment Co. v. Wells[21], Duff, J., now Chief Justice of Canada, said at p. 648:\nThe doctrine of constructive notice is not applicable to current bills and notes transferred for value, but in all cases when the good faith of the holder is in issue the question is a question of fact to be determined on the circumstances of the particular case;\nThe following statement of the rule by Lindley, L.J., concurred in by Lopes and Rigby, L.JJ., in Manchester Trust v. Furness[22], was recently adopted by the English Court of Appeal in Greer v. Downs Supply Co.[23]:\nAs regards the extension of the equitable doctrines of constructive notice to commercial transactions, the Courts have always set their faces resolutely against it. The equitable doctrines of constructive notice are common enough in dealing with land and estates, with which the Court is familiar; but there have been repeated protests against the introduction into commercial transactions of anything like an extension of those doctrines, and the protest is founded on perfect good sense. In dealing with estates in land title is everything, and it can be leisurely investigated; in commercial transactions possession is everything, and there is no time to investigate title; and if we were to extend the doctrine of constructive notice to commercial transactions we should foe doing infinite mischief and paralyzing the trade of the country.\nThis rule as to constructive notice applies, if its application were required, equally to the notations on the deposit slips, to the cheques drawn on the respondent and to the ledger references on the requisitions, drafts and notes.\nIt may be said with fairness that the appellant, knowing, as it did, the imperative need of the coal company for banking accommodation, and receiving, as it was every month, very large remittances by cheques drawn on the respondent, refrained from informing the respondent of its claim to own the proceeds of the coal, either because it was treating in fact the account as a debtor and creditor account, or because it did not think it expedient to embarrass the coal company in its banking arrangement. Whatever may have been the appellant\u2019s motive, while prepared to take advantage of its failure to notify the respondent that it claimed ownership of moneys which it knew the Eastern Coal Docks was paying to the respondent, it now seeks to make the respondent responsible for a situation which was due to its own default. In such circumstances, it is clearly inequitable that it should succeed, for\nwhenever one of two innocent persons must suffer by the acts of a third, he who has enabled such third person to occasion the loss must sustain it.\nper Ashhurst, J., in Lickbarrow v. Mason[24], a statement approved and adopted by the Privy Council in Commonwealth Trust v. Akotey[25].\nIt is too late now to try to bolster their claim by saying that the instrument established in their favour the ownership of the coal and of the proceeds thereof\u2014this instrument may be binding between the parties, but does not bind the bank unless it knowingly acted contrary to it. The so-called \u201cfactor\u201d was entitled to retain out of the proceeds of the sales a considerable equity, the transportation and insurance charges, the cost of unloading, storage and his profit. Was the bank called upon to investigate and make in each case a division of these proceeds between the appellant and the coal company? Evidently nothing of the sort could be reasonably expected. As pointed out by the Court of Appeal, although the parties employ the word \u201cfactor\u201d in the agreement, yet, it is difficult to say, in point of law, that the coal company was a \u201cfactor\u201d in the true sense. They have allowed the use or possession of the moneys received from their sales, and therefore the language of Cozens-Hardy, M.R., in Weiner v. Harris[26], is applicable:\nIt is quite plain that by the mere use of a well-known legal phrase you cannot constitute a transaction that which you attempt to describe by that phrase. Perhaps the commonest instance of all, which has come before the Courts in many phases, is this: Two parties enter into a transaction and say \u201cIt is hereby declared that there is no partnership between us.\u201d The Court pays no regard to that. The Court looks at the transaction and says: \u201cIs this, in point of law, really a partnership? It is not in the least conclusive that the parties have used a term or language intended to indicate that the transaction is not that which in law it is.\u201d\nNothing has been placed before us to weaken the strength of the following part of the judgment of Grimmer, J.:\nHad the bank been put upon inquiry as to the existence of this agreement more than its actual contents could not be presumed against them. Per Lord Herschell in Simmons case[27] at p. 732. The agreement provides that the company \u201cguarantees the payment of all sales of coal made by it hereunder.\u201d It was to pay the plaintiff for any coal sold and unpaid for 120 days which was to be deemed uncollectable \u201cas if such collection had actually been made.\u201d The company was to receive the difference between the plaintiff\u2019s circular of prices and its actual receipts as its compensation. That of itself would not prevent the relation of factor and principal from being established but nowhere in the agreement do we find that the company is to sell the coal ostensibly as agent. The few instances of sales given in evidence shew unmistakably that they sold in the name of the company and that commercial paper was not taken in the name of the plaintiff or in such a way as to indicate that there was a principal. Suppose that there were accounts uncollectable as defined by the agreement. If the company paid the plaintiff as if those accounts had been collected would not the moneys from a delayed collection belong to the company? Besides they were carrying on a soft coal business and it seems to me that if the bank had had full knowledge of the agreement each deposit would have required an audit to ascertain whether or not the plaintiffs had any interest in it. Besides the plaintiffs never required the clause of the agreement as to delivery \u201cto a bank chosen by the principal of all promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness representing and based upon the sales of coal,\u201d to be acted upon. They never named a bank and it is quite possible, judging from the correspondence, that this clause was intended to be deleted. At all events it never was acted upon. Then we have the four weeks\u2019 credit. The plaintiff recognized that that was, as one of the officers called it \u201ca gamble.\u201d It is easy to apply the language of James L.J. in Ex parte White: In re Nevill[28], at p. 75. He says\u2014\n\u201cMr. Nevill was not to pay immediately. Even if he sold for cash Towle & Co. had no right to say \u2018you have sold the goods for cash, therefore hand over the moneys to us at once\u2019 for Nevill would have justly said, \u2018No; the bargain between us is that I am to give you an account at the end of the month and to pay you at the end of another month. My selling for cash does not alter the nature of the bargain between you and me, or entitle you to call upon me to hand the moneys over to you, or to put the money in medio and keep them for you.\u2019 The proceeds of sale in fact were his own moneys and not trust moneys, and he was at liberty to deposit them with a banker or deal with them as he pleased.\u201d\nSee also same case, sub nom, Towle & Co. v. White[29], where Lord Selborne L.C. says\u2014\n\u201cIt was argued that this was the account of Towle & Co. and that the balance was to be treated as a trust fund belonging to them. When we trace back the sums brought into the account to their source, it appears that they were the proceeds of sales in the market to outside purchasers, effected by Nevill, of goods which he had received, under the circumstances presently mentioned, from Towle & Co. Now, if these contracts were all contracts made by Nevill as agent for Towle & Co., then, of course, the consequence would follow that the proceeds of these sales coming into this account would be the moneys of Towle & Co. But if these contracts were between the purchasers and Nevill, Nevill\u2019s contracts, contracts in which he was the person interested, then the proceeds of those sales were Nevill\u2019s, whatever liabilities he might be under to Towle & Co. in respect of the terms arranged between him and them.\u201d\nI, therefore, reach the conclusion that the knowledge and conditions necessary to constitute the trust alleged by the appellant did not exist in fact; and, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHughes J.\u2014This action was brought by the appellant against the respondent to recover the amount of certain sums of money and the proceeds of certain bills of exchange deposited by Eastern Goal Docks, Limited, in the account of the latter in the respondent bank. Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, for some years previous to its bankruptcy in May, 1932, had carried on a retail coal business at Saint John, New Brunswick. The appellant company was a coal dealer which in the latter part of the year 1930 began to sell hard coal to Eastern Coal Docks, Limited. The coal in question was called Susquehanna anthracite.\nIn December, 1930, Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, began its banking business with the respondent. A line of credit of $50,000 was arranged, the respondent receiving from Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, security under section 88 of the Bank Act covering all coal on hand, and also a general assignment of book debts.\nSubsequently a memorandum in writing dated May 1st, 1931, was drawn up between the appellant and Eastern Coal Docks, Limited. By this memorandum, the appellant undertook to supply Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, called the Factor, with anthracite to March 31st, 1932, on the understanding that Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, should be a selling agent only and that the property in the coal and the proceeds thereof, less the agent\u2019s expenses and compensation as selling agent, should remain and be respectively in the appellant. The memorandum further provided that the proceeds should not be confused, mixed or commingled with the funds of the agent, but should be deposited immediately to the account of the principal. The agent further agreed to notify the principal every four weeks of the amount of the collections and deposits and the amounts of accounts unpaid. The agent further agreed to endorse, assign and deliver to any bank chosen by the appellant and operating in Saint John, all promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness representing and based upon such sales of coal to be held by said bank subject to the agreement.\nThe arrangements contemplated by the memorandum did not, however, go into effect on May 1st, 1931. On June 19th, 1931, the appellant sent the memorandum to Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, with certain corrections and with the following request:\u2014\u201cWhen you have agreed upon a bank, will you please insert the name in your copy and then advise me and I will correct our copy?\u201d On July 6th, 1931, the appellant sent to Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, the memorandum rewritten and amended by the addition of three new paragraphs for the consideration of the agent. About this time, Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, approached D. W. Harper, manager of the respondent bank at Saint John, and on July 11th, 1931, Mr. Harper wrote to C. A. Roy, General Manager of the respondent at Montreal. In this letter, Mr. Harper stated that the Susquehanna Red Ash Company or the company producing that brand of coal was requesting the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, to act as a distributing agent for their coal on the terms that the principal should retain the property in the coal and have an assignment of book debts arising from the sales. Mr. Harper suggested it would mean another account and asked for instructions. On July 18th, 1931, Mr. Roy replied that the bank should not run risks of the coals being mixed and the book debts confused. On July 20th, 1931, Mr. Harper advised the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, of the instructions of the General Manager, and added that arrangements could not be made unless the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, wrote the respondent a letter that the coal would be segregated and the book debts kept distinct to the satisfaction of the bank. Mr. Harper went on to state that the respondent would be pleased to continue the account on the old basis, but that if Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, was determined to go on with the new proposal without satisfying the bank as above set out, the account would have to be closed and all indebtedness to the bank paid. On July 25th, 1931, Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, wrote Mr. Harper stating that if Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, should operate under the proposed consignment agreement with the appellant, the only anthracite would be Susquehanna anthracite from the appellant, that this coal would be kept separate, that a separate set of books would be kept and the receipts would be deposited in a \u201cseparate\u201d bank account, and that notes or drafts would be endorsed to \u201cthat Bank\u201d for collection and deposited to that account, and that the \u201csection 88 loans\u201d would be secured by all the bituminous coal and all the book debts of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited. On July 27th, 1931, Mr. Harper again wrote Mr. Roy stating that if the arrangement proposed by Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, was entertained, the respondent would have a separate bank account for the proceeds of the Hanna coal. On August 3rd, 1931, the appellant wrote Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, asking that the consignment memorandum of May 1st, 1931, should be signed and returned. On August 12th, Mr. Roy wrote Mr. Harper that he was not impressed with the method of financing of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, but that he was willing that Mr. Harper should try out the proposal for a month or two according to the policy outlined in the letter from Mr. Harper to Mr. Roy of July 27th. On August 12th, Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, wrote Mr. Harper in part as follows:\nOn this basis M. A. Hanna Company would have an equity in this coal for its invoice value $42,728.03, but at the present time this $42,728.03 stands as an Account Payable and the stock of coal as part of your security under section 88.\nA separate bank account for the proceeds of Hanna coal as proposed in the letter of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, to Mr. Harper dated July 25th, was never opened by Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, nor was the separate account referred to in the letter from Mr. Harper to Mr. Roy dated July 27th ever opened.\nOn October 9th, 1931, W. B. Wright, an auditor of the appellant, went to Saint John and remained there until October 13th. He did not make any inquiry as to where the bank account of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, was kept or as to the nature of the banking arrangements between Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, and its bank. But on October 24th, he sent to Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, a copy of his report to the appellant. Part of the report is as follows:\u2014\nMemorandum as to balance $11,213.70 remaining in Factor Bank Account to Sept. 17th, 1931.\nAs collections from customers are made by Eastern Coal Docks, Ltd., they are deposited in a general bank account of Eastern Coal Docks, Ltd., but to distinguish collections as made for Anthracite sales and collections as made for bituminous sales separate deposit tickets are now being used covering all deposits.\nOn Nov. 11th, W. C. Scott of Cleveland, Ohio, office attorney of the appellant, and John D. Baile of Susquehanna Collieries, Montreal, agent of the appellant, went to Saint John in behalf of the appellant. They agreed with Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, that a separate bank account would not be necessary and that the proceeds of the Hanna coal should be deposited in the bank account of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited. Accordingly, an agreement in writing was prepared and executed by the appellant and Eastern Coal Docks, Limited. This agreement amended the agreement of May 1st by providing for remittances by the agent every four weeks instead of \u201cimmediately,\u201d for a further seven days to transmit the funds to Susquehanna Collieries Limited at Montreal, for six per centum per annum interest for delay, for the cancellation and annulment of the following provision of the agreement of May 1st:\nThe Principal\u2019s share shall be collected first as aforesaid, and such funds shall not be confused, mixed or commingled with other funds of the Factor, but shall be held separately and shall immediately be deposited to the account of the Principal at the or such other bank or banks as the Principal shall designate.\nMessrs. Scott and Baile do not appear from the evidence to have examined the banking arrangements of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, any more than did Mr. Wright, and no person connected with the appellant interviewed or wrote the respondent about them until after the respondent had formally advised Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, on March 26th, 1932, that no more cheques should be issued against the account and that no further advances could be made.\nIt is not necessary, in the view I take of the case, to consider whether the appellant, in order not to disturb the banking credit of a large agency, refrained from formally warning the bank before the crash that it had a claim against the bank for the net proceeds of the sales of Hanna coal not accounted for by the agent. Nor is it necessary to consider whether the appellant after Nov. 11th, 1931, was actively assisting in the financing of the general coal business of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, by extending the time for remittances, by permitting the agent to confuse, mix and commingle the funds now claimed by the appellant with the funds of the agent and by permitting the use of one bank account for both the Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, and the appellant.\nThe appellant urged before us that Mr. Harper knew that the appellant and the agent had entered into the consignment agreement. As a matter of fact, the principal and agent never entered into the consignment proposal of May 1st, nor into the arrangement which was discussed with Mr. Harper in the summer of 1931, but into a new and different arrangement as set out in the agreement of Nov. 11th, 1931, the contents of which were never formally communicated to Mr. Harper as far as the evidence shows. It is true that, in the latter part of the year 1931, Mr. Harper saw that the coal was segregated and came to the conclusion that Eastern Coal Docks Ltd. had entered into some arrangement for the handling of anthracite on an agency basis because the monthly reports did not show anthracite on them. Harper said he thought they must have some other bank account or a new arrangement. Harper, in fact, told his assistant manager, Robinson, to tell the officials of Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, not to put the money from the sale of anthracite into the bank, and Robinson did so tell them according to the evidence. It may here be observed that the appellant sought, through Harper and others, to fix the respondent with knowledge of a banking arrangement which they on Nov. 11th, 1931, confirmed and continued in operation. The appellant also endeavoured to fix the respondent with notice that the net proceeds of the sales of anthracite were their property by shewing that from May or June, 1931, two deposits each banking day were made by the agent, that many of the deposit slips had figures or letters or words on them such as \u201c1112\u201d or \u201cS 187\u201d or \u201cSusq. deposit\u201d or \u201cEastern deposit\u201d or \u201cHanna account.\u201d Several experienced bank employees or former employees were called and testified that such figures and words were common on deposit slips and were not regarded where the name of the account to which the deposit was to go, Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, in this case, was set out and the items and additions were correct.\nThe appellant also urged that the respondent had notice because many cheques were passing through the bank to Susquehanna Collieries Limited, and pointed out to us that the learned trial judge had found that Mr. Harper had sufficient knowledge to put him on inquiry and that he must have known that the moneys received on deposit from Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, were partly the proceeds of coal consigned by the appellant to the factor.\nWhere money is entrusted to an agent by his principal or received by him on his principal\u2019s behalf, it depends upon the terms of the agency whether the agent is bound to keep the money separate or is entitled to mix it with his own. In the former case the agent will be a trustee, in the latter a debtor.\nHalsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd Edition, Volume 1, page 247. In Henry v. Hammond[30], Channell J. said, page 521:\nIt is clear that if the terms upon which the person receives the money are that he is bound to keep it separate, either in a bank or elsewhere, and to hand that money so kept as a separate fund to the person entitled to it, then he is a trustee of that money and must hand it over to the person who is his cestui que trust. If on the other hand, he is not bound to keep the money separate, but is entitled to mix it with his own money and deal with it as he pleases, and when called upon to hand over an equivalent sum of money, then, in my opinion, he is not a trustee of the money, but merely a debtor. All the authorities seem to me to be consistent with that statement of the law.\nEx parte White; In Re Nevill[31]. In this case T. & Co. were in the habit of sending goods for sale to N., who was a person in the firm of N. & Co., to be received on his private account. The course of dealing between T. & Co. and N. was that the goods were accompanied by a price list. N. sold the goods on what terms he pleased and each month sent to T. & Co. an account of the goods he had sold, debiting himself with the prices named for them in the price list, and at the expiration of another month he paid the account in cash without any regard to the prices at which he had sold the goods or the length of credit he had given. He paid the moneys which he had received from the sales into the general account of his firm, and made his payment to T. & Co. through his firm with whom he kept an account of moneys paid in and drawn out by him in respect of moneys unconnected with the partnership, which account included many items wholly unconnected with the goods of T. & Co. N. & Co. executed a deed of arrangement with their creditors. T. & Co. sought to prove against the joint estate for the amounts standing to N.\u2019s credit with his firm on the ground that the same arose from moneys belonging to T. & Co. and improperly placed by N. in the hands of his firm. It was held that such proof could not be admitted, because the course of dealing showed that, although both parties might look upon the business as an agency, N. did not in fact sell the goods as an agent of T. & Co. but on his own account, upon the terms of paying T. & Co. for them at a fixed rate if he sold them, and the moneys he received for them were therefore his own moneys which T. & Co. had no right to follow.\nIt may here be observed that under the agreement of Nov. 11th, 1931, the agent agreed to remit to the appellant\u2019s agent at Montreal the \u201cvalue\u201d of all coal shipped at the appellant\u2019s regular circular of prices in effect at the time of shipment, or such other \u201cvalue\u201d as might from time to time be mutually agreed upon. The same agreement incorporated a provision of the memorandum of May 1st, 1931, that the agent should guarantee the payment of all sales of coal and should account therefor in cash at the end of one hundred and twenty days.\nIn the view, however, that I take of this case, it is not necessary to decide whether Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, was a trustee or a debtor of the appellant. In London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[32], a broker was in the habit of pledging his customers\u2019 securities en bloc with the appellant bank as security for advances to himself. Among these were mortgage bonds belonging to the respondent which were transferable by delivery. The bankers had no notice, and no reason to suspect, that the broker had no right to pledge these bonds for his own purposes. The broker failed and absconded. It was held in the House of Lords that the bankers, having acted in good faith and without notice of the broker\u2019s fraud, were entitled to retain and realize the bonds to repay themselves the amount due by the broker. Lord Halsbury said, page 726:\nMr. Justice Kekewich seems to have been under the impression that relying on the broker\u2019s honesty did not alter the result. But to my mind it makes the whole difference. If there is \u00a310,000 borrowed, and ten different clients\u2019 securities, what is there to tell the bank, or to suggest to the bank, that the ten clients had not each either a joint interest in the \u00a310,000, or a several interest, which their several property justifies the broker in pledging?\nLord Herschell, in the same case, said, page 729:\nThe general rule of the law is, that where a person has obtained the property of another from one who is dealing with it without the authority of the true owner, no title is acquired as against that owner, even though full value be given, and the property be taken in the belief that an unquestionable title thereto is being obtained, unless the person taking it can shew that the true owner has so acted as to mislead him into the belief that the person dealing with the property had authority to do so. If this can be shown, a good title is acquired by personal estoppel against the true owner. There is an exception to the general rule, however, in the case of negotiable instruments. Any person in possession of these may convey a good title to them, even when he is acting in fraud of the true owner, and although such owner has done nothing tending to mislead the person taking them.\nAt page 731, Lord Herschell referred to the view of Baron Parke in Foster v. Pearson[33], that it was long considered as firmly established that the holder of bills of exchange endorsed in blank, or other negotiable securities transferable by delivery, could give a title which he did not himself possess to a person taking them bona fide for value and that the rule should not be qualified by treating due care and caution as essential to the validity of his title besides and independently of honesty of purpose. Lord Herschell went on to say, page 731, that the view of Baron Parke was applied by Willes J. in Raphael v. Bank of England[34], where it was treated as undoubted law that negligence did not invalidate the title of a person taking a negotiable instrument in good faith and for value. In the same case Lord Macnaghten said, page 734:\nLastly, did the bank take the \u201cCedulas\u201d in good faith? They took them, with other securities, from a firm of stockbrokers, who were, at the time, of unblemished reputuation. They took them in the ordinary way of business, to cover their current advances. In regard to this question the difficulty is to see what there was in the transaction to suggest a shadow of suspicion that there was anything wrong with the deposit. The only objection alleged is that securities of different customers of the stockbrokers were pledged for one entire advance, and it is said that the bank ought to have known it. But, even so, if the bank had no reason to suppose that the stockbrokers were not at liberty to pledge each and all of the securities for their full value, I cannot see in what the supposed want of good faith consists. As was pointed out in Foster v. Pearson[35], such a practice\u2014and the practice prevails in the case of stockbrokers as much as in the case of billbrokers\u2014has advantages for the customers as a body, though it may occasionally operate hardly on an individual.\nThe rule is tersely stated by Lord Herschell in the same case, page 730:\nI defer entering upon the inquiry whether it has been proved that the bank had either notice or knowledge that Delmar\u2019s title to the bonds was that of an agent only. Assuming for the moment that this was proved, what is its effect? It is contended on behalf of the respondent, as I understand, that it put the bank upon inquiry as to the title of the person with whom they dealt, and as to the authority which he possessed; and that having made no such inquiry, they obtained as against his principal no better title than he had. It was admitted that any one buying from Delmar would have obtained an unimpeachable title, notwithstanding his knowledge that Delmar was a broker, and that the bonds were the property of his principal. What ground is there for the position that in regard to a pledge the case is different; that one may safely take a negotiable instrument by way of sale from an agent without inquiry, but cannot so take it by way of pledge? It is surely of the very essence of a negotiable instrument that you may treat the person in possession of it as having authority to deal with it, be he agent or otherwise, unless you know to the contrary, and are not compelled in order to secure a good title to yourself to inquire into the nature of his title or the extent of his authority.\nThomson v. Clydesdale Bank[36]. In this case, it was held that a person who takes money from another in discharge of a debt is not bound to inquire how the money is acquired, and is entitled to retain it in discharge of the debt, and that the knowledge that the money has been received by the person paying it on account of other persons is not sufficient of itself to prevent the payment from being a good payment in discharge of the debt. Lord Herschell said, pages 92 and 93:\nI cannot assent to the proposition that, even if a person receiving money knows that that money has been received by the person paying it to him on account of other persons, that of itself is sufficient to prevent the payment being a good payment and properly discharging the debt due to the person who receives the money. No doubt if the person receiving the money has reason to believe that the payment is being made in fraud of a third person, and that the person making the payment is handing over in discharge of his debt money which he has no right to hand over, then the person taking such payment would not be entitled to retain the money.\nLord Watson said, page 94:\nThe onus of proving that they acted in mala fide rests with the appellants. It is not enough for them to prove that the respondents acted negligently; in order to succeed, they must establish that the respondents knew, not only that the money represented by the cheque did not belong to the broker, but that he had no authority from the true owner to pay it into his bank account.\nAnd in the same case Lord Shand said, page 95:\nI am of opinion that the same principle which applies to third parties generally is equally applicable to the case of dealings between stockbrokers and their bankers, and that the only circumstances in which money misapplied by a broker in payment to the banker of a debt due to him can be recovered from the banker by the principal to whom the money belonged, is where it can be shown directly, or by inference from the facts proved, that the banker or his representative in the transaction knew that the money was being misapplied.\nRegardless of whether Eastern Coal Docks, Limited, was after Nov. 11th, 1931, a debtor or a trustee of the proceeds of the sales of the appellant\u2019s coal, the appellant has no sufficient finding by the learned trial judge and no sufficient evidence to bring its case, either before or after that date, within the rule of law discussed in the authorities last cited.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John C.

(as amended in 1932, c. 25)\u2014\u201cMotor Vehicle Liability Policy\u201d\u2014Time limitation for bringing action.\nAppellant insured A. by an automobile insurance policy, dated May 2, 1931, and expiring May 2, 1932. On February 9, 1932, an accident occurred in which respondent, a passenger in A.\u2019s car (driven by A.), was injured. On December 3, 1932, respondent commenced action for damages against A. The action was tried and on March 29, 1933, judgment was given against A. Respondent, not having received payment, commenced, on May 8, 1933, an action against appellant for the amount of the judgment (and taxed costs and subsequent interest), claiming under s. 87 (4) of The Highway Traffic Act (Ont.) (as enacted in 1930, c. 47, s. 6) and, or in the alternative, under s. 183 (h) of The Insurance Act (as enacted by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, c. 25). On September 1, 1932, said s. 87 (4) had been repealed, and on the same date said s. 183 (h) had come into force. On a stated case (in which certain facts were admitted) appellant claimed that, in point of law, respondent was not entitled to judgment against it.\nHeld, affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1934] O.R. 318, that respondent was entitled to succeed.\nPer Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ.:\nIn view of the repeal on September 1, 1932, of provisions, dealing with certain subject matters, in The Highway Traffic Act, and the enactments, taking effect on the same date, introducing into The Insurance Act provisions dealing with the same subject matters, and on comparing and considering the provisions repealed and enacted respectively as aforesaid, said s. 183 (h), introduced as aforesaid into The Insurance Act, between which section and s. 87 (4) (repealed as aforesaid) of The Highway Traffic Act there was (as was held) no substantial difference as to the rights of third parties against an insurer, should be construed as retrospective. Such construction was impelled by a consideration of effects of a contrary construction\u2014 effects which it was inconceivable that the legislature intended. Ex parte Todd; In re Ashcroft, 19 Q.B.D. 186, at 195, cited and applied.\nThe words \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d in said s. 183 (h) are wide enough in form to cover the policy in question. It cannot be said that a motor vehicle liability policy is necessarily the one prescribed by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932 (amending The Insurance Act, and coming into force September 1, 1932) merely because The Highway Traffic Act, 1932 (c. 32), s. 9, (coming into force September 1, 1932), introduces into The Highway Traffic Act s. 87 (1) to the effect that a motor vehicle liability policy shall be in the form prescribed by The Insurance Act.\nThe exclusion, by s. 183 (d) of The Insurance Act (as enacted by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932), from an insurer\u2019s liability under an owner\u2019s policy or a driver\u2019s policy, of a claim by a passenger in the motor vehicle unless the coverage is expressly extended under s. 183 (f), did not exclude respondent\u2019s claim, as at the time of the accident there was no such exclusion from liability and such liability was in fact provided for by A.\u2019s policy.\nAs respondent\u2019s action against appellant was brought within two months after respondent\u2019s judgment against A.\u2014and within two months after respondent\u2019s \u201ccause of action arose\u201d\u2014the limitation of one year, either in the statutory conditions in the policy or in the statutory conditions brought into force by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, did not bar respondent from recovering against appellant.\nAPPEAL by the defendant insurance company from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Kingstone J.[2] who held (upon a stated case in which certain facts were admitted) that in point of law the plaintiffs (including the present respondent) were entitled to judgment against the defendant for the amount of the judgments recovered by the plaintiffs against one Axford and their taxed costs. (On motion for judgment in accordance with said holding, judgment was given for the present respondent against the defendant for $2,000, and for the other plaintiffs for $200 and $280 respectively, and for the taxed costs of the action against Axford and for interest.)\n(An application by defendant to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for leave to appeal from its judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada as to the claims of the plaintiffs other than the present respondent was refused).\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs. A.C. Heighington K.C. for the appellant.\nR.J. Waterous for the respondent.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014On or about the 9th of February, 1931, the respondent Annie M. Winter and one Gertrude Mosley were riding in a motor vehicle owned and operated by one J. Leslie Axford, when an accident occured resulting in injury to the passengers. At the time of the accident J. Leslie Axford was insured by a contract of automobile insurance with the appellant. The policy was dated May 2nd, 1931, and expired according to its terms on May 2nd, 1932.\nOn December 3rd, 1932, Annie M. Winter, Gertrude Mosley and George Mosley, husband of Gertrude Mosley, commenced an action for damages for negligence against Axford. The action duly came on for trial and on March 29th, 1933, judgment was given against Axford in favour of the plaintiffs as follows:\u2014Annie M. Winter $2,000, Gertrude Mosley $200, and George Mosley $280, together with the costs of the action which were subsequently taxed at $650.95. The judgment creditors did not receive payment from Axford and on May 8th, 1933, they commenced an action against the insurer for the amounts awarded to them by the judgment and for the taxed costs and interest from the date of the judgment. They claimed that they were entitled to recover against the insurer by virtue of section 87 (4) of The Highway Traffic Act, as enacted by Statutes of Ontario, 1930, chapter 47, section 6, and, or in the alternative, by virtue of section 183 (h) of The Insurance Act, as enacted by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, Statutes of Ontario, 1932, chapter 25, section 2. The defence of the insurer was that the former provision was repealed on September 1st, 1932, and that the latter statute, which came into force on that date, was not applicable. A special case was submitted to the court and the Honourable Mr. Justice Kingstone gave judgment against the insurer. The latter appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the appeal was dismissed. The insurer now appeals to this Court in respect to that part of the judgment which awards to Annie M. Winter $2,000 and interest from the date of the judgment.\nThe dates and events are somewhat numerous and it may be helpful to set them out in chronological order.\n2nd May, 1931\u2014Delivery of policy.\n9th February, 1932\u2014Accident.\n2nd May, 1932\u2014Expiration of policy.\n1st September, 1932\u2014Repeal of section 87 (4) of The Highway Traffic Act.\n1st September, 1932\u2014Coming into force of The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, including sections 169 to 183 (k) of The Insurance Act.\n3rd December, 1932\u2014Action commenced against insured.\n29th March, 1933\u2014Judgment against insured.\n8th May, 1933\u2014Action commenced against Insurance Company.\nThe parties to this appeal admitted in the stated case that the respondent, at the time of the accident, was riding in a motor vehicle owned and operated by J. Leslie Axford, that the respondent commenced an action on December 3rd, 1932, against Axford for damages for negligence arising out of the operation by Axford of the automobile and that she recovered a judgment against him on March 29th, 1933, for $2,000 and costs and that the judgment and costs were unpaid when, on May 8th, 1933, the respondent commenced this action against the appellant. It was further admitted that Axford was insured at the time of the accident by a policy of automobile insurance with the appellant in respect of the automobile in question, effective from May 2nd, 1931, to May 2nd, 1932, with a coverage sufficient in amount. It was further admitted that the injuries for which the damages were awarded to the respondent were occasioned by the negligent operation by Axford of the automobile described in the policy.\nThe above section 183 h (1) provides that any person having a claim against an insured for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy shall, although such person is not a party to the contract, be entitled upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of the judgment and may maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied. Section 169 (f) of The Insurance Act, enacted at the same time as 183 (h), provides that \u201cMotor Vehicle Liability Policy\u201d shall mean a policy or that part of a policy insuring the owner or driver of an automobile against liability for loss or damage to persons or property. The term \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d appears in the following sections added to The Highway Traffic Act by section 6 of The Highway Traffic Amendment Act, 1930:\u201478 (1) (a); 78 (3); 87 (1); 87 (3); 87 (4); 87 (4) (a); 87 (4) (b); 87 (5); 87 (6) and 87 (7). The words \u201cmotor vehicle liability policies\u201d appear in The Insurance Act, 1931, Statutes of Ontario, Chapter 49, section 4. It cannot, therefore, well be said, as contended by the appellant, that a motor vehicle liability policy is necessarily the one prescribed by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932 merely because The Highway Traffic Act, 1932, section 9, introduces into The Highway Traffic Act section 87 (1) to the effect that a motor vehicle liability policy shall be in the form prescribed by The Insurance Act. I am, therefore, of opinion that the words \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d in section 183 (h) are wide enough in form to cover the policy in question in the appeal. It follows, therefore, that idemnity is or was provided by a motor vehicle liability policy. The indemnity is or was an indemnity to the insured, and his right to indemnity arose when the accident occurred, namely, during the term of the policy. If the insurer had cancelled the policy immediately after the accident, the insured\u2019s right to indemnity would not have been affected in any way. The right of the insured to indemnity did not terminate when the term of the policy expired. If on the day when action was commenced against the insured, namely, on December 3rd, 1932, the respondent had in the words of section 183 (h) said to the insured, \u201cI have a claim against you,\u201d the insured could truly have replied, \u201cIndemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy.\u201d\nThe appellant, however, contends that The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, is not retrospective. In this connection, it is important to observe at the outset that many of the provisions introduced into The Highway Traffic Act by The Highway Traffic Amendment Act, 1930, section 6, concerned largely the subject matter of insurance, for example, 87 (1), which defined the coverage of every motor vehicle liability policy; 87 (2), which permitted excess coverage; 87 (3), which provided for approval of the form of the policy by the superintendent of insurance; 87 (4), which provided that every motor vehicle liability policy should be subject to certain provisions notwithstanding any law to the contrary. One of the latter provisions was that a judgment creditor with a judgment arising out of a claim against an insured for which indemnity was provided by a motor vehicle liability policy should, on behalf of himself and all other persons having similar judgments or claims, be entitled to maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money applied in satisfaction of such judgment or judgments. I have referred to the above provisions at some length in order to make it quite obvious that many of the provisions were largely insurance provisions which were rather more appropriately to be sought in an insurance Act. The desired alterations in these largely insurance provisions, whether formal only or substantial, could not be accomplished by amendment, as there was a transfer also, so to speak, of them from The Highway Traffic Act to The Insurance Act, and repeal and re-enactment were necessary. On September 1st, 1932, many wholly or partly insurance provisions disappeared from The Highway Traffic Act and appeared in more or less altered form in The Insurance Act. For example, provisions relating to the following subject matters may be found in the following sections of The Highway Traffic Act as amended by The Highway Traffic Amendment Act, 1930, chapter 47, section 6, and in The Insurance Act, as amended by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, chapter 25, section 2, respectively:\u2014approval of motor vehicle liability policies by the superintendent of insurance, 87 (3) and 183 (f); extent of ordinary coverage, 87 (1) and 183 (a) (b) (d) and (e); excess coverage, 87 (2) and 183 (f); rights of third parties against insurer, 87 (4) and 183 (h). It is significant, however, that the following provision of The Highway Traffic Act (as amended in 1930):\n71 (2) This Part shall only apply * * * to motor vehicle liability policies issued or in force after the date of coming into force of this Part, re-appeared as section 170 (1) of The Insurance Act as follows:\u2014\nThis Part shall apply to automobile insurance and to any insurer carrying on the business of automobile insurance in the Province and to all contracts made in the Province on or after the date of coming into force of this Part.\nIt is to be observed that the latter enactment does not contain the word \u201conly,\u201d and it should not be construed as necessarily restrictive.\nIt is inconceivable that the legislature intended to cut off claims of third parties in all policies expired or in force at the time of the repeal of 87 (4) and the enactment of 183 (h). Such a conclusion would mean that the potential claims or rights in futuro of third parties in policies issued as late as August 31st, 1932, would be barred although the whole term of the policy with the exception of the day of delivery was within the time covered by the new enactment.\nNow, there is no substantial difference between the rights of third parties against an insurer under 87 (4) and under 183 (h), although the appellant contends that the rights of third parties under 183 (h) were substantially different from their rights under 87 (4) in that (a) the repealed statute applied to judgment creditors only, and (b) under the repealed statute, it was necessary to shew an attempt to collect from the insured. These contentions are not well founded. Both 87 (4) and 183 (h) apply to judgment creditors; and 87 (4) did not provide that an attempt to collect first from the insured should be shewn. The latter was necessary only under the former section 85 of The Insurance Act. See The Continental Casualty Company v. Yorke[3]. In his judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4], the Honourable Mr. Justice Macdonnell referred to a statement in the judgment of Lord Esher, M.R., in Ex parte Todd; In re Ashcroft[5]. The point involved in that case was whether section 47 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, which avoided certain voluntary settlements executed by a bankrupt, was or was not retrospective. Lord Esher, in the course of his judgment, referred to the fact that in In re Player[6], Mathew J. had expressed the opinion that so much of section 47 as was identical with section 91 of the former Act applied to matters which happened before the Act came into operation but that any part of it which was a new enactment was not retrospective. Later on Lord Esher stated:\u2014\nIn determining whether any provision of an Act was intended to be retrospective or not, I think the consequences of holding that it is not retrospective must be looked at, and to my mind it is inconceivable that the legislature, when, in a new Act which repeals a former Act, they repeat in so many words certain provisions of the repealed Act, should have intended that persons who, before the passing of the new Act, had broken the provisions of the old Act\u2014who had been doing that which the legislature thought to be wrong\u2014should entirely escape the consequences of their wrongdoing by reason of the repeal of the old Act. I think, therefore, that, so far as s. 47 is a repetition of s. 91, the legislature obviously intended to replace the old enactment at once by the new one, and that, to that extent, s. 47 must apply to transactions which took place before the commencement of the new Act. But why should we carry it any further, and say that the new part of s. 47 applies to antecedent transactions? I can see no reason for doing so, and I think it is a wholesome doctrine to hold that the section is retrospective so far as it is a repetition of the former enactment, but that it is not retrospective so far as it is new.\nFry, L.J., said that to say that a section of an Act was in part retrospective and in part not, struck him as a somewhat novel mode of interpretation. Lopes, L.J., agreed with Lord Esher. The view of the latter was unanimously applied by the Court of Appeal to the right against the insurer of the respondent third party in the case at bar, and I have not been able to find any valid reason why it should not have been so applied.\nThe appellant also contends that the respondent was a passenger in the automobile owned and driven by Axford and that section 183 (d) of The Insurance Act as enacted by section 2 of The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, excludes from the liability of an insurer under an owner\u2019s policy or a driver\u2019s policy, a claim by a passenger in the motor vehicle unless the coverage is expressly extended under section 183 (f) At the time of the accident, however, there was no such exclusion from liability and such liability was in fact provided for by sections (A) and (B) of the insuring agreements in the policy which the appellant delivered to Axford and which was in force at the time of the accident. The appellant further contends that there was no money payable under the policy at the time the action was brought against the insurer because at that time the rights of the insured to recover under the policy, in any event, were barred by lapse of time. The policy does not support this contention, as it provides by Automobile Statutory Condition 8 (3) (printed on the policy) that no action under the policy shall lie against the insurer unless action is brought after the amount of the loss has been ascertained either by a judgment against the insured after trial of the issue or by agreement between the parties with the written consent of the insurer and no action shall lie in either event unless brought within one year thereafter. This action was brought within two months after the judgment. The statutory conditions brought into force by The (Automobile) Insurance Act, 1932, section 2, provide that every action or proceeding in respect of loss or damage to persons or property shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action arose and not afterwards. This action was brought within two months after the respondent\u2019s cause of action arose.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Waterous, Wallace & Hagey.\n[1] [1934] O.R. 318; [1934] 3 D.L.R. 17.\n[2] [1934] O.R. 87; [1934] 1 D.L.R.358.\n[3] [1930] Can.

The appellant company pleaded that the above transaction was carried out by the president of the company without authority expressed or implied and was never ratified by it, and, in the alternative, that in any event the above shares were not lent as alleged by the respondent, but were given or donated without condition as to their return. On the first point raised by the appellant company, after hearing its counsel, this Court decided that the findings of fact of the trial judge in favour of the respondent, unanimously affirmed by the appellate court, should not be disturbed; but this Court decided to hear the respondent on the question of law, raised by the appellant company in support of its second point, concerning the admissibility of oral evidence to prove the loan of the shares.\nHeld that, under the circumstances of this case, oral testimony was admissible. As both parties were admitting the existence of some contract for the transfer of the shares, parol evidence could be adduced to determine whether the transfer was conditional or unconditional and whether the shares were to be returned to the respondent and his associates as having been merely loaned. Campbell v. Young (32 Can. S.C.R. 547) foll.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Loranger J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action and condemning the appellant to deliver to respondent 30,000 shares of appellant\u2019s capital stock and to pay to the respondent the sum of $4,200.00 the amount of dividends declared on a like number of shares, or in the event of the appellant failing to deliver the said shares, to pay to the respondent the sum of $51,600.00, being the market value of the said shares with the dividends aforesaid. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgment now reported.\nHenry N. Chauvin K.C. and E. S. McDougall K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and B. Robinson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014This appeal is asserted from the unanimous judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench confirming the judgment of the Superior Court (Loranger J.), which maintained respondent\u2019s action and condemned appellant to deliver to respondent 30,000 shares of appellant\u2019s capital stock and to pay to respondent $4,200, the amount of dividends declared on a like number of shares; or, in the event of the appellant failing to deliver the said shares, to pay to the respondent the sum of $51,600, being the market value of the said shares, reserving also a recourse to be discussed later.\nThe respondent claims to be the owner and demands the delivery to him of 30,000 shares of the Siscoe Gold Mines Limited which, he alleged, had been lent by himself and his associates, Joseph Hoffman and Joseph Pluto, to appellant on the 21st day of January, 1927, on the condition that a like number of shares would be returned by the appellant upon its mining properties being brought into production. Artifice, fraud and error were also alleged as vitiating the transaction.\nThe respondent sues in the right of himself and his associates by virtue of a transfer by Pluto and Hoffman to respondent.\nThe appellant says in defence that the transactions in connection with the above-mentioned shares were carried out by one J. T. Tebbutt, the president of the appellant company, without authority, expressed or implied, and that whatever contract was entered into or understanding arrived at between him and other persons associated with him is not binding upon appellant, who, moreover, never ratified the action of its president.\nUnder reserve of the foregoing plea, the appellant pleaded, in the alternative, that in any event the said shares which were transferred to the Eastern Trust Company as trustee of certain shares of the capital stock of the appellant were not lent, as alleged by respondent, but were given or donated without condition as to their return.\nThe respondent and his two associates Pluto and Hoffman were the original discoverers of the Siscoe Gold Mines and obtained for their interest a certain number of shares in the appellant company. The president, Mr. Tebbutt, went to Timmins and gathered together the three illiterate associates and, according to their version, which was unanimously accepted by the courts below, disclosed to them that the company needed funds, and that, in order to carry out a plan which would bring production and profit, other members of the syndicate and officers, including Mr. Tebbutt and Mr. Siscoe, the president and the vice-president of the company, had already loaned to the company a certain number of shares. These foreigners agreed to the demand of the president and took his word that this was a loan, and signed the document which he prepared, i.e. an authorization to split up three certificates of 20,000 shares each so that half would go the company and the other half back to each of them. Eventually the division took place and each received back a certificate of 10,000 shares; and the other shares were placed in the company\u2019s treasury account with the Eastern Trust Company. In reply to a demand for a return of these shares, the appellant contended that it never received them, that it had nothing to do with them, or, in the alternative, that they were donated unconditionally.\nIt was proven that the company actually received the shares and disposed of them in order to reimburse itself of a commission of 10 per cent in cash and 15 per cent in stock payable to W. R. Baillie through whom one G. N. Coyle had agreed to invest $75,000 with the company, under the express condition that no commission was to be paid out of the funds of the company. Whatever may have been the promise made by Siscoe to Coyle, the fact is abundantly established that the commission was paid by the appellant and that the proceeds of the sale of the 30,000 shares were deposited to the credit of the respondent. After these shares were transferred to the treasury in the hands of the Eastern Trust Company, they lost their identity and could not be further traced. After hearing the appellant, this Court decided that the findings of fact of the trial judge, unanimously confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, should not be disturbed; and, we, therefore, in view of the character of the evidence given, say that the shares were not donated to Tebbutt, nor to the company, by the respondent; that they were loaned to the company, who received them and placed them in its treasury, in the care of the Eastern Trust Company.\nIf respondent agreed to deliver, and did deliver, their shares to appellant, what that company or its officers did after is more or less irrelevant, except to show that it benefited from them. If they are not in the treasury, they must have been disposed of for the purposes of that company. In either case, the company\u2019s liability towards the respondent would not disappear.\nThe company was in operation when the action was taken and the time had then arrived when the loan had to be repaid. If, as pleaded, the company never authorized this agreement nor the receipt of these shares, there seems to be no good reason why it should not return them. There can be no question of a donation to the company, because the latter has expressly pleaded that never, at any time, through its board of directors or by officers duly authorized, were these shares accepted. Moreover, the evidence and the findings of the courts below disprove this contention. Both courts below reached the conclusion that the only witness heard on this point on behalf of the appellant is unreliable, and on this question of credibility, great consideration must necessarily be given to the findings of the trial judge who heard and saw the witness. Moreover, it is more than doubtful that such a gift could be legally made in the form of a verbal agreement. Art. 776 C.C.\nThis Court, therefore, decided to hear the respondent only on the question of law raised by the appellant concerning the admissibility of oral evidence to prove the loan of these shares.\nIn view of the rejection by the trial judge of Tebbutt\u2019s version of what took place when the respondent and his associates signed the authorization to transfer the 30,000 shares to the appellant and the adoption below and by this Court of respondent\u2019s evidence, the only possibility for the appellant to succeed was to have this verbal evidence set aside as illegal. Our attention was drawn to the following part of respondent\u2019s testimony:\nQ. Before you brought Hoffman, Pluto and Steinslick, did Mr. Tebbutt tell you what he wanted?\nBy defendant\u2019s counsel: I make a preliminary objection to anything said by Mr. Tebbutt, to the witness prior to the signing of these documents, in view of the fact we have not only this document referred to by Mr. Genest, but we have a transfer signed by the plaintiff and the other parties, of the shares in question.\nAnd I make formal objection to any evidence as to what was said, which was preliminary to the signing of these documents.\nBy the Court: It explains the circumstances under which the deed was signed. Reserved.\nTebbutt was subsequently brought forward by the appellant to prove the alleged donation or gift of the shares, after he had explained to them that he had to have this stock to liquidate the alleged personal debt of vice-president Siscoe to Baillie. The trial judge gave his decision in the final judgment:\nObjection est faite \u00e0 toute preuve verbale comme tendant \u00e0 contredire l\u2019\u00e9crit. En remarquant que le document P. 1 ne d\u00e9finit aucunement la nature de la convention, pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter il faut donc conna\u00eetre les circonstances dans lesquelles l\u2019\u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 afin de se rendre compte de l\u2019intention des parties et de lui donner effet; sans cela, il est impossible de d\u00e9cider le bien ou mal fond\u00e9 de la r\u00e9clamation. Qu\u2019est-ce que l\u2019\u00e9crit comporte? Est-ce un don manuel? Est-ce un pr\u00eat? Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces trois questions, il faut n\u00e9cessairement savoir ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9; et seule la preuve peut nous le r\u00e9v\u00e9ler. L\u2019objection est rejet\u00e9e.\nExhibit P. 1 reads in part as follows:\nWe the undersigned owners of 20,000 shares each of the Siscoe Gold Mines Company stock do hereby authorize the secretary of the Siscoe Gold Mines Company or the Eastern Trust Company of Montreal to split each 20,000 shares of stock into two certificates, one certificate for ten thousand shares to be made out to the Siscoe Gold Mines Company, and one certificate for ten thousand shares to the undersigned.\nJoseph Pluto.\nJoseph Hossman.\nFelix Bijakowski.\nThe declaration alleges that the above document was signed at the request of Tebbutt, the president of the company appellant, who represented that a group of shareholders were lending a portion of their holdings to the company in order to bring it into production sooner; that the president took advantage of the fact that the plaintiff and his two companions were illiterate foreigners and deliberately drafted the document in indefinite terms, leading them into error and making them believe that they, in consort with other large shareholders, were lending to the company a large amount of stock which would be returned immediately after the company would begin producing; and that the plaintiff, Pluto and Hoffman were induced to sign the said document through artifice and fraud.\nPlaintiff\u2019s allegation that the whole transaction was tainted with fraud and false representation, might have supported the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit parol testimony, although his judgment does not mention that ground and he did not find fraud against Tebbutt. In support of the admissibility of the evidence, it might also have been considered whether or not the writings, the books of the company, the attitude of some of the appellant\u2019s witnesses in the box, which was severely criticized by the trial judge, were not sufficient to constitute a \u201ccommencement de preuve par \u00e9crit\u201d which would make probable the loan alleged by the respondent. In fact, some of the learned judges below adopted the view that such a foundation for oral testimony existed and quoted this Court\u2019s decision re Campbell v. Young[1]. Under that precedent, both parties admitting the existence of some contract, parol evidence could be adduced to determine whether the transfer was conditional or unconditional, whether the shares were to be returned or not.\nMoreover, even if the verbal evidence of what took place at Timmins, when exhibit P. 1 was prepared by Tebbutt, president of the company, and signed by the respondent, be rejected, we must not lose sight of the overwhelming evidence in writing showing that the company acted pursuant to the authority given, received the shares, placed them in its treasury and refused to hand them over.\nTo justify the possession and retention of the shares, the appellant alleges a free gift or donation. It was incumbent upon it to prove its title. Reus excipiendo fit actor. It failed to discharge the onus and the appellant having admitted respondent\u2019s ownership of the shares before the transfer, the plaintiff\u2019s case was complete and he was entitled to judgment. The transaction was either res inter alios acta, or is really, as found by the trial judge, part of the business of the company and has been repeatedly ratified and acted upon by it, as appears in the books of the appellant and its bank account. The appellant, having received both the shares and the full benefit thereof (although it contended it had nothing to do with them), and having failed to prove its title thereto, cannot succeed. The attempt to bring Tebbutt before the Court to prove the contention that no one was bound to return respondent\u2019s property proved futile. This verbal evidence of Tebbutt, essential to prove appellant\u2019s version, was tendered by it after it had objected to similar verbal evidence on the same point by plaintiff, Hoffman and Pluto. It was allowed by the trial judge, but evidently was not believed.\nWe, therefore, reach the conclusion that the point raised before us by the appellant cannot prevail.\nBut, says the appellant, if the conclusion be reached that the act of the company was such as to justify the finding that the company actually received the shares, the respondent, in that event, should recover only the amount for which the shares were sold, viz $9,750.\nOn the other hand, the plaintiff seeks the application of article 1782 of the civil code. He claims to be entitled to the return of the shares loaned or, in default, to their full value which, under the circumstances of this case, would include the increased value of the shares since the appellant refused to remit them to the respondent.\nThe trial judge made a special reservation of the rights of the respondent for the losses he might suffer through the fluctuations of the market.\nThe trial judge fixed the value of the shares on the basis of 30,000 at $1.58 a share, the price of the stock on the day of the judgment. Since that date, the stock may have gone up in price and, by the failure to deliver the stock, the respondent may have been deprived of the opportunity of disposing of the shares at a favourable price. The appellant is given the alternative to deliver the shares or to pay the amount of the judgment. Without the reserve made by the trial judge in favour of the respondent to claim any loss resulting from the company\u2019s failure to deliver the stock at the proper time, the appellant to-day would pay the amount of the judgment and not deliver the stock. It could then dispose of the shares which belong to the respondent and profit unduly at the expense of the respondent to the extent of any difference between $1.58 and the price to-day.\nThis reservation would seem to be within the scope of 1073, 1074 and 1075 of the civil code because, when the company decided to refuse delivery of the stock, it must have known and it knew that the value of the shares would fluctuate and it accepted the risk of paying the highest price between the time of the demand and the delivery.\nWe, therefore, see no good reason to strike the reservation from the judgment as suggested by appellant\u2019s counsel. These remarks are made without prejudice to the rights of either party, should it become necessary for the respondent to take another action to recover over and above the amount of the judgment, in case the company would not return the shares.\nWe will therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wainwright, Elder & McDougall.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robinson & Shapiro.\n[1] (1902) 32 Can.

(now deceased) took out policies of insurance on his life, designating therein his wife as beneficiary. Later by his will he declared that \u201call insurance policies on my life, now payable to my wife\u201d should be paid to his executor in trust for the use and benefit of his wife and mother upon the same trusts, terms and conditions as if they had formed part of the residue of his estate; and he left the residue of his estate to his executor in trust to divide it into two equal shares to be held as separate trust funds, one for his wife, the other for his mother, during life time, each to receive the net income from her share, with power of encroachment on corpus according to need, in the executor\u2019s discretion; the survivor to have the benefit, in the same manner, of the balance of the other\u2019s share added to her own, and on the survivor\u2019s death, the trust to terminate and the whole balance to be paid to M.\u2019s sister C., if living, otherwise to her then surviving issue. By the Ontario Insurance Act, where the insured designates as beneficiary or beneficiaries a member or members of the class of \u201cpreferred beneficiaries\u201d (which class includes a wife and mother, but not a sister or her issue), a trust is created, and, so long as any member of the class remains, the insurance money apportioned to a preferred beneficiary shall not (except as otherwise provided in the Act) be subject to the control of the insured, or of his creditors, or form part of his estate. Sec. 146 provides that, notwithstanding the designation of a preferred beneficiary or beneficiaries, the insured may subsequently restrict, limit, extend or transfer the benefits to any one or more of the class to the exclusion of any or all others of the class, \u201cor wholly or partly to one or more for life or any other term or subject to any limitation or contingency, with remainder to any other or others of the class.\u201d Sec. 163 (1) provides for power to appoint trustees.\nHeld (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1934] O.R. 371): While the gift of remainder over to C. or her issue was not competent (as going outside the preferred class), yet the alteration of beneficiaries by the will was not wholly void. The phrase in s. 146 \u201cwith remainder to any other or others of the class\u201d is severable and not conditional. Sec. 146 means that it is competent for the insured to transfer absolutely the rights of one preferred beneficiary to another preferred beneficiary, or, within the class, to transfer or leave, as the case may be, a limited estate such as a life estate, an estate for a term, an estate subject to a limitation, or an estate in remainder. The insurance moneys in question should be dealt with as directed in the will, except that, should the mother predecease the widow, the whole balance of the insurance moneys should then belong to the widow absolutely, and should the mother survive the widow, then on the mother\u2019s death the whole balance of the insurance moneys should revert to the widow\u2019s estate.\nM. had joined his employer\u2019s \u201cEmployees\u2019 Savings and Profit Sharing Fund.\u201d The plan was intended to furnish to each participating employee (a) who served until retirement on account of age, a help to future maintenance, (b) who served for an extended period but not until retirement on account of age, a substantial accumulated sum, (c) who died while an employee, help towards an income for family or dependents. An employee might withdraw at any time, receiving thereupon an amount, or a share of the fund, determined according to length of service. If a participating employee died, a share of the fund was payable to his designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. He might designate the beneficiary by his \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d (signed on joining the plan) or by an instrument signed and lodged with the trustees of the fund, or by will, and might from time to time revoke the benefits or change the beneficiaries or divert the money to his own estate. In his \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d M. directed the trustees (a) upon his withdrawal to pay to him the amount to which he was entitled under the plan, (b) upon his death to pay the amount to which he was entitled to his wife, or otherwise as he might have last designated by writing lodged with the trustees or by will. There was only one witness to his signature.\nHeld (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal, supra): The \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d designating M.\u2019s wife as beneficiary was testamentary in character and, as it had only one witness, was ineffective to make her a beneficiary, and his share in the fund formed part of his estate. Cock v. Cooke, L.R. 1 Pro. & Div. 241, at 243 in the Goods of Baxter, [1903] P. 12, and other cases, cited).\nAPPEAL by the widow of J.C. MacInnes, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (varying the judgment of Garrow J.[2] on a motion for the opinion and direction of the Court upon certain questions arising in the administration of the estate of said deceased) held that the benefit to appellant as designated beneficiary in each of two policies of life insurance had been altered by the will of said deceased (to the extent as described in the judgment now reported which affirmed the said judgment of the Court of Appeal) and that the appellant, as the beneficiary in case of deceased\u2019s death designated by deceased in a certain document, did not take the amount payable on deceased\u2019s death out of a certain \u201cEmployees\u2019 Savings and Profit Sharing Fund\u201d in which the deceased had participated, but that the amount formed part of deceased\u2019s estate. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nW.E.P. DeRoche for the appellant.\nMcGregor Young K.C. (as Official Guardian) for infant children of respondent Mamie Campbell, and (by appointment of the Court) for her unborn issue.\nH.A. O\u2019Donnell K.C. for the respondents Margaret Maclnnes, Mamie Campbell, and certain of the latter\u2019s children.\nK.G. Morden for respondent Executor.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of the appeal. The judgment of Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014On May 19th, 1924, the late J.C. Maclnnes took out a policy of insurance on his life in the sum of $1,000 in the National Life Assurance Company of Canada. He designated the beneficiary as follows \u201cAnnie Maclnnes\u2014Wife.\u201d\nOn November 29th, 1927, he took out a policy of insurance on his life in The Travellers Insurance Company and again designated as beneficiary his wife, Annie Maclnnes.\nThe testator was, in his lifetime, an employee of The Robert Simpson Company, Limited. This company had what was known as an Employees\u2019 Savings and Profit Sharing Fund managed by a board of trustees. The company contributed to the Fund and each participating employee contributed five per cent of his wages, not exceeding $100 per year, and certain bonuses. The employee was entitled to withdraw from the plan at any time. If he withdrew before ten years, he received what he personally had put in together with five per centum interest. If he withdrew after ten years, he received a share of the full Fund. If an employee died, his interest was a share in the full Fund regardless of whether he had or had not served the company ten years. The late J.C. Maclnnes accepted membership in the plan in September, 1926, and designated the appellant his beneficiary. There was only one witness to the execution of this document.\nOn July 31st, 1931, he duly made his last will and testament. The fourth to sixth clauses are important and it may be well to give them textually:\u2014\nFourth: I will and declare that all insurance policies on my life, now payable to my wife, shall be payable and paid to Chartered Trust and Executor Company in trust for the use and benefit of my said wife and my mother upon the same trusts, terms and conditions as if the said proceeds had formed part of the residue of my estate.\nFifth: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate both real and personal of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, I give, devise and bequeath to Chartered Trust and Executor Company in trust to divide the same into two equal shares which shall be held in trust as Separate Trust Funds, one for the use and benefit of each of my wife, Annie Maclnnes, and my mother Margaret Maclnnes, during her lifetimes as follows: During her lifetime each of my said wife and mother shall receive the net income from her share of the trust estate in convenient instalments, together with such portions of the principal thereof as may with the said income be necessary from time to time in the discretion of my trustee for her proper support and maintenance. In the event of sickness, accident or other emergency arising affecting the life, welfare or happiness of my said wife or mother my trustee is authorized to pay to her such further portions of the principal of her share necessary in its discretion under the circumstances.\nUpon the death of either my wife or mother the balance of her share shall be continued in trust and added to the share of the other of them, and shall be used and held for her benefit in the same manner as her original share in the trust estate hereby created.\nUpon the death of the survivor of my said wife and mother the trust shall terminate, and the whole undistributed balance of the trust estate shall be forthwith paid over to my sister Mamie Campbell, if living, otherwise to her then surviving issue per stirpes.\nSixth: Upon my death it is my sincere wish that my wife and mother or the survivor of them release to my estate any interest that they or she may have or has as preferred beneficiaries or preferred beneficiary, in the proceeds of my insurance policies now in force, in order that the distribution herein set forth may be consummated.\nThe request of the testator in the sixth clause of the will was of no avail, and the executor and trustee moved by originating notice for the opinion and direction of the Supreme Court of Ontario on two questions:\u2014\n(a) Is the declaration attached to each policy of insurance, declaring the moneys payable thereunder to the widow, a preferred beneficiary, altered or varied in any way by the said Will?\n(b) Does the document dealing with the Robert Simpson Co. Ltd. Profit Sharing Fund create a trust of the said fund in favour of the widow, or is said fund a part of the estate?\nOn January 9th, 1934, the Honourable Mr. Justice Garrow gave judgment on the motion, declaring that question (a) should be answered in the affirmative and directing that the insurance moneys should be paid to the executor and trustee and divided into two equal trust funds, free from payment of debts, the income from one to be paid to the widow with power to encroach on corpus, and the income from the other to be paid to the mother with power to encroach on corpus, and that, on the death of either the widow or the mother, the survivor should have absolutely what remained of both funds. The learned judge in effect held that the gift over to the sister Mamie Campbell, if living, otherwise to her then surviving issue per stirpes, was severable and alone was void. As to question (b) the learned judge held that the document was testamentary, and that, as it had only one witness, the funds formed part of the estate. The widow appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which affirmed the answer to (b), and varied the answer to (a) by providing that, if the widow should predecease the mother, the income from the whole insurance fund should be paid to the mother, with power to encroach on corpus, during her lifetime, and, on the subsequent death of the mother, the remainder of the fund should revert to the estate of the widow; and, in the event of the mother predeceasing the widow, the balance of the fund should thereupon belong to the widow absolutely.\nFrom this judgment, the widow now appeals to this Court.\nAs to question (a), some provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act are more or less relevant. Section 140 (2) provides that preferred beneficiaries are the husband, wife, children, grandchildren, father and mother of the person whose life is insured. Section 142 (1) provides that, subject to the rights of beneficiaries for value and assignees for value and to the provisions of the Act relating to preferred beneficiaries, the insured may designate the beneficiary by the contract or by a declaration, and may from time to time by any declaration appoint, appropriate or apportion the insurance money, or alter or revoke any prior designation, appointment, appropriation or apportionment, or substitute new beneficiaries... Section 145 (1) provides that where the insured, in pursuance of the provisions of section 142, designates as beneficiary or beneficiaries, a member or members of the class of preferred beneficiaries, a trust is created in favour of the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, and, so long as any of the class of preferred beneficiaries remains, the insurance money, or such part thereof as is or has been apportioned to a preferred beneficiary, shall not, except as otherwise provided in the Act, be subject to the control of the insured, or of his creditors, or form part of the estate of the insured. Section 146 provides that, notwithstanding the designation of a preferred beneficiary or beneficiaries, the insured may subsequently exercise the powers conferred by section 142 so as to restrict, limit, extend or transfer the benefits of the contract to any one or more of the class of preferred beneficiaries to the exclusion of any or all others of the class, or wholly or partly to one or more for life or any other term or subject to any limi- tation or contingency, with remainder to any other or others of the class. Section 163 (1) provides that the powers conferred upon the assured by that Part of the Act (which contains section 146 also) shall include power from time to time to appoint trustees for any beneficiary or beneficiaries.\nThe appellant contends that by virtue of section 145 (1) any attempt on the part of an assured to control the insurance money where a preferred beneficiary has been designated is void unless expressly permitted by some other provision of the Act; and that section 146 does not permit the alteration attempted by the will which purports to change the full ownership of the wife in the insurance moneys into a life estate for her in one-half and into a life estate for the mother in the other half, each with power to encroach on corpus, with remainder over to a sister of the assured, if living, otherwise to her issue per stirpes. It is conceded that the remainder over is not competent, as the latter parties are not within the class of preferred beneficiaries. The appellant contends, in other words, that on this account the attempted alteration is wholly void because section 146 permits an alteration to a life estate in one or more of the preferred class only where the remainder is to \u201cany other or others of the class.\u201d The contention of the appellant necessarily implies that the phrase \u201cwith remainder to any other or others of the class\u201d is a condition to the validity of such an alteration of the rights of a preferred beneficiary or beneficiaries so long as any of the class of preferred beneficiaries remains. An examination of the history of the statutory provisions in question does not throw much light on the question. It is, however, mainifest that section 146 is intended to be an enlarging enactment. This seems clear from the use of the words \u201cnotwithstanding,\u201d \u201cextend\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u201d in section 146 and from the opening words of section 163, \u201cThe powers conferred upon the insured by this Part with regard to the * * * alteration or revocation of such designation or appointment * * * \u201c. Section 146 clearly purports to enlarge the power of the assured over the insurance money in extending or transferring the benefits of the contract among members of the preferred class. It is true that it is a restraining enactment at the same time, but it is re- straining only in regard to the rights of the preferred beneficiaries which may, by the assured, be restricted, limited, extended or transferred to any one or more of the class of preferred beneficiaries to the exclusion of any or all others of the class. In my opinion, the phrase \u201cwith remainder to any other or others of the class\u201d is severable and not conditional. In other words, the section means that it is competent for the assured to transfer absolutely the rights of one preferred beneficiary to another preferred beneficiary, or, within the class, to transfer or leave, as the case may be, a limited estate such as a life estate, an estate for a term, an estate subject to a limitation or an estate in remainder.\n(b) The Revised Plan of The Robert Simpson Company Limited Employees\u2019 Savings and Profit Sharing Fund states that the intention of the Plan is to furnish to each participating employee:\n(a) Who remains an employee until retirement on account of age, an important contribution to future maintenance;\n(b) Who serves for an extended period of years, but not until retirement on account of age, a substantial accumulated sum;\n(c) Who dies while an employee, assistance in providing an income for family or dependents.\nThe Plan further states that participation in it will be entirely voluntary. Any employee is eligible to participate after one year of service and as long thereafter as he is employed. In order to join, the employee must sign an \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d and deposit the same with the Board of Trustees. Each participating employee deposits 5 per centum of his wages, not exceeding $100 yearly, and certain bonuses to the credit of the Fund. The company contributes 5 per centum of its net profits and The Robert Simpson Eastern Limited 5 per centum of the net profits of its mail order branch at Toronto. Provision is made for a Board of five Trustees selected by the company and for the vesting of the Fund in and the management of the Fund by the Board of Trustees, who stand possessed of the Fund and the investments, and of the interest of each participating employee upon the trusts and conditions and for the purposes of the Plan. An em- ployee who has not completed ten years of service may withdraw from the Plan at any time and shall thereupon be entitled to the amount deposited by him with interest at 5 per centum per annum with minor adjustments. If there is a balance at the credit of the employee\u2019s account, it will revert to the Fund. A participating employee may, according to the Plan, after ten years of service withdraw and shall thereupon be entitled to the full balance at his credit with minor adjustments. Upon the death of a participating employee, the full balance at his credit less minor adjustments shall be paid to such beneficiary or beneficiaries as the employee may have designated in writing lodged with the trustees, or by will. A participating employee may designate the beneficiary by the \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d or by an instrument in writing signed and lodged with the Trustees or by will, and the employee may from time to time revoke the benefits or change the beneficiaries or divert the money to his own estate.\nOn September 9th, 1926, the late J.C. Maclnnes executed an \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d and joined the Plan. In it he authorized the company to pay to the Board of Trustees of the Fund the bonus to which he might yearly be entitled and also 5 per centum of his wages and he directed the Board of Trustees provided by the Plan, (a) upon his withdrawal to pay to him the amount to which he was entitled in accordance with the Plan, (b) upon his death to pay the amount to which he was entitled to his wife, Annie Maclnnes, or otherwise as he might have last designated by writing lodged with the Board of Trustees or by will. There was only one witness to his signature.\nOn July 31st, 1931, as above stated, the late J.C. Maclnnes made his last will and testament. On June 17th, 1932, he assigned and transferred to the Bank of Montreal his interest in the Fund as collateral security for a loan. He covenanted that he had full power to assign the same and that he would execute such further assignments as might be required. After his death, the debt was paid off by the executor and trustee.\nThe precise question is whether the \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d with the designation of Annie Maclnnes as beneficiary is a trust in her favour or a testamentary instrument. If the latter, it is void, having only one wit- ness. On this question the words of Sir J.P. Wilde in Cock v. Cooke[3] are frequently quoted:\nIt is undoubted law that whatever may be the form of a duly executed instrument, if the person executing it intends that it shall not take effect until after his death, and it is dependent upon his death for its vigour and effect, it is testamentary.\nShortly afterwards, Lord Penzance in Robertson v. Smith and Lawrence[4], said that the guiding principle in determining whether a paper was or was not testamentary was this\u2014that it would be held testamentary if it was the intention of the maker that the gifts made by it should be dependent on his death. In In the Goods of Joseph Baxter[5] referred to by the Honourable Mr. Justice Middleton in the Court of Appeal, consideration was given to a nomination paper executed by the nominator under section 25 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act (1893). The paper was signed in the presence of two witnesses. It was invalid as a nomination paper because the amount it purported to dispose of was in fact over \u00a3100, but it was held testamentary and admitted as a will. Section 25 (1) provided that a member of a registered society might in writing nominate any person to or among whom his property in the society in whole or part should be transferred at his decease provided the amount credited to him in the books of the society did not then exceed \u00a3100. Section 25 (2) provided that a nomination so made might be revoked or varied by a similar writing but not by the will of the nominator. Joseph Baxter on January 6th, 1899, signed a nomination paper whereby he purported to give the whole amount at his credit at the time of his death to his nephew John Baxter. The nominator died on September 21st, 1901. After the death John Baxter applied for payment but was refused. A lawful sister and next of kin of the deceased then applied for and obtained a grant of letters of administration, she having sworn that Joseph Baxter died intestate. John Baxter then moved the court to revoke the letters of administration and to pronounce the nomination paper a will duly executed. Gorell Barnes J. held that, as the document was not operative as a nomination, subsection 2 had no effect, and granted administration with the will annexed to the applicant as the sole beneficiary. This case was referred to in Griffiths v. Eccles Provident, etc., Society, Limited[6]. The question in the latter case was simply whether the word \u201cthen,\u201d in section 25, subsection 1, referred to the date of the nomination paper or the date of death. It was held by Vaughan Williams, L.J., and Kennedy, L.J., that the word \u201cthen\u201d referred to the date of the nomination, Farwell, L.J., dissenting. The point decided in that case is not important in the case at bar, but certain statements in the judgments as to the testamentary character of a nomination under section 25 are helpful. Vaughan Williams, L.J., said, at page 282:\u2014\nThe view which I am taking is not a novel view, because in In the Goods of Baxter[7], this very question was raised and decided.\nGorrell Barnes J. said in that case: \u201cIn my judgment this document is testamentary. It fails, under the provisions of the Industrial Societies Act, 1893, to operate as a nomination paper. Under that Act, a member of the society may, by writing under his hand, nominate a person or persons to whom his interest in the society is to go after his death, * * *\u201d\nKennedy, L.J., agreed with the judgment of Vaughan Williams, L.J. In his dissenting judgment, Farwell, L.J., said, at page 284:\nThe nomination in pursuance of such a power is, like any other testamentary disposition, revocable, as, under the Wills Act, a will is revocable, and, like a will, does not, prior to the nominator\u2019s death, affect his property, but leaves him free to deal with it as he pleases, either by withdrawing it in accordance with the rules of the society, or receiving payment of his loans to the society, without any power of interference by the nominee. The nominator is in the position of a testator, and the nominee of a legatee.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal was affirmed by the House of Lords[8]. Earl Loreburn, L.C., was of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed. Lord Mersey said, page 490, that, once made, the nomination took effect, not by creating any charge or trust in favour of the nominee as against the nominator, but by giving to the nominee a right as against the society, in the event of the death of the member without having revoked the nomination, to require the society to transfer the property in accordance with the nomination. Until death the property was the property of the member, and all benefits accruing in respect of it during his lifetime were his also. Lord Atkinson concurred in the judgment of Lord Mersey. Lord Shaw of Dunfermline dissented on the point involved in the case, but nowhere was it suggested in the Court of Appeal or in the House of Lords that the nomination was not testamentary in character.\nIt has already been pointed out that the intention of the Plan in the case at bar was to furnish to each participating employee who remained until retirement on account of age, a contribution to future maintenance; to each employee who served an extended term of years, but not until retirement on account of age, a substantial accumulated sum; and to each employee who died, assistance in providing for his family or dependents. An employee with less than ten years of service could withdraw for himself approximately the amount deposited with interest. An employee after ten years of service could withdraw for himself approximately the balance at his credit. Any participating employee could revoke the benefits or change the beneficiaries or divert the money to his estate by instrument in writing or by will. The \u201cEmployee\u2019s Acceptance\u201d did not, in the words of Lord Mersey, supra, create any charge or trust in favour of the nominee against the nominator. Until death the beneficial interest in the amount which the participating employee could withdraw was in the employee. If he died while a participating employee, his beneficiary had a right to his share of the Fund. The right of the beneficiary was dependent upon the death of the participating employee for its vigour and effect.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs payable by the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, Grant, Dods & MacDonald.\nSolicitors for the respondents Margaret Maclnnes, Mamie Campbell, and certain children of the latter: Stewart & O\u2019Donnell.\nOfficial Guardian, representing infants and unborn issue of Mamie Campbell: McGregor Young.\nSolicitors for the Executor of the Estate of Deceased: Armstrong & Sinclair.\n[1] [1934] O.R. 371; [1934] 3 D.L.R. 302.\n[2] [1934] O.R. 120; [1934] 1 D.L.R. 733.\n[3] (1866) L.R. 1 Pro. & Div. 241 at 243.\n[4] (1870) L.R. 2 Pro. & Div. 43.\n[5] [1903] P. 12.\n[6] [1911] 2 K.B. 275.\n[7] [1903] P. 12, 14.\n[8] [1912] A.C. 483.\n"}

At the trial the jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff for $7,261.40, and judgment was entered for him for that sum. The Appeal Division set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial, it being of opinion that there was misdirection in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, and that specific questions should have been put to the jury. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nAfter hearing arguments of counsel, this Court reserved judgment and on a subsequent day delivered judgment allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment at trial, with costs throughout. Reasons for judgment were delivered by Duff C.J. and by Cannon J. (with whom Crocket, Hughes and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ. concurred. Duff C.J. in his reasons also expressed concurrence with Cannon J.). Duff C.J. was of opinion that the issue for the jury was stated in the trial judge\u2019s charge clearly and with substantial accuracy; that, while an isolated sentence here and there might, if separated from its context, convey a false impression, the charge as a whole could not operate unfairly to the defendant\u2019s prejudice; this view being fortified by the fact that no exception was taken by counsel at the trial. He was also of opinion that the evidence was not insufficient to support the verdict. As to the objection that specific questions should have been put to the jury, he pointed out that the matter was one peculiarly for the judgment of the trial judge; it did not appear that counsel suggested that specific questions should be addressed to the jury; the trial judge might well have-considered the course he adopted as the more just and convenient one. He concluded as follows:\n\u201cHaving reached the conclusion that there was no substantial misdirection, that the issue for their decision was adequately put before the jury, and that there was evidence upon which they might reasonably determine that issue as they did (and the learned trial judge having exercised the discretion with which the law invests him as to the form in which the jury was to be asked to express this finding), the appellant could not properly be deprived of the verdict he has obtained, because I might think that, if I had been in his place, I might have considered it convenient to submit specific questions; unless, at all events, it plainly appeared that, because of the course taken by the trial judge, the respondents had suffered some substantial wrong or prejudice.\u201d\nCannon J., after dealing with the facts and the evidence at length, and discussing the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, expressed the opinion that the trial judge had not misdirected the jury; that the trial judge was entitled to use his discretion about putting specific questions to the jury under ss. 41 and 42 of the New Brunswick Judicature Act; that his charge explained clearly to the jury upon what findings of fact they could find generally for either plaintiff or defendant. He pointed out that it did not appear that counsel for defendant required the judge to submit specific questions. As to non-direction, in the absence of a request by counsel to the judge to add to his charge, Cannon J. referred to B.C. Electric Ry. Co. v. Key[2], and held that, under the circumstances of this case, a new trial for non-direction should not be granted, as the interests of substantial justice did not require it, quoting from the judgment of Lord Morris in Seaton v. Burnand[3]. Upon the verdict and the evidence he concluded as follows:\n\u201cWe cannot reach the conclusion that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence, although we might have reached a different view if we had been members of the jury. There was sufficient evidence, written and verbal, to justify the verdict, and we cannot substitute ourselves for the jury in what by law is their exclusive realm. There was testimony as to the exact scope of the appellant\u2019s duties brought by both sides, and the jury were entitled to believe the appellant; they had sufficient evidence before them to find that the duties as defined in Walker\u2019s letter were not those of the Chief of the Planning department and constituted a breach of the contract by the respondent. The jury also must have found, under the judge\u2019s directions, that at all times the appellant was willing to perform his duties and that, instead of being called upon to do so, he was wrongfully refused the right to perform them.\u201d\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nO.

V (1927, Dom.), c. 58, are not assessable for business tax as an \u201coccupier\u201d within s. 357 (1) of the Halifax City Charter (1931). The relation of the Commissioners to the Crown in respect of their occupation of the harbour property is of such a character as to constitute that occupation an occupation \u201cfor the Crown\u201d in the sense of the principle stated in The Queen v. McCann, L.R. 3 Q.B. 141, at 145-6, and as elucidated in its application in other cases. (Coomber v. Justices of Berks, 9 App. Cas. 61, and other cases, cited. Fox v. Government of Newfoundland, [1898] A.C. 667, and Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v. Sheedy, [1927] A.C. 899, distinguished, in view of the constitution, duties and powers of the bodies there in question). Provincial legislation to tax the Commissioners as occupier of the harbour property would be ultra vires; and the general taxing words of the City Charter should be read as excluding such a tax.\nAPPEAL by the City of Halifax from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] holding in effect that the Halifax Harbour Commissioners (respondents) occupy the Halifax Harbour property as agents of the Crown and are exempt from the business tax (for which they were assessed) imposed by The City Charter (1931) of the City of Halifax. Certain questions were submitted in a case stated by the Court of Tax Appeals of the City of Halifax, under s. 406 of the City Charter, for the Judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia presiding in Chambers at Halifax, and were referred by Hall J. to the Supreme Court en banc.\nThe stated case sets out (inter alia) as follows: The Halifax Harbour Commissioners is a body corporate incorporated by c. 58 of the Statutes of Canada, 1927. It does not own any real estate within the City of Halifax, the title to all real property occupied or operated by it being vested in His Majesty the King in the Right of the Dominion of Canada. It carries on operations at the Port of Halifax, as provided by said c. 58 of the Statutes of Canada, 1927, and for such purpose controls, operates and occupies certain lands in the City of Halifax. On February 6, 1933, Halifax Harbour Commissioners was assessed under the provisions of the Halifax City Charter (1931) on the assessment roll of the City of Halifax for $450,000 in respect of business tax for property occupied for business or professional purposes, as provided by s. 357 (1) of the Halifax City Charter (1931) (said property being that above referred to). The Commissioners appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals for the City of Halifax. That court stated a case in writing for the opinion of a Judge in Chambers. Certain sections of the City Charter are set out, including the following:\n356. The taxation of the City shall consist of\n(a) Business Tax,\n(b) Household Tax,\n(c) Licences and Special Taxes,\n(d) Poll Tax and Non-residential Tax,\n(e) Real Property Tax,\nall as hereinafter specified and defined.\n357. (1) The Business Tax shall be a tax payable by every occupier of any real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, except such as is exempt as is herein provided, and shall be payable by such occupier, whether as owner, tenant or otherwise and whether assessed as owner of such property for real property tax or not.\n(2) [Tax rate and percentage of value of premises on which rate fixed].\n(3) The occupant of any real property for any other purpose other than for the purpose of any trade, calling or profession, or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, and not for residential purposes, and not otherwise exempted, shall be liable to a tax of one-half of one per cent on the value of the premises so occupied. 1921, c. 77, s. 20; c. 78.\n370. The following real property shall be exempt from real property tax:\n(a) the property of His Majesty used for Imperial, Dominion or Provincial purposes;\n* * *\n371. No household tax or business tax shall be paid by the occupiers of any of the foregoing properties declared to be exempt from real property tax if such occupiers are the owners thereof and are occupying the same solely for the purposes of the association or other body specified as entitled to exemption. 372. If any real property entitled to exemption is let for residential or business purposes, the portion so let shall cease during the period of such letting to be entitled to any exemption and the occupant thereof shall be liable to household tax or business tax as the case may be.\n373. No exemption from taxation conferred by this Act or under the authority thereof shall apply to any person occupying for a residential, recreational, commercial or industrial purpose any building or land, the property of His Majesty, as represented by either the Government of Canada or of the Province of Nova Scotia; and every person so occupying any such land shall be rated and taxed in like manner as if he were the actual owner of such land and shall be liable to the rates and taxes assessed and rated in respect thereto, 1925, c. 83, s. 3.\n374. Except as is herein otherwise provided, if any property is let to the Crown or to any person, corporation or association exempt from taxation, such property shall be deemed to be in the occupation of the owner thereof for business or residential purposes as the case may be, and he shall be assessed and rated for household tax or business tax according to the purpose for which it is occupied.\nThe stated case sets out that the Commissioners allege, and the City denies, that the assessment was illegal on the ground that the Halifax Harbour Commissioners is exempt from business tax by virtue of s. 125 of the British North America Act and the provisions of the City Charter, the reasons urged on behalf of the Commissioners being that:\n(1) The said Halifax Harbour Commissioners does not own any real property in the City of Halifax.\n(2) The only property at present occupied by the Commissioners is property of His Majesty used for Dominion purposes, which property is exempt from taxation by virtue of the British North America Act.\n(3) Under the City Charter (1931) no business tax is payable in respect of the occupancy of any property exempt from taxation.\n(4) The said Halifax Harbour Commissioners does not occupy any building or land whatever for any commercial or industrial purpose.\n(5) All real property, lands and buildings within the City of Halifax at present occupied or used by the Commissioners are the property of His Majesty and are used for Dominion purposes and are not used for commercial or industrial purposes, and the said Halifax Harbour Commissioners in using and occupying such land is doing so as the agent and servant of the Government of Canada and for governmental purposes only.\nThe questions reserved for decision were:\n(1) Whether the Halifax Harbour Commissioners are occupiers of any real property within the meaning of the City Charter (1931).\n(2) If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative whether the Halifax Harbour Commissioners are occupiers of any real property for the purpose of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for the purpose of gain. (3) If the answer to the foregoing questions are in the affirmative and the Halifax Harbour Commissioners are occupiers of real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for the purposes of gain, whether they are exempted from Business Tax by any provision of the Halifax City Charter or by any other enactment.\n(4) If the answers to questions 1 and 2 are in the negative and it is decided that the Halifax Harbour Commissioners are not liable to be assessed for Business Tax whether the tax provided by Subsection 3 of Section 357 can be assessed against the Halifax Harbour Commissioners.\n(5) How the costs of the application are to be borne.\nIn the Court en banc, Graham J., with whom Carroll and Hall JJ. concurred, came to the conclusion, \u201cwith some doubt,\u201d that \u201cthe Commissioners are to be considered agents of the Government,\u201d and that the third question should be answered in the affirmative. Doull J. held that the Commissioners were \u201cexempt from business tax as agents and servants of the Crown occupying the property on behalf of the Crown.\u201d By the formal judgment of the Court en banc, the questions submitted were answered as follows: (1) Yes, (2) Yes, (3) Yes, (4) No, (5) There should be no costs to either party.\nThe City of Halifax appealed.\nC. P. Bethune for the appellant.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff, C.J.\u2014The question, the answer to which, in my view, must determine this appeal, is whether or not the respondents, the Halifax Harbour Commissioners, fall within the description \u201coccupier\u201d within the meaning of section 357 (1) of the Halifax charter. The conclusion I have reached is that this question must be answered in the negative.\nThe governing principle can, perhaps, for the purposes of this case, be most conveniently stated in the words of Lord Blackburn (Blackburn J. as he then was), in his judgment in The Queen v. McCann[2]. He is there dealing with an issue raised as to the liability of the Commissioners of Works and Buildings to be rated to the relief of the poor under 43 Eliz., ch. 2, s. 1, in respect of their occupation of a bridge across the Thamas at Chelsea. He says:\nSince the decision relating to the Mersey Docks, as a general rule, the occupier of property from which profit is derived, is to be rated, without regard to the purpose to which the profits are ultimately appropriated; but property in the occupation of the Crown\u2014the Crown not being named in the statute of Elizabeth\u2014forms an exception to this rule; consequently where the Crown is the occupier of property it is not to be rated; and further, where property is occupied for the Crown it is not to be rated. It is on this\u2019 principle that a servant of the Crown, who had taken a lease of premises to be used as barracks, as in Lord Amherst v. Lord Sommers[3], was held not liable to be rated; and this principle extends to the case of a person in occupation of premises, whether as servant or trustee for the Crown: and so far from being overruled in the case of Mersey Docks[4], this principle was affirmed.\nThe courts have had to decide, in a number of cases, whether property occupied for public purposes was occupied \u201cfor the Crown,\u201d or in trust for the Crown, within this principle. I think the principle is properly applicable to the construction of such an enactment as section 357. The rule has been uniformly followed in England and Scotland in the application of rating statutes, and one may fairly assume that one is not running counter to the intention of the legislature in applying it to a Canadian enactment in pari materia and expressed in terms not substatially differing in effect.\nThere are, morever, relevant considerations resting upon the circumstances that the respondents are a public body charged with the management and administration of property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, and that their revenues are derived from charges collected in the course of such administration, and from tolls levied under the authority of the Parliament of Canada, in respect of the use of the public harbour of Halifax of which the Crown, in the right of the Dominion, is proprietor, to which it will be necessary to advert.\nBefore discussing these matters, it is advisable to consider the powers and rights of the respondents, under the statute of 1927, by which they were incorporated, and subsequent statutes affecting them, and, in particular, the relation in which they stand, in the exercise of these powers, to His Majesty and His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council and Ministers of State for Canada.\nThe property occupied by the respondents consists of property belonging to the harbour of Halifax, and is the property of the Crown. The object and purposes of the Legislature in vesting the occupation of this property in the respondents are disclosed by the legislation we have to discuss. Broadly speaking, the duties of the Commissioners are, in general terms, of two descriptions. First, they are responsible for the management and administration of the harbour and of property belonging to the harbour and of facilities connected therewith; secondly, they are charged with the duty of regulating the exercise of public rights of navigation within the harbour, including the mooring, berthing, discharging or loading of vessels, and everything incidental thereto.\nIn the exercise of all their powers, they are, as we shall see, subject to the control of the Crown, exercised either through the Governor in Council, that is to say, the Governor, as the representative of His Majesty, acting upon the advice of His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council for Canada, or through the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. This is a matter of no little importance and it is right, therefore, to enter into particulars.\nBy section 8, the statute declares that nothing shall be deemed \u201cto give the Corporation jurisdiction or control respecting private properties or rights\u201d within the limits of the harbour as defined.\nThen, by the same section, it is enacted that the respondents shall have no right to enter upon, or to deal with, any property of the Crown, except when so authorized by Order in Council.\nThe respondents, by section 10, are given wide powers for the acquisition of real and personal property for the purposes of the harbour, but these powers can only be executed after approval by the Governor in Council. There is also, under the same section, a power to sell or lease, but subject to the same condition. The section, moreover, enacts that real property acquired under these powers shall \u201cbe acquired in the name of, and vested in, His Majesty.\u201d\nWhere the respondents proceed (under the authority of the Government, of course) by way of expropriation, they are entitled to avail themselves of the provisions of the Railway Act, but, even in such proceedings, the powers vested by that statute in the Board of Railway Commissioners are to be exercised by the Governor in Council (section 13).\nAgain (section 14), the Governor in Council is authorized to transfer elevators, wharfs, piers, buildings, structures, machinery and equipment, the property of His Majesty, within the limits of the harbour, foreshores, water lots and other real property \u201cto the jurisdiction of\u201d the respondents, to be \u201csubject to the control of and administration by\u201d the respondents; but under such terms and contions as may be prescribed by the Governor in Council.\nThe respondents are empowered to make regulations by by-law, concerning the conduct and government of the Corporation, its officers and servants; the compensation or salaries to be paid to such officers or servants; the management, control and improvement of the property, real and personal, under its jurisdiction; the use of harbour facilities; the lease or allotment of harbour property, plant or facilities; the construction and maintenance of wharfs, piers, buildings and other structures within the harbour limits; the imposition and collection of rates and tolls on vessels and their cargoes, on goods or cargo landed, shipped or stored in the harbour, and for the use of any buildings, plant or facilities under the control of the Corporation; but no such by-law can have any force or effect until confirmed by the\u2019 Governor in Council. The same observation applies to by-laws regulating the navigation of the harbour and matters incidental thereto.\nFor our present purposes, perhaps the most significant provisions of the statute are those relating to the sources of capital funds and revenue and the expenditure thereof. The contemplated sources of revenue appear to be the rates and tolls on vessels and cargoes, and on goods, and the charges for the use of buildings, plant and harbour facilities, which, as already mentioned, the respondents are empowered to impose by by-laws confirmed by the Governor in Council; and penalties imposed under like authority. As to the sources of capital funds, the respondents are, by the statute of 1927, invested with borrowing powers (section 18). These borrowing powers are given for the purpose of enabling the respondents to\nconstruct, acquire, repair or improve wharves and other works and structures in the harbour;\nbut only\nafter the approval by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, of the plans, specifications and estimates in detail for the work proposed, and the amount proposed to be borrowed.\nDebentures may be issued, secured upon the revenues or property receivable or controlled by the Corporation, and may be sold on terms approved by the Governor in Council.\nIt does not appear, from the statute of 1927 itself, whether or not it was supposed that the capital funds provided by borrowing should be obtained from or through the Government, or from other sources. However that may be, statutes were passed in substantially identical terms, except as to amounts, in the years 1928, 1929 and 1931, for providing the respondents with capital funds by loans from time to time from the Government of Canada, not exceeding a maximum named in each case.\nUnder the statute of 1928, the total amount to be advanced, which, the statute declares, it was understood would meet the total requirements of the respondents for the ensuing year, was not to exceed the sum of $500,000. The statute of 1929 authorized the advance of a total sum not exceeding $5,000,000 in addition to moneys already placed at the disposition of the respondents; and that of 1931, a further sum of $3,500,000.\nIt is material to refer to the conditions controlling the Governor in Council in making these advances. The purposes of the advances, the statutes declare in general terms, is to enable the respondents to construct such terminal facilities in the harbour of Halifax, according to plans approved by the Governor in Council, as may be necessary properly to equip the harbour. No loan, it is enacted, is to be paid, unless detailed plans, specifications and estimates, for the works on which the money is to be expended, satisfactory to the Minister of Marine, have been approved by the Governor in Council, before any part of the work has been commenced. The respondents are required to\nsubmit to the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, for approval, monthly applications for loans on account of the different items of construction of terminal facilities, accompanied by statements showing the total expenditure on these different items in detail, for the month which the loan is to cover, and any other statements required in such form as the Minister shall direct; and upon approval of the application, authority for the payment of the amount so applied for may be granted by the Governor in Council.\nUpon any loan being made, debentures equal in par value to the loan, bearing interest at five per cent, payable half-yearly, are to be deposited with the Minister of Finance; and the principal and interest of the sums loaned are to be payable \u201cby the Corporation out of all its property and assets and out of all its tolls, rates, dues, penalties and other sources of revenue and income\u201d and charged thereon under the conditions laid down by section 19 of the Act of 1927.\nThe legislation provides no means of obtaining capital funds other than such borrowing, except the sale of property; and, in resorting to that, as well as in exercising their borrowing powers, the respondents are entirely under the control of the Governor in Council.\nThe property under the control of the respondents, other than its revenues, consists, therefore, of properties transferred by the Crown \u201cto the jurisdiction of\u201d the respondents, or \u201centered upon,\u201d with the authority of the Governor in Council; properties purchased with money taken from revenue, with the consent of the Governor in Council; properties acquired and constructed through the expenditure of moneys borrowed (which, in fact, seem to have been confined to moneys advanced by the Governor in Council under the legislation of 1928, 1929 and 1931); and, as regards this last mentioned class, the respondents, as we have seen, are, at every step in the course of the acquisition of such properties, under the control of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries and the Governor in Council.\nThe revenues, as already indicated, would be revenues derived from charges collected for the use of the property and facilities under the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the respondents, and tolls payable for the use of the port, and from penalties; all such charges and tolls and penalties being fixed by bylaws which must be approved by the Governor in Council.\nThe control over the expenditure is singularly rigorous. We have noticed the conditions under which moneys borrowed are disbursed. By section 19 (1) (a) all revenue is to be applied, first of all, in payment of the necessary expenses incurred in the collection of it, and\nin the management and operation of the harbour services, and in the maintenance and ordinary repair of its works and facilities;\nand, by the same clause, the expenditure of all revenue is subject to the supervision and control of the Minister. The compensation and salaries of all officers, assistants, engineers, clerks and servants are to be fixed by by-law, which must receive the approval of the Governor in Council.\nBy section 21 (a) the respondents are required to keep separate detailed accounts of receipts and disbursements on capital account, as well as on revenue account, and there is to be an audit by the Department of Marine and Fisheries.\nThen, by section 20, the Minister may, when the gross revenue exceeds $50,000 per annum, require the respondents to submit at the beginning of each current year, an estimate of its expenditures on each of the different services of the harbour, (a) out of revenue, and (b) out of capital funds. These estimates are to be subject to the approval of the Minister; who may require the reduction of any item. And the statute requires peremptorily that the expenditure for the year shall be confined \u201cto a total within the estimates so approved.\u201d This last is a statutory provision binding, apparently, upon the Minister and the Governor in Council, as well as on the respondents. But further, within the limits so fixed, the expenditure of all revenue is, as already mentioned, by section 19, subject to the supervision and control of the Minister. Any surplus of revenue, after payment of the costs of collection and services, is to be applied, first, in payment of interest on money borrowed, and, secondly, under the direction of the Minister, in the creation of a sinking fund.\nThe remaining provisions of the statute, except those concerned with the constitution of the Corporation, do not require any special comment save, perhaps, this: the powers of the respondents in respect of the collection of rates and tolls, and the enforcement and collection of penalties, and their rights in respect of the recovery of damages to their property are exceptional, and of such a character as to suggest that the services of the respondents are regarded by the statute as exclusively governmental services. The constitution of the Corporation is important. There are three Commissioners, each of which is appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister. Their tenure of office is \u201cduring pleasure.\u201d One of them is to be President, to be named from time to time by the Governor in Council. A Commissioner resigns his office by notice in writing to the Minister. The Governor in Council determines their remuneration, which is to be paid out of the revenue of the harbour.\nI agree with the view unanimously accepted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the relation of the respondents to the Crown, in respect of the occupation for which they have been assessed, is of such a character as to constitute that occupation an occupation \u201cfor the Crown\u201d in the sense of the principle as stated above, in the language of Lord Blackburn, and as elucidated in its application by the courts in England and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nIt is not necessary, I think, to go through the authorities in detail. The judgments of Lord Blackburn and Lord Watson in Coomber v. Justices of Berks[5] show very clearly indeed the view accepted by these great judges as to the scope of the principle. They both adopt the statement of it by Lord Cairns in Greig v. University of Edinburgh[6] in these words:\nThe Crown not being named in the English or Scotch statutes on the subject of assessment, and not being bound by statute when not expressly named, any property which is in the occupation of the Crown or of persons using it exclusively in and for the service of the Crown, is not rate-able to the relief of the poor.\nIt is quite clear, however, that the phrase \u201cservice of the Crown\u201d is not understood by them in any such limited sense as would exclude such services as those performed by the respondents. At page 68, Lord Blackburn, after referring to Lord Westbury\u2019s language in the Mersey Docks case[7], says:\n* * * in Greig v. University of Edinburgh[8] he more clearly shows what was his view by using this language \u201cproperty occupied by the servants of the Crown, and (according to the theory of the Constitution) property occupied for the purposes of the administration of the government of the country, became exempt from liability to the poor-rate.\u201d He proceeds to say that Lord Cranworth (in his judgment in the Mersey Docks case (1)) was on his guard against being supposed to decide that all the earlier cases were right \"in deciding that the purposes were those of the public government \"; but that he does not impeach them.\nTurning to the judgment of Lord Watson, we find him employing language pointing to the essential distinction as that between public purposes in the broad sense and (in Lord Blackburn's phrase) \"purposes of the public government.\" At p. 73, Lord Watson says it was sufficient in the Mersey Docks case (2)\nto establish that occupation for what were strictly speaking public, though in no sense Government, purposes, was not, as regarded exemption from the poor-rate, in pari casu with the occupation of the Crown.\nHe seems to say that the point for consideration in such cases is whether or not the occcupation \"must be held to be \" for \" a proper Government use,\" and this appears to be adopted by Lord Bramwell at p. 79.\nTo state again, in more summary fashion, the nature of the powers and duties of the respondents: Their occupation is for the purpose of managing and administering the public harbour of Halifax and the properties belonging thereto which are the property of the Crown; their powers are derived from a statute of the Parliament of Canada; but they are subject at every turn in executing those powers to the\ncontrol of the Governor representing His Majesty and acting on the advice of His Majesty's Privy Council for Canada, or of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries; they cannot take possession of any property belonging to the harbor property without the consent of, and only upon such terms as may be imposed by, the Government; they cannot acquire property or dispose of property without the same consent; they can only acquire capital funds by measures taken under the control of the Government; they can only apply capital funds in constructing works and facilities under a supervision and control, the character of which has been explained; the tolls and charges which are the sources of their revenue they can only impose under the authority of the Government; the expenditure of revenues in the maintenance of services is under the control and supervision of a Government Department;\n(1) (1864) 11 H.L.C. 443, at 508. (2) (1864) 11 H.L.C. 443. the salaries and compensation payable to officers and servants are determined under the authority of the Government; the regulations necessary for the control of the harbour, the harbour works, officers and servants, the proceedings of the Corporation, can only take effect under same authority; the surplus of revenue after providing for costs of services and the interest on the debenture debt goes into a sinking fund under the direction of the\nMinister; finally, they are appointed by the Crown and hold office during pleasure.\nI cannot doubt that the services contemplated by this legislation are, not only public services in the broad sense, but also, in the strictest sense, Government services; or that the occupation of the Government property with which we are concerned is, in the meaning with which Lord Cairns used the words in the passage cited (and in the sense in which those words were interpreted by Lord Blackburn and Lord Watson), an occupation by persons \" using \" that property \" exclusively in and for the service of the Crown.\"\nIt is not without importance to observe that, since Confederation, except in special cases where it has been found convenient to make provision for the administration of harbours by the appointment of harbour commissioners, the control, management and regulation of the matters committed to the charge of the respondents have been treated in this country as ;belonging to the services of the Crown.\nBy chapter 89 of the Revised Statutes of Canada (1927), section 4,\n* * * the use, maintenance, and ordinary repairs of all harbours, wharfs, piers and breakwaters constructed or completed at the expense of Canada, or in any way the property of Canada, and the making and enforcing of regulations concerning such use, maintenance and ordinary repairs, and the collection of tolls and dues for such use,\nare placed under the control and management of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. By the same statute (section 7), the Governor in Council is empowered \" on the recommendation of the Minister \" (of Marine and Fisheries) to \" make rules and regulations for the use and management of such harbours, wharfs, piers and breakwaters \" and to establish \" a tariff or tariffs of the tolls and dues to be paid for the use of \" them \" to be levied\nPage 228]\non persons or vessels using them, and on goods, wares or merchandise landed or shipped on or from off them.\u201d\nThe statute substantially in its present form has been in effect since 1877. Prior to that date, the powers vested in the Department of Marine and Fisheries by the statute of 1877 had been exercised in part by that department, and in part by the Public Works Department. By chapter 42 of the statutes of 1872 it was enacted:\n2. The Governor in Council may from time to time appoint a fit and proper person to be Harbour Master for the Port of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia.\n3. Every Harbour Master appointed under this Act shall be under the control of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, to whom he shall furnish a report in writing and on oath, as soon as possible after the thirty-first day of December in each year, of his doings in office, and of the fees of office received by him during such year.\n4. The rights, powers and duties of the Harbour Master for the Port of Halifax, shall be such as may from time to time be conferred and imposed upon him by rules and regulations made by the Governor in Council for the government of his office and of the Port of Halifax, and for his remuneration, which rules and regulations the Governor in Council is hereby authorized and empowered to make, and from time to time to alter, amend or repeal.\nThese provisions applied to the Port of Halifax down to 1927.\nTwo judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are relied upon by the appellants. The first is Fox v. Government of Newfoundland[9]. The question involved in that case was whether certain moneys owing to the boards of education of Newfoundland took priority over ordinary debts in the liquidation of a bank, as falling within the description \u201cdebts and claims due to the Crown or to the government or revenues of the Colony.\u201d The question considered by the Judicial Committee was whether or not these boards were agents of the government. It was held they were not. That view was based upon provisions of the statute by which the boards were constituted.\nTheir Lordships held that,\nThe appointment of boards for each of the three religious denominations, and the constitution of the board, indicate that it is * * * to have within the limit of general educational purposes a discretionary power in expending\nthe moneys transferred to it\u2014\u201ca power which is independent of the Government.\u201d There was provision for auditing of the accounts, but it was held that this was merely for the information of the Government and Legislature and not in order that any item of expenditure might be disallowed if the Government did not approve of it. The statute made a distinction between money to be expended by a board of education and money to be expended as the Governor in Council might determine.\nIt is quite evident that these considerations have no application in the present case. The control, carefully reserved, as we have seen, to the Government, by the statute before us, had no place in the Newfoundland scheme.\nIn Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v. Sheedy[10] a similar question was raised: that is to say, whether a debt due to the Metropolitan Meat Industry Board of New South Wales was a debt due to the Crown. Lord Haldane, who delivered the judgment of the Committee, discusses the cases to which reference has already been made. As regards Fox v. Government of Newfoundland[11], he explains the ratio decidendi in this way:\nThe reason was that the various boards of education were not mere agents of the Government for the distribution of money entrusted to them, but were to have, within the limits of general educational purposes, uncontrolled discretionary power in expending it. The service, in other words, was not treated as being the service of the Sovereign exclusively within the meaning of the principle, but their own service.\nAs regards the New South Wales Board, whose powers were under review, he says,\nThey are a body with discretionary powers of their own. Even if a Minister of the Crown has power to interfere with them, there is nothing in the statute which makes the acts of administration his as distinguished from theirs. That they were incorporated does not matter. It is also true that the Governor appoints their members and can veto certain of their actions. But these provisions, even when taken together, do not outweigh the fact that the Act of 1915 confers on the appellant Board wide powers which are given to it to be exercised at its own discretion and without consulting the direct representatives of the Crown. Such are the powers of acquiring land, constructing abattoirs and works, selling cattle and meat, either on its own behalf or on behalf of other persons, and leasing its property. Nor does the Board pay its receipts into the general revenue of the State, and the charges it levies go into its own fund.\nObviously, there is little relevant analogy between such a body and the respondents, whose duties mainly consist in managing and administering property which belongs to the Crown, and whose activities, and whose revenues and expenditures, are subject to the control and supervision of the Grown, as explained above.\nThe position of the respondents cannot, I think, in any pertinent sense, be distinguished from that of the Commissioners whose status was in question in The Queen v. McCann[12]. Indeed, if, instead of three Harbour Commissioners to be appointed by the Crown, holding office during pleasure, the statute had made provision for the appointment of a single Harbour Commissioner, that Commissioner to be the Minister of Marine, or the Deputy Minister of Marine, for the time being, we should have had a substantially identical case.\nBut there is another point of view from which the controversy in this appeal ought to be considered. It results, I think, from the examination of the legislation, first, that, as I have already said, the occupation by the respondents of the property and facilities under their \u201cjurisdiction\u201d is an occupation for the Dominion of Canada; and, second, that the property of the respondents is part of the public property of Canada.\nI have nothing to add upon the first branch of this proposition. As to the second, there are some points which ought, perhaps, to be emphasized.\nFirst of all, the public harbour of Halifax passed, by force of section 108 of the British North America Act, as property, to the Crown in right of the Dominion, and is still part of the public property of the Dominion. Admittedly, indeed, all the real property and harbour facilities over which the respondents exercise any control are the property of the Government. The sources of revenue are the charges and tolls payable in respect of the use of the harbour and harbour facilities. Moneys obtained by borrowing are obtained upon the security of these revenues and sources of revenue\u2014in actual fact in the form of advances by the Government upon such security. The ultimate source of all revenue, outside of port dues (part of the duties and revenues vested in the Dominion by the British North America Act, section 102), is the property of the Dominion. The statute treats all these revenues as moneys at the disposition of Parliament, and, subject to the specific directions of the statute, gives the control of them to the Government.\nIf the Corporation had been constituted as above suggested, as consisting of a single Commissioner, to be the Minister of Marine for the time being, it would not have been disputed that a proposal to levy a tax upon the Corporation\u2019s occupation of the harbour property was virtually a proposal to tax the Dominion Government, or the property of the Dominion Government. Any such attempt must fail, as ultra vires of a Provincial Legislature. The general words of the charter should be read as excluding such a tax.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. P.

M., 10 App. Cas. 171, at 186). Lapse of time, though not in itself under ordinary circumstances an absolute bar to a suit for nullity, is yet an important factor for consideration, and may operate with other circumstances as a bar to such a suit (B-n v. B-n, 164 Eng. Rep. 144).\nWhere a husband petitioned, over eight years after the marriage, for nullity of his marriage because of his wife\u2019s malformation and impotence, this Court held (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which reversed judgment at trial granting the petition) that the husband, on the facts and circumstances established, should have known years before the suit, and would have so known had he acted as any ordinarily reasonable and prudent man would have acted in the circumstances, that his wife\u2019s condition was one which could not be rectified by surgical skill, and his explanation at the trial for his inaction was one which should not be accepted as valid and sufficient in the circumstances disclosed. Where the relevant facts as to the relation and conduct of the parties are not disputed, a judge sitting on appeal, with the whole record before him, is quite as competent to make a finding, as to the petitioner\u2019s belief and motive, as the trial tribunal, and should find in accordance with his firm conviction thereon.\nAPPEAL (by leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, on certain conditions fulfilled) by the petitioner (husband) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which reversed the judgment of Montague J. granting the petitioner a decree of nullity of his marriage with the respondent. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nJ. S. Lamont for the appellant.\nP. C. Locke and L. D. Morosnick for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba setting aside the decision of Mr. Justice Montague granting the prayer of the appellant\u2019s petition for the nullity of his marriage with the respondent by reason of malformation and impotence.\nThe marriage was solemnized at Winnipeg on June 20th, 1925, and the appellant\u2019s petition filed on January 19th, 1934, after the parties had lived and cohabited together continuously and apparently congenially for a period of over eight years.\nThe appellant was 28 years old at the time of the marriage. He was then a practising barrister, but some time afterwards accepted a position with the Traders\u2019 Finance Corporation of Winnipeg. He said his wife was the same age, but her counsel stated before the Appeal Court that her age at the time of the marriage was 25.\nThere seems to be no doubt as to the existence of an irremediable congenital malformation on the part of the respondent, which rendered normal coition impossible. Indeed that fact was expressly admitted by the respondent\u2019s counsel at the trial, where the controversy between the parties was confined to the issue as to whether the appellant, by reason of his constant cohabitation with the respondent for a period of more than eight years and his laches, delay and insincerity in seeking a nullity decree, had not barred himself from the relief to which he would otherwise have been entitled.\nThere is no doubt that it must now be taken as authoritatively settled that a marriage solemnized between two persons, one of whom is incapable of properly consummating it, may, nevertheless, be so approbated by the acts and conduct of the other as to preclude the latter from impeaching its validity. Lord Chancellor Selborne\u2019s dictum to this effect in the Scottish appeal of G. v. M.[1] in the House of Lords in 1885 has never since been questioned. \u201cThere may\u201d he said,\nbe conduct on the part of the person seeking this remedy which ought to estop that person from having it; as, for instance, any act from which the inference ought to be drawn that during the antecedent time the party has, with a knowledge of the facts and of the law, approbated the marriage which he or she afterwards seeks to get rid of, or has taken advantages and derived benefits from the matrimonial relation, which it would be unfair and inequitable to permit him or her, after having received them, to treat as if no such relation had ever existed.\nIt must also, we think, be taken as settled that lapse of time, though not in itself under ordinary circumstances an absolute bar to nullity proceedings, is yet an important factor for consideration, and will, if not satisfactorily accounted for, operate with other circumstances proving insincerity, as a bar to such a suit. See B-n v. B-n[2], in which Dr. Lushington in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in 1854, said:\u2014\nIt is obvious, for these reasons, that time, though not in itself, under ordinary circumstances, a bar, yet, especially when the lapse has been very considerable, is not an unimportant matter in suits of this description, and more particularly as concerns the wife.\nIn other respects, too, as relates to the right of the husband to prosecute a suit of this description, time, with other facts, deserves great consideration. The law affords a remedy to those who are really aggrieved and sensible of the grievance, and then only vigilantibus non dormientibus. The remedy is given on account of the loss sustained and the evil felt, not to promote or assist other purposes having no relation to it. If the husband is silent for so long a period, unaccounted for, that the presumption would necessarily arise that he acquiesced in the consequences which such an unfortunate connection entailed upon him, he could hardly be entitled to say, \u201cGive me a remedy for a grievance I have not felt,\u201d and that to the detriment of another. Their Lordships are all of opinion that cases might occur where long acquiescence with knowledge, or the means of procuring knowledge, would operate as a bar to the prosecution of such a suit, and more especially if the circumstances shewed that the suit was brought, not on account of the evils resulting from such imperfection, but for other and different reasons.\nThe learned trial Judge with an apparently clear appreciation of these principles found that the appellant did not learn of the incurability of the condition complained of until January, 1934, and that a satisfactory, reasonable explanation had been given as to why he had not learned it sooner. He also found that during the time the marriage existed the petitioner had done nothing, knowing the true facts, which amounts in law to approbation of the marriage and which made it unfair and inequitable for him to take these proceedings, and that there was nothing in the evidence which would in the slightest degree justify the court in inferring insincerity on his part.\nDuring the more than eight years of their cohabitation it seems it was Mr. and Mrs. B.\u2019s custom to occupy the same bed and that, notwithstanding from the very beginning both parties recognized that there was some serious impediment to normal coition, imperfect acts of intercourse were more or less regularly indulged in by the husband with the wife. Both seem at the outset to have regarded the condition as temporary and one which would in time disappear. As it did not, they discussed the advisability of a surgical examination, but no physician or surgeon was even consulted until July, 1929, when Mr. B. says his wife consented to submit herself to examination by an elderly practitioner, Dr. Hurst. The excuse put forward by him for doing nothing up to this time was his wife\u2019s sensitiveness and aversion to such an examination. Dr. Hurst made a manual examination and reported an abnormal vagina. He advised that an exploratory examination would be necessary in order to determine whether the condition could be remedied. Mr. B. says the doctor informed him that the operation would cost $400 and he gave this and his financial straits and the uncertainty of his income as his reason for not having such an operation performed. Mrs. B. says that after Dr. Hurst\u2019s preliminary examination and a discussion between them immediately thereafter the matter was allowed to drop and that it was never mentioned again between them. In the summer of 1933, after their return to Winnipeg from a several months\u2019 temporary residence in Saskatoon, and while they were living together in an apartment suite, Mrs. B.\u2019s health became impaired and later she was found to be developing goitre. A consultation by Mr. and Mrs. B. on December 26th, with a Dr. Douglass, a lady practitioner, led to the calling in of a surgeon, Dr. Fahrni, who upon a manual examination found the same condition as Dr. Hurst had reported four and a half years before, and undertook on instructions from Mr. B. and Mrs. B.\u2019s father to do the goitre operation and at the same time while the patient was under the anaesthetic to make an exploratory vaginal examination to ascertain if the malformation was curable. Dr. Fahrni performed the operation on January 3rd, 1934, and found as to the vaginal condition that no operation could be performed for its correction.\nMrs. B. was discharged from the hospital on January 10th, and went to her parents\u2019 home where it had been arranged she should remain during her convalescence. On January 16th or 17th Mr. B., after having conferred with her father, had a two or three hours\u2019 interview with his wife, during which he informed her he had decided that they must separate. He stated that her attitude during the interview was friendly and that she made no objection to their separation, though she did suggest that it should be brought about by an action for divorce, to which he objected. He says she asked if they could not go to their suite the next day and spend the week-end to sort out and pack their personal belongings, which he agreed to do. This was not denied by Mrs. B. He did not, however, call to see her the next day, and when he went back on January 19th, in response to a telephone call from her, after she had been served with the nullity petition, he found her attitude had changed. She told him she thought he was cruel and refused to go to the suite with him. That was their last meeting.\nWhatever may be said as to the correctness of the statement in the Appeal Court\u2019s judgment that it was not necessary to the success of the present respondent\u2019s appeal to that court to dispute the findings of the learned trial Judge as to delay and insincerity, and that his negativing of an approbation of the marriage was a finding of law, it is perfectly clear from the reasons for the Appeal Court\u2019s judgment, as delivered by Mr. Justice Richards, that that court did reject the learned trial Judge\u2019s finding\nthat during the time the marriage existed the petitioner has done nothing, knowing the true facts, which amounts in law to approbation of the marriage and which makes it unfair and inequitable for him to take these proceedings.\nThat finding manifestly involves not only the whole question of delay and the petitioner\u2019s explanation therefor, but the whole question of knowledge, as well as the petitioner\u2019s sincerity in instituting the nullity proceedings, and it is quite evident from the whole judgment of the Appeal Court that it did in fact consider all these features. Otherwise it could not have founded its reversal of the judgment of the learned trial Judge upon the cases of G. v. M.[3] and B-n v. B-n[4], as it undoubtedly did.\nWitness the following passages from Mr. Justice Richard\u2019s opinion:\u2014\nNow what are the facts here as stated by the husband? He found immediately after the marriage that his wife was incapable of ordinary sexual intercourse. He thought for a while the difficulty would be overcome but soon came to the conclusion that an operation would be necessary. He has given his reasons for taking no action. One of them is that the inquiry as to an operation, or whatever might be required to cure his wife, was postponed because he expected to have a child as soon as his wife\u2019s condition has been overcome and he would be in a position to assume the responsibility.\nIt seems to me that the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from that statement, the long delay, the continued imperfect acts of coition and the happiness with which the parties lived together is that for the time being he preferred things as they were and deliberately resolved not to have an operation for some time.\nThe petitioner is a lawyer and knew his legal rights. It is true that he had not been informed that the trouble was incurable but he must have known that it might be. In effect he acted as though he had decided: \u201cI love my wife; I am happy; I will take the chance of a cure being possible or impossible; I will approbate the marriage in any event.\u201d\nThe parties discussed a number of times during the last few years the advisability of adopting a child. That indicates that they realized that the wife might be incapable of bearing one.\nThe age of the wife at the time of her marriage was 28 years according to the evidence. Her counsel, on the argument said 25 years. It makes no difference. Eight and one-half of the best years of her life have gone. If the husband had acted promptly, those years could have been spent by the wife in preparing herself for a business life to earn a competency for her old age, or some man might have come along who would have married her for her companionship.\nThe wife was a good housekeeper and the husband took the benefit of that during their married life.\nMy greatest difficulty has been to determine whether the Appeal Court was justified in rejecting or ignoring the findings of the trial tribunal on such questions as the petitioner\u2019s knowledge of the incurability of his wife\u2019s condition and the reasonableness and bona fides of his excuse for not sooner discovering the permanent character of that condition. Personally, I am disposed to shrink from the responsibility of setting aside the findings of any trial tribunal on questions which depend entirely on the credibility and sincerity of witnesses that tribunal has had the advantage of seeing in the witness box, and especially where the issues the court is trying are themselves directly pointed to the motives and good faith of a plaintiff or petitioner in instituting such a suit as this.\nThe relevant facts of this case, in so far as they concern the relations and conduct of the parties, are not in any manner disputed. The cruical question concerns the belief and motive of the petitioner\u2019s mind and heart, as to which his own statement, with whatever apparent sincerity it may be made, ought not for that reason alone to be deemed to be conclusive. Its real truth can only be satisfactorily tested by a judge or jury by a careful consideration of its consistency or inconsistency with the undisputed or established facts. As to this, where the relevant facts are all admitted or undisputed, a judge sitting on appeal, with the whole record before him, is quite as competent to make a finding as the trial tribunal, and if the admitted or proved facts are such as to force upon one\u2019s mind a firm conviction that they do not accord with the declared attitude of the party concerned, one should not hesitate to say so.\nAfter as careful consideration, I think, as I have ever bestowed upon any case, I have not been able to resist the conviction that, if the appellant did not definitely know until Dr. Fahrni\u2019s exploratory examination in January, 1934, that his wife\u2019s condition was one which could not be rectified by surgical skill, he should have known years before and would have known had he acted as any ordinarily reasonable and prudent man would have acted in the unfortunate circumstances in which he found himself, and that the explanation which he advanced on the trial for his inaction during a period of more than eight years is one which the learned trial Judge should not have accepted as valid and sufficient in the circumstances disclosed. In B-n v. B-n (1) the full Board of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, though accepting the plaintiff\u2019s statement that he did not become aware of the incurability of a malformation of the same character until seventeen years after his marriage, did not hesitate to find that he should have known long before, and that the explanation put forward for not knowing before was not a valid or satisfactory excuse.\nFor this reason I am of opinion that the findings of the learned trial Judge were not reasonably warranted by the evidence, and that this appeal must now be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Clark, Jackson, Arundel & Robertson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Philip C.

In order to bring an action in damages, being a minor, she had to be represented according to article 78 C.C.P. Accordingly she filed a petition in the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the state of New York asking for the appointment of her father, the appellant, as \u201cher general guardian to commence and carry on such action for her.\u201d Pursuant to an order from that court granting the petition, letters of guardianship were issued appointing the appellant \u201climited guardian of the person and estate of the said minor on (his) making, executing and filing with the said Surrogate such bond or application as is required by the statute in such cases made and provided\u201d; the same court in its previous order having stipulated that \u201cuntil the filing of a bond * * * the guardian (was) restrained from receiving any funds arising from said action.\u201d The appellant then brought the present action in damages on his own behalf and as guardian to his minor daughter and, with the return of the writ, he filed duly certified copies of the decree and of the other judicial proceedings in the New York court. The respondent made a motion in the nature of an exception to the form disputing the appellant\u2019s capacity and quality to bring his action on behalf of his minor daughter on the ground that he had been appointed limited guardian on \u201cfiling with the Surrogate\u2019s Court a bond or obligation as is required by statute\u201d which provision had not been complied with by him. The exception to the form was dismissed by the Superior Court; but the appellate court reversed that decision and dismissed the appellant\u2019s action as to the damages claimed on behalf of his minor daughter.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 56 K.B. 520), that, by virtue of his appointment as guardian by the court of the state of New York, the appellant had the quality and the capacity to bring in the province of Quebec an action in damages on behalf of his minor daughter. According to the provisions of article 79 C.C.P. and also in uniformity with the terms of article 6 C.C., all foreign persons may come before the Quebec courts, providing they are authorized to appear in judicial proceedings under the law of their country: the test of their capacity or quality before the Quebec courts being their quality or capacity in the courts of their own country. Although there is in the record no evidence of the New York law by expert witnesses, the decree and the other judicial proceedings in the New York court, duly filed, make prima facie proof of the facts therein set forth and they afford the best evidence that the law therein applied is the law in force in the country in which the judgment had been rendered. Therefore, by force of that decree and of the foreign law of which it bears evidence, the appellant was a person duly authorized to appear in judicial proceedings within the meaning of article 79 C.C.P., and it follows that he had the quality and capacity assumed by him in this action. As to the restriction placed upon the appellant\u2019s authority to receive the funds arising from the action until he had fyled a bond required by the order appointing him as guardian, it should be held that the letters of guardianship cannot be construed as limiting the authority of the guardian to proceed with the action and that such restriction has to do with nothing else but the final discharge if and when payment would be made; and the Quebec court seized with the case, by force of its inherent power and propria motu, would have the power to stay proceedings at any stage, or at all events, before making its final adjudication, so that the condition imposed in the restriction may be previously complied with: in that way, the court would keep control of the case and would give judgment only after it would be satisfied that the required bond has been approved. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Curran J.[2], and maintaining the respondent\u2019s motion in the nature of an exception to the form.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nWm. F. Macklaier for the appellant.\nWalter A. Merrill K.C. and Gordon D. McKay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This appeal raises a question of private international law.\nRuth Schatz, domiciled at Poughkeepsie, in the state of New York, United States of America, was injured in an automobile accident which happened in the city of Montreal, province of Quebec. She suffered serious personal injuries. She intended to sue the person whom she held liable for the damages she sustained; but, being a minor and not having the free exercise of her rights, she could not, in the province of Quebec, be a party to an action. In order to bring her action, she had to be \u201crepresented (or) assisted * * * in the manner prescribed by the laws which regulate (her) particular status or capacity\u201d (Art. 78 C.C.P.).\nUnder the Quebec law (Art. 6 C.C.), persons domiciled out of the province of Quebec \u201cas to their status and capacity, remain subject to the laws of their country.\u201d\nAccordingly, Ruth Schatz filed a petition in the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the State of New York, representing that she desired \u201cto commence an action in the city of Montreal, province of Quebec, Dominion of Canada, against John G. McEntyre, an infant, and his guardian, John McEntyre, who are residents of the city of Montreal, province of Quebec, Dominion of Canada.\u201d (N.B. The latter are the present respondents.)\nThe petition alleged:\nThat the action arises out of personal injuries sustained by (the) petitioner through the careless and negligent operation of an automobile operated and controlled by the said John G. McEntyre in the city of Montreal, province of Quebec, Dominion of Canada * * * that the estimated value of the personal property to which the petitioner is or will be entitled on a favourable decision of this action will not exceed $5,000; that she had no additional income from any other source;\ntherefore she prayed that Grover H. Schatz, her father (the present appellant),\nbe appointed her general guardian to commence and carry on such action for her.\nThe petition was supported by affidavit.\nUpon the petition, the Surrogate\u2019s Court\nOrdered and decreed that said Grover H. Schatz be and is hereby appointed general guardian of the person and property of said infant, to serve until said infant shall attain the age of twenty-one years, or a successor to said general guardian shall be appointed, and that letters of guardianship issue, on filing the oath required by law.\nAnd it was also\nOrdered and decreed that the guardian proceed with such action as may be advisable to protect the infant\u2019s rights in the action stated in her petition;\nAnd it was further\nOrdered and decreed that the filing of a bond be dispensed with until further order of this court but that until the filing of a bond satisfactory to this court the said guardian is hereby restrained from receiving any funds arising from said action.\nPursuant to this, letters of guardianship were issued. They were signed by the \u201cClerk of the Surrogate\u2019s Court.\u201d They recite:\nThat said minor is entitled to certain property and estate and that, to protect and preserve the legal rights of said minor, it was necessary that some proper person should be duly appointed guardian of her person and estate * * *\n* * * The said Surrogate\u2019s Court did order that the said Grover H. Shatz be appointed limited guardian of the person and estate of the said minor on (his) making, executing and filing with the said surrogate such bond or application as is required by the statute in such cases made and provided; and you, the said Grover H. Schatz, having executed the proper oath of office approved by the said Surrogate, according to the form of the said statute, we do by these presents constitute and appoint you, the said Grover H. Schatz, limited guardian of the person and estate of the said minor until she shall attain the age of twenty-one years, or until another guardian shall be appointed.\nThe appellant, having been appointed guardian in the manner just stated, brought the action with which we are at present concerned, both for himself personally and in his quality of guardian on behalf of his daughter Ruth Schatz. With the return of the writ, he filed duly certified copies of the decree and of the other judicial proceedings in the New York court (including a copy of the oath of office executed by him). The action was at once met by the respondent\u2019s motion in the nature of an exception to the form disputing the appellant\u2019s capacity and quality to bring the action on behalf of his minor daughter.\nThe ground of the motion was that the appellant\nhad not such full and complete capacity, authority or power as is required by a person making claim before the courts of the province of Quebec.\nthat his power was in fact limited, and, as appeared by the letters of guardianship, he was appointed limited guardian on, among other things,\nfiling with the Surrogate\u2019s Court a bond or application, as is required by statute,\nwhich provision had not been complied with by him.\nThe exception to the form was dismissed by the Superior Court: but the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), by a majority, reversed that decision and dismissed the appellant\u2019s action\njusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de $5,000 qui y est demand\u00e9e pour et au nom de la mineure, Ruth Schatz.\nThe guardian then appealed to this Court. Since this appeal has been lodged, both Ruth Schatz and John G. McEntyre became of age and now have and enjoy the free exercise of their rights. Suggestions were filed with the prayer that each of them be added as a party to the appeal. This may be done under the rules of the Court (rule 50); and, indeed, has become essential, since the guardian, acting on behalf of Ruth Schatz, and the tutor representing John G. McEntyre are functi officio.\nThe fact, however, that Ruth Schatz has now attained the age of majority cannot be allowed to improve the proceedings originally entered in the province of Quebec by her guardian, if these proceedings were invalid. Her present application to be substituted for her guardian cannot affect the situation as it existed when the action was instituted. If the appellant was then lacking in the quality or the capacity required to bring the action, the appeal must be dismissed and the adding of Ruth Schatz as a party becomes immaterial. If, on the contrary, we come to the conclusion that the original proceedings were properly and competently brought by the appellant, the granting of the applications to add as parties both Ruth Schatz and John G. McEntyre should follow as a matter of course.\nIt is, therefore, necessary to discuss the case as it stood before the courts of the province of Quebec. The question is whether the appellant, by virtue of his appointment in the state of New York, had the quality and the capacity to bring the action in the province of Quebec.\nUnder Article 79 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\nAll foreign corporations or persons, duly authorized under any foreign law to appear in judicial proceedings, may do so before any court in the province.\nIt follows from the provisions of this article that all foreign persons may come before the Quebec courts, provided they are authorized to appear in judicial proceedings under the law of the country. The test of their capacity or quality before the Quebec courts must be their quality or capacity to appear in the courts of their own country. This is further borne out by article 6 of the Civil Code already adverted to.\nIn order to answer the question now before us, the inquiry, therefore, must be: What is the law of the State of New York in respect to the authority of the appellant to appear in these judicial proceedings?\nThere is in the record no evidence of the New York law, in the sense that no witnesses were heard who, on account of their profession or their expert knowledge, are recognized as being in a position to state what that law is; but the appellant alleged that,\nin his quality of guardian to the said minor Ruth Schatz, he was well and truly entitled by the laws of the state of New York to institute and carry on the present action,\nin support of which he filed copies of the decree and the other judicial proceedings had in the New York court. These documents make prima facie proof of the facts therein set forth (Art. 1220-1 C.C.), and they afford the best evidence that the law therein applied is the law in force in the country in which the judgment was rendered (Bauron v. Davies[3], and authorities there cited at pp. 551, 552 and 553).\nAs was said in the House of Lords by Lord Cranworth, in the case of Doglioni v. Crispin[4].\nIt is the decision of a court of exclusive jurisdiction, a decision which we are bound to receive without inquiry as to its conformity or nonconformity with the laws of the country where it was pronounced. So that the matter resolves itself into the interpretation of the decree appointing the appellant and of the accompanying documents. The guardian\u2019s powers are there set out.\nNow, if we turn to these documents, we find that the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court was sought for the very purpose of appointing a guardian to Ruth Schatz, because she desired to institute the present action in the province of Quebec against John G. McEntyre and his tutor. The petition states that she had no income from any other source and that the estimated value of her personal property was the value of the damages resulting from the automobile accident and to which she claimed to be entitled on a favourable decision of her action. Then the decree appoints her father, the present appellant,\ngeneral guardian of the person and property of the said infant, orders that letters of guardianship do issue on filing the oath required by law\nand\nthat the guardian proceed with such action as may be advisable to protect the infant\u2019s rights in the action stated in her petition.\nAnd the decree goes on to say that\nthe filing of a bond be dispensed with until further order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court and that until the filing of a bond satisfactory to that court the said guardian is hereby restrained from receiving any funds arising from said action.\nThe letters of guardianship state that the appellant has executed the oath of office (copy of which, as a matter of fact, is filed with the return of the action) and they declare the appellant limited guardian of the person and estate of the said minor.\nNo explanation is given for the use of the word \u201climited\u201d in the letters of guardianship signed by the clerk of the Surrogate\u2019s Court. The reasonable interpretation would be that the word is referable to the restriction put upon the guardian\u2019s right to receive the funds arising from the action until he has filed a bond satisfactory to the New York court. Be that as it may, the letters of guardianship cannot be construed as limiting the authority of the guardian to proceed with the action, in the province of Quebec, in order to protect the infant\u2019s rights, which is expressly given in the decree and which, indeed, was the sole apparent purpose for which the petition was presented and the decree issued. There can be no doubt that, by force of the decree and of the foreign law of which it bears evidence, the appellant is a person duly authorized to appear in judicial proceedings within the meaning of art. 79 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It follows that he has the quality and capacity assumed by him in this action. He has the quality of guardian to which was expressly attached the power to commence and carry on the action for Ruth Schatz.\nThe argument made against him is that, on account of the restriction placed upon his authority to receive the funds arising from the action, he is not fully clothed with all the powers requisite to bring the action. In a general way, it is said that he who cannot receive payment of a sum of money cannot bring action to recover that sum.\nWith great respect, it seems to us that the argument so presented forgets the quality in which alone the appellant appeared in these proceedings. The action is concerned not with the appellant\u2019s rights, but with the minor\u2019s rights. The appellant is not claiming for himself; he is claiming on behalf of the minor. The minor\u2019s rights are full and complete; they constitute (to borrow the language of the Court of King\u2019s Bench) \u201cun droit n\u00e9 et actuel.\u201d The action whereby he claims those rights belongs to the minor; and the only reason why the guardian appears is because\nActions belonging to a minor are brought in the name of his tutor. (Art. 304 C.C.).\nThis provision is implemented by that of the Code of Civil Procedure (art. 78) whereby\nNo person can be a party to an action. . . unless he has the free exercise of his rights * * *\nThose who have not the free exercise of their rights must be represented, assisted or authorized in the manner prescribed by the laws which regulate their particular status or capacity.\nIn this case the appellant merely represents the minor, and he does so\nin the manner prescribed by the laws which regulate the particular status or capacity\nof the minor and his own. We are unable to come to the conclusion that, for this purpose, he was not adequately and sufficiently authorized by the New York decree. The restriction therein has to do with nothing else but the final discharge if and when payment is made.\nThe respondent complains that he was not faced with a claimant to whom a payment could be made and from whom a discharge could be obtained. The first observation ought to be in this respect that the point does not arise; for the respondent does not disclose any intention of making payment, nor can we discern any indication of his willingness to offer any proposition of settlement.\nShould the respondent wish to pay the claim in full, we should be sorry if no means could be found under the laws of Quebec whereby a good and valid discharge could be given to him. Should he be willing to compromise, he would have no more difficulty to do so as a consequence of the New York decree than he would have in the case of a tutor appointed under the Quebec law. In the first case, he need only require, before paying, a certified copy of the order of the Surrogate\u2019s Court approving the bond, upon the filing of which the restriction put upon the respondent\u2019s power to receive the money shall be removed. In the second case, he could not transact with the tutor unless the latter was authorized by the court, a judge or a prothonotary on the advice of the family council (art. 307 C.C.). The restrictions in both cases are of a similar character. They cannot affect the quality of the New York guardian more than they do the quality of a Quebec tutor.\nIt is true, as was argued by the respondent, that, before the bond is filed and approved, the restriction in the decree may suspend the power of the appellant to prosecute the execution of a judgment given in his favour. A somewhat similar objection was advanced in the case of London Life Insurance Company v. S\u00e9guin[5], and it was rejected by the Court of King\u2019s Bench as not being a bar to the capacity to bring the action and as raising a point which could be taken care of after judgment, should the defendant be called upon to pay.\nWhile we think a preferable way would be for the court not to make any adjudication of the money until the appellant has complied with the condition; without going as far as the decision in the S\u00e9guin case5 and without waiting until after final judgment is rendered, it does not seem to us that the Quebec courts are lacking in power to deal with the matter. The restriction against the appellant\u2019s authority to receive payment is not absolute. The authority is not taken away. It is, in fact, given to him conditionally, and the condition is that he should file the prescribed bond. It was suggested that the respondent might have met the situation completely by taking advantage of paragraph 2 of art. 179 of the Code of Civil Procedure and by asking that the suit be stayed until the bond had been filed and approved, as provided for in the decree, the whole of which could have been certified to the Quebec court in the usual way. To this suggestion the respondent was unable to give any satisfactory answer.\nUnder all circumstances, we see no reason to doubt that the Quebec court seized with the case, by force of its inherent power and proprio motu, could stay proceedings at any stage or, at all events, before making its final adjudication, so that the condition imposed in the restriction may be previously complied with. In that way, the court would keep control of the case and would give judgment only after it is satisfied that the required bond has been approved. Authority for this course could be found in the judgments of Grondin v. Cliche[6] and Ellard v. Millar[7].\nThe appellant, no doubt, in the conclusions of his declaration, prayed for the payment to himself in his capacity of guardian, although at that time he was still affected by the restriction. This was pointed out by the respondent.\nIn our view, the objection does not go to the question raised by the exception to the form. In the words of Japiot (Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9dure, p. 61),\nL\u2019on, fait souvent intervenir \u00e0 tort la notion de qualit\u00e9 en contestant \u00e0 une personne la qualit\u00e9, alors qu\u2019il vaudrait mieux contester l\u2019existence du droit.\nThe appellant may have asked for more than he was entitled to until he had filed the bond required by the New York decree. But this does not affect his quality or his capacity to appear for and on behalf of the minor and to represent her. If he had limited his conclusions to a prayer that the defendant be condemned to indemnify Ruth Schatz in the amount of $5,000 and that payment of that sum, or of such other sum as may be awarded, be made to him as guardian of Ruth Schatz after he has filed in the case a bond satisfactory to the New York Surrogate\u2019s Court, there could have been no question as to his quality or capacity to do so. The complaint of the respondent really is that the appellant\u2019s conclusions go too far, at least for the present. It may be conceded that they ought not to be granted precisely in the form in which they are, unless the bond has been previously filed. But, if the facts are found in favour of the minor, it will be within the power of the court, indeed it would no doubt be its duty to see that the respondent should not be compelled to pay except upon being adequately protected in respect to the discharge to which he is entitled. (Compare: Montreal Street Ry. v. Girard[8]; People\u2019s Holding Company Ltd. v. Attorney-General[9]. In the later case, objection was made and doubts were expressed both by the Court of King\u2019s Bench and by this Court whether the prayer of the information was not in excess of the powers of the Attorney-General of Quebec. Yet, as it appeared that, upon his allegations if proven, he was entitled to some measure of relief, it was held the objection did not affect his quality or capacity, and it would be for the courts, on the merits, upon the conclusions as drawn or upon proper amendments, to order the appropriate remedy.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench in favour of the appellant.\nThe application to have Ruth Schatz and John G. McEntyre added as parties will be granted with costs in the cause. Our decision was reached, as it should be, independently of that consideration; but it is satisfactory to realize that as Ruth Schatz now enjoys the full exercise of her rights, the possibility of the difficulty anticipated by the respondent and discussed in this judgment has disappeared and no question subsists as to her capacity to give a valid discharge in the future.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacDougall, MacFarlane & Barclay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Merrill, Stalker & McKay.\n[1] (1034) Q.R. 56 K.B. 520.\n[2] (1034) Q.R. 56 K.B. 520.\n[3] (1897) Q.R. 6 Q.B. 547.\n[4] (1866) 35 L.J., Pro. and Mat. 129, at 135.\n[5] (1933) Q.R. 55 K.B. 332.\n5 (1933) Q.R. 55 K.B. 332.\n[6] [1922] S.C.R. 390.\n[7] [1930] S.C.R. 319.\n[8] (1911) Q.R. 21 K.B. 121, at 127.\n[9] (1930) Q.R. 48 K.B. 133; [1931] S.C.R. 452, at 459.\n"}

The ground of appeal was that no other person than the bankrupt could be indicted for any offence under that section.\nHeld, affirming that conviction, that the offences created by section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act were offences within section 69 of the Criminal Code; or, to put it alternatively, by force of section 69, or, by force of the enactments of section 28 of the Interpretation Act, section 69 is to be read as if the offences created by section 191 were specifically named therein.\u2014In other words, section 191 must be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal Code should apply to offences created by that section, as there is nothing in the provisions of that section necessarily or reasonably implying the exclusion of section 69 of the Criminal Code. Crocket J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the appellants, on their trial before Cusson J., president of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, on charges of having concealed and removed property of a bankrupt, under s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. The ground of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on the point dealt with by the Court are stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed; and the conviction was affirmed.\nPhillippe Mouette K.C. for the appellant.\nErnest Bertrand K.C. for the respondent.\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal raises a question as to the sufficiency of an indictment in these terms:\nIrving Simcovitch et Harry Simcovitch, en la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, en rapport avec la compagnie \u201cParis Shoe Shoppe\u201d, magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, et dont le dit Irving Simcovitch \u00e9tait le g\u00e9rant et l\u2019autre dit accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 et complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en faillite, le ou vers le 7 d\u00e9cembre, mil-neuf-cent-trente-deux, ont commis les actes criminels de faillite suivants:\n(d) Dans les six mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la dite faillite ou apr\u00e8s ils ont cach\u00e9 une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour une valeur au del\u00e0 $50 et ils ont cach\u00e9 des compt\u00e9s recevables de la dite faillite;\n(e) Durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de temps, ils ont frauduleusement enlev\u00e9 une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour une valeur d\u2019au del\u00e0 $50, \u00e0 savoir; pour une valeur de $5,000.\nS.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.\nThe sole point in controversy before this court is a point raised by the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice St. Jacques, which is stated in the formal judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in these words,\n* * * because, according to section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that article.\nThe argument presented is substantially as follows: Section 191 declares that any person who has been adjudged a bankrupt, or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made an authorized assignment under this Act, shall in each of the cases following be guilty of an indictable offence.\nNeither of the appellants falls within the description of the classes of persons to whom, in the circumstances mentioned in the subsections, the indictable offences created by the section are imputed by the statute. It follows, it is said, that the appellants cannot be convicted of such an offence.\nThe validity of this contention turns upon the proper answer to the question whether the offences created by section 191 are offences within section 69 of the Criminal Code; or, to put it alternatively, whether, by force of section 69, or, by force of the enactments of the Interpretation Act, section 69 is to be read as if the offences created by section 191 were specifically named therein.\nThe Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, s. 28) enacts that,\nEvery Act shall be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be\n(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an indictable offence\n* * *\nand all provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.\nThe language of this enactment is quite plain and unqualified.\nI have no doubt that it applies to offences created by section 191. First of all, there is nothing in section 28 which is (in the words of section 2) \u201cinconsistent with the object or scope of\u201d the Bankruptcy Act; or, which (in the words of that section) \u201ccould give any word, expression or clause,\u201d in section 191, \u201can interpretation inconsistent with its context.\u201d The circumstance that the acts enumerated in section 191 are limited to acts committed by the classes of persons described in that section is in no way inconsistent with the proposition that the offences defined by the section are indictable offences, as section 28 declares, or that to them, as indictable offences, the provisions of the Criminal Code apply. With great respect, I cannot give my adherence to the view that in sections 191 to 201 of the Bankruptcy Act there is sufficient evidence that these sections were intended to constitute a code, having an operation which excludes the Criminal Code. True it is, section 28 lays down a rule of interpretation, and necessarily, therefore, the provisions of the Criminal Code must give way to the enactments of the statute to be interpreted, to the extent to which, by express words, or by necessary or reasonable implication, such statute evinces an intention to exclude those provisions. But, subject to this qualification, section 191 must be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal Code apply to the offences created by it, and, in particular, that the provisions of section 69 are to be construed as if such offences were specifically nominated in that section.\nNow, the effect of section 69 in this view, is simply this: persons aiding or abetting the bankrupt or other person, whose acts are embraced within the enactment, are guilty of the offences created by the enactment. I see nothing here inconsistent with section 191 read by itself alone. The bankrupt himself is not affected by this reading of the provisions of section 69; as regards him, section 191 takes full and complete effect according to its terms. On this construction of section 69, we have a substantive enactment, co-ordinate with section 191, by which, persons aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, are put upon the same plane as the bankrupt, and become indictable and punishable for the offence in relation to which they have so acted.\nThere is, therefore, nothing in the provisions of section 191 necessarily or reasonably implying the exclusion of section 69.\nSection 201 cannot, I think, be properly read as evidencing an intention on the part of the legislature to exclude the operation of section 69. It is limited to the case of offences committed by incorporated companies, and it may well be that the framers of the Act desired to provide against difficulties that might conceivably arise where the bankrupt is a corporation. See King v. Daily Mirror[1].\nOn the other hand, I am unable to agree with the argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, that section 198 affords an answer to the contention of the appellants. Section 198 assumes that persons other than the bankrupt may be guilty of an offence under the Act (for example, a creditor or person claiming to be a creditor who has committed an offence under section 194). Section 198 does not indicate that any person other than the classes of persons enumerated in section 191 can be guilty of an offence created by that section.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nCannon J.\u2014The appellants were convicted under the following indictment:\nIrving Simcovitch et Harry Simcovitch, en la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, en rapport avec la compagnie \u201cParis Shoe Shoppe\u201d, magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, et dont le dit Irving Simcovitch \u00e9tait le g\u00e9rant et l\u2019autre dit accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 et complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en faillite, le ou vers le 7 faillite suivants:\n(d) Dans les six mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la dite faillite ou apr\u00e8s ils ont cach\u00e9 une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour une valeur au del\u00e0 $50 et ils ont cach\u00e9 des comptes recevables de la dite faillite;\n(e) Durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de temps, ils ont frauduleusement enlev\u00e9 une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour une valeur d\u2019au del\u00e0 $50, \u00e0 savoir: pour une valeur de $5,000.\nS.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.\nThe appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench on the facts and on points of law was dismissed, Mr. Justice St-Jacques dissenting on a point of law which is now submitted to our consideration.\nAccording to the formal judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the learned justice would have quashed the conviction\nbecause, according to 191 of Bankruptcy Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that article; and because the trustee, by himself or by a representative, cannot lodge a complaint against another than the bankrupt, for a bankruptcy offence, unless he follows the enactment of 195 and 198 of the Act; and this procedure was not followed.\nAs the second reason of the dissenting judge was not mentioned amongst the grounds of appeal, the appellants very properly state in their factum that they cannot now support it before this court. We, therefore, have to decide only whether or not none but the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe learned dissenting judge says in his reasons for judgment:\nLa question se pose comme suit:\nLes offenses, ou les s\u00e9ries d\u2019offenses, que l\u2019article 191 de la Loi de faillite \u00e9dicte, peuvent-elles \u00eatre mises \u00e0 la charge d\u2019autres personnes que du failli lui-m\u00eame? Et subsidiairement, peut-on recourir \u00e0 l\u2019article 69 de la Loi criminelle pour compl\u00e9ter l\u2019article 191 de la Loi de faillite, et par application de cet article 69 du Code criminel, mettre en accusation d\u2019autres personnes que le failli lui-m\u00eame pour la commission de quel- qu\u2019une ou de quelques-unes des offenses \u00e9dict\u00e9es par l\u2019article 191 de la Loi de faillite?\nIl me para\u00eet certain que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral dans l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs que lui donne la constitution de notre pays, a voulu, en l\u00e9gif\u00e9rant au sujet des faillites, cr\u00e9er un m\u00e9canisme complet, tant au point de vue de la proc\u00e9dure civile que de la proc\u00e9dure criminelle.\nIl a d\u00e9fini, entre autres, dans les articles 191, 195, 198 et 201, quels sont les actes qui, sans \u00eatre criminels en eux-m\u00eames, le deviennent eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la faillite et s\u2019ils sont commis dans les d\u00e9lais et les conditions pos\u00e9s par la Loi de faillite. Par exemple, si un commer\u00e7ant enl\u00e8ve de son \u00e9tablissement de commerce une certaine quantit\u00e9 de marchandises pour la porter ailleurs, cet acte n\u2019est pas en soi un crime; mais cet enl\u00e8vement devient une offense criminelle punissable, si l\u2019enl\u00e8vement est fait dans les six mois qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent la faillite ou apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une requ\u00eate de faillite avec l\u2019intention de causer du pr\u00e9judice aux cr\u00e9anciers, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire avec une intention frauduleuse.\nCette offense cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le statut des faillites est punissable par une amende n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas $1,000, ou un terme d\u2019emprisonnement n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas deux ann\u00e9es, ou, en m\u00eame temps, l\u2019amende et l\u2019emprisonnement.\n(L\u2019article dit que \u201ctoute personne (any person) qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en faillite\u201d etc, sera, dans chacun des cas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article, coupable d\u2019une offense \u201cindictable\u201d etc.\nOn sait que l\u2019expression \u201cpersonne\u201d employ\u00e9e dans cette loi de faillite s\u2019applique aussi bien aux corporations qu\u2019aux individus.\nEt pourtant, afin de donner une sanction efficace \u00e0 la loi de faillite, le l\u00e9gislateur a dispos\u00e9 dans l\u2019article 201 que lorsqu\u2019une offense, pr\u00e9vue par la loi de faillite, a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par une compagnie incorpor\u00e9e, chaque officier, directeur ou agent de la compagnie qui a particip\u00e9 dans la commission de l\u2019offense, sera passible de la m\u00eame p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 que la compagnie elle-m\u00eame et tout comme s\u2019il avait commis cette offense personnellement.\nA premi\u00e8re vue, il semblerait \u00e9trange que les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 191 eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s insuffisants par le l\u00e9gislateur pour permettre d\u2019atteindre toute personne, autre que le failli, qui aurait commis une offense de faillite.\nJe crois que l\u2019article 191 vise le failli lui-m\u00eame et nul autre.\nSi le failli a commis l\u2019une queconque des offenses \u00e9dict\u00e9es par cet article, il peut \u00eatre recherch\u00e9 en justice criminelle et condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la punition pr\u00e9vue par la loi.\nDans le cas actuel, C\u00e9cilia Simcovitch d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en faillite et ayant refus\u00e9 de signer le bilan pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par les syndics, il y a contre elle de fortes pr\u00e9somptions qu\u2019elle n\u2019ignorait pas les actes frauduleux commis par son g\u00e9rant, \u00e0 la veille m\u00eame de la faillite. Elle aurait pu, je crois, \u00eatre atteinte par les dispositions de l\u2019article 191.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a pas voulu, toutefois, que les personnes qui ont pu participer, soit directement, soit indirectement, \u00e0 la fraude ou aux actes frauduleux que la loi de faillite punit, \u00e9chappent \u00e0 la justice.\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 195, la cour des faillites peut ordonner la poursuite de telle personne pour de telles offenses.\nThe Crown contends that section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act created an indictable offence for any person who has been adjudged bankrupt, or in respect of whom a receiving order has been made, in each of the cases therein enumerated. Once this offence has been committed, the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 1, s. 28) applies. It reads as follows:\nEvery Act (of the Parliament of Canada) shall be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be:\u2014\n(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred were described or referred to as an indictable offence; and\n(b) punishable on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and,\nall provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.\nTherefore, says the Crown, the Bankurptcy Act not excluding this rule of interpretation, the provisions of the Criminal Code, including section 69, apply to this particular offence.\nThe Crown further contends that the appellants, having aided and abetted the bankrupt Cecilia Simcovitch in the commission of this indictable offence, were liable to arrest and conviction, as they have been in this case. Cecilia Simcovitch, the bankrupt, could have have been prosecuted together with her brothers and could even to-day be prosecuted for the said offence.\nFirst of all, it must be noticed that, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Walsh in the majority judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the legislators provided in section 198 of the Bankruptcy Act that\nwhere there is ground to believe that the bankrupt or any other person has been guilty of any offence under this Act, the Court may commit the bankrupt or such other person for trial.\nThis section is designed to enable the court to commit the bankrupt or any other person for trial without the necessity of a preliminary inquiry before a magistrate; but it does not exclude the ordinary procedure which has been adopted in the present case. The facts show clearly that the offence was committed with the aid of the appellants. Can they escape punishment on the technical ground that the goods that were concealed and carried away were not their goods, but those of their bankrupt sister?\nA somewhat similar question was raised in the case of The King v. Kehr (No. 3)[2], in which\nit was urged on behalf of defendant that the facts did not disclose an offence by the defendant, nor a lending by the company, of whose branch office he was in charge as manager; that the offence declared by the Money Lenders Act being purely statutory and its prohibition not being general as to all persons, but limited to the class specially named therein, i.e. \u201cmoney lenders,\u201d there could be no conviction for aiding and abetting, (with the possible exception of another money lender); that the class limitation of the statute excluded the operation of sec. 69 of the Criminal Code (1906), under ss. 2 and 28 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. (1906), c. 1.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario was delivered by Meredith J., who said in part:\nI am also unable to see why one who is not a money lender, within the meaning of the Act, may not be an aider and abettor of one who is, in an infraction of its provisions.\nIt does not follow, from the fact that the person who aids in the commission of a crime is, by the Criminal Code, declared to be a party to and guilty of the offence, that one who could not alone have committed it, cannot be convicted. One may be physically incapable of committing a crime and yet guilty of it, through the act of another who is capable and whose act is the act of both; and why not equally so where there is legal incapacity?\nThat which the accused did would have been none the more harmful, none the more against the object of the enactment, if the accused, as well as his employer, had been a money lender.\nUnder section 69 of the Criminal Code,\nEvery one is a party to and guilty of an offence who\n(a) actually commits it;\n(b) does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;\n(c) abets any person in commission of the offence; or\n(d) counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.\nThis has always been given this meaning: If a person assists another in the commission of an offence, he is responsible as though he had committed it himself. By aiding or abetting in the commission of an offence, he becomes a party to and guilty of an offence. He does become a party principal and there appears to be no reason why he should not be indicted or charged as principal under the Code.\nSee: R\u00e9millard v. The King[3] and Rex v. Daily Mirror[4].\nI, therefore, reach the conclusion that the rather technical point raised before us cannot prevail in face of the provisions which are intimately connected of the Bankruptcy Act, the Interpretation Act and the Criminal Code. The evident intention of Parliament was that these three statutes should complete and aid one another in order to bring to justice those who aided or abetted a bankrupt to commit offences to defraud his creditors.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. Crocket J. (dissenting): There is no doubt that the acts, with which the appellants were charged as offences against clauses (d) and (e) of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, are declared to be offences by that section only when committed by a person, who has been adjudged bankrupt or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made or who has made an authorized assignment under that Act. The learned counsel for the Crown conceded that the conviction could not be maintained against either appellant under that section alone, inasmuch as neither was a person answering the specific description stated in its opening words. Seeking for other provisions with which s. 191 might be read to extend its application to any person, whether the bankrupt or not, he argued in the first place that s. 198 of the Bankruptcy Act itself had this effect. This argument, however, is not admissible for the reason pointed out in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, viz: that the language relied upon in the latter section comprehends not only the offences described in s. 191 but other offences described in other sections of the Act as well, which might be committed by other persons than the bankrupt himself.\nThe real, substantial contention which has been advanced in support of the conviction is that s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act must be read together with s. 69 of the Criminal Code in virtue of the provisions of s. 28 of the general Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 1, and that s. 69 of the Criminal Code makes any one, who abets the bankrupt in the commission of the offence, or who does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding the bankrupt to commit the offence, liable to prosecution for committing the offence described in s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act as well as the bankrupt himself.\nSingularly enough, therefore, there is no difficulty in the interpretation of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act itself\u2014the enactment which creates and defines the alleged offence of which the appellants have been convicted. Its language is as unequivocal as any language could well be. The difficulty is encountered in the interpretation of s. 28 of the Interpretation Act, through which it is sought to read s. 69 of the Criminal Code into the Bankruptcy Act for the purpose of reaching the appellants, not as offenders who could themselves have committed the described offence, but as offenders, who might nevertheless be convicted of that offence as accessories.\nI regret that after much anxious reflection I find myself quite unable to adopt the view of the majority of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec and of my brethren in this Court, that s. 28 of the Interpretation Act brings into operation, as regards the particular offences created by s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, the provisions of s. 69 of the Criminal Code, so as to render a person liable to prosecution and punishment therefor, who could not himself be guilty of the offence as created and defined in the particular Act.\nAs I read s. 28 of the Interpretation Act, it does not purport to do any more than to enact that whenever any statute of the Parliament of Canada creates an offence, for which any person may be prosecuted by indictment or liable to punishment on summary conviction, all the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to such offence. This section itself prescribes a limitation to the words \u201cany offence\u201d in the same way as s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act prescribes a limitation to the words \u201cany person.\u201d It qualifies the words \u201cany offence\u201d by the immediate addition of the words \u201cfor which the offender may be prosecuted by indictment\u201d or is \u201cpunishable on summary conviction,\u201d as s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act qualifies the words \u201cany person\u201d by the words \u201cwho has been adjudged bankrupt,\u201d etc.\nIt is in my judgment only to an offence, which has been created or defined by the particular statute, to which the designated provisions of the Criminal Code are intended to be applied, not to an act, which itself has not been declared by the statute to be an offence at all, and that offence must be one, for which the offender within the contemplation of the particular statute may be prosecuted by indictment or is liable to punishment on summary conviction.\nOnce you have an offence created by the Bankruptcy Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, of which any person, whether adjudged a bankrupt or not, can be guilty and for which any person can be prosecuted by indictment or is liable to punishment on summary conviction, then I have no doubt that s. 28 of the Interpretation Act would operate to apply all the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or offences, to such an offence in the same manner and with the same effect as they would apply to all offences defined by the Criminal Code itself. These provisions of the Criminal Code would then apply to such an offence without in any manner altering the effect of the special enactment by which the offence is created.\nIf, however, s. 28 of the Interpretation Act is construed in the sense contended for by the Crown we are at once confronted by two contradictory enactments: one\u2014the special enactment, providing that only a person who answers a specific description, can commit the offence, which it has created; and the other, s. 69 of the Criminal Code, providing that anybody, whether he answers the specific description or not, can commit it. If no one but the bankrupt is indictable for any of the offences described in the special enactment, when that enactment is read by itself, as the Crown concedes, and anybody is indictable for any of them, whether he be the bankrupt or not, if the provisions of s. 28 of the Interpretation Act and s. 69 of the Criminal Code are read together with it, as the Crown contends they ought to be, it necessarily follows, not only that the intendment of the one enactment is radically different from that of the other, but that s. 69 of the Criminal Code is the governing enactment. Yet s. 2 of the Interpretation Act itself, the controlling section of that statute, clearly recognizes that it is the intention of the particular enactment which must always prevail in the event of there being any inconsistency or repugnance between the particular enactment and any provision of the Interpretation Act. S. 2 reads as follows:\nEvery provision of this Act shall extend and apply to every Act of the Parliament of Canada, now or hereafter passed, except in so far as any such provision,\u2014\n(a) is inconsistent with the intent or object of such Act; or\n(b) would give to any word, expression or clause of any such Act an interpretation inconsistent with the context; or\n(c) is in any such Act declared not applicable thereto.\nIn my opinion s. 28 of the Interpretation Act and s. 69 of the Criminal Code can be read into s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act only in so far as their provisions can consistently be read with those of s. 191. If its language is clear and free from all ambiguity in constituting any of the acts described in its various clauses as indictable offences only when they are committed by a person who answers the specific description stated in its opening and governing words, and there is no other provision in the Bankruptcy Act to the contrary, it seems to me that it must be taken that it was not intended to incorporate in the Act any provision of the Interpretation Act, or of the Criminal Code, which would give to that enactment any other effect than that which its own language so clearly connotes.\nWith all deference to those who have reached an opposite conclusion, I think the ground of Mr. Justice St. Jacques\u2019 dissent in the Court of King\u2019s Bench was well taken. I would adopt his judgment, allow the appeal to this Court and quash the conviction as one which discloses no offence against s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nHughes J.\u2014The appellants were tried and convicted in the Sessions of the Peace at Montreal on an indictment the material parts of which are as follows:\nIrving Simcovitch et Barry Simcovitch, en la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, en rapport avec la compagnie \u201cParis Shoe Shoppe\", magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, et dont le dit Irving Simcovitch \u00e9tait le g\u00e9rant et l\u2019autre dit accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 et complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en faillite, le ou vers le sept d\u00e9cembre, mil-neuf-cent-trente-deux, ont commis les actes criminels de faillite suivants:\n(d) Dans les six mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la dite faillite ou apr\u00e8s ils ont cach\u00e9 une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour une valeur au del\u00e0 $50 et ils ont cach\u00e9 des comptes rerevables de la dite faillite;\n(e) Durant le m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de temps, ils ont frauduleusement enlev\u00e9 une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour une valeur d\u2019au del\u00e0 $50, \u00e0 savoir: pour une valeur de $5,000.\nS.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.\nThe accused appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, and the appeal was dismissed with costs, Mr. Justice St. Jacques dissenting. The grounds of dissent of the learned judge are set forth in the formal judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, as follows:\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice St. Jacques dissenting, because, according to 191 of Bankruptcy Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that article; and because the trustee, by himself or by a representative, cannot lodge a complaint against another than the bankrupt, for a bankruptcy offence, unless he follows the enactments of 195 and 198 of the Act; and this procedure was not followed.\nThe appellants concede that the second reason for dissent of Mr. Justice St. Jacques was not mentioned in the notice of appeal as a ground of appeal and that it cannot now be urged before this Court. In his notes Mr. Justice St. Jacques said:\u2014\nJe crois que l\u2019article 191 vise le failli lui-m\u00eame et nul autre.\nThe Crown, however, submits that section 69 of the Criminal Code is made applicable by the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, s. 28, which reads as follows:\n28. Every Act shall be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be\n(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an indictable offence;\n(b) punishable on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and\nall provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.\nI am of opinion that section 69 of the Criminal Code is applicable.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nSt. Germain J. (ad hoc): I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1922] 2 K.B. 530.\n[2] (1910) 18 Can. Cr. Cas. 202.\n[3] (1912) 62 Can. S.C.R. 21.\n[4] [1922] 2 K.B. 530, at 542.\n"}

Co. and O. Co. for damages for injury to one of them (wife of the other) alleged to have been caused by escape of gas from P. Co.\u2019s premises (which were in the same building as plaintiffs\u2019 premises). O. Co. had, five years before the alleged injury, installed gas appliances in P. Co.\u2019s premises, and it supplied gas to P. Co. At the trial the jury found that plaintiff was injured by gas; that it escaped from gas appliances on P. Co.\u2019s premises; that P. Co. had not satisfied the jury that it was not guilty of negligence causing or contributing to the escape; that O. Co. did not take the precautions it ought to have taken in installing and maintaining the gas appliances; that its failure to take such precautions caused or contributed to the causes of the injury; that O. Co. was guilty of negligence in the installation or maintenance, causing in whole or in part the injury, \u201cin failing to install fume pipe on boiler when said boiler was installed\u201d; that there was a verbal agreement between P. Co. and O. Co. \u201cto install the aforementioned boiler and maintain same in good order\u201d; and that the companies failed to observe the terms of such agreement \u201cby not insisting on the installation of fume pipe on boiler at the time said boiler was installed\u201d; that O. Co.\u2019s failure to observe its agreement caused or contributed to the causes of the injury; and assessed damages. Judgment was given against both defendants. The Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the judgment and dismissed the action. Plaintiffs appealed.\nHeld: There should be a new trial. Cannon and Hughes JJ., dissenting, would restore the judgment at trial.\nDuff C.J. and Smith J., while not entirely satisfied to go as far as the Court of Appeal, held that on the record, including the evidence and the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, the trial and its result were so unsatisfactory that the verdict should not stand and there should be a new trial. As to the jury\u2019s finding that defendants were both negligent in not insisting upon setting up a fume pipe, they held that this finding meant that it was perfectly well understood on all sides that the installation was incomplete, in that the absence of a fume pipe might have the effect of allowing noxious gases to escape which might do harm; and that the negligence found occurred when the boiler was installed\u2014five years before the alleged injury; and Duff C.J. and Smith J. held that in such circumstances O. Co. would not be responsible (M\u2019Alister v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562, at 578; Gregson v. Henderson Roller Bearing Co., 20 Ont. L.R. 584; Farr v. Butters, [1932] 2 K.B. 606, at 617; Caledonian Ry. Co. v. Mulholland, [1898] A.C. 216; and Bottomley v. Bannister, [1932] 1 K.B. 458, at 472-3, referred to).\nRinfret J., while otherwise concurring with Duff C.J. and Smith J., expressed an inclination to hold that the action as against O. Co. should be dismissed\u2014that the effect of the verdict was that its negligence occurred at the time \u201cwhen said boiler was installed,\u201d five years before the alleged injury; and, applying to the verdict the principle laid down in Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. Collins, [1909] A.C. 640, and having regard to the jury\u2019s answers with respect to the full knowledge of P. Co. concerning the incomplete nature of the installation, the result was that O. Co. was not legally liable; but, in view of the opinions of the other members of the court, equally divided, he concurred in disposing of the case as proposed by Duff C.J. and Smith J.\nCannon and Hughes JJ., dissenting, were of opinion that there was reasonable support in the evidence for the jury\u2019s findings; and that, applying the law to the facts as found by the jury, the judgment at trial against both defendants should be restored. (With regard to the liability of O. Co., reference was made to M\u2019Alister v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562, at 611-612, 580-581, 595-597; Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. Collins, [1909] A.C. 640, at 646, 647.)\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which reversed the judgment of McEvoy J. (given upon the findings of the jury) in favour of the plaintiffs, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action (Magee J.A. dissenting as to the judgment at trial against the defendant The Pure Spring Co. Ltd., which he would affirm). The action was brought by the plaintiffs, husband and wife, for damages for injury to the plaintiff, Mrs. Dozois, alleged to have been caused by gases escaping from the premises of the defendant The Pure Spring Co. Ltd. (which premises were in the same building as was the plaintiffs\u2019 apartment), in which premises there were certain gas appliances which had been installed by the defendant The Ottawa Gas Co., which company supplied gas through a meter at the outer wall of the premises of The Pure Spring Co. Ltd. The plaintiffs alleged that the alleged escape of gases was caused by the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents.\nA.W. Beament and G.M. Bleakney for the appellants.\nE.J. Murphy K.C. and A.F. Moore for the respondent The Pure Spring Co. Ltd.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. and J.D. Watt for the respondent The Ottawa Gas Co.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Smith J. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014The Chief Justice of Appeals in Ontario (Latchford C.J.) and Mr. Justice Fisher, have unanimously held that, on the evidence as it stands, that is to say, upon the facts admitted or not disputed, or necessarily inferable, the plaintiffs\u2019 action ought to be dismissed against both defendants. I should have no hesitation whatever in coming to that conclusion had it not been for the verdict of the jury and, although I think the case is very near the line, I cannot express myself as entirely convinced that the findings can properly be set aside upon these grounds. Other questions, however, arise when the Court of Appeal finds the evidence in such a state that, as said in effect by Lord Halsbury in Jones v. Spencer[1], the court may find the trial so unsatisfactory on various grounds as to make it a duty of justice to set aside the findings although granting the party affected the right to bring the matter before another jury; or the court may specifically find that matters, or a matter, or the matter, which the jury had to consider were not brought so clearly and so fairly to the minds of the jury as to justify them in allowing the verdict to stand. The court may think, on the whole record as it stands, that there has been grievous error amounting to injustice, and, consequently, that the verdict ought not to stand.\nI am satisfied in this case that, regarding the case as a whole, the verdict ought not to be permitted to stand. The judgment of Mr. Justice Fisher develops the facts, though much might be added to what he has said, and I have no hesitation whatever in saying that, examining the evidence in the record, the result of this trial is to my mind entirely unsatisfactory; and so unsatisfactory and on such grounds that there should be a new trial. I am not, as I have said, entirely satisfied that we should go so far as the Appellate Division has gone but, at least, the respondent should have an opportunity to submit the issues to another jury.\nThere are one or two matters which would appear to require special attention. The questions submitted to the jury as affecting especially the liability of the Pure Spring Co. Ltd., respondents, were in these words:\n1. Was the plaintiff Mrs. Dozois injured by inhaling poisonous gases or fumes?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n2. If so, did the said gases or fumes escape from or emanate from gas appliances upon the premises occupied by the defendant Pure Springs Company?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n3. If the said gases or fumes escaped from the said appliances on the premises occupied by the defendant Pure Springs Company, has the defendant Pure Springs Company satisfied you that the Pure Springs Company, or its servants or agents, were not guilty of any negligence causing or contributing to the said escape?\u2014Ans. No.\nIt is too obvious for comment that, under questions one and two, the onus was on the appellants to establish that Mrs. Dozois was injured by inhaling poisonous gases or fumes and, further, that such gases and fumes escaped from or emanated from the gas appliances kept by the defendant Pure Spring Company. In addition to that, the onus was on them also to prove that the Pure Spring Co. was guilty of negligence causing or contributing to \u201csuch escape.\u201d\nNow, when one reads the charge of the trial judge as affecting the issues raised by these questions, one receives at once the impression that the respondents are burdened with an onus to rebut the charges which form the basis of these issues. The learned trial judge begins his charge by saying that the first thing that seems to him important is that the jury should get \u201cinto their minds\u201d how the case came about and then he says:\nFrom that point of view, the first thing is you must consider what is the nature of gas, and how does it diffuse itself, because that is at the very foundation of this action. You have had a number of gentlemen of experience who have given you an account how gas, not this gas, but how gas travels from place to place.\nThough not in explicit terms, yet by implication, it would rather appear that the learned trial judge was asking the jury to assume that the illness from which Mrs. Dozois suffered was derived from the escape of gas. This, of course, was one of the most critical points of dispute in the action and the learned trial judge ought to have been most careful to call the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the onus was on the appellants and that they must be satisfied by reasonable evidence that such was the case.\nThen, the learned trial judge goes on to point out that an attempt has been made by the Pure Spring Company to show that no gas fumes escaped at all and, therefore, he says:\n* * * it appears to me that it would be well for you to commence your consideration of the matter by trying to determine upon this evidence whether or not there was any gas, any poison gas, escaping from the Pure Spring premises into the hall and up to the place where this woman lived. In weighing that evidence and looking at it, you will not forget the importance to the defendants of making it appear to the court and jury that there never was any gas escaping from that place up to the place where this woman says she was poisoned.\nObserve that there is no caution that the very basis of the case is, not merely that gas was escaping in some quantity, but that gas did escape and that the gas which did escape caused the illness complained of. Then,\nYou will begin by considering that question; was there any gas escaping up to that stairway at all, or was it, as has been boldly said, something that has been framed up? The evidence of the defence began and persisted largely upon the theory that there never was any gas came to this place, and this woman never was gassed, and there was no gas there to gas her anyway, and she could not be gassed. They seek to prove that in two ways at least. One way is by calling a number of people who were about the place, and who say, \u201cWe were there such and such a time and there was no gas.\u201d Another way is by seeking to satisfy the jury that this woman was not suffering from gas poisoning at all * * *.\nThe trial judge seems, I think, to be conveying to the jury the impression that the ultimate onus is on the respondents. His language is not calculated to make the jury understand that the onus was plainly on the appellants to show, not merely that there was gas escaping but that the escaping gas did in fact injure the appellant. Then, later on, he puts the matter in a more explicit form. He says:\nYou will remember that the task of the defendants is to show that there was no gas escaping from their premises that was poisoning this woman.\nThat seems to be a very plain misdirection and it is very difficult indeed to think that the minds of the jury were not affected by it. Then he goes on to say that during the few days including the day on which Mrs. Dozois injury is alleged to have occurred the respondents were doing something with the gas appliances. That in itself might have been an innocuous observation, but, taken together with what immediately preceded it, viz., that the \u201ctask\u201d of the appellants was to negative the escape of gas, it strikes one as being very far from innocuous. Then he proceeds to discuss what occurred in the Pure Spring Company\u2019s plant on the Sunday on which the accident occurred. Three young men said they were playing cards there all day and that the plant as usual was closed down and there was no sign of escaping gas. The learned trial judge asked them to consider the likelihood of these three people playing cards, as he describes it, \u201con ginger beer,\u201d and he suggests to them that they must consider very carefully whether something did not happen on that occasion which would cause an escape of gas. All this must be considered in relation to what the learned trial judge had already said as to the onus on the respondents. It cannot, I think, be regarded as harmless. Then, there is a suggestion, which appears to be based upon nothing, that this whole story of card playing is a pure myth because the other side have said Mrs. Dozois was not sick from gas poisoning but sick from something else, and that, therefore, her claim had no foundation. The learned trial judge thought it proper to suggest that the jury might consider, in the absence of any foundation in the evidence for such a suggestion, that these young men were engaged in a conspiracy to defeat by false evidence the appellants\u2019 case.\nThen, I find the learned trial judge, dealing with the evidence given on behalf of the defendants by the letter carrier, Mr. White, to the effect that he never smelt gas in the apartment, says:\nBut in that regard I have to say this to you, that under our law a man who swears he does see something is considered very much stronger, and a very much more important witness than a man who swears that he does not see anything.\nNow, that, I think, was a misdirection and a dangerous misdirection. It is quite true that the jury may properly in the exercise of their commonsense say to themselves that, other things being equal, credibility, for example, being equal, etc., the evidence of a man who remembers that he has seen something is of greater weight than the evidence of the man who says, \u201cI did not see it.\u201d But, to lay down the broad proposition, laid down by the learned trial judge as a proposition of law, is wrong, and a misdirection, and, I think, in this case, was calculated to mislead the jury.\nI shall not proceed further with the incidents of the conduct of the trial except to call attention to the fact that the learned trial judge, in effect, left the jury under the impression that if the respondents, the Pure Spring Company, in whose premises the machine was installed, were negligent in not insisting upon the installation of a fume pipe, that would not affect the responsibility of the Gas Company. It is quite true that the learned trial judge did not put the matter precisely in that way, but the jury found in most explicit terms that the defendants were both negligent in not insisting upon the setting up of a fume pipe. I do not think there can be any misconception whatever as to the meaning of that finding. I think it meant that it was perfectly well understood on all sides that the installation was incomplete, in that the absence of a fume pipe might have the effect of allowing noxious gases to escape which might do harm; and that the negligence found occurred when the boiler was installed, that is to say, five years before the alleged injury. Now, as I understand the law laid down in M\u2019Alister v. Stevenson[2]; Gregson v. Henderson Roller Bearing Co.[3]; Farr v. Butters[4]; Caledonian Ry. Co. v. Mulholland[5]; and Bottomley v. Bannister[6]; in such circumstances, the Gas Company would not be responsible.\nFor these reasons I think the trial was most unsatisfactory, and that the verdict cannot stand. The costs, including the costs of both appeals, should be reserved to be disposed of by the trial judge.\nRINFRET J.\u2014On the issue between the appellants and the respondent The Pure Spring Company Limited, I concur with my Lord the Chief Justice and with Mr. Justice Smith; and, for the reasons stated by the Chief Justice, I agree that there should be a new trial giving the appellants the opportunity to submit the issue to another jury.\nOn the issue in respect of The Ottawa Gas Company, I would have felt inclined to dismiss the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which was unanimous in holding that the verdict of the jury could not be upheld.\nAs I read the verdict, the negligence of the Gas Company was found to have consisted only in the installation\u2014not the maintenance\u2014of the appliances.\nThe jury did find the existence of a verbal agreement between The Pure Spring Company and the Gas Company both to install the boiler and to maintain it in good order. If, however, the other answers of the jury are looked at, although the jury says that the Gas Company did not \u201ctake the precautions it ought to have taken in installing and maintaining the gas appliances on The Pure Spring Company\u2019s premises,\u201d and although the jury did say that this failure caused in whole or in part the appellants\u2019 injuries, it will be noticed that Question No. 6, to which they gave this affirmative answer, was put to them in the alternative, viz.: \u201cWas the defendant gas company guilty of any negligence in the installation or maintenance of any of the gas appliances, etc.?\u201d But the meaning of the answer to Question 6 is cleared up by the subsequent answer to Question 7, where the jury is asked to state fully in what such negligence consisted. The answer is: \u201cIn failing to install fume pipe on boiler when said boiler was installed.\u201d\nThis was not an oversight on the part of the jury, for their attention was drawn to it by the presiding judge, who said: \u201cThat is originally you mean, when they put it in five years ago, or something? You are all agreed to that, are you?\u201d And the jury assented.\nThis was again shown by the answer to Question 10.\n10. In what respect, if any, did either party fail to observe the terms of such agreement?\u2014A. By not insisting on the installation of fume pipe on boiler at the time said boiler was installed.\nAgain the attention of the jury was drawn by the trial judge to this feature of their answer. He said:\nYou mean that The Pure Spring people were the ones that neglected; that is, they did not insist on having it done? Is that what you mean?\nThe FOREMAN: Yes, both companies, Your Honour.\nHis LORDSHIP: You do not seem to lay any fault to the Gas Company for not doing it. The Pure Spring people did not insist on it, and you think they ought to have insisted?\nThe FOREMAN: Your Honour, the jury feels that both should have insisted\u2014either one or both should have insisted on it.\nHis LORDSHIP: I think I must accept that explanation just the way they give it.\nIn my view, the effect of the verdict is that, so far as the Gas Company is concerned, its negligence occurred at the time \u201cwhen said boiler was installed\u201d. In fact, those are the precise words used by the jury after their attention was drawn to it by the presiding judge. Now, the installation was made five years before the accident.\nIt being so, my view would be that, applying to the verdict the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Dominion Natural Gas Company Limited v. Collins[7], and having regard to the answers of the jury with respect to the full knowledge of the other defendant, The Pure Spring Company Limited, concerning the incomplete nature of the installation, the result is that the Ottawa Gas Company is not legally liable and the action against that respondent ought to have been dismissed.\nAs matters stand, however, two of my learned brothers are of opinion that the appellants should succeed in toto and that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, while my Lord the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Smith think there should be a new trial against both respondents. Under the circumstances, I shall concur in disposing of the case as proposed by the Chief Justice (Carter v. Van Camp[8]; Littley v. Brooks & C.N.R.[9]).\nThe judgment of Cannon and Hughes JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014The plaintiff and his wife complain by their action that they suffered damages because the defendant, The Pure Spring Company Limited, who occupied the basement and the ground floor of the building in which they resided, for some time prior to the 21st December, 1930, allowed dangerous and noxious gases to escape from their premises on to the premises of the plaintiffs. They also allege that, on the night of the 21st December, 1930, and all day the 22nd and in the morning of the 23rd, large quantities of gas escaped from the premises of the defendant and the plaintiff Ida Dozois was asphyxiated and poisoned.\nThe plaintiffs also aver that the Ottawa Gas Company distributed this poisonous gas to, and had installed, two large gas water heaters operated by The Pure Spring Company in the premises.\nThe plaintiffs further alleged that the escape of the said gas was caused by the negligence of the defendant companies and that the plaintiff\u2019s wife, after being ill and confined to the hospital for sixteen days, had suffered a great destruction of nervous tissues with a paralysis of the lower extremities and consequent pain and suffering and great bodily weakness\nThe Ottawa Gas Company denied all liability and claimed that, although they delivered gas at the exterior of the premises of their co-defendant, they had no control over it or its use after it entered the said premises. The Pure Spring Company pleaded that no gas could escape, or had escaped, from their premises; and also that if plaintiff Ida Dozois had suffered illness, it was not from the effect of gases emanating from the defendant\u2019s premises but due to other causes. They also pleaded, in the alternative, that if any gas emanated from their premises, injuring the plaintiff, the same was due to the negligence of the Ottawa Gas Company, which had sold and installed the gas equipment and fittings used in the said premises.\nMr. Justice McEvoy, who presided at the trial, after hearing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, refused the motions for non-suit submitted by the defendants; and the case went to the jury, who answered the questions as follows:\n1. Was the plaintiff Mrs. Dozois injured by inhaling poisonous gases or fumes?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n2. If so, did the said gases or fumes escape from or emanate from gas appliances upon the premises occupied by the Defendant Pure Springs Company?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n3. If the said gases or fumes escaped from the said appliances on the premises occupied by the defendant Pure Springs Company, has the defendant Pure Springs Company satisfied you that the Pure Springs Company, its servants or agents, were not guilty of any negligence causing or contributing to the said escape?\u2014Ans. No.\n4. Did the defendant Gas Company take the precautions they ought to have taken in installing, and maintaining the gas appliances on the Pure Spring Company\u2019s premises?\u2014Ans. No.\n5. If you answer Question 4 \u201cno,\u201d then did the failure of the gas company to take such precautions as they ought to have taken cause or contribute to the causes of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n6. Was the defendant gas company guilty of any negligence in the installation or maintenance of any of the gas appliances upon the premises of the defendant Pure Springs Company, or of any of the attachments thereto, which caused in whole or in part the plaintiff\u2019s injuries?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n7. If you answer Question 6 \u201cyes\u201d state fully in what such negligence consisted?\u2014Ans. In failing to install fume pipe on boiler when said boiler was installed.\nThat is originally you mean, when they put it in five years ago, or something? You are all agreed to that, are you? (Jury assent.)\n8. Was there any agreement between the Pure Springs Company and the Gas Company in regard to the appliances in question?\u2014Ans. Yes (verbal).\n9. If so, what was the agreement?\u2014Ans. To install the aforementioned boiler and maintain same in good order.\n10. In what respect, if any, did either party fail to observe the terms of such agreement?\u2014Ans. By not insisting on the installation of fume pipe on boiler at the time said boiler was installed.\nYou mean that the Pure Spring people were the ones that neglected; that is, they did not insist on having it done? Is that what you mean?\nThe FOREMAN: Yes, both companies, your Honour. His LORDSHIP: YOU do not seem to lay any fault to the Gas Company for not doing it. The Pure Spring people did not insist on it, and you think they ought to have insisted?\n* * * * *\n11. If you find (that the Gas Company failed to observe its agreement with the Pure Springs Company, did the failure of the gas company to observe its agreement cause or contribute to the causes of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n12. At what sum do you assess the damages to,\u2014\n(a) the plaintiff George Dozois $700.00.\n(b) the plaintiff Ida Dozois $4,000.00\nFrom the judgment rendered according to this verdict, an appeal was brought to the learned judges of the Court of Appeal who unanimously dismissed the action against the Ottawa Gas Company and by a majority against The Pure Spring Company. Mr. Justice Magee found that the verdict of the jury, as far as The Pure Spring Company Limited was concerned, could not be disturbed.\nAfter reading with care all the evidence, I have reached the conclusion that there was abundant evidence for the jury to reach reasonably the conclusion that the plaintiffs and their witnesses did smell gas on the occasions in question; that such escape could come only from the premises of The Pure Spring Company. The jury had a right and were in duty bound after the way the trial was conducted by the respondents to believe or disbelieve the denials of their witnesses and to accept or reject the evidence in support of the action. Could they reasonably reach the conclusion that the plaintiffs had proven their case? It was admitted that if gas was diffused in the apartment, it could come exclusively from the Pure Springs\u2019 plant, installed and served by the Ottawa Gas Company\u2014in that building. There was no gas leak on the street or in the neighbourhood. The jury were duly warned by the learned trial judge that the plaintiffs and the members of the family or immediate friends were to be considered as interested witnesses, but they accepted as sufficient and acted upon the evidence they gave as to the presence of gas on several occasions and specially on the 20th, 21st and 22nd of December, 1930. They knew that on several prior occasions, Dozois complained to the landlord who passed the complaints to the Pure Spring Company. Louis Shapiro, one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, stated that on the Sunday night at 10.30 Dozois complained to him about the smell of gas. Moreover, several independent witnesses, Burgess, the bread salesman, Belisle, the bread-driver, and L\u00e9o Chartrand swore that from the 1st of October to the date of the accident they smelled cooking gas there.\nThere being gas in and about that apartment from the 1st of October on, is it unreasonable to reach the conclusion that Mrs. Dozois was injured by it? The jury had the admission by the medical expert for the defence that it was quite possible that this woman, in the house almost all the time, had before the accident built up a certain amount of carbon monoxide poisoning which would make her more susceptible, especially after exertion, walking fast and running upstairs, to the obnoxious results of the inhaling of illuminating gas. This would reasonably explain why, of the whole family, she was the only one who suffered seriously from the combination of carbon monoxide with the blood.\nThe evidence of Dr. A. V. Kniewasser, who, previously unknown to the plaintiffs, was called in and diagnosed monoxide poisoning and swore that his diagnostic was correct, corroborated by Dr. Cairns, more than established the plaintiff\u2019s case. This medical attendant is the only one who spoke from actual personal observation. The other medical witnesses gave only opinions to the effect that the paralysis, if genuine, could be caused by a hemorrhage. They could not give facts. The jury, amidst the obscurity which the expert testimony often brings to a case, chose the evidence of the practitioner who could and did swear to a constant positive fact\u2014that his patient was suffering, when he was called, from gas poisoning, and that he himself had smelt the gas going upstairs to her apartment.\nThis is not a case where the jury had to infer from certain elements of proof a certain conclusion; there was no hiatus to be bridged, but, if they accepted the evidence of the plaintiffs, actual observations of facts which, in their mind, brought practical certainty\u2014or at least reasonable probability, far above a mere guess or conjecture.\nA court of appeal is not called upon to substitute its own views of the evidence to set aside the verdict of a jury. The Court of Appeal and ourselves have not to decide whether the jury were right or wrong in their views of the facts. We are merely to determine whether there was evidence on which reasonable men, properly instructed by the judge, could have come to the conclusion at which the jury arrived. Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright[10]; Laporte v. C.P.R.[11].\nThe judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were acceptable to both parties; and, moreover, the case was eminently one in which the question of the credibility of the witnesses was specifically left to the jury, as all parties went on the basis that evidence was fabricated by the other party and the learned trial judge especially called the attention of the jury to this state of affairs in his address.\nIt is impossible to say that there was no evidence, as contended by the defendants, that Mrs. Dozois had been exposed to poisonous gases and that her injuries resulted from such exposure. Moreover, Mirsky, heard for the defendants, admitted that the appellants complained of gas. William Delorme, another witness for the defendants, was called on the 20th December because there had been a complaint of a gas leak. He admits that he smelled a slight odour of fumes. Prindiville, another employee of the Gas Company, went down to the premises and also smelled fumes, as a result of which he repeated his recommendation that a gas fume pipe be installed in the basement. Up to that time, the defendants\u2019 installation was not complete. Mclntyre, the gas company\u2019s superintendent, says:\nQ. No job is complete without a fume pipe?\u2014A. I would say no. No gas appliance is complete without a fume pipe.\nQ. Suppose on the night of the 20th of December somebody had gone out of those premises and inadvertently left the gas on in this boiler and there had been a fume pipe\u2014what would have happened?\u2014A. The gas would have gone through the building.\nQ. Would it have been carried off through the fume pipe?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. If the fact was there was no fume pipe, and somebody left the gas turned on what would happen to the gas?\u2014A. It would go through the building.\nQ. It would go out of the apparatus into the atmosphere and through the building?\u2014A. That is if it was turned on.\nMr. HENDERSON: That is all elementary.\nIn fact, this fume pipe was installed only on the day that the plaintiff Ida Dozois was taken to the hospital and was entered by her physician as suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.\nThere was evidence, besides the smell of unburnt illuminating gas, of emanations of the product of the incomplete combustion of the said gas which contains a high percentage of carbon monoxide.\nI therefore reach the conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal should be maintained against The Pure Spring Company Limited and the verdict against it restored.\nNow, what about the Gas Company?\nMr. Justice Magee says in his judgment:\nAs regards the Gas Company different considerations arise. The Spring Company were not bound to use any defective appliances and thereby allow the others to be injured. The Gas Company cannot be brought within the principle of the so-called snail case of M\u2019Alister (Donohue) v. Stevenson[12] where the manufacturer of ginger beer was held liable to the donee of a purchaser from his retailed customer for injury to the donee\u2019s health from the concealed presence of a dead snail in the stone bottle nor is the Gas Company in the position of the manufacturers of the Ross rifle as in Ross v. Dunstall[13]. In Gregson v. Henderson Roller Bearing Co.[14] the defendant Company were tenants and the plaintiff was injured by the fall of a wooden platform insecurely placed on edge by the employees of the co-defendant Eckhardt who undertook to make some repairs and who happened to be landlord. It was held that Eckhardt was not liable to the plaintiff but the tenants alone were liable. I at least am bound by that decision and I think it applies to the present case and relieves the Gas Company so far as liability to the plaintiffs are concerned.\nOn this point, the trial judge says:\nAs it seems to me upon the findings of the jury the Pure Spring Co. had gas upon its premises and allowed it to escape upon the premises to the damage of the plaintiffs and thereby were guilty of a breach of duty to take care of a dangerous substance which they had upon their premises to the purposes of their business; and the Gas Company is guilty of a breach of duty amounting to negligence by installing and maintaining this dangerous machine without a fume pipe whereby the gas was allowed to accumulate and enter the plaintiffs\u2019 premises doing damage.\nThe following abstract from the discussion as to the questions to be submitted to the jury may explain, to a certain extent, the view taken by the trial judge:\nHis LORDSHIP: You mean there is evidence that might make me think, especially the evidence of Mclntyre, who says, supposing the cock had been left partly open and the fume pipe has been there, the fume pipe would have carried it out and it would not have circulated through the building.\nMr. BEAMENT: And Prindiville said the same thing.\nMr. HENDERSON: That is common sense anyway. His LORDSHIP: I thought Mclntyre\u2019s evidence was that if somebody did kick the top of one of these machines and knock it partially open, and that raw gas began to circulate there, the fume pipe would carry it away.\nMr. HENDERSON: It is common ground between my friend and myself. I would not attempt to deny it for one moment, if that happened through carelessness or design, if you like. That is why a fume pipe is necessary, to make a job complete. A fume pipe makes the apparatus practically fool-proof. The fume pipe is unimportant as regards merely the fumes from burnt gas because they don\u2019t hurt anybody.\nMr. BEAMENT: That is for the jury to decide.\nThe jury found the following against the Gas Company:\n1st. That they did not take the precautions they ought to have taken in installing and maintaining the gas appliances on these premises;\n2nd. That the failure of the Gas Company to take such precautions as they ought to have taken caused or contributed to the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury;\n3rd. That the Gas Company was guilty of negligence in the installation or maintenance of the appliances which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries in failing to install a fume pipe on the boiler when the said boiler was installed;\n4th. That there was a verbal agreement between the Pure Spring Company and the Gas Company in regard to the appliances in question to install the aforementioned boiler and maintain same in good order; and the jury found that both parties should have insisted on the installation of this fume pipe at that time.\nIn Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins[15], Lord Dunedin, speaking for the Privy Council, said that the findings of the jury must be the basis of consideration, unless it can be said that these findings are incapable of support by the evidence.\nIn this case, it is shown and it is practically common ground that the Gas Company took special care in looking after its appliances and sent an inspector to look them over, even without being called upon to do so. It is also abundantly shown that Prindiville, their employee, insisted, at the time of the installation and after, and also on the day on which the female plaintiff went to the hospital, on the necessity of a fume pipe. As in the Collins case[16], The gas company were not occupiers of the premises on which the accident happened. Further, there being no relation of contract between the company and the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs cannot appeal to any defect in the machine supplied by the defendants which might constitute breach of contract. * * *.\nOn the other hand, if the proximate cause of the accident is not the negligence of the defendant, but the conscious act of another volition, then he will not be liable.\nCan it be said in this case that the Gas Company owed a duty to all the occupiers of the building in which they introduced an admittedly dangerous thing? Were they bound to take all precautions to prevent its escape or to neutralize the danger to such occupiers in case of an accident causing such an escape? Therefore, were they not bound, as found by the jury, to insist and complete the installation and make it safe by installing the fume pipe which would have brought the noxious gas into the open air, instead of allowing its diffusion into the building? If so bound, did they satisfy the onus cast upon them of proving that the proximate cause of the accident was not their negligence, but the conscious act of another volition?\nVery recently, after the trial of the present case, Lord MacMillan, in M\u2019Alister v. Stevenson[17], says:\nThe exceptional case of things dangerous in themselves or known to be in a dangerous condition has been regarded as constituting a peculiar category outside the ordinary law both of contract and of tort. I may observe that it seems to me inaccurate to describe the case of dangerous things as an exception to the principle that no one but a party to a contract can sue on that contract. I rather regard this type of case as a special instance of negligence where the law exacts a degree of diligence so stringent as to amount practically to a guarantee of safety.\nIn the same case, Lord Atkin, speaking for the majority of the House of Lords, gave us the present state of the law of England as follows[18]:\nAt present I content myself with pointing out that in English law there must be and is some general conception of relations giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in the books are but instances. The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of \u201cculpa,\u201d is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer\u2019s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be\u2014persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question. This appears to me to be the doctrine of Heaven v. Pender[19] as laid down by Lord Esher (then Brett M.R.) when it is limited by the notion of proximity introduced by Lord Esher himself and A.L. Smith, L.J., in LeLievre v. Gould[20]. Lord Esher says: \u201cThat case established that, under certain circumstances, one man may owe a duty to another, even though there is no contract between them. If one man is near to another, or is near to the property of another, a duty lies upon him not to do that which may cause a personal injury to that other, or may injure his property.\u201d So A.L. Smith, L.J.: \u201cThe decision of Heaven v. Pender19 was founded upon the principle, that a duty to take due care did arise when the person or property of one was in such proximity to the person or property of another that, if due care was not taken, damage might be done by the one to the other.\u201d I think that this sufficiently states the truth if proximity be not confined to mere physical proximity, but be used, as I think it was intended, to extend to such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take care would know would be directly affected by his careless act. * * * I do not find it necessary to discuss at length the cases dealing with duties where a thing is dangerous, or, in the narrower category, belongs to a class of things which are dangerous in themselves. I regard the distinction as an unnatural one so far as it is used to serve as a logical differentiation by which to distinguish the existence or non-existence of a legal right. In this respect I agree with what was said by Scrutton, L.J., in Hodge & Sons v. Anglo-American Oil Co.[21], a case which was ultimately decided on a question of fact. \u201cPersonally I do not understand the difference between a thing dangerous in itself, as poison, and a thing not dangerous as a class, but by negligent construction dangerous as a particular thing. The latter, if anything, seems the more dangerous of the two; it is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing instead of an obvious wolf.\u201d The nature of the thing may very well call for different degrees of care, and the person dealing with it may well contemplate persons as being within the sphere of his duty to take care who would not be sufficiently proximate with less dangerous goods; so that not only the degree of care but the range of persons to whom a duty is owed may be extended. But they all illustrate the general principle. In Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. Collins and Perkins[22], the appellants had installed a gas apparatus and were supplying natural gas on the premises of a railway company. They had installed a regulator to control the pressure and their men negligently made an escape valve discharge into the building instead of into the open air. The railway workmen\u2014the plaintiffs\u2014were injured by an explosion in the premises. The defendants were held liable. Lord Dunedin, in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee (consisting of himself, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Collins, and Sir Arthur Wilson), after stating that there was no relation of contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants, proceeded: \u201cThere may be, however, in the case of any one performing an operation, or setting up and installing a machine, a relationship of duty. What that duty is will vary according to the subject-matter of the things involved. It has, however, again and again been held that, in the case of articles dangerous in themselves, such as loaded firearms, poisons, explosives, and other things ejusdem generis, there is a peculiar duty to take precaution imposed upon those who send forth or install such articles when it is necessarily the case that other parties will come within their proximity.\u201d This, with respect, exactly sums up the position. The duty may exist independently of contract. Whether it exists or not depends upon the subject matter involved; but clearly in the class of things enumerated there is a special duty to take precautions. This is the very opposite of creating a special category in which alone the duty exists. I may add, though it obviously would make no difference in the creation of a duty, that the installation of an apparatus to fee used for gas perhaps more closely resembles the manufacture of a gun than a dealing with a loaded gun. In both cases the actual work is innocuous; it is only when the gun is loaded or the apparatus charged with gas that the danger arises.\nAfter the jury had retired and after taking up this matter and discussing the above quoted Collins case[23] with counsel for the Gas Company, the jury returned for further instruction and was told:\nHis LORDSHIP: Counsel for the gas company points out to me that I said to you that in installing and handling gas, it was a dangerous substance, and that they had a duty to exercise of precaution and care, which they ought to exercise in order to prevent somebody being hurt by their gas. I think I did say that to you and I ought to have said in that connection to you that if some independent person other than the gas company, somebody by his volition did something which caused the accident that is complained of, that would relieve the gas company so far as that duty was concerned. If the Pure Spring Company, for instance, did something that really caused the accident, and did it voluntarily by their own volition, then that would be a thing that would discharge the gas company from the liability from that doctrine of duty.\nMr. BEAMENT: And the gas company must prove that, my Lord.\nHis LORDSHIP: And before you can apply that rule you must be convinced from the evidence, not that the gas company must prove it, but from the whole evidence as you have it before you\u2014if you conclude that the Pure Spring Company did do something in connection with that gas after the company had done their whole duty, and been as careful as they ought to have been, and did everything they ought to have done\u2014if the Pure Spring people, or anybody else, did some act voluntarily intentionally, that really caused the harm that is complained of, then you would be right in acquitting the gas company from any liability on that branch of the case.\nThe answers of the jury show that they did not find that the accident was entirely caused, independently of the negligence of the Gas Company, by the conscious act of another volition against which no precaution could really avail; on the contrary, they found joint negligence; and in apportioning the blame, the jury considered that 60% of it should be assigned to the Gas Company for failing in their duty to protect the plaintiff\u2019s wife, as one of the persons who were so closely and directly affected by the introduction of poisonous gas in the building that they (the company) ought reasonably to have had her in contemplation as being immediately affected by the acts or omissions called in question\u2014and they evidently found that the Gas Company had not exculpated itself by establishing that the accident had been caused by the independent conscious act of another volition. The instructions of the learned trial judge to the jury have not been challenged and the latest authorities confirm his directions in law.\nApplying the law to the facts as found by the jury, I reach the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the trial court restored against both respondents.\nAppeal allowed; new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellants: George M.

Arsene Bonnier (Plaintiff) Respondent;\nand\nThe City of Montreal (Mise-en-Cause).\n1934: May 14; 1934: November 26.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Quo warranto\u2014Disqualification of alderman\u2014Property owned by alderman, sold to his daughter and leased to the city\u2014Whether alderman \u201cdirectly or indirectly interested\u201d\u2014Paragraph (g) of s. 25 of the charter of the city of Montreal, 11 Geo. V, c. 112.\nIn the year 1931, the appellant held the office of alderman of the city of Montreal and was re-elected in 1932. Previous to his election he owned lots on Allard street, and, in 1931, he built a three-storey house thereon. Some time in the early part of 1931 the appellant suggested to the chief of police that this house would be suitable for a police substation, alleged to be needed; and, after examination of the premises and reports by officials of the city, on the 23rd of April, 1931, the city\u2019s notary received instructions to prepare a lease of the property at $125 per month. On the 27th of April, the appellant transferred his property to his daughter for a sum of $9,500, payable in five years, nothing being paid on account, the appellant reserving his privil\u00e8ge de bailleur de fonds and an hypothec on the property for the full amount. On the 6th of June, 1931, a lease was signed between the city and the appellant\u2019s daughter for a term of ten years at $125 for the first five years and $150 for the other five years. The city of Montreal paid these rents by cheques to the order of the appellant\u2019s daughter; all the cheques down to the 15th of April, 1932, with only one exception, were endorsed and delivered by her to the appellant, and the latter deposited them in his banking account and gave credit for same amounts on the purchase price of the property. On the 15th of April, 1932, the respondent filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto asking the disqualification of the appellant as alderman, alleging that the deed of sale from the appellant to his daughter was simulated and that the property in reality still belonged to the appellant, or that, alternatively, the latter had an indirect pecuniary interest in the contract ostensibly between his daughter and the city of Montreal. Paragraph (g) of section 25 of the charter of the city of Montreal enacts that \u201cNo person may be nominated for the office of mayor or alderman nor be elected to nor fill such office: (g) If he is directly or indirectly a party to any contract or directly or indirectly interested in a contract with the city, whatever may be the object of such contract.\u201d\nHeld that the appellant was disqualified as alderman of the city of Montreal, as, according to the facts of the case, he was \u201cdirectly or indirectly interested\u201d in the lease to which, by its terms, his daughter and the city were the parties.\nPer Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\u2014The existence of a common intention and expectation concerning the disposition of the rents, which was acted upon, by the transfer of cheques for rent to the father by the daughter shews that the appellant was interested in the lease within the purview of the statute.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The appellant, before and after his election as alderman, had a pecuniary interest in the property leased to the city, and consequently in a contract with the city, contrary to the charter.\nPer Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\u2014The language of the statute is not the language of lawyers; the phrase \u201cinterested in\u201d has no technical signification; effect must be given to it according to the common usage of men.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The nature and the extent of such \u201cinterest\u201d must be established by the facts in each case; and whenever an alderman finds himself in such a position that he must choose between the interest of the city in a contract and his own, he is instantly disqualified.\nPer Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Hughes JJ.\u2014In this case, there is \u201cconcert,\u201d within the meaning of the Lord Chancellor\u2019s judgment in Norton v. Taylor, [1906] A.C. 378, between the appellant, as alderman, and his daughter, as a contractor with the city, by which moneys paid by the city under the contract were to be, and in fact were, transferred to the alderman in payment of a debt owing to him by the contractor. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Surveyer J. and maintaining a petition for a writ of quo warranto issued against the appellant, asking for his disqualification as alderman of the city of Montreal.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn Ahem K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Hughes J.J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal arises out of a proceeding alleging the disqualification of the appellant to hold the office of an alderman for the city of Montreal.\nIn the year 1931 the appellant held the office of alderman and was re-elected in April, 1932. Previous to his election he owned lots on Allard street and, in 1931, he built a three-storey house thereon. Some time in the early part of the year 1931 he suggested to the chief of police that this house would be suitable for a police substation. The chief of police caused the property to be examined. The appellant, who was then an alderman, accompanied the inspector who conducted the examination. The inspector reported that the creation of such a substation would provide increased protection. The superintendent of police reported that the appellant had told him there was an understanding that the city would rent the property at $125 per month.\nAfter inspector Kavanagh\u2019s visit to the property, the appellant again discussed the matter with the chief of police and was told by him that the place would be suitable for a substation. On the 21st of April, 1931, the chief of police recommended to the director of services of the city of Montreal the establishment of a substation there, citing in support of his recommendation the opinion of inspector Kavanagh and his approval of the proposal.\nLater, the appellant saw Mr. Bray, the president of the executive committee of the city of Montreal, and provisionally arranged for a lease by the city at $125 per month. On the 23rd of April the director of services wrote to the city\u2019s notary giving instructions to prepare a lease of the property, and, on the 27th of April, all arrangements for the lease having been completed, the appellant transferred the property to his daughter Mrs. April for the sum of $9,500, payable in five years, nothing being paid on account.\nOn the 27th of May, 1931, the executive committee submitted to the council a draft of a lease by Mrs. April to the city, and this report was adopted on motion by another alderman which was seconded by the appellant. On the 6th of June, 1931, the lease between the city and Mrs. April was signed; it was a lease for a term of ten years at a rental of $125 per month for the first five years, and $150 per month for the last five years. The city of Montreal paid the rent of $125 per month, by cheque to the order of Mrs. April; and all the cheques down to the 15th of April, 1932, when the present proceedings were instituted, were endorsed and delivered by Mrs. April to the appellant, with the exception of the cheque for December, 1931, which was used by the daughter for exceptional family expenses. All the cheques delivered to the appellant by Mrs. April were deposited in his banking account and credited on the purchase price of the property.\nIn July, 1931, the chief of police reported to the director of services that he had been induced by error to assent to the establishment of a substation and that no substation was required on Allard street, and that the lease ought to be cancelled. In October, 1931, the police inspector for the division where the property was situated reported that the property was not in a sanitary condition; that the heating system was insufficient; that the building was not finished; and that there was water at all times in the basement. Nevertheless, the city took possession of the property in January, 1932. Rent has been paid by the city at the contract rate from the 1st of May, 1931; and on the 4th of April, 1932, the date of the appellant\u2019s reelection as alderman, the lease was a subsisting lease.\nThe question for our determination is whether or not the appellant was disqualified, by force of paragraph (g) of section 25 of the charter of the city of Montreal, which enactment is in these terms:\nNo person may be nominated for the office of mayor or alderman or be elected to nor fill such office: (g) If he is directly or indirectly a party to any contract, or directly or indirectly interested in a contract with the city, whatever may be the object of such contract.\nThe precise question is whether, while holding the office of alderman, the appellant was \u201cdirectly or indirectly interested\u201d in the lease, to which, by its terms, his daughter and the city were the parties.\nIt was argued by the respondent that the whole transaction was simulated, and that the daughter was, in respect of the ownership of the property, as well as in respect of the lease, a mere pr\u00eate-nom for her father, the appellant. The trial judge, on this issue, found against the respondent, as well as four judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. These learned judges held that the sale to the daughter was a real sale and that the daughter was the real party to the lease to the city. Their view was that the activities of the appellant, in respect of which he received no remuneration, in superintending the building of the house, were naturally explained by the parental relationship; and that this relationship accounted, at least in large measure, for his efforts in procuring the letting of the property to the city.\nWe perceive no satisfactory ground for doubting that this is substantially in accord with the actual facts. On the other hand, this view, that these transactions were real transactions, establishing legal relations between the father and the daughter, and between the city and the daughter, necessarily involve the proposition that the ostensible obligation on the part of the daughter to pay the purchase money was a legal obligation which the daughter was expected to fulfil.\nThe majority of the judges in Quebec have fully accepted the contention that the house was built for the daughter, but that she was to pay the purchase price of it, the amount which corresponded at least approximately to the aggregate of the sums expended by the appellant; as well as additional sums expended by him, for example, in connection with heating arrangements. But there seems to be no room for doubt, and, indeed, it is not disputed, that (since the daughter was without resources, and had no other means for providing for the payment of these obligations to her father) it was contemplated by all parties that the daughter would be enabled to discharge these obligations out of the moneys received by her as rents, and that the rents would be devoted to that purpose.\nOne of the sisters who was called by the respondent gives this evidence:\nQ. Quand il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question que M. Angrignon donnerait \u00e0 madame April une propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019il lui ferait construire une propri\u00e9t\u00e9, madame April avait-elle de l\u2019argent pour faire un payment en acompte? R. Du tout, aucun argent.\nQ. Il \u00e9tait entendu que madame April n\u2019avait pas d\u2019argent pour acheter ou payer une propri\u00e9t\u00e9?\u2014R. Non, du tout.\nQ. Comment devait-elle payer cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0?\u2014R. Quand la maison \u00e9tait finie, avec les loyers qu\u2019elle recevait.\nQ. Elle devait payer avec les loyers?\u2014R. Oui.\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait cela qui \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu?\u2014R. C\u2019\u00e9tait la d\u00e9cision.\nThis testimony must not be given an extreme construction. It ought not to be read as establishing that there was an explicit contract between the father and daughter as to the application of the rents; and we are not disposed to hold that there was a legally enforceable duty resting upon the daughter to apply the rents in pursuance of the expectation and intention of the family who seem to have been fully conversant with the arrangements. In this sense we think the finding of the trial judge, in which Mr. Justice Letourneau concurred, that the daughter was free to dispose of the rents, can be sustained.\nNevertheless, we do not think it can be seriously disputed that the appellant, his daughter, as well as the family generally, counted upon the disbursements made by the father in the construction of the building, that is to say, the amount of the purchase price, which constituted debt from the daughter to the father, being reimbursed and paid to the father by the application of the rents to that purpose.\nAt the conclusion of the argument I was disposed to think that, since the facts in evidence did not point to a legally enforceable arrangement between the father and the daughter touching the application of the rents, the case was not within the statute. On further reflection, I have reached the conclusion that the existence of a common intention and expectation concerning the disposition of the rents, which was acted upon by the transfer of cheques for rent to the father by the daughter, as already explained, down to the commencement of the proceedings in quo warranto, shews that the father was \u201cinterested in the lease\u201d within the purview of the statute. It should be observed that the cheques were transferred by the daughter and received by the father as a matter of course. He says she was entitled to retain them. But she had, as already observed, no other means of paying him. The appellant, when asked to explain why, after commencement of the proceedings, he had left the rent in the hands of Madame April, gives this answer:\nQ. Voulez-vous dire pourquoi apr\u00e8s cela les ch\u00e8ques sont all\u00e9s au compte de votre fille?\u2014R. Parce que mon gendre a perdu sa position et que ma fille \u00e9tait malade, elle est gravement malade, elle est aux incurables, peut-\u00eatre pour ne pas en sortir. Je voudrais bien qu\u2019elle reviendrait, je prends tous les moyens. Je lui ai dit: \u201cPrends tout ton argent et soigne-toi\u201d. Son mari, il faut qu\u2019il mange, il n\u2019a rien \u00e0 faire.\nHis answer by the appellant who insists, throughout his evidence, that the rents were the property of Madame April, rather implies that the retention of the rents by her in the special circumstances was a concession by him.\nAgain, this passage in his evidence is not without significance:\nR. C\u2019\u00e9tait ma fille qui recevait cela pour moi, je les endossais apr\u00e8s ma fille. Elle les endossait, ils \u00e9taient faits \u00e0 son nom, les ch\u00e8ques n\u2019\u00e9taient pas faits \u00e0 mon nom.\nQ. Vous les endossiez et vous les d\u00e9posiez \u00e0 votre compte?\u2014R. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 endoss\u00e9s par ma fille.\nQ. Vous les d\u00e9posiez \u00e0 votre compte?\u2014R. Qui.\nQ. Alors, la ville payait votre propri\u00e9t\u00e9? (Me L. E. Beaulieu C.R., avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette question comme ill\u00e9gale).\nQ. C\u2019est bien l\u2019argent de la ville qui allait dans votre compte en paiement de votre propri\u00e9t\u00e9? (Me L. E. Beaulieu C.R., avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette question comme ill\u00e9gale).\nTurning now to the effect of the statute. The courts have had to consider similar provisions on various occasions during the past century. I refer to some of the judgments which have been delivered in cases involving the construction of similar words, not as authorities governing us in the construction of the Quebec statute, but as indicating, as I think they do, the point of view from which the consideration of the enactment before us is to be approached.\nIn Towsey v. White[1] Bayley J. said,\nThe great object of the Legislature was to prevent any bargaining between the trustees and the contractors, so as to give the former an interest adverse to their duty.\nIn Nutton v. Wilson[2] Lindley L.J. said,\nTo interpret words of this kind, which have no very definite meaning, and which perhaps were purposely employed for that very reason, we must look at the object to be attained. The object obviously was to prevent the conflict between interest and duty that might otherwise inevitably arise.\nIn Norton v. Taylor[3], Lord Loreburn, L.C., construing a statute of New South Wales, by which any person holding civic office was penalized, where he \u201cbecomes directly or indirectly * * * knowingly engaged or interested in any contract * * * with or on behalf of the council,\u201d said,\nThere are many ways in which a person holding a civic office might be brought within the Act 2 Edw. 7, No. 35, as for instance if he had a share in the original contract, or if he were employed by way of subcontract to execute the original contract or part of it; or it might be perceived by the Court that an arrangement had been made under which he was to be the person to supply the materials for the original contract. In those cases, whether it was done directly or indirectly, he might be liable, and no device to conceal the real nature of the transaction would prevail. But their Lordships do not think that he is liable merely for supplying materials to the contractor who chooses to buy them from him without any sort of understanding or arrangement that he should do so. Courts of justice in such cases would be vigilant to observe evidence of any concert to enable a civic officer to derive benefit from a contract.\nWe think the indicia adverted to in this passage, and in the observations of Lindley L.J., afford the most satisfactory tests in the circumstances of this case. The language of the statute is not the language of lawyers. The phrase \u201cinterested in\u201d has no technical signification; effect must be given to it according to the common usage of men.\nSufficient has been said to support the conclusion that here we have \u201cconcert,\u201d within the meaning of the Lord Chancellor\u2019s judgment, between an alderman and a contractor with the municipality, by which moneys paid by the city under the contract were to be, and in fact were, transferred to the alderman in payment of a debt owing to him by the contractor. No doubt, as has already been said, the appellant, throughout, had his daughter\u2019s welfare at heart. In negotiating the lease, we may assume that he was actuated by his concern in seeing her comfortably provided for; but it is impossible to escape the conclusion that he had in view the employment of the moneys paid by the city to reimburse his expenditures in constructing and equipping the building. Nor is there any doubt that in all this his daughter\u2019s view and intentions, in this respect, coincided with his own. The appellant was, we repeat, by \u201cconcert\u201d between himself and the lessee \u201cinterested in the lease\u201d in the pertinent sense.\nThe appeal will be dismissed. But, since the respondent can only succeed upon a construction of the statute not advanced by him at any stage, we think he should be subjected to the terms that there shall be no costs of this appeal or of the proceedings in the courts of Quebec.\nCannon J.\u2014La Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec a accord\u00e9 permission sp\u00e9ciale de nous soumettre son jugement du 28 octobre 1933 renversant, avec le dissentiment de l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef Tellier et de l\u2019honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Surveyer, J.) et d\u00e9clarant l\u2019appelant d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et exclu de son si\u00e8ge comme \u00e9chevin. L\u2019article 25, par. (g), de la charte de Montr\u00e9al se lit comme suit:\nNul ne peut \u00eatre mis en nomination pour la charge de maire ou d\u2019\u00e9chevin, ni \u00eatre \u00e9lu \u00e0 cette charge, ni l\u2019exercer:\n(g) S\u2019il est directement ou indirectement partie \u00e0 un contrat, ou directement ou indirectement int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans un contrat avec la cit\u00e9, quelque soit l\u2019objet de ce contrat.\nComme le dit le jugement permettant l\u2019appel, cet article ne fait que confirmer un principe de droit public \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, \u00e0 savoir que personne occupant une position de confiance, comme celle d\u2019\u00e9chevin, ne doit continuer dans l\u2019exercise de ses fonctions si son int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier vient en conflit avec son devoir officiel.\nPour r\u00e9soudre la question pos\u00e9e, il est bon de faire l\u2019historique de cette disposition de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nEn 1890, dans la cause de Stephens v. Hurteau[4], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 qu\u2019un \u00e9chevin qui s\u2019engage \u00e0 fournir des mat\u00e9riaux requis par un entrepreneur pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un contrat avec la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans tel contrat qui tombe sous la prohibition du statut 37 Vict. (Q.) c. 51, s. 22, et le rend incapable d\u2019occuper son si\u00e8ge comme \u00e9chevin. A la page 157, le juge-en-chef Johnson nous dit:\nFirst, what is the law? The Act of 1874 (37 V. c. 51, sec. 22) lays down at sec. 22, among other things, that any person holding the office of mayor or alderman, who shall directly or indirectly become a party to, or security for, any contract or agreement to which the corporation of the said city is a party, or shall derive any interest, profit or advantage from such contract or agreement, shall immediately become disqualified and cease to hold his office.\nThen came the Act of 1889 (52 Vic. c 79), a consolidation of the Act constituting the charter of the city\u2014which never repealed the Act of 1874; but on the contrary enacted by its 284th section, that only Acts inconsistent with the Act of 1889 were repealed; and even in that case the repeal was not to affect anything done under the Acts repealed. Well, this Act of 1889, by its 25th section, reproduced the provisions of sec. 22 of the Act of 1874, as far as disqualification resulting from directly or indirectly becoming a party to, or security for, any contract or agreement with the city; but when it came to disqualification as resulting from deriving any interest, profit or advantage from such contract or agreement, the later Act added the words, to the extent of $100.\nCette section 25, telle qu\u2019interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans cette cause de Stephens v. Hurteau[5], fut remplac\u00e9e par 55-56 V. c. 49, s. 26, par la suivante:\n25. If any person, holding the office of mayor or alderman * * * directly or indirectly becomes a party to, or security for, any contract or agreement with the city for the performance of any work or duty, or derives any interest, profit or advantage from such contract or agreement, to the extent of one hundred dollars, * * * then, and in every such case, such person shall thereupon immediately become disqualified, etc.\nLa charte fut revis\u00e9e et consolid\u00e9e en 1899, par 62 Vict. c. 58. La clause 37 d\u00e9qualifie toute personne qui\ndirectly or indirectly becomes a party to or security for any contract or agreement with the city, for the performance of any work or duty or for goods to be supplied to it, or directly or indirectly has any interest in, or derives any profit or advantage from, such contract or agreement, or is a party to or directly or indirectly interested in any claim or in any suit or legal process or in any expropriation or other case in which the city, if condemned, will have to disburse any moneys, or is the attorney for the claimant or for the plaintiff in any such process, suit or case, or is a member of a firm acting as attorneys or one of the members whereof acts as attorney as aforesaid, etc.\nCet article 37 de 62 Vict. c. 58, fut, \u00e0 son tour, amend\u00e9 par 9 Ed. VII, c. 81, sec. 3, et remplac\u00e9 par 4 Geo. V, c. 73, sec. 4, modifi\u00e9 par 8 Geo. V, c. 84, s. 16, et abrog\u00e9 par 11 Geo. V, c. 112, s. 18 (1921).\nCette m\u00eame loi de 1921 (c\u00e9dule B, s. 10) art. 10, nous donna l\u2019article 25 comme suit:\n25. No person may be nominated for the office of mayor or alderman nor be elected to nor fill such office; * * *\ng. if he is directly or indirectly a party to any contract, or directly or indirectly interested in a contract with the city, whatever may be the object of such contract;\nh. if, as an advocate, he conducts or if the firm to which he belongs, or any of its members, conducts any case against the city before a court of justice, or in connection with an expropriation; i. if he is a party or interested directly or indirectly in any case, prosecution or claim against the city;\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 le texte qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter.\nIl serait assez difficile de donner une d\u00e9finition exacte et pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat en question. Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas seulement de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour avoir un droit d\u2019action contre la cit\u00e9; car, dans ce cas, la deuxi\u00e8me partie de la prohibition serait inutile. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir par les faits de chaque cause la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat; et chaque fois qu\u2019on arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019\u00e9chevin se trouve \u00e0 avoir \u00e0 choisir entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la cit\u00e9 dans un contrat et le sien, il est imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9.\nM\u00eame si, en fait, l\u2019acte de vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al consenti par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 sa fille est r\u00e9el et non simul\u00e9, cela aurait simplement pour effet d\u2019\u00e9liminer la premi\u00e8re prohibition du sous-paragraphe g, celle qui l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019\u00eatre partie directement ou indirectement \u00e0 un contrat avec la cit\u00e9. Mais pourquoi avoir retard\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 24 avril 1931 pour passer l\u2019acte authentique de cette vente que l\u2019on veut faire remonter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1930? Le rapport favorable de Kavanagh est du 8 avril 1931. Le rapport du directeur de police porte la date du 21 avril, celui du directeur des services fut sign\u00e9 le 23 avril demandant au notaire Beaudoin de pr\u00e9parer le bail. D\u00e8s lors, l\u2019affaire pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme b\u00e2cl\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant; et il semble raisonnable de d\u00e9duire de ces circonstances la conclusion que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019alors, le 27 avril 1931, qu\u2019il s\u2019est cru suffisamment garanti pour pouvoir vendre par acte authentique \u00e0 sa fille qui \u00e9tait devenue, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses d\u00e9marches comme \u00e9chevin, capable de lui payer le prix de vente \u00e0 m\u00eame les loyers qu\u2019elle retirerait chaque mois pendant dix ans de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nJe ne puis me convaincre que l\u2019appelant, cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire pour la pleine valeur de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, d\u00e8s lors, au moins indirectement, int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la ville de Montr\u00e9al paie \u00e0 sa fille cent vingt-cinq dollars ($125) par mois pendant cinq ans, et cent cinquante dollars ($150) par mois pendant les cinq ann\u00e9es suivantes, si r\u00e9ellement sa fille, qui \u00e9tait absolument sans moyens, devait lui rembourser le prix de cet immeuble. La charte de Montr\u00e9al est plus rigoureuse sous ce rapport que le code municipal ou la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. La l\u00e9gislature avait sans doute ses raisons pour mettre les \u00e9chevins de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute tentation. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas encore comme cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire un jus in re dans cet immeuble, il n\u2019en aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 moins int\u00e9ress\u00e9, comme promettant vendeur, \u00e0 obtenir, par ses d\u00e9marches, du chef de police et des autres officiers les recommandations voulues pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un nouveau poste de police dans la maison de rapport en question. Je suis fortement d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir de doute que, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est agi d\u2019autoriser l\u2019adoption du rapport de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif par le conseil de ville, le 27 mai 1931, l\u2019\u00e9chevin Angrignon a fait preuve d\u2019une ignorance de la loi, ou d\u2019une ind\u00e9licatesse peu ordinaire, en secondant audacieusement la motion de l\u2019\u00e9chevin Biggar adoptant le rapport qui assurait la location de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 pour dix ans \u00e0 un prix qui, pour le moins, \u00e9tait r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur et lui fournissait un moyen presque certain de se faire payer les d\u00e9bours\u00e9s qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir faits pour installer sa fille et que cette derni\u00e8re, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019acte de vente, devait lui rembourser\u2014bien qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt sans moyens de le faire autrement,\u2014que par ce que cet immeuble pouvait rapporter. Et, de fait, l\u2019appelant a admis que chaque ch\u00e8que de $125, depuis juin 1931, sauf celui de d\u00e9cembre, est all\u00e9, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 avril 1932, date des proc\u00e9dures, avec l\u2019endossement de sa fille, au cr\u00e9dit de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la banque, en d\u00e9duction du prix de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e.\nComme je l\u2019ai dit plus haut, la charte de la cit\u00e9 est plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re aujourd\u2019hui qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019\u00e9tait en 1890, lors de l\u2019affaire de Stephens v. Hurteau (1). Ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9qualifi\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il aurait vendu du bois pour le pavage de la rue Craig \u00e0 un entrepreneur de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, dont il \u00e9tait ainsi devenu le cr\u00e9ancier. La loi, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, prohibait tout int\u00e9r\u00eat, profit ou avantage de l\u2019\u00e9chevin dans un contrat. Plus tard, on a sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un contrat \u201cfor the performance of any work or duty.\u201d Puis on a ajout\u00e9 \u201cfor goods to be supplied to the city.\u201d Et enfin, nous avons le texte actuel qui ne sp\u00e9cifie rien mais parle de n\u2019importe quel contrat \u201cquelque soit l\u2019objet de ce contrat\u201d. La disposition actuelle, en retranchant les mots \u201cprofit\u201d et \u201cavantage\u201d, qui, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point, d\u00e9limitaient le sens du mot \u201cint\u00e9r\u00eat \u201c, me para\u00eet plus compr\u00e9hensive. Avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans une affaire n\u2019est pas prendre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de quelqu\u2019un par simple bienveillance, sentiment qui fait que Ton d\u00e9sire et poursuit le bien de quelqu\u2019un, que l\u2019on prend part \u00e0 ce qui lui arrive d\u2019agr\u00e9able ou de f\u00e2cheux\u2014mais sans d\u00e9sir \u00e9goiste d\u2019un profit, d\u2019un avantage personnel, sans consid\u00e9ration pour son bien propre et exclusif. Pour moi, l\u2019appelant, dans cette affaire de bail \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, n\u2019a pas agi par simple bienveillance pour sa fille, \u00e0 laquelle il pouvait l\u00e9gitimement s\u2019int\u00e9resser; mais il s\u2019\u00e9tait auparavant assur\u00e9 un droit \u00e9ventuel \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel \u00e0 m\u00eame les loyers provenant de la cit\u00e9\u2014dont il avait jur\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger les int\u00e9r\u00eats. De plus, il s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par l\u2019acte de vente une \u201chypoth\u00e8que sur l\u2019immeuble lou\u00e9 en outre du privil\u00e8ge de droit Il avait donc, avant, lors et apr\u00e8s son \u00e9lection comme \u00e9chevin, un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e \u00e0 la cit\u00e9\u2014et, par cons\u00e9quent, dans un contrat avec la cit\u00e9; que cet int\u00e9r\u00eat soit direct ou indirect, peu importe, dit la charte de Montr\u00e9al.\nCette disposition est de droit public et les autorit\u00e9s anglaises recueillies dans Biggar, Municipal Manual, \u00e9dition de 1900, pp. 109 et 110, sont \u00e0 consulter.\nDans Stephens v. Hurteau[6], le juge-en-chef Johnson r\u00e9f\u00e8re (p. 163) \u00e0 City of Toronto v. Bowes[7]. Je trouve dans le rapport de cette cause un citation tir\u00e9e de Governor and Company of York Building Society v. Mackenzie[8], qui pose, je crois, le principe qui trouve son expression dans l\u2019article de la charte de Montr\u00e9al qui nous est soumis:\nThe office imports a natural disability, which, ex vi termini, imports the highest quality of legal disability. A law which flows from nature, and is founded on the reason and nature of the thing, is paramount to all positive law. This is not an arbitrary or local regulation; it is the constitution of nature itself, and is as old as the formation of society, and of course it must be universal. It proceeds from nature, and is silently received, recognized, and made effectual, where ever any well regulated system of civil jurisprudence is known.\nThe ground on which the disability or disqualification rests is no other than that principle which dictates that a person cannot be both judge and party. \u201cNo man can serve two masters.\u201d He that is entrusted with the interest of others cannot be allowed to make the business an object of interest to himself; because, from the frailty of human nature, one who has the power, will be too readily seized with the inclination, to use the opportunity for serving his own interest at the expense of those for whom he is entrusted. The danger of temptation, from the facility and advantages of doing wrong which a particular situation afford, does, out of the mere necessity of the case, create a disqualification; nothing less than incapacity being able to shut the door against temptation, when the danger is imminent and the security against discovery great, as it must be when the difficulty of prevention or remedy is inherent in the very situation which creates the danger. The wise policy of the law has therefore put the sting of a disability into the temptation as a defensive weapon against the strength of the danger which lies in the situation. * * * This conflict of interest is the rock, for shunning which the disability under consideration has obtained its force, by making the person who has one post entrusted to him incapable of acting on the other side, that he may not be seduced by temptation and opportunity from the duty of his trust.\nPour ces raisons, je crois que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 et le dispositif du jugement a quo confirm\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed, no costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaulieu, Gouin, Mercier & Tellier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hyde, Ahem, Perron, Puddicombe & Smith.\n[1] (1826) 5 B. & C. 125 at 131.\n[2] (1889) 22 Q.B.D. at 744, 748.\n[3] [1906] A.C. 378, at 380.\n[4] (1890) M.L.R. 6 S.C. 148.\n[5] (1890) M.L.R. 6 S.C. 148.\n[6] (1890) M.L.R. 6 S.E. 148; M.L.R. 5 S.E. 1.\n[7] (1854) 4 Grant\u2019s Ch.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario held against the claim for exemption; and refused special leave to appeal to this Court. The applicant then applied to this Court for special leave to appeal.\nHeld, This Court has jurisdiction to grant such leave, under s. 41 (c) of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35); and, in all the circumstances, leave should be granted.\nMOTION for special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal (taken by way of stated case) by the City of Ottawa, the present respondent, from the decision of Daly, Co.C.J., affirming the decision of the Court of Revision which, on assessment under the Ontario Assessment Act in respect of income received in 1932 by the present applicant as executor or trustee of each of several estates left by persons resident in Ontario, allowed an exemption of $1,500 in respect of the income payable to each beneficiary resident out of Ontario.\nW. Schroeder for the applicant.\nF.B.

Special leave to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal on May 8, 1934.\nThe matter in controversy between the parties is whether an executor and trustee of an estate in which part of the annual income is payable to persons residing out of Ontario is entitled to an exemption of $1,500 in respect of the income received by it on behalf of and payable to each beneficiary resident out of Ontario.\nLes Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice de Montr\u00e9al v. City of Montreal[2], was an exemption case. In it the jurisdiction of this Court was questioned on an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada, Appeal Side, in an action brought to recover $361.90, the amount of a special assessment for a drain along the property of the appellants. The respondent moved to quash on the ground that the matter in controversy was less than $2,000 and did not come within any of the exceptions of section 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. Section 29 (b) of the Act read as follows:\u2014\n29. No appeal shall lie under this Act from any judgment rendered in the province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, wherein the matter in controversy does not amount to the sum or value of two thousand dollars, unless such matter, if less than that amount,\u2014\n* * *\n(b) Relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nIt was held Per Curiam:\nThe case is appealable as coming within the words \u201csuch like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound\u201d in paragraph 6 of section 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act\u2014If the rate struck was found to be insufficient and another rate imposed, the parties would be bound by the judgment in this case.\nThe figure 6 in the report is obviously a clerical error. It should be the letter (b). There was no paragraph 6 in section 29. On the merits it was held that the appellants came within a statutory exemption and the appeal was allowed.\nWe think this case falls within subsection (c) of section 41 of the present Supreme Court Act.\nThere remains the question whether, there being jurisdiction, special leave should be granted. We are of opinion that, in all the circumstances, it should be granted.\nThe costs of this application will be costs in the cause in the appeal.\nMotion granted.\nSolicitors for the applicant: MacCraken, Fleming & Schroeder.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.B.

C.\nThe appellant was tried for the murder of her husband, convicted and sentenced to death, the indictment charging her with the administering of poison (arsenic). The conviction was affirmed by the appellate court, two judges dissenting. The grounds of dissent were based on misdirections by the trial judge in his charge to the jury on the two following matters. First: the Crown brought witnesses who testified to declarations made by the deceased, in the presence of the accused, four or five days before his death and nearly two weeks after the date of the alleged offence, such declarations being to the effect that he was dying from poison given to him by the accused. Counsel for the accused having objected to the admissibility of such evidence, the trial judge held that it could not be admitted \u201cas being a deposition ante mortem,\u201d but he allowed it \u201cas being a declaration made by the victim in presence of the accused.\u201d But, in his charge to the jury, the trial judge did not restrict himself to instruct the jury accordingly, and, treating these declarations by the deceased as being an important part of the evidence, he proceeded to make an analysis of same and emphasized the statement made by the deceased that he was going to die, and so to give more weight to the truthfulness of the latter\u2019s declarations that he had been poisoned by his wife. Secondly: the principal witness for the Crown was one G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard, brother of the accused. At the time of the trial he was serving a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment following a verdict of manslaughter on an indictment for the murder. He testified that the appellant came to his house and asked him if he had any poison, as she wanted to get rid of her husband, that she agreed to pay him $200; that he gave her some poison; that the appellant, seeing her husband ill but not yet dead, asked him for more poison and he gave it. At the request of counsel for the accused, the trial judge warned the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, although it was within their legal province so to do; but he added (translation): \u201c* * * to tell you to take the evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard as that of an accomplice, I am bound, at the request of the defence, to tell you that he was the aider and not the principal. To be an accomplice, it is necessary that there should be a principal, that another should have committed the crime. If it is absolutely desired that I say to the jurors to regard G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard as an accomplice in the present case, it would be necessary that the principal should be the accused. It is not possible to be the accomplice of one who does not exist. * * * He is not an ordinary accomplice. If he be the accomplice, he is the brother of the accused.\u201d\nHeld that the trial judge misdirected the jury upon each of the two grounds of appeal above mentioned and that those material misdirections were so grave as to necessitate a new trial, the Crown having failed to shew that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice did not occur owing to such misdirections. Section 1014 (2) Cr. C.\nHeld, also, that the declarations made by the deceased that he had been poisoned by his wife were not admissible as forming part of the res gestae. These declarations were made at the hospital nearly two weeks after the date of the alleged offence and four or five days before his death: therefore they were too much separated by time and circumstance from the actual commission of the alleged criminal act. These declarations should have been alluded to only in connection with the attitude of the accused.\nHeld, further (St. Germain J. ad hoc expressing no opinion), that the trial judge misdirected the jury in his remarks concerning the evidence of the brother of the accused, if considered as an accomplice. The trial judge after having set out to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, destroyed in effect by his subsequent remarks the warning given; some jurors may have in view of those remarks considered that the request of the defence was tantamount to an admission of guilt.\nPer Duff C.J. and Crocket J.\u2014The observations of the trial judge fall within the description \u201cmatters which ought not to have been submitted\u201d to the jury for consideration by them \u201cin aiming at their verdict.\u201d Makin v. A. G. for N.S.W. ([1894] A.C. 70).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the appellant, on her trial before Louis Cousineau J. and a jury, on a charge of murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed; the conviction was quashed, and a new trial ordered.\nAntoine Rivard K.C. and C\u00e9saire Gervais K.C. for the appellant.\nWilfrid Lazure K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Crockett J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014I concur with the conclusion of my brother Hughes and of Mr. Justice St. Germain. I agree with my brother Hughes that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury in the matter of the evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard, and that this misdirection in itself was so grave as to necessitate a new trial. I agree, moreover, with Mr. Justice St. Germain in what he says as to the statements alleged to have been made by the unfortunate deceased, Ludger Chapdelaine, in the presence of the accused.\nThe rule as to the admissibility of statements made in the presence of the accused is stated by Lord Atkinson in Rex v. Christie[1] in these words:\nAs to the second ground, the rule of law undoubtedly is that a statement made in the presence of an accused person even upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some explanation or denial from him, is not evidence against him of the facts stated save so far as he accepts the statement, so as to make it, in effect, his own. If he accepts the statement in part only, then to that extent alone does it become his statement. He may accept the statement by word or conduct, action or demeanour, and it is the function of the jury which tries the case to determine whether his words, actions, conduct, or demeanour at the time when a statement was made amounts to an acceptance of it in whole or in part. * * * Of course, if at the end of the case the presiding judge should be of opinion that no evidence has been given upon which the jury could reasonably find that the accused had accepted the statement so as to make it in whole or in part his own, the judge can instruct the jury to disregard the statement entirely. It is said that, despite this direction, grave injustice might be done to the accused, inasmuch as the jury, having once heard the statement, could not, or would not, rid their mind of it. It is, therefore, in the application of the rule that the difficulty arises. The question then is this: Is it to be taken as a rule of law that such a statement is not to be admitted in evidence until a foundation has been laid for its admission by proof of facts from which, in the opinion of the presiding judge, a jury might reasonably draw the inference that the \u2022accused had so accepted the statement as to make it in whole or in part his own, or is it to be laid down that the prosecutor is entitled to give the statement in evidence in the first instance, leaving it to the presiding judge, in case no such evidence as the above mentioned should be ultimately produced, to tell the jury to disregard the statement altogether?\nIn my view the former is not a rule of law, but it is, I think, a rule which, in the interest of justice, it might be most prudent and proper to follow as a rule of practice.\nThe practice indicated in the judgment of Pickford J. in Rex v. Norton[2] which Lord Atkinson says\n* * * where workable, would be quite unobjectionable in itself as a rule of practice, and equally effective for the protection of the accused,\nis explained by Mr. Justice Pickford in these words:\nThe fact of a statement having been made in the prisoner\u2019s presence may be given in evidence, but not the contents, and the question asked, what the prisoner said or did on such a statement being made. If his answer, given either by words or conduct, be such as to be evidence from which an acknowledgment may be inferred, then the contents of the statement may be given and the question of admission or not in fact left to the jury; if it be not evidence from which such an acknowledgment may be inferred, then the contents of the statement should be excluded. To allow the contents of such statements to be given before it is ascertained that there is evidence of their being acknowledged to be true must be most prejudicial to the prisoner, as, whatever directions be given to the jury, it is almost impossible for them to dismiss such evidence entirely from their minds. It is perhaps too wide to say that in no case can the statements be given in evidence when they are denied by the prisoner, as it is possible that a denial may be given under such circumstances and in such a manner as to constitute evidence from which an acknowledgment may be inferred, but, as above stated, we think they should be rejected unless there is some evidence of an acknowledgment of the truth. Where they are admitted we think the following is the proper direction to be given to the jury:\u2014That if they come to the conclusion that the prisoner had acknowledged the truth of the whole or any part of the facts stated they might take the statement, or so much of it as was acknowledged to be true (but no more), into consideration as evidence in the case generally, not because the statement standing alone afforded any evidence of the matter contained in it, but solely because of the prisoner\u2019s acknowledgment of its truth; but unless they found as a fact that there was such an acknowledgment they ought to disregard the statement altogether. It is desirable to emphasize what Lord Atkinson says. These observations cannot, except in so far as they relate c to the direction to the jury, now be regarded as laying down the law, but they may properly be regarded as outlining a practice which \u201cwhere workable\u201d is \u201cunobjectionable\u201d and may prove \u201ceffective for the protection of the accused.\u201d\nTo these observations it may be useful to add the following extract from the judgment of Lord Moulton at p. 559 of the same case[3]:\nThere remains the second ground, namely, that it is evidence of a statement made in the presence of the accused, and of his behaviour on that occasion. Now, in a civil action evidence may always be given of any statement or communication made to the opposite party, provided it is relevant to the issues. The same is true of any act or behaviour of the party. The sole limitation is that the matter thus given in evidence must be relevant. I am of opinion that, as a strict matter of law, there is no difference in this respect between the rules of evidence in our civil and in our criminal procedure. But there is a great difference in the practice. The law is so much on its guard against the accused being prejudiced by evidence which, though admissible, would probably have a prejudicial influence on the minds of the jury which would be out of proportion to its true evidential value, that there has grown up a practice of a very salutary nature, under which the judge intimates to the counsel for the prosecution that he should not press for the admission of evidence which would be open to this objection, and such an intimation from the tribunal trying the case is usually sufficient to prevent the evidence being pressed in all cases where the scruples of the tribunal in this respect are reasonable * * *\n* * * The evidential value of the occurrence depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that some one makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime cannot in itself have any value as evidence for or against him.\nIt is not seriously open to dispute that the learned trial judge\u2019s charge was calculated to convey to the jury the belief that they were entitled to weigh the evidential value of the statement as if the statement were evidence of the facts stated, apart from the behaviour of the prisoner. This was done, moreover, in a manner calculated to influence weightily the judgment of the jury in arriving at a verdict.\nI find myself quite unable to accept the contention made on behalf of the Crown that the appeal ought to be dismissed on the ground that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. To quote the language of the Lord Chancellor in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Makin v. A.G. for N.S.W.[4].\nTheir Lordships do not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them.\nThe matters discussed by the learned trial judge, already referred to, in dealing with the statements of the accused, plainly fall within the description \u201cmatters which ought not to have been submitted\u201d to the jury for consideration by them \u201cin arriving at their verdict.\u201d This applies also to the observations of the learned trial judge upon the evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard.\nIt is not within the province of this court to substitute itself for the jury in such cases.\nIt is, I think, desirable, since there is to be a new trial, that something should be said as to the principle governing the admissibility of dying declarations. Whether the conditions of admissibility are fulfilled is a question for the judge, and it is his duty to pass upon that question before admitting evidence of the statement alleged to have been made.\nFirst of all, he must determine the question whether or not the declarant at the time of the declaration entertained a settled, hopeless expectation that he was about to die almost immediately. Then, he must consider whether or not the statement would be evidence if the person making it were a witness. If it would not be so, it cannot properly be admitted as a dying declaration. Therefore, a declaration which is a mere accusation against the accused, or a mere expression of opinion, not founded on personal knowledge, as distinguished from a statement of fact, cannot be received.\nIn Rex v. Sellers, a decision pronounced in 1796, reported in 1828 in the third edition of Carrington\u2019s Supplement to the Criminal Law, it was laid down that,\nNothing can be evidence in a declaration in articulo mortis that would not be so if the party were sworn. Therefore, anything the murdered person, in articulo mortis, says as to facts, is receivable, but not what he says as matter of opinion.\nThat this statement of the law governs the practice to-day is evidenced by the fact, that it is found in the leading current textbooks on criminal law, Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., p. 1930; Archbold, Criminal Evidence, 28th ed., 392; Roscoe, Criminal Evidence, 15th ed., 31; Wills, Evidence, 2nd ed., 197. In the section of Lord Hailsham\u2019s edition of Lord Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England devoted to the criminal law (9 Hals. 452) it is reproduced almost ipsissimis verbis. The authors of that section are Mr. Justice Avory, Sir Archibald Bodkin and Mr. R. E. Ross.\nIf alleged ante mortem declarations of Ludger Chapdelaine are tendered as such during the course of the new trial, it will be the duty of the judge to consider and decide, before permetting evidence of them to go before the jury, whether or not these conditions have been satisfied.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial should be ordered.\nCannon J.\u2014I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that the learned trial judge erred in matters of substance with respect to the declarations of the deceased in the hospital, in the presence of the accused, and also in his presentation to the jury of the appellant\u2019s position if G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bouchard\u2019s evidence was to be considered as that of an accomplice. But I have pondered with grave anxiety over paragraph 2 of article 1014 of the Criminal Code which would allow this court to dismiss the appeal and avoid a third trial if, notwithstanding our opinion on the above grounds, we were also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. I cannot, however, reach the conviction, to use the language of Lord He wart, C.J. re Jones alias Wright[5], that, without these irregularities in the trial, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict of guilty against the accused.\nIt is impossible for us to enter into a speculation about what the jury might, could, would or should have done, and as we do not feel able to say that they must \u201cinevitably\u201d have come to the conclusion to which they did come, in the absence of the material improperly admitted,\nthe conviction must be quashed and a new trial ordered.\nHughes J.\u2014The appellant was tried before Mr. Justice Louis Cousineau and a jury at Sherbrooke, Quebec, January, 1934, on the following indictment:\u2014\nA East Angus, dans le district de St. Fran\u00e7ois, dame B\u00e9atrice Bernard a assassin\u00e9 son mari, Ludger Chapdelaine, dans les circonstances suivantes, savoir: en faisant prendre, le ou vers 1e 15\u00e8me jour de f\u00e9vrier 1932, au dit Ludger Chapdelaine, malicieusement et dans le but de l\u2019empoisonner, un poison violent, savoir de l\u2019arsenic, qu\u2019elle m\u00eala \u00e0 son breuvage, lors de son repas, le tout \u00e0 l\u2019insu du dit Ludger Chapdelaine, et ce dernier mourut le 6 mars 1932, \u00e0 Sherbrooke, dit district, des suites du dit empoisonnement, la dite dame B\u00e9atrice Bernard commettant par l\u00e0 un meurtre.\nThe accused was convicted and sentenced to death.\nThe accused appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side. The appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment, Chief Justice Sir Mathias Tellier and Mr. Justice St. Jacques dissenting.\nFrom the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, the accused now appeals to this Court.\nThe grounds of dissent as set out in the formal judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, are as follows:\nSir Mathias Tellier et M. le Juge St-Jacques sont dissidents, parce que, suivant eux, le verdict est vici\u00e9 par suite de la preuve ill\u00e9gale admise au dossier, comme celle des d\u00e9clarations du d\u00e9funt Ludger Chapdelaine et par suite de la direction ill\u00e9gale et injuste donn\u00e9e au jury, et que, dans ces conditions, il est impossible de dire que, sans ces ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s, le verdict du jury aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame.\nThe notes of the Chief Justice and those of Mr. Justice St. Jacques both shewed that the misdirection above referred to concerned the declarations of the deceased and also concerned the evidence, as an accomplice, of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard, a brother of the appellant.\nThe declarations of the deceased, both as to admissibility and direction, may first be taken up. It is not in dispute that the deceased, on or about February 17, 1932, felt ill about two hours after he had eaten some tomato soup prepared by the appellant, the remains of a can opened by the deceased the day before. At first he thought it was indigestion and had the doctor treat him. On February 23, the patient was removed by the doctor to St. Vincent de Paul Hospital at Sherbrooke. He died there on Sunday, March 6, 1932.\nWhen, at the trial, Josephine Chapdelaine Brault, sister of the deceased, was testifying to a statement made by the deceased in the presence of the appellant the Tuesday or Wednesday before his death, the Crown counsel endeavoured to lay a foundation for the admission of the evidence as an ante mortem statement. The defence counsel objected, and the learned trial judge said:\u2014\nJe ne l\u2019accepterai pas comme une d\u00e9position ante mortem, mais comme une d\u00e9claration ordinaire formant partie du res gestae en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019accus\u00e9e.\nThe learned judge added:\u2014\nJe ne permets pas la preuve comme \u00e9tant une d\u00e9position ante mortem, mais je la permets comme \u00e9tant une d\u00e9claration faite par la victime en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019accus\u00e9e. The witness had, before the objection, testified that the deceased had said, in his wife\u2019s presence: \u201cC\u2019est toi qui m\u2019as empoisonn\u00e9; tu le sais.\u201d After the learned judge\u2019s ruling, the witness added that the deceased had also said that the appellant would appear in court and would be hanged for it. The witness further testified that the appellant appeared indifferent and did not reply at all. In cross-examination the witness said the deceased had not spoken that way previously. The witness said to the deceased that she should not say such things, but the deceased replied: \u201cOui, ma tante, c\u2019est elle qui m\u2019a empoisonn\u00e9.\u201d He further said:\nJe pense que je vais mourir parce que je suis empoisonn\u00e9; c\u2019est de la soupe que j\u2019ai mang\u00e9e * * * Oui, ma tante, c\u2019est elle qui m\u2019a empoisonn\u00e9 avec la soupe qu\u2019elle m\u2019a donn\u00e9e.\nNapol\u00e9on Brault, a cousin of the deceased, testified that he had been at the hospital to see the deceased the Sunday before he died and also on the Wednesday or Thursday before his death. He was asked by the Crown counsel if the deceased had spoken in the presence of the appellant of what had happened to him. The defence counsel objected to the admission of the statement of the deceased as a dying declaration. The learned trial judge then ruled:\u2014\nJe suis de votre opinion. Mais je ne la prends pas comme \u00e7a. Je la prends comme une d\u00e9claration faite en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019accus\u00e9e et comme faisant partie du res gestae, et je la permets.\nThe witness then testified that on the Wednesday or Thursday the accused had said in the appellant\u2019s presence: \u201cC\u2019est elle qui m\u2019a empoisonn\u00e9\u201d. The appellant did not say anything in reply.\nElie Chapdelaine, a brother of the deceased, testified that he had gone to the hospital five or six times to see the deceased and that he had met the appellant there on almost every occasion. The Crown counsel asked the witness whether the deceased, during the last days, had spoken of his dying condition, and what he had said. The defence counsel objected to the admissibility of the evidence as a dying declaration. The learned trial judge then ruled as follows:\nJe suis de cette opinion l\u00e0. Mais je ne la prends pas comme telle. C\u2019est la d\u00e9claration de la victime qu\u2019il faut interpr\u00e9ter et non pas l\u2019opinion du t\u00e9moin; ce n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9claration ante mortem, mais \u00e7a fait partie du res gestae. Ensuite \u00e7a ne regarde pas l\u2019opinion du t\u00e9moin, \u00e7a regarde la d\u00e9claration de la victime elle m\u00eame et elle fait partie du res gestae. Je permets la preuve. The defence counsel then objected to the admission of the evidence as part of the res gestae. On this objection the learned trial judge ruled as follows:\nJe rends toujours le m\u00eame d\u00e9cision et pour les m\u00eames raisons.\nThe witness then testified that the deceased had, on the Wednesday or Thursday before his death, said, in his wife\u2019s presence: \u201cJe suis empoisonn\u00e9, je vais mourrir; c\u2019est elle B\u00e9atrice qui m\u2019a empoisonn\u00e9.\u201d The witness was asked what attitude the appellant had taken to this statement and replied that the appellant had smiled and, to change the subject, had said to the witness: \u201cTa femme est bien?\u201d Previously the deceased had always told the witness that he was ill of indigestion from eating soup which the appellant had prepared from the balance of a can opened by the deceased the day before his first illness.\nRaoul Gosselin, also a Crown witness, testified that he was a hospital attendant. He was asked by the Crown counsel if he had heard what the deceased had said to the appellant about his illness and about poison. He replied that he had heard it on two occasions. The defence counsel objected to the admission of the evidence as a dying declaration or as part of the res gestae. The learned trial judge ruled:\nL\u2019objection est renvoy\u00e9e parce que toute d\u00e9claration ainsi faite ne serait pas prise comme d\u00e9claration ante mortem faite par la victime, mais comme d\u00e9claration de la victime en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019accus\u00e9e faisant partie du res gestae.\nThe witness then testified that the deceased had said in the presence of the appellant:\nTu peux sortir ma maudite hypocrite, c\u2019est toi qui m\u2019a empoisonn\u00e9, et tu viens ici m\u2019en faire acroire.\nThe witness did not remember any reply by the appellant. The witness added that the deceased had been delirious almost continually for three or four days before he died. From the arrival of the deceased at the hospital he had been delirious at times.\nDealing with the declarations of the deceased the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:\nMaintenant, il y a pour moi la partie la plus importante, quoiqu\u2019on en dise. Ce sont les d\u00e9clarations de la victime \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Voici un homme qui dit \u00e0 tout le monde qu\u2019il va mourir, qu\u2019il est empoisonn\u00e9, en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019accus\u00e9e; elle est l\u00e0, elle est l\u00e0 tout le temps. Il ne dit rien les premiers jours.\n* * *\nDans les premiers jours il ne dit rien; il ne sait pas encore; mais c\u2019est quand il est rendu \u00e0 h\u00f4pital et puis que sa maladie augmente tout le temps qu\u2019il parle. C\u2019est \u00e0 vous autres \u00e0 vous demander:\u2014Est-ce que c\u2019est en pleine sant\u00e9, se voyant dispara\u00eetre tout \u00e0 coup, sachant qu\u2019il est empoisonn\u00e9, et qu\u2019il est empoisonn\u00e9, d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa conviction, par sa femme, croyez-vous qu\u2019il est bien naturel qu\u2019il ne se soit pas tu alors? Tous les m\u00e9decins de l\u2019h\u00f4pital disent qu\u2019il d\u00e9lirait par moment; tous ceux qui l\u2019ont vu disent qu\u2019en les voyant entrer il les reconnaissait. M\u00eame ceux qui disent, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fense, qu\u2019ils y sont all\u00e9s et qu\u2019il a jamais parl\u00e9 de rien, qu\u2019ils ont jamais cr\u00fb qu\u2019il \u00e9tait empoisonn\u00e9, ne disent pas qu\u2019il d\u00e9lirait dans ce temps l\u00e0. Il avait toute sa connaissance et souffrait. Maintenant quel int\u00e9r\u00eat avait-il d\u2019affirmer, de venir dire \u00e7a? Quel int\u00e9r\u00eat aurait cette dame Brault, sa tante. Elle a rendu un t\u00e9moignage, si je pouvais me servir d\u2019une expression connue, de sainte femme, sans aucune malice, au contraire. Et quand le savant procureur de la d\u00e9fense lui demande si l\u2019accus\u00e9e a protest\u00e9 contre les accusations du mari, elle dit:\u2014Non, elle n\u2019a pas protest\u00e9; c\u2019est moi qui ai dit:\u2014Ne parle donc pas comme \u00e7a.\u2014Et elle dit sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 lui:\u2014C\u2019est vrai ma tante, c\u2019est vrai ma tante.\u2014Il d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle l\u2019a empoisonn\u00e9; et puis m\u00eame il demande \u00e0 son ami de la sortir et il la traite d\u2019hypocrite. Tous ces t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus. C\u2019\u00e9tait le mercredi ou le jeudi; c\u2019\u00e9tait quatre ou cinq jours avant sa mort, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore entr\u00e9 dans le coma. Alors voici des d\u00e9clarations excessivement s\u00e9rieuses d\u2019un homme, quand m\u00eame \u00e7a ne serait pas une d\u00e9position ante mortem, mais qui d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il sait qu\u2019il va mourir. Vous aurez \u00e0 vous demander: quel int\u00e9r\u00eat Ludger Chapdelaine avait-il d\u2019accuser sa femme, puisque la d\u00e9fense reconna\u00eet qu\u2019ils vivaient bien et \u00e9taient heureux tous les deux. Si encore on avait prouv\u00e9 une animosit\u00e9; s\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 s\u00e9par\u00e9s, d\u00e9test\u00e9s. S\u2019il y a eu une preuve de faite c\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre l\u2019accus\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle n\u2019aimait pas son mari. Toute la d\u00e9fense a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait un m\u00e9nage mod\u00e8le, c\u2019est son expression, elle a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun conflit entre les deux.\nVous devez vous demander si un homme qui a son bon sens,\u2014d\u2019apr\u00e8s tous les t\u00e9moins,\u2014l\u2019infirmier a dit:\u2014Pour moi il \u00e9tait absolument normal,\u2014et les r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 sa tante au moment o\u00f9 elle a dit:\u2014Ne parle pas comme \u00e7a.\u2014C\u2019est vrai ma tante, ce n\u2019est pas une r\u00e9ponse d\u2019un homme qui d\u00e9lire. Vous \u00eates oblig\u00e9s de vous demander, dans vos d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, quel int\u00e9r\u00eat avait-il d\u2019accuser sa femme plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un autre? pourquoi? Enfin il disait qu\u2019il croyait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait empoisonn\u00e9, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pour mourir.\u2014Je vais mourir, je meurs empoisonn\u00e9; sortez moi cette hypocrite; je ne veux pas la voir; elle essaie de m\u2019en faire accroire.\u2014 Il disait qu\u2019il allait mourrir et de fait il est mort.\nIt is clear that the declarations of the deceased above referred to were not admissible as forming part of the res gestae. They were made at the hospital within a week or thereabouts of the death of the deceased and consequently long after the commencement of the illness of the deceased They were, as Lord Atkinson said, in Rex v. Christie[6], so separated by time and circumstance from the actual commission of the alleged criminal act that they were not admissible as part of the res gestae. The Crown contended, however, that, if not admissible as part of the res gestae, the declarations were admissible statements made in the presence and hearing of the accused under such circumstances that she might reasonably have been expected to have made some answer or done something in repudiation thereof. Gilbert v. The King[7]. Hubin v. The King[8]. The appellant, on the other hand, contended that the statements were mere opinions and therefore inadmissible, but, assuming that the declarations were admissible as the Crown contended, the learned trial judge did not explain to the jury that the statements made in the presence of the appellant, even upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some explanation or denial from her, were not evidence against her of the facts, if any, stated save so far as she accepted the statements or part thereof, so as to make them or part thereof, in effect, her own, and that the evidential value of the statements depended on her behaviour in response thereto. The King v. Christie[9].\nThe Crown further contended that the declarations were admissible as dying declarations in any event and that the learned trial judge sufficiently charged the jury. But the learned trial judge refused to admit them as dying declarations and, in view of the disposition that I think must be made of this appeal on the next ground, it is not necessary to discuss them here in that light.\nWe now come to the evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard. This witness, at the trial, testified that he was then serving a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment at St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary following a verdict of manslaughter on an indictment for the murder of the same deceased, Ludger Chapdelaine. He testified that during the winter of 1932, he lived at Bishop Crossing, seven or seven and one-half miles from East Angus where the deceased and the appellant lived. On \u201cSamedi gras\u201d the latter came to his house and asked him if he had any poison for the purpose of poisoning her husband, as she wanted to be rid of him. She told him that she would pay him $100. He asked $300 and she said that she would give $200. He set out for East Angus on the evening train. On Sunday morning he returned home. On Monday he went back to East Angus. That evening he gave her some poison which he had brought in an envelope and which he had taken from a little bottle in his own barn. He had purchased it for his horses. Before that the appellant had written him a letter asking for poison but the witness had thrown it in the stove. On February 21, he received another letter, containing one dollar, which he took home and which his wife read. The letter was as follows: \u201cTu viendras \u00e0 East Angus. Tu sais pourquoi.\u201d That evening he went to East Angus. Ludger Chapdelaine was ill. The appellant said to the witness:\nJe lui en ai donn\u00e9, je pensais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pour mourir et il n\u2019est pas mort. Tu vas m\u2019en donner encore.\nThe deceased was complaining of sickness at the stomach and said he was going to die. The following morning, the appellant said to the witness: \u201cTu vas m\u2019en envoyer, tu m\u2019en enverras, j\u2019en ai plus.\u201d That evening she put in his pocket an envelope addressed to her at East Angus. In the morning when he arrived home, he put the balance of the poison from the bottle into the letter and sent it to her. After the death he asked her twice for the hundred dollars she had promised him. The Crown counsel then asked the witness:\nMonsieur Bernard, le vingt-deux, lorsque vous avez r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 sa lettre et que vous \u00eates all\u00e9 \u00e0 East Angus, qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 entre vous et elle?\nTo the question the defence counsel objected. The learned trial judge ruled, \u201cJe permets la question.\u201d The Crown counsel then asked the witness if he had talked with the appellant and the witness answered,\nOui, j\u2019ai caus\u00e9 avec elle quand je suis all\u00e9 chez elle; j\u2019ai caus\u00e9 avec elle et j\u2019ai eu des relations avec elle une fois. C\u2019est \u00e7a que vous voulez savoir, je vais vous le dire.\nThe Crown counsel then asked if that occurred on the trip of the 6th or on the trip of the 21st, and the witness answered that it was on February 8. In cross-examination the witness was asked about a statement in writing previously made by him in which he had said that his wife had heard the appellant say that she wanted poison to get rid of her husband, and that his wife had said to make her pay dearly, to ask two hundred dollars. To this question, he answered: \u201cJe peux assermenter que non.\u201d The witness also in cross-examination was asked the following questions and made the following answers:\nEt puis, qu\u2019un nomm\u00e9 Gagn\u00e9 le savait lui aussi; votre homme engag\u00e9, Oliva Gagn\u00e9? Je vous demandais, Monsieur Bernard, \u00e0 la prison, avant votre proc\u00e8s, si ce que vous aviez dit aux d\u00e9tectives, les d\u00e9clarations aux d\u00e9tectives si c\u2019\u00e9tait vrai, et vous avez dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait tout de travers, que l\u2019arsenic, vous n\u2019en aviez pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 votre s\u0153ur, que vous aviez tout donn\u00e9 \u00e0 vos chevaux, et que Oliva Gagn\u00e9 savait \u00e7a?\u2014R. Monsieur Gagn\u00e9 a travaill\u00e9 pour moi dans l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQ. Je vous demande si vous m\u2019avez dit \u00e7a d\u00e9j\u00e0?\u2014R. Oui, je vous l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit.\nIntroducing and speaking of the evidence of this witness, the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:\nMaintenant, venons en aux faits. C\u2019est l\u00e0 dessus que je dois traiter de la question du complice.\nS\u2019il n\u2019y avait que les sympt\u00f4mes trouv\u00e9s par les m\u00e9decins tant durant la maladie de Chapdelaine que les sympt\u00f4mes trouv\u00e9s apr\u00e8s sa mort, je dirais que la Couronne n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de faire la preuve compl\u00e8te de l\u2019accusation port\u00e9e contre l\u2019accus\u00e9e. Mais il y a d\u2019autres preuves et la Couronne a essay\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer, a li\u00e9, par des faits ant\u00e9rieurs, la maladie soufferte par Chapdelaine qui a amen\u00e9 sa mort.\nLe principal t\u00e9moin c\u2019est G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard. C\u2019est un complice * * * Vous devez prendre le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un complice, pour me servir d\u2019une expression assez connue, avec un grain de sel. Vous devez le prendre avec beaucoup de pr\u00e9caution, malgr\u00e9 que vous ayez le droit de consid\u00e9rer ce t\u00e9moignage, celui du complice, sans corroboration. Vous avez droit de le croire, mais il doit \u00eatre support\u00e9, d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, pour que, dans une accusation aussi s\u00e9rieuse que celle-ci, vous deviez le prendre en consid\u00e9ration * * *\nDans les circonstances je ne crois pas que vous ayez de doute que G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard \u00e9tait un complice, parce qu\u2019il a subi son proc\u00e8s sur la m\u00eame offense et a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq ans de p\u00e9nitencier, qu\u2019il purge \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle. Mais la question pr\u00e9sente un c\u00f4t\u00e9 assez s\u00e9rieux au point de vue des pr\u00e9cautions que vous devez prendre, avant de prendre son t\u00e9moignage, surtout dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Il y a un caract\u00e8re absolument particulier qui se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause sp\u00e9cialement, qui n\u2019est pas dans une autre cause. Pour que G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard soit complice, soit l\u2019aide de quelqu\u2019un qui a commis un meurtre ou un crime, il faut qu\u2019il y ait un crime. La d\u00e9fense me demande de vous dire de prendre le t\u00e9moignage de G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard avec beaucoup de pr\u00e9caution parce qu\u2019il est complice dans la mort de Ludger Chapdelaine; on me dit de vous demander de prendre son t\u00e9moignage avec beaucoup de pr\u00e9caution, parce que si on a tu\u00e9 par le poison, l\u2019arsenic, Ludger Chapdelaine, G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard y a particip\u00e9.\nDonc, pour que je vous dise de prendre le t\u00e9moignage de G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard comme complice, je suis oblig\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande de la d\u00e9fense, de vous dire qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019aide et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le principal auteur. Pour \u00eatre le complice de quelqu\u2019un il faut un auteur, il faut qu\u2019un autre commette le crime. Si on veut absolument que je dise aux jur\u00e9s de reconna\u00eetre G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard comme complice dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il faudrait que le principal acteur soit l\u2019accus\u00e9e. Il ne peut pas \u00eatre le complice de quelqu\u2019un qui n\u2019existe pas. Il faut que le meurtre ait exist\u00e9 pour que je vous demande de le consid\u00e9rer comme complice, et dans ce cas, prenez son t\u00e9moignage avec beaucoup de pr\u00e9caution. Mais s\u2019il est vrai, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9tentions de la d\u00e9fense, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de meurtre, que Ludger Chapdelaine est mort de mort naturelle et non de mort violente par ars\u00e9nic, il n\u2019est plus le complice; c\u2019est un t\u00e9moignage ind\u00e9pendant qui n\u2019aurait aucun d\u00e9faut, et que vous seriez oblig\u00e9s de prendre en entier. L\u2019un ou l\u2019autre, ou il est le complice ou il ne l\u2019est pas. S\u2019il est complice il est complice de l\u2019accus\u00e9e et le meurtre a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. S\u2019il n\u2019est pas le complice, c\u2019est un t\u00e9moin absolument impartial et vous devez le prendre en entier. Je ne sais pas si je m\u2019exprime assez clairement pour vous d\u00e9montrer dans quelle position assez embarrassante au point de vue de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du complice vous \u00eates. Alors, s\u2019il est le complice, prenez le avec pr\u00e9caution. En dehors de \u00e7a je suis oblig\u00e9 de vous dire: ce n\u2019est pas un complice ordinaire, s\u2019il est le complice, c\u2019est le fr\u00e8re de l\u2019accus\u00e9e.\nIl est en preuve qu\u2019il n\u2019y a jamais eu aucune animosit\u00e9 entre l\u2019accus\u00e9e et G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard; il est en preuve qu\u2019ils se visitaient. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rien qu\u2019un fr\u00e8re, c\u2019\u00e9tait un ami, et un ami tr\u00e8s intime. C\u2019est en preuve. On n\u2019a pas amen\u00e9 dans cette cause qu\u2019il y avait une rancune quelconque existant entre les deux. G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard est condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 cinq ans de p\u00e9nitencier; il ne peut pas \u00eatre touch\u00e9 de nouveau sur la m\u00eame accusation. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable et c\u2019est fini. Quand m\u00eame on d\u00e9couvrirait aujourd\u2019hui qu\u2019il est l\u2019acteur principal, on ne peut pas le mettre en accusation. Quel int\u00e9r\u00eat le complice aurait-il \u00e0 venir rendre t\u00e9moignage? Quel int\u00e9r\u00eat avait-il? Vous pouvez vous demander \u00e7a. La vengeance? Ca n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9. Au contraire, c\u2019est de l\u2019amiti\u00e9 qu\u2019on vous a d\u00e9montr\u00e9e entre les deux. Ils ont eu un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, au point de vue du meurtre, mais aujourd\u2019hui il n\u2019y en a plus; il n\u2019y a aucun danger pour lui de parler. Quant aux promesses qu\u2019il aurait pu recevoir pour rendre son t\u00e9moignage, o\u00f9 en est la preuve? Aucune * * * vous devez vous demander toutes ces questions. C\u2019est en analysant toutes les attitudes de G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard depuis le commencement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui que vous aurez la v\u00e9ritable interpr\u00e9tation de son t\u00e9moignage.\nIn Vigeant v. The King[10], a new trial was ordered by this Court where the trial judge had omitted to instruct the jury on what was an accomplice in law and to warn them of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice although it was within their legal province so to do. This rule applies whether there is or is not corroborative evidence of the testimony of the accomplice. Boulianne v. The King[11]. In the case at bar the learned trial judge appeared to have set out to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard, but he destroyed, in effect, by the subsequent remarks, particularly those beginning with the words \u201cMais la question * * *\u201d and ending with the words \u201c* * * de l\u2019accus\u00e9e,\u201d the warning given. Some jurors may have, in view of those remarks, considered that the request of the defence was tantamount to an admission of guilt.\nBut the Crown alleges that, if there was misdirection, in respect of the declarations of the deceased or in respect of the evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard or both, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice actually occurred and that there should not be a new trial, Criminal Code, section 1014 (2), particularly as there was ample other evidence of guilt. Boulianne v. The King[12]. It is not possible in the case at bar to say to what extent the jury or some of the jurors were materially prejudiced against the appellant by the misdirection concerning the evidence of G\u00e9d\u00e9on Bernard alone, but it is clear that there was material misdirection. Allen v. The King[13]. Where the jury has been misdirected on a material matter, the onus is upon the Crown to shew that the jury, charged as they should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have given on the evidence a verdict other than one of guilt. Brooks v. The King[14]. The Crown has failed to shew this.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nSt-Germain J. ad hoc: Regarding the admission of the declarations made by Ludger Chapdelaine, at the hospital, and narrated by some of the Crown witnesses, as evidence in the case, I am of the opinion that these declarations were rightly rejected by the learned trial judge as \u201cdying declarations.\u201d In making these declarations, Chapdelaine was merely expressing the opinion that he had been poisoned by his wife and was not asserting a statement of fact. Had Chapdelaine been able to testify himself at the trial, such declarations would not have been allowed. In a case of Rex v. Sellers, reported in Carrington\u2019s Treatises on the Criminal Law, p. 233, it was decided that:\nNothing can be evidence in a declaration in articulo mortis that would not be so if the party were sworn. Therefore, anything the murdered person, in articulo mortis, says as to facts, is receivable, but not what he says as matter of opinion.\nThese declarations, however, though rejected as \u201cdying declarations,\u201d were admitted as res gestae. Here again I must come to the conclusion that said declarations should have also, as such, been rejected, first, for the very same reason above mentioned as to \u201cdying declarations,\u201d and, secondly, for the further reason that, having been made several days after the date on which the appellant was accused of having given poison to her husband, said declarations did not \u201cconstitute or accompany and explain, the fact or transaction in issue\u201d and therefore were not admissible \u201cas forming parts of the res gesta\u201d; (Phipson, 7th Ed., p. 54).\nThese declarations could only have been admitted to prove the accused\u2019s attitude or answers and, thereby, allow the jurors to draw their own conclusions as to such attitude and answers of the accused. Unfortunately, the learned trial judge in his charge did not restrict himself to instruct the jury accordingly; on the contrary, treating said declarations as the most important part of the evidence, he proceeded to make an analysis of same and emphasized the statement made by Ludger Chapdelaine that he was going to die, and so to give more weight to the truthfulness of the latter\u2019s declarations that he had been poisoned by his wife.\nMaintenant, il y a pour moi la partie la plus importante, quoiqu\u2019on en dise. Ce sont les d\u00e9clarations de la victime \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Voici un homme qui dit \u00e0 tout le monde qu\u2019il va mourir, qu\u2019il est empoisonn\u00e9, en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019accus\u00e9e; * * *\nEst-ce que c\u2019est bien naturel pour un homme de trente ans encore en pleine sant\u00e9, se voyant dispara\u00eetre tout \u00e0 coup, sachant qu\u2019il est empoisonn\u00e9, et qu\u2019il est empoisonn\u00e9, d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa conviction, par sa femme, croyez-vous qu\u2019il est bien naturel qu\u2019il ne se soit pas tu alors? * * *\nMaintenant quel int\u00e9r\u00eat avait-il d\u2019affirmer, de venir dire \u00e7a? * * *\nAlors voici des d\u00e9clarations excessivement s\u00e9rieuses d\u2019un homme, quand m\u00eame \u00e7a ne serait pas une d\u00e9position ante mortem, mais qui d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il sait qu\u2019il va mourir. Vous aurez \u00e0 vous demander: Quel int\u00e9r\u00eat Ludger Chapdelaine avait-il d\u2019accuser sa femme, puisque la d\u00e9fense reconna\u00eet qu\u2019ils vivaient bien et \u00e9taient heureux tous les deux * * *\nThus by his remarks the learned trial judge invites the jurors to consider as the most important part of the evidence the declarations of the deceased, while they should have been alluded to only in connection with the attitude of the accused. These declarations as commented were surely illegal evidence submitted to the jury.\nHaving reached that conclusion, even after the reading of the whole evidence, in view of the decisions of Allen v. The King[15], and Gouin v. The King[16], I cannot but conclude that the appeal must be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nSeeing my conclusion on the first ground raised by the appellant, I need not express any opinion with regard to the second ground as to the comments of the learned trial judge concerning the accomplice.\nAppeal allowed, new trial ordered.\n[1] [1914] A.C. 545 at 554.\n[2] [1910] 2 K.B. 496, at 500.\n[3] [1910] 2 K.B. 496.\n[4] [1894] A.C. 57 at 70.\n[5] (1922) 16 Cr.

In 1928, the Pioneer Gold Mines of B.C. Limited was incorporated with a capital stock of $2,500,000 divided into 2,500,000 shares of $1 each. On March 30, 1928, Sloan assigned to the new company his option for 1,600,000 shares in that company. The Income Tax Act of British Columbia (Statutes of 1932, c. 53, s. 6) enables the Commissioner of Income Tax to make certain deductions from a mine owner's income on account of depletion of the mines, thus involving the fixing of the costs to the taxpayer of the acquisition of the mines. The Commissioner of Income Tax fixed the acquisition costs to the new company at $100,000. The new company appealed to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under section 44, subsection 4, of the Taxation Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 254) as amended, from the decision of the Minister of Finance, under clause (p) of subs. 1 and and clause (a) of subs. 3 of section 44, fixing the acquisition costs \" at too low figure of $100,000 instead of $2,500,000 for the purpose of assessment of the company's income for the year ending March 31, 1931.\" The appeal was disposed of by an Order in Council, increasing the amount from $100,000 to $200,000. The new company, being still dissatisfied, obtained a writ of mandamus from D. A. McDonald, J., commanding the Minister of Finance to ascertain and take into consideration the acquisition costs to the new company of the properties acquired by it under the above agreement of March 30, 1928. Subsection 4 of section 6 of the Income Tax Act provides that \" an appeal from any decision of the Minister (of Finance) *** may be taken to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, who after hearing the parties interested, may either confirm or amend the decision of the Minister and the decision of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall be final.\" The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of McDonald, J.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (48 B.C. Rep. 412), that mandamus did not lie in this case. Under section 6 (4) of the Income Tax Act, the decision by the Minister of Finance was appealable; a competent appeal was taken from it; the appeal was considered by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in the exercise of his statutory jurisdiction and powers, who pronounced a decision upon the matters in dispute which the Act declares to be final. Such decision was binding upon the Minister of Finance as well as upon the appellant company; and a mandamus requiring him to reconsider questions settled by the Order in Council would have been a mandamus requiring him several months after he became functus officio, to commit a breach of the law and to perform an act which, by force of the statute, must necessarily be inoperative.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , reversing the judgment of D. A. McDonald J. granting an order absolute for mandamus.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions of issue are fully stated in the above head note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Clark K.C. for the appellant.\nC. W. Craig K.C. and E. Pepler for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret J. was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014Thanks to the complete and accurate statement of the facts contained in the judgment of my brother Hughes, I shall be able to state, without undue length, the grounds on which I think this appeal should be decided. On the 22nd of January, 1932, the appellant served notice of appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under section 44, subsection 4, of the Taxation Act, from the decision or determination of the Minister of Finance under clause (p) of subsection 1, and clause (a) of subsection 3 of section 6 (as the section is now numbered) of the Taxation Act, which notice is in these terms:\nPioneer Gold Mines of B.C. Limited (N.P.L.), a body corporate, having its head office at 605 Rogers building, Vancouver, B.C. hereby appeals to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under section 44, subsection 4 of the Taxation Act, from the decision or determination of the Minister of Finance under clause (p) of subsection 1, and clause (a) of subsection 3 of section 44 of the Taxation Act, fixing the cost to this company of its mine and mining property at the too low figure of $100,000 instead of $2,500,000 for the purpose of assessment of the company's income for the year ending 31st March, 1931, as set out in notice of assessment by the assessor of Vancouver district mailed 30th December, 1931, and failing to make a sufficient allowance for depletion or exhaustion of the mine to be deducted from the income from the mine for the year ending 31st March, 1931.\nThe above mentioned appeal to be heard at such time and place as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall appoint.\nDated at Vancouver, B.C., this 22nd day of January, 1932. A second notice of appeal was served on the 9th August, 1932, by which, for the figure of $2,500,000 in the notice of January, there was substituted that of $2,378,120.09.\nThe appeal was disposed of by an order in council dated the 28th July, 1933, by increasing the amount determined as the total cost of the mine from $100,000 to $200,000, and increasing the allowance for depletion or exhaustion accordingly. The order in council is as follows:\nApproved and ordered this 28th day of July, A.D. 1933.\nIn the matter of an appeal by Pioneer Gold Mines of B.C. Limited (non personal liability) to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under section 44(4) of the Taxation Act.\nThe undersigned has the honour to report\nThat an assessment for income tax was made against the above mentioned company under the Taxation Act in respect of the income of the company for its fiscal year ending the 31st day of March, 1931, in the sum of $3,556.23, and notice of assessment thereof was mailed to the company on the 30th day of December, 1931.\nAnd that in arriving at the said assessment the undersigned as Minister of Finance allowed the company the sum of $14,665.87 for depletion or exhaustion of the mine pursuant to clause (p) of subsection (1) of section 44 of the Taxation Act, and that this sum was based on a total cost of the mine of $100,000 as determined by the Minister of Finance pursuant to subsection (3) of said section 44.\nAnd that, with the exception of this sum of $14,665.87, the total cost so determined by the Minister had already been allowed as a deduction from the income of preceding years, and accordingly no further allowance by way of depletion remained to be made during the balance of the anticipated life of the mine subsequent to the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1931.\nAnd that the company appealed to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council from the decision of the Minister of Finance by notice of appeal dated the 22nd day of January, 1932, on the grounds that the cost to the company of its mine and mining property was fixed at the too low figure of $100,000 instead of $2,500,000, and that a sufficient allowance for depletion or exhaustion of the mine was not made in the said assessment.\nAnd that on the 9th day of August, 1932, the company filed a further notice of appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council from the decision of the Minister as aforesaid on the same grounds as set forth in the previous notice except that it was stated therein the cost to the company for the purposes of the said assessment should have been fixed at $2,378,120.09 instead of $100,000.\nAnd that the appeal came on for hearing on various days and dates in the months of April and May, 1933, and that the case for the company was fully presented by J. A. Clark, Esq., K.C., counsel on behalf of the company and the case for the Government by the departmental solicitor and the Commissioner of Income Tax, and the appeal was stood over for decision.\nThe undersigned has therefore the honour to recommend:\u2014\n1. That under the authority of subsection (4) of section 44 of the Taxation Act the appeal of the company be allowed in part, and that the total cost of the mine as determined by the Minister at $100,000, be increased to the sum of $200,000, of which, after deducting the sum of $85,334.13 already allowed as a deduction from income of preceding years, a balance of $114,665.87 remains to be allowed as a deduction from the income derived from the mine during ensuing years, commencing with the fiscal year of the company which ended on the 31st day of March, 1931.\nAnd that, having regard to the anticipated life of the mine as indicated by the total ore reserves and annual ore extraction disclosed in the return filed by the company for the said fiscal year, and to the allowance of $14,665.87 made in assessing the income for the year ended March 31st, 1931, be approved, and that subject as aforesaid the said assessment be confirmed.\n2. That a certified copy of this minute, if approved and ordered, be forwarded to the company and the Commissioner of Income Tax.\nDated this 28th day of July,A.D. 933.\nJ. W. Jones\nMinister of Finance.\nApproved this 28th day of July, A.D. 1933.\nR. H. Pooley\nPresiding member of the\nExecutive Council.\nThe statute, section 6 (1,o), authorized the Minister, in determining expenses in the production of income to make an allowance for depletion or exhaustion of a mine; an allowance to be deducted from the income of the mine in any year in the discretion of the Minister. The Minister must have regard to the anticipated life of the mine and the \"total cost of the mine\" as determined by him. By section 6 (3a), in determining this last mentioned cost, the Minister shall take into consideration (inter alia) \"acquisition costs incurred prior to April 1, 1928.\"\nThe appeal taken by the company from the Minister to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was authorized by section 44 (4) of the Taxation Act, which invests the Lieutenant-Governor in Council with jurisdiction upon such an appeal, after hearing the parties interested, either to confirm or amend the decision of the Minister; and the statute declares that \" the decision of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall be final.\"\nIt was argued on behalf of the appellants that this right of appeal does not extend to a determination of acquisition costs under subsection 3a, but relates only to an allowance for depletion under subsection 1o. No doubt the appeal is given from the allowance by the Minister for depletion or exhaustion, but the appeal is given in the most general terms, and seems clearly to include every appeal intended to assert a complaint against the action of the Minister in respect of the allowance upon any ground on which he may have acted; including his determination of acquisition costs and other matters, which is only a step in the process of fixing the allowance. The order fixing the allowance is the definite order. I have no doubt that the right of appeal is comprehensive in its nature; that, given a determination by the Minister of an allowance for depletion or exhaustion, then the complainant has a right to present his complaint by way of appeal in respect of any matter of fact or law which he may conceive to have affected the decision of the Minister adversely to his interests, or by reason of which he may desire to contend that the decision of the Minister was erroneous.\nThe appellants, by their appeal, it will be observed, complained that the Minister had fixed \" the cost to this company of its mine and mining property at the too low figure of $100,000 instead of $2,500,000 \" (amended to read $2,378,120.09); and that he had failed to make sufficient allowance for the depletion or exhaustion of the mine.\nThe notice of motion originating the proceedings claimed a writ of mandamus; and the judgment of the judge of first instance, which the appellants now ask be restored, ordered the issue of such a writ directed to the Minister of Finance, requiring him \" to ascertain and take into consideration the acquisition costs of the Pioneer Gold Mines, Ltd. of the properties acquired by them under an indenture \" of 30th March, 1928.\nThe bringing of the appeal invests the Lieutenant-Governor in Council with jurisdiction to deal with the allowance complained of, and necessarily to review all matters that the statute requires to be considered for the purpose of reaching a determination upon that subject. The decision of the Lieutenant-Governor upon such matters, whether they be matters of fact or matters of law, is final. One may suppose, of course, that there might be cases in which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, in passing upon the matters arising upon the appeal, had so radically violated the conditions of his jurisdiction as to require a court to hold that his determination was a determination ultra vires. It is also, of course, conceivable that an appeal might be taken in respect of something which is not, under the statutory provisions, an appealable matter at all.\nIn the present case it could not seriously be, and in fact is not, disputed that an allowance was fixed by the Minister of Finance, who professed, in doing so, to exercise his powers under subsection 1o. There was, therefore, an appealable matter.\nNor can I perceive any ground for affirming that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council violated any fundamental condition of his jurisdiction. His position, in exercising such a statutory authority to pass upon disputed questions affecting the rights and property of individuals, was discussed in Wilson v. Esquimault Nanaimo Railway Co.[2] . In that case the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had to consider the function of the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia who had been invested with statutory authority to issue Crown grants of property, which the Board had previously held to be vested in the Railway Company, upon \"reasonable proof\" of certain facts. It was held that his function was in that case judicial, but that he was not bound to follow the rules regulating proceedings in a court of justice, or the rules of evidence, and that, if there was before him something which he might properly regard as proof of the necessary facts, it was within his discretion to determine whether or not such proof constituted \" reasonable proof \" within the meaning of the statute.\nThe Board there proceeded upon principles laid down in Arlidge's case[3] . The judgment of Lord Haldane in that case contains a passage which explicitly points out that when Parliament entrusts a government department (such, for example, as the Local Government Board) with judicial duties, Parliament must be taken, in the absence of any declaration to the contrary, to have intended it to follow the procedure which is its own, and may be necessary if it is to be capable of doing its work efficiently.\nThe Minister, as the head of the Board, it was said, is directly responsible to Parliament like other Ministers. He is responsible, not only for what he himself does, but for all that is done in his department. The volume of work entrusted to him is very great and he cannot do the great bulk of it himself. He is expected to obtain his materials vicariously through his officials, and he has discharged his duty if he sees that they obtain these materials for him properly.\nAn observation somewhat to the same effect is to be found in Wilson's case[4] . The passage in Lord Haldane's judgment in full is as follows:\nMy Lords, when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed, those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially. They must deal with the question referred to them without bias, and they must give to each of the parties the opportunity of adequately presenting the case made. The decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of responsibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice. But it does not follow that the procedure of every such tribunal must be the same. In the case of a Court of law tradition in this country has prescribed certain principles to which in the main the procedure must conform. But what the procedure is to be in detail must depend on the nature of the tribunal. In modern times it has become increasingly common for Parliament to give an appeal in matters which really pertain to administration, rather than to the exercise of the judicial functions of an ordinary Court, to authorities whose functions are administrative and not in the ordinary sense judicial. Such a body as the Local Government Board has the duty of enforcing obligations on the individual which are imposed in the interests of the community. Its character is that of an organization with executive functions. In this it resembles other great departments of the State. When, therefore, Parliament entrusts it with judicial duties, Parliament must be taken, in the absence of any declaration to the contrary, to have intended it to follow the procedure which is its own, and is necessary if it is to be capable of doing its work efficiently. I agree with the view expressed in an analogous case by my noble and learned friend Lord Loreburn. In Board of Education v. Rice[5] he laid down that, in disposing of a question which was the subject of an appeal to it, the Board of Education was under a duty to act in good faith, and to listen fairly to both sides, inasmuch as that was a duty which lay on every one who decided anything. But he went on to say that he did not think it was bound to treat such a question as though it were a trial.***It could, he thought, obtain information in any way it thought best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who were parties in the controversy to correct or contradict any relevant statement prejudicial to their view. If the Board failed in this duty, its order might be the subject of certiorari and it must itself be the subject of mandamus.\nMy Lords, I concur in this view of the position of an administrative body to which the decision of a question in dispute between parties has been entrusted. The result of its inquiry must, as I have said, be taken, in the absence of directions in the statute to the contrary, to be intended to be reached by its ordinary procedure. In the case of the Local Government Board it is not doubtful what this procedure is. The Minister at the head of the Board is directly responsible to Parliament like other Ministers. He is responsible not only for what he himself does but for all that is done in his department. The volume of work entrusted to him is very great and he cannot do the great bulk of it himself. He is expected to obtain his materials vicariously through his officials, and he has discharged his duty if he sees that they obtain these materials for him properly. To try to extend his duty beyond this and to insist that he and other members of the Board should do everything personally would be to impair his efficiency. Unlike a judge in a Court he is not only at liberty but is compelled to rely on the assistance of his staff. When, therefore, the Board is directed to dispose of an appeal, that does not mean that any particular official of the Board is to dispose of it. This point is not, in my opinion, touched by s. 5 of 33 and 34 Vict., c. 70, the Act constituting the Local Government Board to which I have already referred. Provided the work is done judicially and fairly in the sense indicated by Lord Loreburn, the only authority that can review what has been done is the Parliament to which the Minister in charge is responsible.\nNow, the materials in the appeal book, including the Order in Council in which the determination of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is expressed, abundantly show that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council did apply himself to the matters which it was his duty to consider in the circumstances by virtue of the provisions of subsections 1o and 3a; and, moreover, that the appellants were given the fullest opportunity to present their views. He determined in the most explicit way \"the total cost of the mine\" as required by subsection 1o, already quoted, and \"having regard,\" as the statute required, to the amount so ascertained, and the anticipated life of the mine, he fixed the allowance. I can find no evidence that he disregarded any statutory rule or statutory direction, or that there was any substantial departure from the mandatory provisions to which he was subject.\nIt was argued before us with a great deal of vigour\u2014and this is the sole ground of complaint\u2014that he erred in holding that the shares allotted by the appellants to the members of the syndicate had no value for certain reasons which were advanced. It does not appear that he did so, but, even if he did, and if, in doing so, he was wrong, that was not a matter going to his jurisdiction. It was simply a mistaken ruling and, apparently, a mistake of fact. It is desirable, however, to point out that, in substance, he passed upon this matter.\nThe issue with which the parties were practically concerned was the deduction to be allowed in respect of income by way of allowance for depletion or exhaustion. The duty of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was, in fixing this, to have regard to the \"total cost of the mine\" to the appellants; and in ascertaining this cost to take into consideration (inter alia) the \"acquisition costs incurred prior to the 1st April, 1928.\" The Lieutenant-Governor in Council had before him the agreement of April, 1930, the various documents and, no doubt, other facts affecting the value of any rights acquired under that agreement; the transfer of which was the consideration for the purchase of the shares (1,600,000) allotted to the promoters. The appellants contended that the value of these rights was the amount of the total nominal share capital, $2,500,000. Later they argued that the value of the shares was fixed by the agreement at $1,600,000. Plainly, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was not bound to take this view. He was entitled to hold that the actual value of the shares ought to be measured by the value of the rights transferred. He may have been satisfied that no title to any of the property passed under the agreement. He may have had facts before him leading him to the conclusion that the agreements, purporting to be transferred, were not, strictissimi juris, enforceable. In any event, even from the point of view of the appellants, which is that it was his duty to value the shares, he was entitled to hold that this value did not exceed $200,000 (less the sums still owing under the agreements), the amount he fixed as the value of \"the mine\" for the purpose in hand. There is not the slightest ground for imputing to him any departure in point of substance from the directions of the statute. As regards all these matters his decision is not open to review.\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council having in July, in the exercise of his statutory jurisdiction, passed upon the matters which it was his duty to decide under the statute, it is quite obvious that the Minister of Finance became functus officio. The determination of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, let me repeat, is, by the most explicit terms of the statute, final. It is binding upon the Minister of Finance as well as upon the appellants. The Minister would, after the decision, have been committing a breach of the law if he had attempted to exercise his powers in respect of allowance for depletion or exhaustion otherwise than in conformity with that decision. A mandamus requiring him to reconsider questions which had been settled by the Order in Council would, therefore, have been a mandamus requiring him to commit a breach of the law; to perform an act which, by force of the statute, must necessarily be inoperative.\nIn this view, no question arises as to the legality or propriety of the acts of the Minister of Finance. It is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal that there was an appealable decision by the Minister; that a competent appeal was taken from it; that the appeal was considered by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in the exercise of his statutory jurisdiction and powers, and that he pronounced a decision upon the matters in dispute which the statute declares to be final.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia which allowed an appeal, Mr. Justice McQuarrie dissenting, from a judgment of Mr. Justice D. A. McDonald ordering the issue of a writ of mandamus directed to the Minister of Finance of British Columbia commanding the Minister to ascertain and take into consideration the acquisition costs to Pioneer Gold Mines of B.C. Limited of the properties acquired by the company under an indenture of agreement dated March 30, 1928, between one David Sloan and the company as provided by the Income Tax Act, section 6, chapter 53, Statutes of British Columbia, 1932.\nThe relevant portions of section 6 are as follows:\u2014\n6. (1) In ascertaining the net income for the purposes of taxation, no deduction by way of expenses shall be made for:\u2014\n(a) not material;\n(b) not material;\n(c) not material;\nnor shall the following be allowed in any case as expenses incurred in the production of income:\u2014\n(d) to (n) not material.\n(c) Any allowance for depletion or exhaustion of a mine, except such proportional amount as may in the discretion of the Minister be allowed to be deducted from the income from the mine in any year, having regard to the anticipated life of the mine and to the total cost of the mine as determined by the Minister pursuant to the provisions of subsection (3) ***\n(2) Not material. (3) In determining the cost to any taxpayer of any mine in respect of which he claims an allowance for depletion or exhaustion under clause (o) of subsection (1), upon which cost any such allowance is to be computed, the Minister shall take into consideration the following expenditures, whether incurred by the taxpayer or by any predecessor in title to the mine:\u2014\n(a) Acquisition costs incurred prior to the first day of April, 1928, together with all expenditures subsequent to the date of acquisition for exploration and development costs and any other expenses which the Minister may consider as directly related to and forming part of the costs of the mine, subject, in the case of any mine which was in active production prior to the first day of January, 1915, to a deduction therefrom of an amount to be determined by the Minister as representing the amount of depletion or exhaustion (if any) actually sustained prior to the first day of January, 1915 ***\n(4) An appeal from any decision of the Minister under clause *** (o) *** of subsection (1) may be taken to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, who, after hearing the parties interested, may either confirm or amend the decision of the Minister, and the decision of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall be final.\nBy an agreement in writing dated July 16, 1924, a company known as Pioneer Gold Mines Limited granted to David Sloan or his assignee the right to take possession of, use, work, mine and develop mining property in the Lillooet mining division in the province of British Columbia certain claims known as the Pioneer group together with buildings, plant, machinery and equipment during the performance by the purchaser of the conditions and stipulations in the agreement. The purchaser agreed to provide and deposit to his credit $16,000 or such lesser amount as should be sufficient to finance and pay for certain mining work and development described in the agreement at the following times: $4,000 on or before August 1,1924; $4,000 on or before the first days of September, October and November, 1924. The agreement further provided that the proceeds of ore shipped or milled on the property should be deposited and 85 per centum credited to the purchaser's trust account and 15 per centum credited to the company for rent or use of its property. The purchaser was also given an option to purchase the property up to August 1, 1929, for $100,000 less any amounts paid to the company through the 15 per centum allowance on the proceeds of ore taken from the property. This agreement was referred to on the argument and may hereafter be referred to as the option. Sloan and his associates duly deposited $8,000, being two sums of $4,000 each, and also deposited $45,000 to the credit of the vendor, representing 15 per centum allowances on the proceeds of ore taken out. The remaining 85 per centum of the proceeds, amounting to $255,000, was put back by Sloan and his associates in improvements.\nIn the year 1927, Victor Spencer purchased for $40,000 a quarter interest in the agreement, subject to the payment by the syndicate of the option price. The money paid by Victor Spencer went to those members of the syndicate who had sold the quarter interest to him. On March 29, 1928, a private company was incorporated under the name of Pioneer Gold Mines of B.C. Limited, and on March 30, 1928, Sloan, on behalf of himself and all the other members of the syndicate, entered into an agreement with the new company whereby Sloan granted, assigned and transferred to the company the option and all his rights and interests to the mineral claims and property and the buildings, plant, machinery and stock in trade used in connection with the said mining business and operations. The agreement recited that the assignor had agreed to assign the option \"and other premises\" to the company, but the agreement in fact transferred to the company only the option and the interests of Sloan in the mineral claims and real and personal property therein described. The consideration was set out as $1,600,000 to be satisfied by the allotment to the assignor and his nominees of 1,600,000 shares of $1 each of the capital stock of the company. On the same day Sloan transferred two mining claims and shortly thereafter five additional mining claims to the company. Previous to the above assignment and transfers from Sloan, commencing on March 30, 1928, the new company had not any assets.\nOn May 20, 1928, an agreement for sale of 50,000 shares of the capital stock of the new company was entered into with Stobie, Furlong & Company. The consideration was $75,000. To effect this sale, the new company was converted from a private company into a public company.\nIn the years 1929 and 1930, the new company, which I shall hereafter refer to as the Company, was assessed on a basis of acquisition costs of $100,000. I merely mention this to give the history. I do not consider that these assessments are important in considering the present appeal as the appellant's evidence was that these assessments were the subject of an arrangement or agreement. In 1931, the appellant was again assessed on a basis of $100,000 for acquisition costs\nOn January 22, 1932, the appellant company served a notice of appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under section 44, subsection 4, of the Taxation Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, chapter 254, as amended, from the decision of the Minister of Finance under clause (p) of subsection 1 and clause (a) of subsection 3 of section 44, fixing the acquisition costs\nat too low figure of $100,000 instead of $2,500,000 for the purpose of assessment of the company's income for the year ending March 31, 1931,\nThe relevant portions of section 44 of the former Taxation Act, being R.S.B.C. 1924, chapter 254, as amended by the 1925 statutes of British Columbia, chapter 54, section 8, as amended by 1928 statutes of British Columbia, chapter 47, section 6, are:\u2014\n44. (1) The net income of every person shall be ascertained for the purpose of taxation by deducting from his gross income the exemptions provided in section 42, and all expenses incurred in the production of that part of his income which is liable to taxation and the income tax thereof payable to the Crown in right of the Dominion; but no deduction by way of expenses shall be made for\n(a) not material.\n(b) not material.\n(c) not material.\nand the following shall not in any case be allowed as expenses incurred in the production of income.\n(d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) (m) (n) (o) not material.\n(p) Any allowance for depletion or exhaustion of a mine except such proportional amount as may in the discretion of the Minister be allowed to be deducted from the income from the mine in any year, having regard to the anticipated life of the mine and to the total cost of the mine as determined by the Minister pursuant to the provisions of subsection (3).\n(2) not material.\n(3) In determining the cost to any taxpayer of any mine in respect of which he claims an allowance for depletion or exhaustion under clause (p) of subsection (1), upon which cost any such allowance is to be computed, the Minister shall take into consideration the following expenditures, whether incurred by the taxpayer or by any predecessor in title to the mine:\u2014\n(a) Acquisition costs incurred prior to the first day of April, 1928, together with all expenditures subsequent to the date of acquisition for exploration and development costs and any other expenses which the Minister may consider as directly related to and forming part of the cost of the mine, subject, in the case of any mine which was in active production prior to the first day of January, 1915, to a deduction therefrom of an amount to be determined by the Minister as representing the amount of depletion or exhaustion, (if any) actually sustained prior to the first day of January, 1915 ***\n(4) An appeal from any decision of the Minister under clause (n) (o) (p) *** of subsection 1 may be taken to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, who, after hearing the parties interested, may either confirm or amend the decision of the Minister, and the decision of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall be final.\nNotwithstanding the appeal, the company urged the Minister in conference and in correspondence to change his decision. On June 21, 1932, the company secretary wrote at length setting out a history of the dealings with the property from the year 1915. On July 27, 1932, the secretary again wrote the Minister referring to the sale of shares made to Stobie, Furlong & Company and urged that the net acquisition costs were $2,378,129.09, and that the company had nothing whatever to do with the amount that the property had cost Sloan and his associates. On July 27, 1932, the Minister wrote the secretary that he had thoroughly investigated the matter. On July 28, the Minister again wrote the secretary stating that 1,600,000 shares were issued to members of the syndicate and that the shares only represented declarations of interest and that the syndicate members had merely changed into shares their interests in an agreement to purchase the property for $100,000. On August 9, 1932, the company served a new notice of appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council substituting a figure of $2,378,120.09 for the sum of $2,500,000 set out in the notice of appeal of January 22, 1932. Early in October, 1932, the secretary and Victor Spencer interviewed the Minister at Victoria and submitted to the Minister that the shares were issued as consideration not only for the eight claims set out in the option but also for fourteen additional claims, and that the value of the property at the time it was transferred to the company had increased to the value of $2,378,129.09 by reason of the development work and money spent on it.\nOn January 10, February 9 and May 16, 1933, the appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was heard. While the appeal was pending there were some conferences and some correspondence between the Attorney-General and the solicitor of the company concerning the possibility of a submission to the courts of the matters at issue under the provisions of section 3 of the Constitutional Questions De- termination Act, chapter 46, R.S.B.C. 1924. Nothing definite, however, resulted from these negotiations.\nThe company continued its interviews and correspondence with the Minister in the month of June, 1933.\nOn July 28, 1933, an order in council was passed whereby the appeal of the company was allowed in part and \"the total cost of the mine as determined by the Minister at $100,000\" was increased to the sum of $200,000.\nMonths afterwards, namely, on November 13, 1933, the company applied to Mr. Justice D. A. McDonald of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and secured a peremptory writ of mandamus directed to the Minister of Finance commanding him forthwith to ascertain and take into consideration the acquisition costs to the company of the properties acquired by it under the agreement of March 30, 1928, as provided by the Income Tax Act, section 6, chapter 53, statutes of British Columbia, 1932. The Minister was cross-examined on an affidavit made by him and filed on the mandamus motion. In the course of his cross-examination, the Minister testified that he took into consideration the section of the Act which stated that he must consider acquisition costs only, that no cash consideration had been given for the shares, that there was simply the transfer of the interests of a syndicate into 1,600,000 shares and that to justify his conclusions he had had interviews with three representatives of the company and all his departmental chiefs. The Minister further testified that he always listened and gave every possible consideration to the requests and arguments of the company. On November 14, 1933, the Minister made answer to the writ, and in his answer stated that he had in accordance with the instructions and command in the writ ascertained from the evidence before him that, although the consideration expressed in the agreement for the transfer to the Company was $1,600,000, the agreement stated that the consideration was to be paid and satisfied by the allotment of 1,600,000 fully paid ordinary shares of the capital stock of the Company of $1 each; that he had ascertained that the Company on the 30th day of March, 1928, the date of the agreement, had no assets whatever and its shares were therefore of no actual value before the acquisition of the rights of Sloan in the option and in the properties and had no market value prior to such acquisition and that, therefore, there were no acquisition costs to the Company, in that transaction, in money or money's worth. He further stated that, on the appeal taken from his decision as Minister, it was decided by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council on July 28, 1933, that his decision fixing the acquisition costs at $100,000 should be amended by increasing the amount to $200,000 and that in compliance with the writ, he determined the acquisition costs at the said sum of $200,000. He further stated that if, in deference to what he believed to be the reasons of Mr. Justice D. A. McDonald for granting the writ, the basis for determining the acquisition costs were not a matter for his personal judgment, and that if he were legally bound to rule that the acquisition costs consisted of the value which the shares acquired after the Company had received title to the properties, he would find that the acquisition costs were $1,600,000.\nIn The King v. The Board of Education[6] , it was held by the Court of Appeal that a local education authority had no power under the Education Act, 1902, to differentiate, in the matter of teachers equally qualified and teaching the same subjects, between the salaries paid in provided and non-provided schools as such. The Board of Education had decided that there had been no failure by the local education authority to maintain, and keep efficient, a school. The Court of Appeal held that the decision of the Board must be quashed on the ground that it did not answer the question submitted, and that a mandamus must be isssued directing the Board to determine the question according to law. The decision of the Court or Appeal affirming the decision of the Divisional Court that mandamus should issue, was affirmed in the House of Lords, sub. nom. Board of Education and Rice[7] . The following statement is from the judgment of Lord Loreburn, Lord Chancellor, page 182:\nComparatively recent statutes have extended, if they have not originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or officers of State the duty of deciding or determining questions of various kinds. In the present instance, as in many others, what comes for determination is sometimes a matter to be settled by discretion, involving no law. It will, I suppose, usually be of an administrative kind; but sometimes it will involve matter of law as well as matter of fact, or even depend upon matter of law alone. In such cases the Board of Education will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts. I need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who who decides anything *** The board is in the nature of the arbitral tribunal, and a Court of law has no jurisdiction to hear appeals from the determination either upon law or upon fact. But if the Court is satisfied either that the Board have not acted judicially in the way I have described, or have not determined the question which they are required by the Act to determine, then there is a remedy by mandamus and certiorari.\nIn determining the acquisition costs in the case at bar, the Minister was bound to give the company full opportunity of presenting their arguments and to listen to them with a proper feeling of responsibility and conscientiously to apply his mind to the determination of the acquisition costs as required by the statute; but he was entitled to supplement the material before him vicariously through the officials of his department. Wilson v. Esquimault and Nanaimo Railway Company[8] . There are of course, many cases to the effect that mandamus will not lie if, as in The King v. Port of London Authority[9] , there is as convenient, beneficial and effectual a remedy by way of appeal; but, as Lord Wright points out in his opinion in the Mayor, Alderman and Councillors of Stepney and John Walker and Sons Limited[10], the Court will weigh the character and competence of the alternative remedy, to ascertain if it is sufficient and convenient in the true legal sense of the words.\nNow it was argued by the appellant (a) that there was not any right of appeal from the decision of the Minister on the statute before us and that the alleged appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was therefore a nullity, and (b) that, if there was an appeal, the remedy of appeal was not a sufficient remedy since by the scheme of the Act the acquisition costs had to be first determined by the Minister, that this was a condition precedent to a valid appeal, that the Minister had not applied his mind or exercised his discretion on the proper questions and that he had not, therefore, determined the acquisition costs as required by the Act.\nThese points may be considered in the above order.\n(a) Subsection 4 of section 44 of the 1928 Act expressly provided in the widest terms for an appeal from any decision of the Minister under clause (p) of subsection 1, and subsection 4 of section 6 of the 1932 Act, if that is relevant, expressly provided in the widest terms for an appeal from any decision of the Minister under clause (o) of subsection 1. Merrill Ring, Wilson Ltd., v. Workman's Compensation Board[11] .\n(b) It was argued by the appellant that there had been no pretence on the part of the Minister to determine the acquisition costs and that the Minister had deliberately refused to do so. The record, however, does not support these contentions. Some of the statements of the Minister on his cross-examination on the affidavit filed by him and on the return to the writ are not easy to reconcile, but it is clear that he fairly listened to the representatives of the company, examined the records and correspondence, consulted his principal departmental officers and bona fide came to the conclusion that acquisition costs of $1,600,000 were not established by the issue of 1,600,000 shares of a par value of $1 each any more than acquisition costs of $5,000,000 or $50,000 would have been established by the issue of 5,000,000 or 50,000 shares, respectively, of a par value of $1 each. In all cases, the shares would have reflected the value of the rights and interests assigned by Sloan to the company.\nThe case book shows that many claims were transferred to the company after the assignment from Sloan and before the sale to Stobie, Furlong & Company, which was an isolated sale at $1.50 per share. Clearly, the Minister was not bound to accept that figure. The record, as a whole, shows that the points in issue were constantly impressed upon the Minister by the company in conferences and correspondence and it is difficult to think that he did not apply his mind to the consideration required by the statute, particularly when, in point of fact, the representatives of the company were very properly tireless in urging these considerations upon him, and the Minister was always patient in listening to them. An examination of one letter alone, namely the letter from A. E. Bull to the Minister dated June 21, will disclose the most complete exposition of the points at issue. The following is a short quotation from that letter:\nWhile I have given you a history of the property before the incorporation of the company, the facts and figures therein mentioned do not affect the question being dealt with, which is under sec. 44, ss. 3, clause (a) of the Taxation Act the \"acquisition cost\" of the property to the company (the present tax bearer), prior to the 1st of April, 1928, and this acquisition cost is clearly the value of the shares at the time issued for the property, which was $2,400,000 and, as you know, the share capital of the company is a liability of the company and has to be returned to the shareholders and not encroached upon for dividends or profits, and is a real consideration and has to remain intact until the ultimate winding up of the company. The cost to some of the vendors who sold to the company four years before incorporation has nothing whatever to do with the acquistion cost to the company in March, 1928.\nThe Minister quite properly found that the shares reflected the value of the rights and interests transferred by Sloan. He then proceeded to determine the value of those rights and interests and, after consultations with departmental officers, he fixed the value at $100,000 and determined that the acquisition costs were that sum.\nBut there was an appeal by the statute to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. This appeal was actually taken by the Company and the decision of the Minister was varied to $200,000, and there is no doubt whatever that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council acted judicially. Wilson v. Esquimault & Nanaimo Railway Company[12] . The statute provided that this appeal should be final. The effect of the mandamus order was to direct the Minister, several months after he became functus officio, to act in disregard of the appeal from his decision, which appeal, I repeat, the statute declared to be final.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The appellant, a widow, who had a savings account with the respondent bank, gave a power of attorney to one M. authorizing him \"for me and in my name to draw and sign cheques on the said bank * * *\" M. was indebted to the respondent bank and on being pressed for payment told the respondent's local manager that he \"could borrow it from Mrs. Begley\", the appellant. Shortly thereafter, after the appellant had left on a visit to Ontario, M. told the bank's accountant, who was aware of what had been said previously between M. and the manager, that he, M., wished to pay off his debt. Under M.'s instructions, the accountant made out a promissory note payable to the appellant on demand which M. signed for the amount of his debt to the bank. M. thereupon gave the bank a cheque on the appellant's account, signed by him as her attorney. The cheque was charged up against the appellant's account and M.'s indebtedness to the bank was cancelled, the note was left with the bank. The note was renewed twice by M. on July 31st, 1931, and in September, 1932. Alleging that she had not given M. authority to borrow or use her money for his own use, the appellant sued the bank respondent on December 29th, 1932. The trial judge maintained the action; but the Appellate Division reversed his judgment on the ground that the appellant's subsequent conduct in dealing with M. and her silence towards the bank constituted a complete estoppel.\nHeld, in accord with the judgment of the Appellate Division ([1934] 1 W.W.R. 689) and the trial judge, that the respondent bank had no right as against the appellant to retain the monies so paid over to it by M.; but\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division, Cannon J. dissenting, that, according to the facts and circumstances of this case, the appellant's conduct did not constitute estoppel or ratification.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting):\u2014Both on the ground of ratification and of estoppel, the respondent bank's defense is well founded, according to the facts of the case.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Boyle J., and dismissing the appellant's action. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgments now reported.\nH. G. Nolan for the appellant.\nE. K. Williams K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket and Hughes JJ. and of Maclean J. ad hoc was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014This appeal involves a controversy concerning the rights of the appellant against the respondent bank in respect of certain moneys of the appellant paid to the bank by one McElroy, who at the time held a power of attorney from the appellant, in liquidation of his debt to the bank.\nThe payment was made on the 29th of June, 1929. The appellant had been a depositor and had had a savings account with the bank since 1918. At the time of the transaction we have to consider, she was a widow, her husband having died in the previous December. She had been told by her husband, just before his last illness, that in matters of business, she should seek the assistance of McElroy. They both recognized that she would require assistance, because she was ill, suffering, as she afterwards learned, from an \"inward goitre.\" Accordingly, in January, McElroy was appointed administrator of the husband's estate, and one Moyer, McElroy's solicitor, acted as solicitor in the business of administration.\nOn the 21st of June, 1929, the appellant, McElroy and Moyer were in the bank, saw the manager and on that occasion, the sum of $13,000, which had been realized from the estate, was transferred from the administrator's account to the personal savings account of the appellant.\nMcElroy was a customer of the bank and for some years his indebtedness to the bank had been heavy; it appears that from 1924 to 1929 his \"direct liability\" fluctuated from fourteen to eighteen thousand dollars, while he was under an \"indirect liability\" for something like fifteen thousand dollars, arising out of a mortgage held by the bank as collateral security.\nWeaver, the local manager of the bank of Calgary, who was called as a witness at the trial, states that, since early in 1925, he, as manager of the branch, had been trying to get McElroy to discharge his liability. In December 1928, his indirect liability was $14,800 and his direct liability $18,690.\nSome of the letters which passed between Weaver and the western head office at Winnipeg, and the head office at Toronto, are in evidence. On the 20th of December, 1927, the assistant general manager at Winnipeg, writing to Weaver, says that he is concerned about McElroy's account, and comments sharply upon a remark of McElroy's, reported by Weaver, about a \"purchase of May wheat,\" as indicating that McElroy was gambling in wheat. This, Weaver was informed, was a very serious matter and he was directed \"to get at the situation at once.\"\nOn the 23rd of November, 1928, the assistant general manager at Toronto writes to the western superintendent at Winnipeg expressing his dissatisfaction with the information in his possession respecting McElroy's account, which showed a \"direct\" indebtedness at that time, apparently, of over $15,000. He complains that a suggestion that McElroy was going \"to place a mortgage\" in order to repay the bank was vague and appeared \"to be drifting.\"\nTowards the end of December, McElroy succeeded in raising a loan of $13,000 odd, by mortgage upon his lands, reducing his direct liability to the bank to $5,289. On the 8th of January, the assistant general manager writes:\nYou do not tell us how McElroy is going to pay the $5,289. Has he got sufficient money from the sale of grain and cattle to provide for it?\nWeaver replies on the 15th of January informing the assistant general manager that McElroy has not sufficient grain and cattle to pay the balance owing the bank, but that he has decided \"to sell out\" and is negotiating with one Herron for that purpose.\nMcElroy's direct liability was increased to $7,296 by the 25th of March, 1929. On the following day a deposit was made reducing it to $3,423. On the 29th of June it had been increased to $8,518. By moneys transferred from the appellant's account to McElroy's account, it was paid in full on that day\u2014the first time for at least five years when McElroy was free of debt to the bank.\nIn the meantime, Weaver, stimulated by the head office, had been pressing McElroy for the payment of his indebtedness. Weaver states that at the end of April, 1929, McElroy told him that if the deal with Herron did not materialize, he could borrow the money from Mrs. Begley.\nAgain, on the 7th of June, Weaver says, he asked McElroy \"in regard to paying the loan,\" and McElroy, he avers, told him that Mrs. Begley \"had not yet got back from the states,\" and that \"he would make arrangements with her when she came back.\"\nThe bank adduced this testimony by Chambers, the assistant manager:\nQ. Prior to the 29th of June had you any reason to anticipate the withdrawal of any of the funds from Mrs. Begley's savings account and the same to be applied in satisfaction of McElroy's indebtedness to the bank.\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Where did you get your information from?\u2014A. From the correspondence between the branch manager and head office.\nQ. Have you any duty in connection with that correspondence.\u2014A. I have to read every letter that goes out of the office the day that it goes out.\nQ. So you knew some time I take it before, or tell me whether you knew before the 29th of June that some transaction of the kind contemplated was going to take place\u2014A. Yes, I knew it on, I believe the date is May 14th.\nQ. In May some time.\u2014A. Yes.\nThe appellant, who had gone in January to stay with her sister in Spokane, returned to Calgary on the 19th of June. On the 21st, with McElroy and Moyer, she visited the bank and had a short conversation with Weaver, and, apparently, on this occasion, $13,000, the sum realized from the husband's estate, was transferred to her personal account. She visited the bank again on the 24th of June, and still again on the 25th, when she arranged with the assistant manager Chambers for the transfer of some money in Hamilton, Ontario, where she was about to pay a visit, intending to leave Calgary, as she did, on the following day, the 26th. It was three days after her departure that McElroy, purporting to act under a power of attorney in the bank's printed form, transferred from the appellant's savings account to his own account, a sum equal to his debt to the bank for the purpose of paying that debt which was so applied.\nMcElroy was not called as a witness, and the only direct evidence as to what occurred on the 29th of June, 1929, is that of the assistant manager, Chambers. In examination-in-chief he says:\nQ. Now will you narrate in your own language, Mr. Chambers, the exact transaction as you recall it.\u2014A. On June 29th, which was Saturday, just at the closing of the bank, Mr. McElroy came in. Q. That would be at 12 o'clock I suppose?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. The bank closes on Saturdays at 12?\u2014A. Yes. He came to me and said * * *\nMr. Shaw: You have no objection to these conversations, just a moment please.\nMr. Nolan: All right, Mr. Shaw.\nQ. Mr. Shaw: Well now, Mr. Chambers?\u2014A. He said, \"I wish to pay off my liability to the bank, will you please figure up how much it is I owe you.\" I then figured up his liability which amounted to $8,518.78. He then said I am going to borrow sufficient money from Mrs. Begley's account to pay this liability. Will you kindly make me out a note payable to Mrs. Begley. I said, \"How long, when will the note be payable?\" and he said, \"On demand.\"\nQ. The Court: What is that?\u2014A. The note would be payable on demand. I asked him at what rate of interest was to be added to the note and he said, Seven per cent.\" I made out this note and handed it to him and he signed it. He then said, \"Will you please make me out a cheque\" which I did, a cheque payable to J. W. McElroy for $8,500 which he signed \"Victoria Begley per J. W. McElroy, Attorney.\"\nQ. Is the handwriting of the note and the cheque yours excepting the signature?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. Then what happened?\u2014A. He then said, \"I will have to put this cheque to my credit.\" I said, \"I will make out a deposit slip,\" and I made out this deposit slip for, put on the $8,500 and I said, \"This will not be sufficient to clean up your liability in full and he gave a further cheque for $18.78 which I added to the $8,500 deposit, made out the deposit for his account\nQ. What did you do? All these documents were turned over to you, that is you had the cheque\u2014A. I gave them all to Mr. McElroy to sign and when they were all made out and signed by him he handed them back to me.\nQ. Yes, what did you do with them?\u2014A. I took the cheque and the note, the cheque and the deposit slip and gave them to the paying teller. I put them in the paying tellers slide.\nQ. That would be, your office is at the inner entrance to the bank? \u2014A. Yes.\nQ. So you simply walked down behind the counter I suppose?\u2014A. Behind the counter and put them into the paying teller's slide. The note I put in my basket.\nBefore commenting upon this proceeding, it will be convenient to turn to the meeting which took place at Moyer's office between the appellant, McElroy and Moyer on the 24th of June. On that occasion the appellant executed the power of attorney, in the printed form furnished by the bank, upon which the bank relies in this litigation. The appellant remembers nothing about the power of attorney, and Moyer says it was not read over to her or explained to her. It was understood by all three, the appellant and Moyer agree, that the appellant's object in going to Moyer's office with McElroy, who accompanied her, was to make arrangements for the investment of the money in her savings account; which, as already mentioned, she had received from her husband's estate. She says that she then \"appointed McElroy\" as her agent to invest her money, and it was arranged, she says, and with this Moyer agrees, and there is no dispute about it, that McElroy was to try to get investments at a higher rate of interest than the ordinary bank rate on deposits; and that, in the meantime, her money was to be invested in government bonds. It was agreed that any other investments were to be subject to Moyer's approval. Moyer says this:\nQ. Did you read this document exhibit \"4\" over to Mrs. Begley?\u2014\nA. No.\nQ. Did you explain it to her?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Why didn't you?\u2014A. Well, I cannot say, Mr. Nolan. She understood that the power of attorney was being given on the bank account and it was in keeping with the instructions she had given to vest authority in McElroy to operate the account for the purpose of investments she had sanctioned or agreed to.\nQ. All right then, are you saying to me that finally instructions were given that for the time being at least the investment was to be in Government bonds?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Until such time as selected securities could be obtained, to which your approval must be given?\u2014A. That is right, and subject to the retention of some reasonable amount in the account.\nQ. For current expenses?\u2014A. That is right.\nThe appellant declares most explicitly that at no time did she agree to lend money to McElroy. But the evidence goes further, and, as it is important, it will be better, perhaps, to quote a passage from it verbatim. The incident mentioned in the passage was on the occasion to which we have referred, on the 24th of June; when, as Moyer says, the final instructions were that \"for the time being at least the investment was to be in government bonds.\" The appellant says:\n* * * Mr. McElroy asked me in an undertone voice if I would not let him have some money where he would pay me seven per cent interest, where if I put it out in Government Bonds, as I asked him, he said I would only get four or four and a half or something and I ignored it, I never let on I heard him say it at all. I said I wanted my money put out in Government bonds.\nQ. That was on Monday the 24th, was it, of June. Was it, Mrs. Begley.\u2014A. Yes.\nFive days after this meeting, at which Moyer deposes, the appellant declared \"she trusted\" McElroy and himself \"to do the right thing, and she was not going to worry about it at all \"\u2014five days after this interview at which these instructions were given, McElroy entering the Imperial Bank, declared to the assistant manager, according to the evidence of the latter, that he was going to pay off his debt to the bank; that, in order to do so, he was going to borrow from Mrs. Begley, and the assistant manager having drawn a cheque upon the appellant's account payable to McElroy's order, he forthwith attached the signature \"Victoria Begley per J. W. McElroy, attorney.\"\nIn addition to the sum thus withdrawn on the 29th of June, McElroy, within the succeeding four months and a half withdrew something like $3,000, professing to act under his power of attorney, of which $2,500 seems to have been applied for his own purposes, and without Moyer's knowledge; the remaining $500 was advanced to Moyer personally as a loan.\nThe majority of the Appellate Division seem to have thought that the evidence left some doubt upon the point of the fraudulent character of McElroy's conduct. I regret to say I am unable to share, what I cannot help regarding, if I may say so with the greatest respect, as the somewhat indulgent view, which the learned judges consider to be admissible, of the effect of the evidence. It seems to have been thought that the appellant's attitude, in ignoring, to use her own expression, McElroy's request, might have been interpreted by McElroy as \"silence\" importing \"consent.\"\nThe evidence of Moyer and the appellant is quite unmistakable that the power of attorney was to be used for the purpose of investing the appellant's money in accordance with her instructions. McElroy could not possibly have misconstrued those instructions in the sense suggested. If he had done so, that is to say, if he had really believed that the appellant was acceding to his request, and agreeing to give him a loan, the matter would not have been allowed to rest there; he would have had the loan effected and the business closed before the appellant left Calgary on her visit to Ontario. McElroy was a man of experience in business, and could not have failed to realize that if he delayed the matter until after the appellant's departure, and then made use of his power of attorney in order to effect a loan to himself, without further communication of any sort with the appellant, he must expose himself to the gravest risk of misunderstanding and suspicion. No honest intelligent man of business experience would have behaved so. The judges of the Appellate Division, as well as the trial judge, have concurred in the view that the bank had no right, as against the appellant, to retain the moneys paid over by McElroy on the 29th of June. They all agree that if the appellant had, on becoming aware of what had occurred, demanded repayment, the bank could not have successfully resisted her demand. They agreed that the transaction in its character and in the circumstances attending it, was so far outside the ordinary course of business as to put the bank upon enquiry, and that the bank, having acted without the slightest investigation, not even so much as a question addressed to McElroy, could not, if such a demand had been made, have been permitted to keep the money.\nThe majority of the Appellate Division hold that the appellant is now estopped by her conduct from asserting her claim, and think, with some hesitation, that she had ratified McElroy's act in withdrawing the money from her account as a loan to himself; and that this involved a ratification also of his act in employing the proceeds to pay his debt to the bank.\nWith the greatest respect, I have been unable to satisfy myself that the bank has established these defences; but before considering them it is worth while, I think, to make one or two observations upon the transaction of the 29th of June.\nAs the trial judge observes, none knew better than the officials of the bank the financial pressure to which McElroy was subject. Apparently, he had unsuccessfully essayed every expedient, save resort to the appellant, for the purpose of providing himself with funds in order to satisfy the just and urgent demand of the bank.\nOn behalf of the bank, it is said, and the evidence already mentioned was offered in support of it, that they had been looking forward to payment by McElroy out of the proceeds of a loan which he expected to obtain from the appellant. He seems, as we have seen, to have informed the manager in April that he could borrow from the appellant. Then, as we have also seen, on the 7th of June, again, the manager tells us, he said that on the appellant's return \"he would make arrangements with her.\"\nIt must be assumed that the local officials of the bank had more than an ordinary interest in these expectations communicated to them by McElroy; information regarding them had, apparently, been communicated to the head office. McElroy's account, as administrator of the estate of the appellant's husband, seems to have been kept in the bank. Indeed, the evidence suggests that, during her absence in Spokane, the manager had been permitting the appellant to draw upon the moneys of the estate or upon the bank on the security of her interest in the estate.\nIt may properly be inferred that before the appellant returned to Calgary on the 19th of June, the officials of the bank were fully cognisant of the amount of the funds which would pass into her possession from the estate. They must have realized that to give a loan of $8,500 to a man in McElroy's circumstances without security, out of a savings account deposit of $13,000, could be no light thing for a woman circumstanced as the appellant was. It is idle to suggest that their minds did not advert to such matters. The payment of McElroy's loan was a matter of no slight moment to them. It would require an unusual degree of credulity to accept the hypothesis that the probabilities of McElroy succeeding in obtaining such a loan, and as incidental thereto the financial situation of the appellant, were not of interest and concern to them. Such being the circumstances, it is impossible to suppose that they did not look forward to receiving some information from McElroy after the appellant's return, touching the result of his endeavours to obtain the assistance of the appellant in relieving him from his embarrasments.\nI cannot think it could have entered their minds antecedently that McElroy would endeavour to get rid of his difficulties by making use of a general authority under a power of attorney in the bank form without the specific consent of the appellant to a loan; but when McElroy proposed (after the appellant had returned to Calgary, and having remained there a week, going in and out of the bank, and had gone away for a lengthy visit in Ontario, and no communication had been received by the bank touching the success of his endeavours to arrange the loan he had been expecting to secure) that he should employ the power of attorney lodged by the appellant with the bank in order to effect an unsecured loan to himself of $8,500, out of the appellant's balance of $13,000, I am un- able to resist the conclusion that the suspicion of any sensible person in the situation of the bank officials, with all the knowledge they possessed, and interested as they were, must have been aroused. Neither the manager nor the assistant manager says he believed a loan had been obtained, or that he did not regard the circumstances as suspicious The manager, indeed, puts his point of view very clearly. In direct examination he says:\nQ. Mr. Weaver, you have suggested that the cheque, the $8,500 cheque, first came to your attention in January, 1929, and at the time of the bank inspection, you observed the form of it at that particular time, did you? \u2014A. Yes, that it was 30.\nQ. Yes, 1930?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Now what did you do following that?\u2014A. When I found it was signed under power of attorney, I inspected the power of attorney which was on file in the office and had it filed away again, that is all I did.\nQ. You just investigated to find out whether or not there was a power of attorney?\u2014A. Yes, and the power of attorney, so far as I knew, was in proper form.\nQ. Had you known anything about this transaction previously, I am talking now about the cheque, the $8,500 cheque and the note?\u2014A. Will you please be a little more clear?\nQ. Here you see, Mr. Weaver, a cheque signed by, under power of attorney, now what did you do in connection with that, that put you on your inquiry did it?\u2014A. I only inquired at the time if there was a power of attorney and if that power of attorney was in order and properly recorded and that is all I did, I did not consider there was anything further necessary.\nQ. No, the Court will not allow that conversation, but what I want to know is, did you have any other source of information other than Chambers with respect to this matter?\u2014A. I may be very stupid in this question but I do not understand exactly what you wish to get from me. I can only explain that Mr. Chambers told me about the transaction at the time it went through and when this cheque was taken out in 1930 I took the transaction up by myself and found that cheque had been signed under a power of attorney and I saw nothing to take exception to in it. Whoever the cheque was payable to, so far as I was concerned, I thought it was all right. The power of attorney was there and expressed as such the cheque would be signed in that way and I did nothing further with respect to it.\n* * *\nQ. Now when this money represented by this cheque which is exhibit \"5\" in this case, the $8,500 cheque, was credited to the account of J. W. McElroy and it was on the 29th of June?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Where did the money come from that went into Mr. McElroy'a account?\u2014A. He borrowed it.\nQ. No, no.\nThe Court: No.\nMr. Shaw: You must take his answer surely.\nQ. The Court: No.\nQ. The Court: Whose money was it that went into his account?\u2014A. Mr. McElroy's. Q. Where did he get it?\u2014A. He borrowed it from Mrs. Begley.\nMr. Shaw: My learned friend must take the answer he gets.\nMr. Nolan: I am saying this to you, Mr. Weaver, the money which went into Mr. McElroy's account that day came out of the account of Mrs. Mary Victoria Begley, that is right, is it not?\u2014A. It may have come from the Bank of England but the fact is that so far as we are concerned it was his money. It was his money, he had borrowed it elsewhere.\nThe Court: That is not what you were asked, you know what you were asked, you are an intelligent man?\u2014A. Yes, my Lord.\nQ. You were asked where that money came from that paid off your bank?\u2014A. Well, my Lord, it came from Mr. McElroy so far as we are concerned, if Mr. * * *\nQ. The evidence before us now is that it came from a cheque drawn by Mr. McElroy on Mrs. Begley's account?\u2014A. That is correct, my Lord.\nQ. Is that so?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe Court: Well why don't you say so frankly?\nThat is the manager's account of his attitude; but I find it difficult to ascribe to him or the assistant manager the degree of simplicity necessarily involved in the supposition that either of them believed McElroy's plan of obtaining a specific loan from the appellant had succeeded, or that the extraordinary method adopted by McElroy in getting possession of funds to pay the bank was not the result of something that required or called for explanation.\nThe legal result is plain. The relation of principal and agent does not necessarily involve the existence of a fiduciary bond between them, but it is beyond controversy that, superadded to the legal relation between the appellant and McElroy, there was another relation in virtue of which McElroy owed a fiduciary obligation to the appellant in respect of the funds entrusted to him (Burdick v. Garrick[2]; Gray v. Bateman[3]; Makepeace v. Rogers[4]; John v. Dodwell[5]; Reckitt v. Barnett[6].\nIn the circumstances of the present case, the burden of the fiduciary obligation to which McElroy was subject was transmitted to the bank. If McElroy had withdrawn the sum of $8,500 in cash, and paid it to the bank in discharge of his debt, the bank, in the absence of knowledge or suspicion that, in doing so, McElroy was violating a fiduciary obligation to the appellant, would have been protected. But the existence of the suspicion which, for the reasons I have given, must be imputed to the local officials of the bank, is a complete answer to any defence by the bank resting upon the hypothesis that they were bona fide transferees. The cheque in McElroy's hands was held by him under this fiduciary burden and the bank cannot in the circumstances retain the proceeds of it (John v. Dodwell)[7].\nI am assuming for the moment that under the power of attorney, McElroy had authority to bind the appellant in his application of the moneys in her account in such a way that she could not question his notes as against persons dealing with him bona fide; and in particular that a payment of his debt, bona fide received by the bank, would not be open to such question. I shall discuss the power of attorney later. Whatever the scope of his powers under that instrument, those powers were conferred upon him for a specified purpose\u2014the investment of the appellant's money. Any moneys in his hands drawn from her account would be subject to the trust for investment; and in the circumstances of this case, the slightest knowledge or suspicion on the part of the bankers that McElroy was not, in paying his debt to the bank, acting loyally in the performance of his fiduciary duty to his principal would be sufficient, in the absence of enquiry, to make the bank accountable to the principal. (Foxton v. Manchester[8]; Coleman v. Union Bank[9]; A. G. v. De Winton[10]; John v. Dodwell7); B. A. Elevator Co. v. Bank B.N.A.[11].\nI turn now to the substantive defences. And first, as to estoppel. The estoppel set up is almost entirely grounded upon acquiescence. Acquiescence strictly imports a standing by in silence while, and with knowledge that a violation of one's right is in progress by somebody who is ignorant of the right. There is nothing of that sort here. The violation of the appellant's rights was a completed act before she became aware of it, and the sole question is whether she has lost her remedy. The remedy of one who has been deprived of his property by the fraud of another who had possession or control of it under a fiduciary obligation to him is, as a rule, twofold. He has a personal remedy, and he has a proprietary remedy; that is to say, he is entitled, under certain conditions, to follow, and require restitution of, his property. It is this latter remedy which the appellant prays, and, as I have said, her right to it, if it had been claimed without delay, is not denied.\nApart from one alleged conversation between the appellant and Chambers, the assistant manager of the bank, the basis of the bank's contention under this head is the fact that the appellant, after learning that McElroy had used the money drawn from her account to pay the bank, did not, for two years, inform the bank of McElroy's fraud.\nSilence is effective as creating an estoppel only where there is a duty to speak. Was there any duty to speak arising out of what McElroy told the appellant in June, 1930? Her account of it is that McElroy, having informed her he had taken her money to pay the bank, she asked him why he had done so, and his answer was that\nWeaver told him to take it, he said I would be back and I was a widow, and I would want to marry him and he told him to take my money and pay it back.\nI shall have something to say about this evidence later. I. mention it here because the majority of the Court of Appeal attach some weight to it in this connection.\nIf the appellant believed McElroy, then the whole basis of the defence of estoppel by silence disappears, because, if Weaver had instigated McElroy's fraud, there could be no duty upon the appellant to give him information about what he already, ex hypothesi, knew too well.\nFurthermore, it is quite plain that the bank did not act upon any supposed representation arising out of the appellant's conduct. Neither the manager nor assistant manager suggests that the bank was influenced by the appellant's silence.\nI have already quoted passages from the evidence of Weaver in which he leaves us in no doubt as to the position of the bank. He had the power of attorney and the cheque, and since he considered the cheque was within the authority given, he concerned himself about nothing else. If the appellant had made a claim she would have been confronted with the power of attorney.\nBut the weakness of the bank's case, in so far as it rests upon estoppel by acquiescence, lies deeper. The remedy the appellant seeks to enforce is, as I have said, the pro- prietary remedy. In a proceeding in a court of equity, the appellant, having, as the Alberta courts have unanimously held, established her equitable title to the moneys, cannot be denied her remedy on the ground of acquiescence unless with a full knowledge of her rights and with independent advice, she has confirmed the impeachable transaction (De Busshe v. Alt[12]; Moxon v. Payne[13]).\nIt is quite plain, I think, from the whole of the evidence that she had no knowledge of her rights and she expressly says she did not know that the bank had done anything wrong. She knew, no doubt, that she had executed a power of attorney, and knowledge of the effect of that cannot be imputed to her in the absence of advice upon it. Moyer, to whom she took McElroy's promissory note in 1931 with the hope of getting some settlement from him, never suggested to her that she might have some remedy against the bank. Indeed, it seems probable that Moyer knew nothing about the transaction with the bank.\nChambers, the assistant manager of the bank, from whom she learned of McElroy's unauthorized withdrawals, explained the transaction to her as a loan to McElroy. Not a word was said to her by him about the purpose for which the money had been used. Down to the very eve of the present proceedings, she appears to have had no suspicion whatever that the bank was in any way accountable to her. Indeed, to me, it sems in the highest degree improbable that it would have occurred to a woman in her position, with her lack of experience in business, that the conduct of the bank could be affected by any inactivity on her part. She would, beyond question, assume, if she thought about it at all, that the bank had taken, and would take, all the necessary measures for its own protection. In' this respect, the case bears no sort of analogy to such cases as Ewing v. Dominion Bank[14] where a man of business experience is informed by a bank that his signature is attached to a commercial paper, takes no steps to disabuse his informant, who, he must know, will probably act on faith of the signature. Nor has it any sort of resemblance to Greenwood v. Martin's Bank[15] where the House of Lords had to consider a case in which the silence upon which the estoppel was founded was, to quote the words of Lord Tomlin (at p. 58),\ndeliberate and intended to produce the effect which it in fact produced, viz., the leaving of the respondents in ignorance of the true facts so that no action might be taken by them against the appellants's wife.\n* * *\nThe course of conduct relied upon (Lord Tomlin says at p. 59) as founding the estoppel was adopted in order to leave the respondents in the condition of ignorance in which the appellant knew they were. It was the duty of the appellant to remove that condition however caused. It is the existence of this duty, coupled with the appellant's deliberate intention to maintain the respondents in their condition of ignorance, that gives its significance to the appellant's silence.\nAt p. 57, Lord Tomlin states the essential factors of an estoppel where it is alleged that a failure to disclose facts has deprived one of the parties of this opportunity to take proceedings against a third person. The first two of these factors are:\n1. A representation or conduct amounting to a representation intended to induce a course of conduct on the part of the person to whom the representation is made.\n2. An act or commission resulting from the representation, whether actual or by conduct, by the person to which the representation is made.\nIt seems little less than fantastic to ascribe to the appellant an intention to induce by her silence the course of conduct which was followed by the bank; and equally so to suggest that from her point of view, her silence was calculated to induce that course, or any other course of conduct by the bank; and once again, equally so, to say that anything the bank did was the result of an interpretation of the appellant's conduct by them as amounting to a representation of any description whatever.\nThen as to ratification. It is important here to recall that there was a fiduciary bond between McElroy and the appellant as well as the legal relation of principal and agent. It is also most important to observe that the transaction was, by McElroy and the bank, given a form in which it consisted of two separable and separate acts; first, a loan by the appellant to McElroy through McElroy, her attorney; and then a payment by McElroy personally to the bank in liquidation of his debt.\nI have quoted the evidence of the bank manager in which he makes it clear that the bank's interpretation of the transaction was that the payment by McElroy to the bank was not an act done in his representative capacity, but a personal payment made on his own behalf out of his own moneys. The cheque was made payable to McElroy and, notwithstanding the fact that the sole purpose of drawing the cheque was to put McElroy in funds to pay the bank, the fair interpretation of what occurred is that both McElroy and the bank treated the transaction throughout as possessing the character I have indicated.\nIt is not entirely without relevancy to notice that in their communications with the appellant, the bank's officials admittedly presented the transaction to her as a loan to McElroy, making no reference to the application of the proceeds of the loan; implying clearly that the only phase of the transaction in which she was concerned was the first phase.\nThat could not, of course, in the least degree, militate against the right of the appellant to treat the moneys in McElroy's hands as funds held by him in trust for her, or against her right to enforce the trust against the bank, in the circumstances in which the fund was in fact transferred. Nevertheless, McElroy was not professing to act as her agent in paying the bank, and the bank was not receiving the money from anybody acting as the appellant's agent. This is a most important consideration because it follows that, as McElroy did not profess to represent the appellant in paying the bank, his act in doing so was not one which the appellant could validly make her own by ratification.\nIn this view, the issue of ratification is not of much importance because we are only concerned on this appeal, as I have already said, with the appellant's proprietary remedy against the bank. Nevertheless, it is desirable, I think, to call attention to the difficulty of holding that ratification has been established, even as between the appellant and McElroy. The acts relied upon as constituting ratification consist principally of three:\n(1) Delay in taking proceedings to call McElroy to account after she became aware in June 1930, of McElroy's withdrawals;\n(2) Steps taken by her through Moyer to procure some kind of settlement from McElroy; (3) An agreement in the autumn of 1931 to renew the note signed by McElroy on the 29th of June, and to accept security from McElroy in the form of an assignment of his rights under that agreement. Ratification must consist of words or conduct recognizing clearly the authorized act as the act of the ratifying principal. Now, I should have much difficulty in holding that the appellant really intended to recognize McElroy's withdrawal of her money from the bank as her act, or as an act rightfully done by him. Of course, a person may be bound, whatever his actual state of mind may be, by acts unequivocally evincing a recognition as his own of an unauthorized act; but I am far from satisfied, when the circumstances and the relations of the parties are all considered, that (apart from the point of knowledge of the nature of the transaction which I am about to discuss) what the appellant did falls within this category. When she was first informed of McElroy's withdrawals, it is quite evident that the information came to her as a blow. She was quite ill at the time and shortly afterwards underwent an operation for goitre. It was during her stay in the hospital, and while still ill and suffering, that she told Moyer McElroy owed her money, and that she heard from McElroy that her money had been used to pay his debt to the bank. For something like a year after this, the note signed by McElroy remained in possession of the bank. Then having for the first time had it in her hand, she handed it to Moyer. Moyer says that later she consented to accept a \"renewal\" of this note accompanied by a transfer of some agreement as security; but she herself says she never so agreed; and Moyer's evidence is not at all clear as to what actually took place. He says, it is true, that she assented to the proposed arrangement ; but he says, also, that a day or two afterwards she revoked her assent. His instructions, I gather, were revoked before McElroy had actually executed anything. McElroy appears at all times to have been holding out promises of restitution. I repeat, it is not established to my entire satisfaction that, when all the circumstances are considered (including the relations of the parties), there was an unequivocal recognition of McElroy's misappropriation as her own act.\nHowever that may be, the bank has not, in my judgment, established that the appellant was in possession of that knowledge of the nature of the transaction and of the material incidents of it, the existence of which would be an essential condition of a binding ratification. There is nothing to indicate that she knew the actual form of the transaction. There is nothing to indicate that she was acquainted with the facts which, as I have explained, convince me that, by reason of the conduct of its local officials, to use the phrase of Mr. Justice McGillivray, the bank cannot be treated as an \"innocent party.\" She actually knew nothing of this conduct; and, although the loan was treated by the parties as separate from the transfer to the bank, I do not think you can disregard that conduct, as immaterial, within the meaning of the rule which makes full knowledge an essential condition.\nI am, of course, not overlooking the communication which she says McElroy made to her in the hospital touching Weaver's part in securing the repayment of the loan to McElroy. I think that may be put aside because the learned trial judge evidently did not think the appellant had treated the communication seriously; otherwise, he could hardly have used the language he did in discussing and rejecting the application to dismiss the action at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case. The learned trial judge, in his view of this passage in the evidence, would be much influenced by the manner in which the story was told. My impression is that nobody at the trial was disposed to treat the commuication very seriously. The manager, as might have been expected, contradicted McElroy's statement emphatically.\nThe bank relies upon an interview between the assistant manager Chambers and the appellant which, according to the evidence of the appellant, took place in June, 1930. Chambers says that at this interview he noticed the appellant expressed her surprise at the amount of McElroy's withdrawals saying she had not expected him to borrow so much. He also says that the appellant told him that she was confused and could not remember the arrangement she made with McElroy on her departure for Ontario. This evidence was obviously offered for the purpose of supporting a suggestion that the appellant had assented to the use of the money by McElroy. The learned trial judge, as I have already mentioned, held that she gave no such assent, adding that counsel for the defendant did not contend that she had done so. I agree with Mr. Justice McGillivray that this evidence is of little assistance.\nI should add that, in my judgment, the evidence is quite sufficient to support the findings of fact necessary to sustain the conclusion of the learned trial judge on the issues of estoppel and ratification.\nI have one further observation to make upon ratification. Such acts as those relied upon by the bank as constituting ratification could, in my judgment, afford no answer in any case to the appellant's claim against the bank to recover the money as a trust fund (John v. Dodwell)[16].\nI come now to the power of attorney. It is in these words:\nKnow all men by these presents that I, Mary Victoria Begley, of the city of Calgary, in the province of Alberta, have made and appointed and by these presents do make and appoint James Wesley McElroy of the city of Calgary in the province of Alberta or any substitute appointed by him in writing, my true and lawful attorney to enter into, manage and carry out for me and in my name any and every financial transaction with the Imperial Bank of Canada, and particularly, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing, to make all arrangements for credits, discounts and advances and the carrying of my account with the said bank, and to carry out the said arrangements, with power to vary, modify or rescind the same and to make new arrangements, and for me and in my name to draw and sign cheques, including those creating an overdraft, on the said bank or any other bank or banker, and receive the moneys thereon; to state and settle accounts; to endorse all cheques in which I am interested; to make and endorse in my name promissory notes; to draw, accept and endorse drafts and bills of exchange; to waive presentment, protest and notice of dishonour of negotiable instruments; to sign and endorse warehouse receipts; to endorse bills of lading; to pledge securities and negotiable instruments; to assign mortgages, policies of insurance, choses in action and book accounts and all moneys payable in respect thereof; to transfer shares in any company or corporation; to mortgage lands and securities upon lands or chattels; to give and agree to give security upon goods, wares, merchandise and other products and things upon which a bank may lawfully take security; and otherwise to pay or secure the payment to the Imperial Bank of Canada of any and all sums of moneys for which I may be from time to time liable to the said bank, whether directly or indirectly, with full power from time to time to make any agreement with reference to all or any of the said securities; to substitute other securities in the place of any securities relinquished by the bank; to confirm all or any securities held by the bank, and to release to the bank any right of redeeming the same or any of them, or any other right with reference thereto; and generally for me to do and transact any business in my name with the said Imperial Bank of Canada which I could transact in person, and in my name to bind me on any and all deeds, conveyances, assurances, convenants, contracts, assignments, transfers, agreements and guarantees in the same manner as I could do in person; I hereby ratifying whatever my said attorney shall do.\nAnd I further covenant and agree with the said bank, in consideration of the said bank accepting the acts done under this power, that I will ratify and confirm all acts, deeds, conveyances, assurances, contracts, covenants, assignments, transfers, agreements, guarantees and other matters and things which my said attorney may make, do, sign, execute or enter into with the said bank, and will repay all moneys my said attorney or any substitute may borrow or receive from the said bank whilst acting or assuming to act under this power, and that without regard to whether the transaction in question is or is not within the scope of the authority given herein.\nThis power of attorney may be exercised in the names of my heirs, devisees, executors or administrators, and shall continue in force as well after as before my death, and shall be revocable only after written notice of revocation signed by me or my executors or administrators has been served upon the manager of the said bank at Calgary, Alberta, and has been acknowledged by him in writing.\nAnd I do declare that my said attorney shall have the power from time to time to appoint any substitute or substitutes for any or all of the purposes aforesaid, and every such substitution at pleasure to revoke by notice in writing served upon the manager before mentioned.\nThe primary purpose of this instrument obviously is to confer upon McElroy authority to transact businness with the Imperial Bank of Canada as the agent of the appellant. Some of the phrases in the instrument are very sweeping, but it has long been settled that powers of attorney are to be construed strictly; and it was laid down by the Privy Council in Bryant v. La Banque du Peuple[17] that\nwhere authority to do an act purporting to be done under a power of attorney is challenged, it is necessary to show that on a fair construction of the whole instrument the authority in question is to be found within the four corners of the instrument either in express terms or by necessary implication;\nand powers given in the widest terms have been held not to extend, for example, to the making of presents, or to the granting away of the principle's property without consideration.\nIn Reckitt v. Barnett[18] Mr. Justice Russell (as he then was) says:\nThe primary object of a power of attorney is to enable the attorney to act in the management of his principal's affairs.\nIt would require, he says, in a power of attorney,\nwords unambiguous and irrestible to justify the attribution to the instrument of \"a meaning and intention\" to enable the attorney to do what he liked with the plaintiff's moneys, even to the extent of applying them in payment of his own personal debts.\nMr. Justice Russell refers to, and in part rests his judgment upon, the decision of the Court of Chancery Appeals in In re Bowles[19] in which that court had to construe a power of attorney that enabled the attorney\nto act on his behalf in all matters relating to his property, and to the affairs of the company, and to mortgage, charge, or otherwise incumber all or any part of his freehold and leasehold estates, stocks, shares and effects in England, and to lease the same for any term of years, and absolutely to sell all his said estates and effects.\nPurporting to act under this instrument, the attorney executed a mortgage in favour of the company, of which he was the secretary and of which the principal was a shareholder, to secure a past debt. Lord Justice James, in delivering judgment, said,\n* * * the mortgage was of no value. Whatever might be the legal effect of the power of attorney under which the mortgage was executed, it was clear that it could not authorize the donee of the power to execute a deed as a voluntary gift. But this was a voluntary mortgage in consideration of a past debt, executed under a power of attorney given by a shareholder of the company in whose favour the mortgage was made. The mortgage was clearly invalid, and the Vice-Chancellor was right in dismissing the petition.\nIn this judgment, Lord Justice Mellish concurred. The decision is a decision of the Court of Chancery Appeals; but, in addition to that, the decision and the judgment have the weight which attaches to all the pronouncements of the two eminent judges who exercised the powers of the court on that occasion.\nThe power of attorney with which we are concerned does not, in express terms, or by necessary implication, authorize the making of gifts; nor do I think it authorizes the attorney to make any disposition he likes to make of the appellant's money and property, to apply such money, for example, in the payment of his own debts. While the general clauses are very sweeping, there is a specific clause which deals with the subject of the payment of debts due to the bank and the giving of security for such debts and the dealing with such securities. These provisions are very elaborate and very sweeping except as to one point; that is to say, that the liabilities to the bank which the attorney is authorized to discharge and secure, are limited to liabilities of the principal. There is, of course, the specific de- claration that the generality of the general power to transact business with the bank is not to be limited by the particulars which follow, but I do not think it is a fair construction of this power of attorney to hold that these words are sufficient to sweep away the conditions and qualifications expressed in the sentences which deal with the paying and securing of liabilities to the bank. The point, I need hardly say, is by no means free from difficulty, and I have come to this conclusion after a good deal of hesitation, but I think, on the whole, it is the right view of the effect of this instrument; and, if so, obviously, the withdrawal of the money for the sole purpose of applying it in a manner not authorized by the power of attorney was an abuse of the power of which the bank had full knowledge and, consequently, as between, not only McElroy and the bank, but also as between the bank and the appellant, an act not binding on the appellant.\nIn any case, it is very clear to me that this power of attorney does not invest the attorney with authority to release himself from his fiduciary obligation to the principal in respect of property of the principal's which has come into his hands, or to release the transferee of such property from transmitted fiduciary obligations. Any such a transaction would be entirely outside the contemplation of the instrument.\nThe appellant is, therefore, entitled to restitution of the sum of $8,500 with interest from the 29th of June, 1929. I have been unable, however, to reach the conclusion that, as regards the later cheques, the bank is responsible.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be set aside and the judgment of the trial judge varied by striking out the third paragraph. There should be no costs of the appeal to the Appellate Division but the appellant should have the costs of the appeal to this court.\nCANNON J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing (McGillivray J. dissenting) the judgment rendered by the trial judge in favour of plaintiff for $11,000 with interest, amount of alleged unauthorized withdrawals of her funds with the connivance of the bank.\nThe plaintiff is a widow. Her husband having died in December, 1928, one James Wesley McElroy, their neigh- bour and friend, administered the estate and got his discharge as administrator on or about June 21, 1929; he then deposited the estate's money in the savings department of the defendant bank, at Calgary, to the plaintiff's personal account which had been in operation for several years past.\nOn June 24, 1929, the plaintiff executed a power of attorney in the office of her solicitor and lodged it with the defendant bank. This was on one of the bank's forms and authorized McElroy, inter alia, \"for her and in her name to draw and sign cheques * * * and receive the moneys thereon.\"\nOn the 26th June, 1929, after having told the defendant that she was going east and having a portion of her money transferred to Hamilton, the plaintiff left Calgary for a visit to Ontario.\nMr. McElroy had been farming on a rather large scale in the neighbourhood of Calgary for some years; and he had been indebted to the defendant bank on both direct and indirect liabilities for comparatively large amounts varying from time to time.\nOn June 29th, 1929, the bank held a third mortgage on a considerable portion of his farm, which security was surrendered or destroyed when he paid the amount of his direct liability on that date. His account was not closed and it was not carried on and further advances were made to him subsequent thereto. On that 29th day of June, 1929, a Saturday, a few minutes bewore closing hour, McElroy told Mr. Chambers, the accountant of the bank, that he intended to pay off his debt of $8,518.78, which amount he was going to borrow from Mrs. Begley's funds for that purpose. He signed a note for $8,500 in her favour. He also drew as attorney a cheque against plaintiff's account for $8,500 which he deposited, with $18.78, to his own credit and thereby balanced his personal account and his direct liability. Subsequently McElroy drew other cheques as plaintiff's attorney against her account in the defendant bank, to the order of third parties, which were paid.\nThe plaintiff returned to Calgary about the middle of December, 1929. She had several interviews with McElroy, was in the bank and had her passbook marked up. Subsequently thereto, on the 2nd of January, 1930, she issued a cheque to McElroy through the respondent bank for $1,400 by way of loan.\nThereafter she was often in the bank and had her passbook written up and was also shown the $8,500 note and all the cheques that had been issued by McElroy against her account. The plaintiff said in her evidence that while she was in the hospital, in June, 1930, McElroy told her that he had paid the bank with her money. He promised to pay it back in the Fall. He had 1,600 acres in crop. While in the hospital, plaintiff told her then solicitor Moyer that McElroy had her money and changed her will leaving ing him out as executor.\nNow, what was appellant's behaviour after she knew of McElroy's use of her money to pay his debt to the bank?\nOn July 9th, 1930, the plaintiff was in the bank, but never spoke to Chambers, the accountant, or to the manager, Weaver, about this transaction or of the transfer of her funds to McElroy's credit.\nOn the 10th July, 1930, the plaintiff left by motor for Spokane, driving with McElroy who remained in Spokane three days. They seemed to have been on the best of terms, although they quarrelled about these matters, but made up before he left. She was told that he would pay the bank the money that Fall.\nAfter remaining in Spokane about a month, plaintiff returned to Calgary and was in the bank at least four times before the end of October, and never gave a hint that she disapproved of what had been done; she even took possession of and withdrew the $8,500 note from the custody of the defendant bank and took it to the Bank of Montreal.\nOn the 31st of July, 1931, she got the first note from the Bank of Montreal and secured from McElroy a new note dated the 1st of August, 1931, for $9,419.11, payable in one year, and stipulated an interest of 6 per cent. She then went to the Bank of Montreal and put this note in her deposit box. It was understood that McElroy would pay as much as possible out of the crop that year.\nOn the 24th July, 1932, plaintiff writes to McElroy referring to Mr. McElroy's note will soon be due which he put off on an ignorant woman who was in love.\nFrom the 1st to the 3rd September, 1932, plaintiff accepted a renewal note for $10,224, and arranged for security at the office of her solicitor Moyer who had been trying to secure protection for her claim against McElroy. The papers were prepared and signed by McElroy; but she afterwards countermanded her instructions and, having consulted with Mr. Taylor, started the present proceedings against the bank to recover the amounts of several cheques drawn by McElroy as her attorney.\nThe parties and the courts below seem to concur in the view that the respondent could have been compelled to reimburse the $8,500 at the moment when, in December, 1929, or January or June, 1930, the appellant first heard of what had been done, if she had, as a matter of fact, never agreed to loan to McElroy the amount in question.\nThe bank was certainly, to say the least, negligent at the outset. But the defendant has pleaded that the plaintiff not only authorized the issue by McElroy of the cheque but also, on the 2nd of January, 1930, and on the occasion of each and every renewal of the note, ratified the act of the said McElroy in issuing the cheque and the use thereof. The defendant also sets up that the plaintiff by her conduct has elected to waive the wrong, if any, in connection with the $8,500 cheque and to treat the transaction from the beginning as a duly authorized loan of money by her to McElroy. The defendant alleges that by reason of the authority given by the plaintiff to McElroy, and her knowledge, acts, omissions and conduct and by reason of the financial position of McElroy and the security and opportunity that have been lost to the defendant, the plaintiff is estopped and should not be heard to allege or prove the facts set forth in the statement of claim.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Alberta has dealt with these aspects of the case with much care; and there is hardly anything to add to his remarks. But it would be useful to insert here some abstracts from the evidence of the appellant to show the extent of her knowledge of what had taken place and her determination to accept McElroy as her debtor and shield him as against the bank: Q. But McElroy did tell you that the money had, that he had paid the money to the Imperial Bank?\u2014A. He told me that when I was in the hospital.\nQ. I think it was at this particular time that McElroy told you that you did hot need to worry about the amount, that he was going to pay it that Fall?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You were quite satisfied with that, were you, I mean you thought he would pay it?\u2014A. I do not know as I was just satisfied. Well I thought he would.\nQ. I asked you two questions. But you did think he would pay it that Fall?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You knew that that particular year he had some 1,600 acres in wheat?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And of course, the prospects at that particular time were favourable, I mean the crop prospects were favourable?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. This conversation that you had with McElroy I believe, Mrs. Begley, was some four or five days before you left for Spokane, of course, you told me you had one in the hospital but you had another one four or five days before you left for Spokane?\u2014A. I have forgotten.\nQ. In any event you know at that time that McElroy had taken your money or some of your money?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. There is no manner of question about that at all is there?\u2014A. No.\n* * *\nQ Now as a result of the information which you got you knew that McElroy had taken some of your money and used it to pay his debt to the bank, didn't you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You knew that before you took this trip to Spokane with Mr. McElroy?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Now you knew, of course, at that time that that was a very wrong thing for Mr. McElroy to do, didn't you?\u2014A. For to take the money?\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You knew at that time, of course, it was a very wrong thing for the bank to have used the money in that particular way didn't you? \u2014A. I did not know that they should not, I did not know about that.\nQ. You did not know about that?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Didn't you think it was improper for them at that time to have taken the money without any instructions from you to McElroy and used it for paying his indebtedness to the bank?\u2014A. Well I do not remember just what I did think about it.\nQ. You would have thought there was something wrong about it anyway, put it that way?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Didn't you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In any event regardless of what you thought about it you were satisfied from the conditions generally that McElroy would pay it back? \u2014A. I thought he would.\nQ. And that he would pay it back that Fall?\u2014A. He said so.\nQ. Well you must have been satisfied weren't you that he would do it? \u2014A. I thought he would all right.\nQ. And so you were prepared to wait until the crop season was over? \u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. As a matter of fact you got a renewal note for this indebtedness on the 1st of August, 1930, didn't you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Have you got that note?\u2014A. Mr. Taylor has it. Q. What is this document, Mrs. Begley?\u2014A. Well that is Mr. McElroy's note.\nQ. That is the note and what is the date of it?\u2014A. August 1st.\nQ. 1931?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. The Court: What did you say about renewing the note, how did you come to meet Mr. McElroy?\u2014A. Mr. McElroy was to be in at ten o'clock Saturday morning to have the note fixed up and he did not come until just about a quarter to 12 and we had to rush then to get down to get it into the bank. I did not take time to look at it until I was putting it in the deposit box and I noticed then it was Nine thousand dollars and something.\nQ. Mr. Shaw: Yes, now you had told McElroy before this that you wanted to get this note renewed hadn't you, it was your suggestion that you should get a renewal of this note?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And so he came up and the amount was figured out in your apartment, he gave you this new note which is now exhibit 23 to you and you gave him back the $8,500 note, is that not right?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And then he drove you down to the bank so that you could put in the bank the $9,400 note which you had, which he had just given to you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I notice that the original note for $8,500 was with interest at seven per cent. I believe there was an arrangement by which that was to be reduced to six per cent?\u2014A. Yes, he asked me, he said you are only getting six per cent from others why do I have to pay you seven? I said, \"You pay me up in September and you can have it for six too.\"\nQ. The understanding was that he was to pay, although the note was taken for a year, he was to pay as much as he could or all of it if possible within, or all of it out of that year's crop?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Or from any other source I suppose?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. Did you after that date (1st of August, 1931) at any time suggest to or discuss with any of the defendant bank officers, the matter of this wrongful taking by McElroy?\u2014A. No, I just showed that note to the manager, that was all, and he told me to go to my solicitor.\nQ. You are speaking of the Bank of Montreal?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I am speaking about the Imperial Bank?\u2014A. I never was in there after.\nQ. You never discussed with Chambers or Weaver or Mackie\u2014A. After I got these notes from Mr. McElroy I was never in.\nQ. It would be obviously clear in your mind that you never suggested the wrongful taking by McElroy?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And I assume from the evidence we already have had that you have never discussed it with any of the officers of the bank previously either?\u2014A. Before that?\nQ. Yes.\u2014A. About the $8,500?\nQ. I mean about the wrongful taking by McElroy without your authority?\u2014A. No.\nQ. That would be a correct statement I take it, Mrs. Begley?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And I suppose, Mrs. Begley, that it would be fair to say your first complaint to the bank would be through your solicitor, Mr. Taylor, that would be correct would it not?\u2014A. My complaint to the bank, about the bank, yes.\nQ. Or to the bank?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * * Mr. Shaw: And that I believe must have been about October, 1932? \u2014A. Yes.\nIt is said that\nit seems little less than fantastic to ascribe to the appellant an intention to induce by her silence the course of conduct which was followed by the bank towards her friend McElroy.\nWith due respect, I cannot ignore her own letter of January 13, 1931, and her admission that she was telling lies in order to shield the latter.\nMrs. Begley, I show you this document, what is that, is that your signature?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That is a letter written by you to McElroy is it not?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Dated Calgary, January, 13th, 1931?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Mr. Shaw: I am going to ask to have this letter put in. (Document in question was then marked exhibit \"24\" and was read to the jury by Mr. Shaw).\nQ. Now in connection with that communication in your examination for discovery I asked you at question 1383\n\"1383. Q. So you were telling these lies for the purpose of shielding\nMcElroy, is that what you meant by that.\u2014A. Well, it looks that way.\"\nYou still agree with that?\u2014A. Yes, it was not just meant in those ways but I could not just explain how it was.\nIn Scott v. Bank of New Brunswick[20] this court held:\nIf payment is obtained from a debtor by one who falsely represents that he is an agent of the creditor, upon whom a fraud is thereby committed, if the creditor ratifies and confirms the payment he adopts the agency of the person receiving the money and makes the payment equivalent to one to an authorized agent.\nThe payment may be ratified and the agency adopted, even though the person receiving the money has, by his false representations, committed an indictable offence.\nIn this case also, the doctrine of ratification is invoked, to use the words of Chief Justice Strong, in the above case, at page 283,\nfor the purpose of fixing a party, by reason of his adoption of it, with the legal consequences of an act which, whatever may have been the circumstances which attended it and brought it about has a de facto existence.\nThe payment made to the bank with appellant's money is a substantial act susceptible of ratification; and for two years after she heard what McElroy had done with the $8,500 cheque she never complained or advised the bank of her intention to deny the loan to McElroy; and, moreover, she repeatedly, by renewing the notes and exacting interest, adopted and ratified the alleged loan of her money by McElroy in order to pay the bank. It would be difficult to conceive stronger acts of ratification than those in evi- dence in this case. Surely, to paraphrase the late Chief Justice Strong, if an agent, after converting to his own use moneys received from the principal's debtor, undertakes to pay to the principal money to the same amount that which he has received from the principal's debtor in assumed discharge of the debt, the principal could not afterwards, while retaining the money, compel the debtor to pay a second time. In such a case, the receipt of the money from the fraudulent agent would be such a recognition of the agency as to place the debtor in the same position as if the pretended agent had had full authority to keep the money at the time he received payment from the debtor. What difference, in principle, can there be between actual receipt of money and accepting notes bearing interest, as appellant did in this case? Having secured from McElroy these notes for the amount of the supposed loan, the appellant cannot keep those notes and, at the same time, ask her debtor, the respondent, to pay her a second time the amount paid to McElroy under the power of attorney, even if the latter at first did more than what he was authorized to do as her agent. These facts reveal a conduct that is only consistent with a waiver of her complaint against the bank. In this case, to hold that appellant has not waived the alleged lack of authority of McElroy would be to allow her to take up the inconsistent position of at once \"approbating and reprobating.\"\nLord Blackburn, in the case of McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[21], says:\nIt is quite immaterial whether this ratification was made to the person who seeks to avail himself of it or to another.\nChief Justice Strong, in the same case of Scott v. The Bank of New Brunswick[22], said that the distinction between ratification and estoppel is well pointed out in a case of Forsyth v. Day[23], where it is said:\nThe distinction between a contract intentionally assented to or ratified in fact and an estoppel to deny the validity of the contract is very wide. In the former case the party is bound because he intended to be; in the latter he is bound, notwithstanding there was no such intention, because the other party will be prejudiced and defrauded by his conduct unless the law treat him as legally bound. In one case the party is bound because the contract contains the necessary ingredients to bind him including a consideration. In the other he is not bound for these reasons but because he has permitted the other party to act to his prejudice under such circumstances that he must have known or be presumed to have known that such party was acting on the faith of his conduct and acts being what they purported to be without apprising him to the contrary.\nDoes justice require, as between the parties before us, that their rights and liabilities should be determined, so far as this particular transaction, the subject of our investigation, is concerned, on the assumption that a certain fact, or state of facts is true, whether in fact it be so or not? Can the bank exact from the appellant an admission that the loan to McElroy actually took place, or was at least confirmed and ratified? Was the appellant legally in duty bound, when she discovered the alleged fraud of McElroy, to tell the truth to the bank immediately? By reason of such breach of duty towards the bank, has the latter sustained damages? If so, has the bank, however negligent it may have been at the outset, been misled afterwards to believe that McElroy's representation that the money was being loaned to him by the appellant was true? In other words, are the respondents, in the circumstances of this case, entitled to set up an estoppel?\nAccording to the plaintiff, she became aware, in June 1930, of the fact that McElroy paid his own debt to the bank with moneys drawn from her account under the power of attorney. There is no doubt that at that time she was, either from friendship or love, disposed to help and shield McElroy and did not want, by disclosing the true facts, to bring trouble between him and the bank. She deliberately refrained from speaking to the bank and did not and would not have the latter debit McElroy's account with the amount which might have been reinstated to her credit. She made a loan of $1,400 to McElroy, to the bank's knowledge. She also accepted and withdrew from the bank the promissory note which was given by McElroy as an acknowledgment of the alleged loan. Her conduct amounts, in my opinion, to a representation intended to induce the bank to believe that McElroy was truly authorized by his principal to act as he did on the 29th of June 1929 and that his debt to the bank was definitely, well and truly paid, and, that, therefore, the bank had no more reason to protect their interest against McElroy.\nThe bank, as a result of this conduct amounting to representation, refrained from pressing McElroy and missed at least during two crop years to collect from him any claim that they might have revived against him if the payment made out of the appellant's funds had to be set aside. The act of the bank in crediting this amount to McElroy and giving up the security they held, and their omission from that date to take any action to collect their advances to him, would, if the plaintiff could now recover against the bank, evidently cause detriment to the letter.\nI find here the essential factors giving rise to an estoppel as propounded by the House of Lords in the recent case of Greenwood v. Martin's Bank[24]. At page 58 Lord Tomlin says:\nI do not think that it is any answer to say that if the respondents had not been negligent initially the detriment would not have occurred. The course of conduct relied upon as founding the estoppel was adopted in order to leave the respondents in the condition of ignorance in which the appellant knew they were. It was the duty of the appellant to remove that condition however caused. It is the existence of this duty, coupled with the appellant's deliberate intention to maintain the respondents in their condition of ignorance, that gives its significance to the appellant's silence. What difference can it make that the condition of ignorance was primarly induced by the respondent's own negligence? In my judgment it can make none. For the purposes of the estoppel, which is a procedural matter, the cause of the ignorance is an irrelevant consideration.\nThe above remarks apply aptly to this case. The bank may have had more or less good reasons to believe McElroy's statement that he had procured a loan from the appellant; if the latter did not loan the money, she, by her conduct, induced the bank to believe that she had actually loaned the money, or, if she had not really done so before the 29th of June, 1929, that she had ratified the transaction.\nI would therefore, both on the ground of ratification and of estoppel, find in favour of the bank.\nAs far as the subsequent cheques totalling $2,500 are concerned, the authority of Bryant v. Quebec Bank[25], is amply sufficient to justify the payments by the respondent and we must agree with the unanimous findings of the Appellate Division.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1934] 1 W.W.R. 689.\n[2] (1870) 5 Ch.
