C, J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nThe Dominion Elections Act 1874 sees. 82 83 and 84Public peace\u2014Colorable employment\u2014Liability of candidate for the acts of persons employed by agent \u2014 Bribery.\nOn a charge of bribery against one T. and one A., upon which this appeal was decided, the Judge who tried the petition found as a fact that A had been directed by T. an admitted agent of the respondent, to employ a number of persons to act as policemen at one of the polling places in the parish of Bay St. Paul on the polling day, and had bribed four voters previously known to be supporters of the appellant, by giving them $2 each, but held that A. was not agent of the respondent, and, therefore his acts could not avoid the election. The facts of this case are fully set out below.\nHeld, on appeal, that as there was no excuse or justification for employing these voters, their employment was merely colorable and these voters having changed their votes in consequence of the money so paid to them, and the sitting member being responsible alike for the acts of A., the sub agent, as for the acts of T., the agent, and they having been guilty of corrupt practices, the election was void. (Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J., holding that A, the sub-agent alone, had been guilty of bribery.)\nTHIS was an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Routhier, of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, District of Saguenay delivered the 15th day of September 1880, dismissing the petition against the return of Joseph Stanislas Perrault as member of the House of Commons for the Electoral District of the County of Charlevoix, in the Province of Quebec\nThe appellants limited their appeal to four charges of corruption by the candidate and sixteen charges of corruption by agents.\nThis appeal was determined upon the fifth charge known as the Tarte and Allard case.\nOne P. Allard was charged with having, under the authority of one Tarte, bribed four voters, viz; A. Bouchard, E. Martin, S. Boivin and J. Gagnon\u2014previously petitioner's supporters\u2014by the payment of $2 to each of them. Tarte who was the brother-in-law of the respondent, and admitted to be his general agent in the western part of the county, on the receipt of certain letters and telegrams, informing him that roughs were coming down from Quebec to interrupt the peaceable voting of the electors, did not enquire to ascertain whether the reports in these telegrams and letters were well founded or not nor take the proper steps to secure by legal means the public peace, but stated that he had applied to Hon. Mr. Langevin or Hon. Mr. Masson for a detachment of \"B\" Battery and receiving no reply, asked the captain of the volunteer company at Baie St. Paul if he could keep order with his men and that the latter replied he did not consider himself authorized to do so. Tarte thereupon gave Allard money, and asked him to employ persons to act as policemen and further induced him to advance money for the same purpose, promising to return it. No roughs came and there was no disturbance. Allard employed the above named four voters who were known to be appellant's supporters, and they all swore that, in consequence of the money they received from Allard, they changed their vote, and voted for respondent. This expenditure was not included in the official return of respondent's legal expenses, made by his agent. Mr. C. P. Davidson, Q. C., and Mr. Mackay with him, for appellant :\nMr. Justice Routhier regarded the payments as direct acts of bribery, but refused to make the respondent liable for them, on the ground that Allard was not a general agent, and that his authority was limited to the hiring of a number of men for the pretended purpose of preventing violence at the polls. As a matter of fact, these men performed no such duty, and did nothing in return for the money thus received. Allard was active in the election. Some witnesses speak of his having been known as a vigorous partisan. He attended committee and other meetings. Mr. Tarte the brother-in-law of respondent, his chief manager and recognized agent, was heard to have specifically requested Allard to take charge of the very concession where the men so bribed resided. Mr. Tarte also furnished the larger part of the money thus illegally used. That is a fact upon which no dispute exists. But Mr. Tarts claims that Allard's instructions were limited to the employment of men, and that there was no question of buying voters. The hiring was a flimsy pretext for their purchase I contend the candidate is responsible for the acts of persons specially employed by his agent. The case seems irresistible, as well in respect of the deliberate and flagrant act of bribery which it involves as of the direct connection with it of persons for whose acts respondent must be held responsible.\nMr. Angers, Q.C., for respondent:\nP. Allard is a peaceful citizen of Bate St. Paul who is little accustomed to mix himself up in election contests. Some days before the voting, Mr. Tarte requested him to hire some men to keep the peace without naming any one. This request is not, in law, an offence, and Mr. Tarte, who had already gone through several elections in the county, had good reasons for doing as he did Allard had no other mission to per-form; if he went beyond his instructions, his so doing cannot do any harm.\nAbraham Bouchard, Jean Gagnon, Samuel Boivin, Israel Gagnon admit that they sold themselves for two dollars. But this avowal establishes nothing. It must be proved that there was really bribery. The cynicism displayed by these four witnesses is far from giving any weight to their evidence.\nP. Allard possesses the confidence of the petitioner, who twice brings him forward under oath to explain. Now, this witness, whose reputation is blameless, flatly contradicts these four electors who were ready to sell themselves for two dollars. He hired these people to keep the peace on the eve of the polling day, and that was all. No one proves that Allard canvassed them; on the contrary, all declared themselves supporters of the respondent. But, supposing they were really bought, as they say, what would be the consequences of P. Allard's conduct? We have already seen that the mission confided to him by Mr. Tarte could not make him an. election agent. But, of his own accord, by his actions and his relations with him can he have become the agent of the respondent to the extent of being able to compromise him? When there is no general system of bribery proved, it is necessary that the isolated cases and the mandate be clearly proved.\nThere are no precise rules for determining agency; each case rests upon the evidence * but it must be borne in mind that an election is a serious matter and should only be set aside for the weightiest reasons This question of agency has already been discussed at length before our Courts; we will but refer to a few decisions already given on this point The Portneuf case ([1]), and the Jacques Cartier case ([2]). Allard did not canvass; he made no speeches; in a word he took no part in this election.\nWhat is Allard's position, compared to that of Belle-rive and Terreau in the Quebec East case, to that of Conway, Cardinal St. Denis, St. Jean, Dufour in the Jacques Carlier election? and yet all these men who mixed in these elections, who were in a position to use their influence, and who, in fact, did so, have not been considered as agents.\nThe learned Counsel also referred to the Tamworth case ([3]); Salford case ([4]); Longford case ([5]); Gloucester case ([6]); Durham case ([7]); Windsor case ([8]); London-derry case ([9]).\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThis was a petition against the return of the respondent as the member of the House of Commons for the County of Charlevoix. The learned judge, whose judgment is appealed from, dismissed the petition, holding that the charges against the respondent had not been sustained\nWith reference to the personal charges against the respondent, the principles enunciated by my learned predecessor and to which I have referred in the case of Larue v. Deslauriers ([10]), are very applicable to this case, because there was considerable weight given by the judge who tried the case, to the manner in which some of the witnesses brought to prove the personal charges gave their evidence.\nBut there is a charge against the respondent's agent which in my opinion, must avoid the election\nIt is the fifth case treated in the appellant's factum., by which Pamphile Allard is charged with having under the authority of Mr. Tarte, bribed A5raham Bouchard, Samuel Boivin, Israel Gagnon and Jean Gagnon, previously petitioner's supporters, by the payment of $2.00 to each of them,\nMr. Tarte was the brother-in-law of the respondent his agency is admitted, and, indeed, it could not be denied, for he was obviously entrusted with and had, it may be said, the entire management and conducting of the election on respondent's behalf in that part of the county. He states that he received letters and telegrams from certain parties in Quebec, informing him that certain roughs were coming down to interfere with the peace-able voting of the electors, but he does not appear to have made any enquiries, or taken any steps to ascertain whether the reports in these telegrams and letters were well founded or not; thereupon he gives Allard money and asks him to employ persons to act as policemen, and he further induces him to advance money for the same purpose, promising to return it. With this money the judge below finds Allard bribed certain voters. There is no satisfactory evidence to show that any extraordinary measures whatever were necessary to be taken with a view to the preservation of the peace; and if such a course had seemed necessary no proper steps were taken to secure by legal means the public peace, nor do the proper authorities appear to have had the slightest intimation from Tarte or Allard or indeed from any source whatever, that trouble was anticipated.\nThe personal application of Mr. Tarte to Hon. Mr. Langevin and Capt. Gauthier, unsupported by affidavit or evidence of any kind, were perfectly futile, because neither of, the parties applied to had any authority in the matter, and if they had authority no verified facts were laid before them to justify their acting.\nThe law makes ample provision in such a case, and points out how and to whom the application should be made, and the steps that should be taken in such an emergency, and provides upon whom the duty and responsibility in such a case is cast of preserving the peace and the means by which this shall be accomplished. Thus by sec. 81 of the Dominion Elections Act, 1874\" every returning officer and every deputy return-ins^ officer from the time of the taking of the oath of office until the day after the closing of the election, shall be a conservator of the peace invested with all the powers appertaining to a justice of the peace,\" and by sec. 82, such officers \"may require the assistance of justices of the peace, constables or other persons present to aid him in maintaining peace and good order at such election, and may also, on a requisition made in writing by any candidate, or by his agent, or by any two electors, swear in such special constables as he deems necessary \"; and by sec. 83, \"such returning officer or deputy returning officer may arrest or cause to be arrested by verbal order, and place in the custody of any constable or other persons any person disturbing the peace and good order at the election, and may cause such person to be imprisoned under an order signed by him until any period not later than the close of the poll \"; and by sec. 84, such returning or deputy returning officers may require any person within one half mile of the place of nomination or of polling station to deliver to him any fire-arm, &c, and any person refusing to deliver such weapon shall be liable to a line &c.\nAll which was entirely disregarded by Mr. Tarte, and not the slightest excuse, still less justification, is offered for his thus ignoring the law, and taking upon himself, an active partizan, the duty and responsibility of preserving the public peace; no evidence whatever was offered to show that the slightest grounds existed justifying the sending of the telegrams or letters, nor does there appear to have been any persons sent from Quebec, nor does there appear to have been any disturbance whatever at the election.\nI can therefore come to no other conclusion than that there were no reasonable grounds for any extraordinary measures being taken for preserving the public peace, and if there had been that there were no reasonable grounds whatever for Mr. Tarte taking upon himself the employment of 30 unauthorized persons, and that there was no excuse or justification for employing and paying voters, as was done by Allard, by the direction of Mr. Tarte.\nIf trouble was really anticipated, I feel it quite impossible to believe that Mr. Tarte would have employed 30 men on his own account, and at his own expense without calling on the proper legal authorities whose especial duty it was to preserve the peace, or without even hinting to them that trouble was feared, so that proper, unobjectionable and legal precautions might be taken to provide against any unlawful disturbance.\nI may here say that I find that on the trial a question was put to Mr. Tarte which was objected to by the respondent, viz., whether the 30 men, which he alleged he had employed were paid ? This objection was sustained. And again whether these men were voters ? Also objected to, and objection sustained. These were, in my opinion, most pertinent and proper questions, and I cannot conceive on what valid grounds they were rejected, for, if the transaction had been an honest one, it is to be presumed the agent would have been only too glad to give such an answer as would dispel any unfavorable inference.\nThe questions having been objected to and not answered, the only reasonable inference is that the questions were objected to and not answered because the answers would militate against the witness and the respondent.\nThen, how do these men, who are charged with having been bribed, state the case as to Allard's dealing with them?\nWe have first;\nJean Gagnon :\nQ.

Pardonnez, je n'avais ni chevaux ni voitures dans ce temps-l\u00e0., main-tenant j'en ai une.\nThe coolness and frankness with which these men admit the bribery is somewhat astonishing. They do not pretend that they ever did anything for this money, they simply took the money and changed their vote; they do not appear to have had the least idea that they were acting as peace officers, or preservers of the peace, or were expected so to act, or had been employed for any such purpose; having voted as they agreed, no further notice appears to have been taken of them. Added to this we have the fact, that not one penny of this money and expenditure was accounted for, as the law required, if legal and proper; the inference from which, in connection with the other circumstances of the case is irresistible. Therefore, I am forced to the conclusion that the employment of these men, if employment it can be called, was merely colorable, or as a cloak for bribery and undue influence; hut from the testimony of those who were examined it would appear that the money can scarcely be said to have been given for colorable employment, but was a direct and open purchase of their votes; that the payments were not with any view to their acting as peace officers, but to induce them to vote for Perrault instead of Cimon, and therefore I think that the judge was right in deciding that they were actually bribed, as they swore they were, and that by reason of such bribery they changed their vote and instead of voting for Cimon voted for Perrault.\nIf the law would tolerate and treat as uncorrupt and legal what was- done in this ease by Messrs. Tarle and Ailard, and if parties disposed to resort to undue practices could hide their corrupt intentions and make innocent their expenditures under such a flimsy pretext as has been put forward in this case, all legislative efforts hitherto made to put down corrupt practices would be entirely futile. For if this can be done with reference to voters at one polling place, why not at all the other numerous polling places in the county? and if $2 is paid, why not a larger sum? and if thirty men can be so paid, why not more ? It is not easy to conceive how a much more general and effective system of corruption could he established It may be as well to cite two or three cases on this point.\nAs to the employment of watchers, Mr. Justice Blackburn said in the Bewdley case ([11]):\nIt comes within all the mischief of treating. In the first place it indirectly influences the men whether voters or not: if they are not voters it indirectly influences all their friends and other voters. In the second place, when it is given to voters, it would, in all human probability, lead to an expenditure by them in public houses and elsewhere which would indirectly influence voters. In that way it falls within all the mischief of treating, but no statute has yet been passed rendering it of the same effect as treating.\nHe subsequently said that he considered this to be a corrupt practice, and that as such he must report it to the Speaker.\nMartin, B., in the Nottingham case ([12]), as to the hiring of persons on behalf of the candidates for the purpose of keeping the peace and protecting the voters, said:\nI must protest against the employment of such persons at all. The proper course to pursue is to go to the Mayor and communicate to him that there is a probability of the peace of the town being disturbed, and to tell him that he must perform his duty and swear in a sufficient number of special constables to preserve the peace.\nThen, also, in a very late case, arising out of the last general elections, with regard to the employment of watchers Baron Pollock in the Salisbury case ([13]) said as follows :\nIn every borough the greatest caution should be used before any person employs others in a private character to preserve the quiet of the town, to prevent breaches of the peace, Or to protect even the property of individuals. This is a matter of very serious importance, because it reflects, not merely upon the purity of the election, if such a thing is done to a great extent, but it reflects also upon the credit and reputation of the town. I should be very sorry to think that it could ever be necessary, even in an election time, to resort to anything like a private body for the purpose of protecting either persons or property. The proper course, whenever such an occasion should arise, and a reasonable fear exists, would be to apply to the mayor and magistrates and the police authorities, and if there are not a sufficient number of men already serving in the police, we well know by experience that the services of we'll conditioned honest persons can always be obtained as special constables, who are ready to protect property in their own town.\nNow, independent of Mr. Tarte's personal direct connection with this transaction, the learned judge, in my opinion, though he correctly arrived at the conclusion that the parties named had been bribed came to a conclusion of law entirely erroneous in. respect to Mr. viz.: That although Mr. Tarle was unquestionably the agent of the respondent, Mr. Allard employed by him was not, and therefore respondent's seat could not be affected by Mr. Allard's acts.\nThis pretension cannot be, in my opinion, for one moment sustained. The law would indeed, be childishly weak were it not able to reach the corrupt acts of a sub-agent. The law as to employment of sub-agents seems to me to be very clear.\nIn the Bewdly case ([14]), Blackburn, J. says:\nI can come to no other conclusion than that the respondent made Pardoe his agent for the election to almost the fullest extent to which agency can be given. A person proved to be an agent to this extent is not only himself an client of the candidate but also makes those agents whom he employs. The extent to which a person is an agent differs according to what he is shown to have done. An agent employed so extensively as is shown here makes the candidate responsible, not only for his own acts, but also for the acts of those whom he, the agent, did so employ, even though they are persons whom the candidate might not know, or be brought in personal contact with. The analogy which I put in the course of the case is a strong one, I mean that of the liability of the sheriff for the undersheriff, when he is not merely responsible for the acts which he himself has done but also for the acts of those whom the undersheriff employs, and not only responsible for the acts done by virtue of the mandate but also for the acts done under colour of the mandate, matters which have been carried very far indeed in relation to the sheriff.\nApplying the principle thus laid down to the case of one Burmish, a clerk to Pardoe (the agent), he said:\nEvery person employed in the election of Pardoe is an agent of the respondent. Burmish was so employed, and if he had ordered drink and treating without authority from anybody, and had paid for it out of his own pocket that of itself would have been sufficient to avoid the election.\nAgain in the Staleybridge case ([15]), Blackburn, J., says:\nI have already in the Bewdley case had occasion to decide this much. There it appeared that the sitting member had put a sum of money into the hands of his agent, and that he exercised no supervision over the way in which that agent was spending that money; that he had given him directions, and I thought really intended, that none of that money should be improperly spent; but that he had accredited and trusted his agent, and left him the power of spending the money; and I came to the conclusion upon that, that there was such an agency established as that the sitting member was responsible to the fullest extent, not only for what that agent might do, but for what all the people whom that agent employed might do; in short, making that agent, as far as that matter was concerned, himself, and being responsible for his acts. I see no reason to doubt at all that that is perfectly correct. 10\u00bd\nIn the Barnstaple case ([16]) Mr. Justice Mellor, as to the law of agency, said:\nI quite think the election law is a cruel and somewhat hard law yet it is too well settled for an election judge to act contrary to it I say that if an agent, although he may be no agent to the candidate, be employed by the agent of a candidate, he is a sort of subordinate agent, and if he is employed by persons who have authority to employ people to further the election of a particular individual, and in the course of canvassing makes use of a threat or a promise, such an act will make the candidate liable, however innocent the candidate may be or however careful the candidate may have been to avoid such conduct. As Mr. Harrison very fairly puts it, he cannot take the benefit of the services of the individual and repudiate them at the same time.\nIn the Plymouth case ([17]), it was proved that one of the principal agents of the respondent authorized one Stebbs, who was an active member of the respondent's committee, to go to Penzance and bring up any Ply~ mouth voter he could find. Stebbs found, among others, one Willis, a fisherman, and as Willis declined to come up and vote unless not only his travelling expenses were paid but also a substitute found to do his share in the fishery during his absence at Plymouth, Stebbs paid a substitute for this purpose and Willis came up and voted.\nMr. Justice Lush, after holding that the case was within the very words, as well as within the spirit of the Act said:\nThe only remaining question is\u2014was Stebbs authorized to make this engagement with Willis? I am clearly of opinion that he was. He was sent to Penzance for the purpose of getting those men to go to the poll, and that involved an authority to make such reasonable terms as Willis might require. It is clear law that if an agent of the candidate employed a sub-agent to negotiate with a voter going to the poll, and the sub-agent commits an act of bribery in carrying out his commission, the candidate is as responsible as if the act had been done by the agent himself; the. sub agent here is not in the position of a messenger sent upon a mere ministerial duty, he was to negotiate with Willis and arrange for his leaving his work and coming up to the polls; I am, therefore, constrained to hold that by this act Stebbs has rendered the seat untenable. It is abundantly clear to my mind that the sitting member must be affected by the acts of both Tarte and Allard, and that for and by reason of the corrupt acts of the bribery of these four voters the election must be declared void\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nAfter a very careful consideration of the evidence in this case and of the law by which the several issues are to be decided, I think! it unnecessary to refer to more than two of them; they, in my opinion, being sufficient to decide the case before us\nThe first is the case of the alleged bribery by Pamphile Allard and Joseph Israel Tarte by payments of money to Abraham Bouchard,, Samuel Boivin, Israel Gagnon and Jean Gagnon, all of whom were electors. By the evidence it is shown that Aliard and Tarte were active supporters of the respondent, and the latter is shown to have been his agent.\nIt also satisfactorily appears that the four persons alleged to have been bribed, up to the time of the payments of the money to them respectively by Allard, were known to be supporters of the appellant. Tarte and Allard both in their evidence admit the payment of the money, and that Tarte requested Allard to hire them as policemen for the polling day. A\/lard in hiring the men did no more than he was ordered to do by Tarte.\nThe learned judge who tried the petition in his judgment says:\nI therefore believe Allard when he says he hired them as police-men, but I equally believe them when they declare that the two dollars they received caused them to vote for the respondent. I am also of the opinion that Allard in hiring them was guilty of an act of bribery under the circumstances proved by Allard himself\nThe learned judge also says: In the present case Mr.: Tarte was a general agent. out Allard was not.\nI entirely agree with the conclusion as to both points drawn from the evidence by the learned judge.\nIt is not, however, necessary, as assumed by him that to make Tarte responsible for Allard's acts the latter should be an agent of the respondent. On the contrary, he may not have been a partizan at all. If he is guilty of a corrupt practice, it would be no justification for him to allege he acted by the command or at the suggestion of Tarte. He is therefore guilty of the corrupt practice charged, but how can his guilt be a justification for the man who engaged him to commit it ? Tarte is, therefore, the principal, and Allard the agent\u2014 the conduit pipe between Tarte and the bribed parties. Under the law the respondent is answerable for Tarte's corrupt practices, and the case, as shown against Tarte, is as effectual as if the acts of which he has been shown to be guilty had been done by the respondent himself. If the latter had got Allard to do what is proven against him no one would say for a moment that if Allard were guilty of a corrupt practice in carrying out directions he, the respondent, would not be responsible also. If a man engages another to commit a crime he as well as the active agent, is guilty.\nThe reason assigned by Tarte for hiring policemen is no justification, even if satisfactorily shown. It is in evidence that thirty men (I believe all electors) were hired as policemen, although the cases of bit four of them have been investigated. If a candidate, or agent, for a real or imaginary cause, or fear of a riot could be permitted to hire to the extent of the number just stated, he might hire and thereby bribe half a constituency. The law very properly is against such being done by the candidate or his agents, It has provided other means to secure the peaceful conduct of an election by arming the presiding officers, when necessary, with power to employ and swear in constables and others to prevent force violence or riot, and effectually, though impliedly, forbid such to be hired or engaged by any of the contesting parties or their agents. Besides, the evidence of the existence of any reason or necessity for employing those men is by no means satisfactory. It is all hearsay on the part of Tarte. The idea that violence was to be apprehended rests upon nothing in the shape of any threat or any overt act of the opposite party. No document was produced by Tarte to show that any such threat had been made in Quebec, or in any other place, to induce the belief that anybody of men were going from there to commit violence. None went and no riot or disturbance took place. How such defective and objectionable evidence as the record shows was admitted I cannot understand. I feel bound to declare that under the law and evidence Allard and Tarte were both guilty of corrupt practices in hiring the four men above named, and that as Tarte was the acknowledged agent of the respondent, his election is therefore void.\nThe other case is that preferred against the respondent himself in attempting to bribe Thomas Lapointe by an advantageous offer to him accompanied by a threat. It is shown that Lapointe intended to and did support the appellant, and the object alleged was to induce him to vote for the respondent. The respondent is alleged to have made the attempt charged at Lapointe,s house. The charge was proved by Lapointe who says no one else was present. The respondent contradicted him, and says in addition that he was not at his (Lapointe's) house during that election but during one some months previous. Lapointe is sustained by two witnesses as to the fact that the respondent was in his house during the election in question Ferdinand Desmeule says he was with respondent at Lapointe's house at-the previous election, but does not to my mind contradict Lapointe and the two other witnesses, There are then three witnesses who contradict the respondent and sufficiently so in my mind to sustain the charge. The learned judge, however, decided in favor of the respondent, and I cannot, without some doubt, say he was so far wrong that I would be justified in reversing his decision The respondent has contradicted the statement of' Lapointe as to the offer, and, as the disqualification of a member or candidate for so long a period is a serious penalty which should not be inflicted when any reasonable doubt exists, I feel bound under all circumstances to confirm the finding, on this charge, of the learned judge. I think the evidence in such cases as in criminal prosecutions, should leave no reasonable doubt of the guilt of the party charged, either as to his acts or the object of them.\nI think it right to add that the evidence shows other pretty strong cases of bribery against Tarte, but I have not considered it necessary to make special references to them.\nFor the reasons given I think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nIf there are any cases in which more than in others we should inflexibly adhere to the rule that we should not in appeal reverse upon mere matters of fact the judgment of the judge Who tries the cause, having himself heard all the evidence unless the matter of the evidence is of such a nature as to convey an irresistible conviction that the judgment is not only wrong but is erroneous, they are these election cases, in which so much depends upon the manner in which the witnesses give their evi4enqe, and upon the degree of credit to be attached to them respectively. A judge sitting in appeal, not having before him the demeanor which the judge who tried the petition had, assumes a grave responsibility, and indeed, as it seems to me, exceeds the legitimate functions of an appellate tribunal when he pronounces the judgment of the judge of first instance in such cases to be erroneous upon anything short of the most unhesitating conviction.\nProceeding upon this principle, as I consider to be my duty, I am not prepared to differ with the findings, upon mere matters of fact of the learned judge who tried the petition in this case. It is however, the privilege and the duty of this court to question the conclusions, whether of fact or of law drawn by him from facts in evidence as to which there is no dispute, as to the agency of Pamphile Allard, upon the question arising whether or not the respondent is to be held responsible for certain acts of Allard which the learned judge has found to have been corrupt.\nThe learned judge has found, as matter of fact that money was paid corruptly by Allard to one Bouchard, one Boivin and two persons named Gagnon, who were voters and who voted at the election I confess that upon the evidence unless we do violence to common sense and close our eyes to the inferences which men of ordinary understanding would naturally and which the persons to whom the money was paid did, draw, it appears to me to be impossible to come to any other conclusion than that these payments were bribes, thinly concealed under the pretenc3 of the engagement of the persons to whom the money was paid as police.\nThere cannot be a doubt that these persons went to see Allard two or three days before the polling day, for the purpose of obtaining money from him for their votes for the respondent, having been informed that he was paying money to persons to vote for the respondent. Allard's own account is that they came to his shop and told him they had been at the house where the appellant lodged; that on their way from there they had stopped at the house of Joseph Lavoie, who sent them to Allard, saying that he (Allard) had money to give them; that Allard replied \"We do not pay any one;\" Allard asked them if there were many people at the appellant's boarding house, to which Jean Gagnon, one of the four replied, \"There were ' Scarcely any, that they were a party of children.\" \"Stay,\" then said Allard \"are you for Mr. Perrault?\" To which Jean Gagnon again replied \"Yes, it is true they \"do not like him much and Cimon is not much better, \"but they are good enough to vote for Perrault;\" and thereupon they asked Allard if he had anything to give them and in reply he told them that Mr. Tarte had given him some money to maintain the peace the day of the polling, and that they could engage themselves that day and he admits that he paid them $2.00 each to keep order in cas\u00e9 of a disturbance. He adds that Mr. Tarte had authorized. him to engage men to keep order on the polling day, and that he gave to him (Allard) $8 or $10 for the purpose, saying at the time of giving it\u2014\"I know it is not sufficient, you will furnish \"the rest yourself and I will repay you.\" Besides the above four, Allard says he thinks he engaged two others, and although he says he has a bill against Mr. Tarte for something over $30, he does not particularize the items. Now whether the idea of engaging men as police on polling day was or not a scheme devised by Tarte to cover bribes matters not but that Allard was covering a bribe to these men under this thin pretext cannot, I think, admit of a doubt in the minds of men who allow themselves to be governed by common sense. I entirely agree, therefore, with the finding of the learned judge, that Allard's conduct in this matter was corrupt, but I am compelled to differ with him upon the point of Allard's agency and the responsibility of the respondent for his corrupt conduct. That Mr. Tarte was the confidential agent of the respondent, and the person managing the contest on his behalf in that part of the county is unquestionable; that Allard was seen in company with Tarte several times at his lodgings and elsewhere upon election matters; that he acted in such a manner as to be regarded by the people generally as an agent of the respondent; that he attended meetings held for respondent on several occasions at which Mr. Tarte was also present and that he had the appearance of being an agent and zealous partizan of the respondent at those meetings, and generally, is testified by Dr. Clement and others, and not denied; but there is no doubt that, and this appears to me to be sufficient for the purpose, Mr. Tarte, who was the respondent's confidential agent and manager of the contest for him gave Allard $8 or $10, with instructions to engage men as police on the polling day, and authorized him to spend of his own moneys more money for the like purpose, promising to repay him what he should expend. Now, whether this engagement of police was, or not a scheme devised by Tarte to cover bribes matters not, for it is plain upon the evidence that the manner of expending the money entrusted to Allard, and that which he was authorized to pay out of his own pocket upon the promise of repayment for the like purpose was left to his discretion, qualified only with the direction that it was to be expended in engaging men as police. Allard, as he himself says, expended the money given to him in the manner directed, and he exercised the discretion which was left to him in giving it to the four persons above named to secure their votes for the respondent, that is to say, in bribes in the respondents interest. Now, for money so expended by the person who was so far an agent of the respondent as to be entrusted with the outlay of this sum entrusted to him by the confidential manager of the respondent's election contest, to be expended at the discretion of the agent so employed as to the persons to whom it should be giv9n, the respondent must be held responsible for the indiscretion and corrupt conduct of the person so employed to lay out money on his behalf. It is the common case of a person to whom money is entrusted to be expended in the interest of a candidate and for the promotion of his election, and whose discretion is confided in as to the manner of the outlay. I am of opinion, therefore, that upon this point the judgment of the learned judge, who tried the petition, should be reversed and that the election should be avoided for this conduct of Allard, who, in the particular matter, is sufficiently proved to have been respondents agent, so as to make the respondent's election invalid, although the respondent be not personally affected with the criminality of the agent.\nAs to the costs, there are so many of the cases which appear to be so very suspicious that I think there was reasonable cause for investigating them. In such cases I think, in the interest of justice, that the party whose conduct, or the conduct of whose agents gives cause for such suspicion, should, as a general rule, pay the costs attending the investigation, although the evidence when taken falls short of convincing proof; but in view of the fact that there were very' many cases urged at the trial which were abandoned before us as wholly defective in proof, I am not prepared to say that the learned judge's mode of apportioning the costs is erroneous in directing each party to pay his own costs of the enqu\u00e9te, save only as to the costs of the cases in which the appellant should succeed, that is to say: the four cases of payment made by Allard above mentioned, as to which the respondent should be ordered to pay the appellant's costs in the court below as well as the costs of the appeal.\nThe report should, I think, be to the effect that the respondent's election is void for bribery committed by an agent of the respondent named Pamphile Allard, but that there is no evidence of the respondent having had knowledge of such bribery.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs of appeal and also with costs of court below to appellant, except one-half the costs of appellants enqu\u00eate.\nSolicitor for appellant P.

Q.\nElection Petition\u2014Supreme Court Act, Sec. 44\u2014Right to send back record for further adjudication\u2014Bribery\u2014Appeals from findings upon matters of fact\u2014Insufficiency of return of election expenses\u2014Personal expenses of candidate to be included.\nThe original petition came before Mr. Justice McCord for trial, and was tried by him on the merits, subject to an objection to his jurisdiction. The learned Judge having taken the case en delib\u00e9r\u00e9, arrived at the conclusion that he had no jurisdiction declared the objection to his jurisdiction well founded, and \"in consequence the objection was maintained, and the petition of the petitioner was rejected and dismissed.\"\nThis judgment was appealed from, and the now respondent, under sec. 48 of the Supreme Court Act, limited his appeal to the question of jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court held that Mr. Justice McCord had jurisdiction, and it was ordered that the record be transmitted to the proper officer of the lower court to have the said cause proceeded with according to law.\nThe record was accordingly sent to the prothonotary of the Superior Court at Montmagny, Mr. Justice McCord, after having offered the counsel of each of the parties a re-hearing of the case, proceeded to render his judgment on the merits and declared the election void. The respondent then appealed to the Supreme Court and contended that Mr. Justice McCord had no jurisdiction to proceed with the case. Held,\u2014That the Supreme Court on the first appeal, could not, even if the appeal had not been limited to the question of jurisdiction, have given a decision on the merits, and that the order of this court remitting the record to the proper officer of the court a quo to be proceeded with according to law, gave jurisdiction to Mr. Justice McCord to proceed with the case on the merits, and to pronounce a judgment on such merits, which latter judgment was properly appealable under sec. 48, Supreme Court Act (Fournier and Henry, J.J., dissenting).\nThe charge upon which this appeal was principally decided was that of the respondent's bribery of one David Asselin, The learned Judge who tried the case found, as a matter of fact that) appellant had underhandedly slipped into Asselin's pocket the $5 for a pretended purpose, that was not even mentioned to the recipient; that this amount was not included in the published return of his expenses as required by the Election Act, and this payment was bribery. The evidence bearing on this charge is reviewed in the judgments below.\nHeld,\u2014That an Appellate Court in election cases ought not to reverse on mere matters of fact the findings of the Judge who has tried the petition unless the court is convinced beyond doubt that his conclusions are erroneous, and that the evidence in this case warranted the finding 9f the court below that appellant had been guilty of personal bribery.\n2. Per Taschereau, J.,\u2014 That the personal expenses of the candidate should be included in the statement of election expenses required to be furnished to the Returning Officer under 37 Vic., c. 9, sec. 123. [Fournier and Henry, J. J., expressed no opinion on the merits]\n[The judgment of McCord, J., ([1]) on the other charges was also affirmed.]\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Mr. Justice McCord of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, by which the election of the appellant, as the member representing the County of Bellechasse in the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada, was declared void and the appellant personally found guilty of bribery.\nAt the general elections of September, 1878, the appellant was returned for the electoral district of Bellechasse, and his election was contested by the respondent.\nMr. Justice McCord before whom the matter of the petition against the return of the appellant was tried, having heard the parties and their witnesses, as well on the merits of the case as on an objection taken to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 was unconstitutional finally, on the 22nd April, 1879, without adjudicating on the merits of the case, decided that he had no jurisdiction, and on that ground alone dismissed the petition of the respondent. The respondent appealed from Mr. Justice McCord's judgment to the Supreme Court. Upon that appeal, Mr. Justice McCord's judgment was, on the 3rd March, 1880, reversed, the Supreme Court holding that the Act was constitutional, and that Mr. Justice McCord had jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, and it was ordered that the record should be transmitted to the officer by whom it had been sent to the Supreme Court to have the said cause proceeded with according to law. Upon the record being sent back as ordered to the Prothonotary of the Superior Court for the District of Montmagny, Mr. Justice McCord took up the case, and, on the 10th May, 1880, pronounced the following judgment:\n\"Having heard the parties and their witnesses, examined into the evidence and documents filed and duly deliberated;\n\"Considering that it is proven that an agent of the respondent committed corrupt practices at the said election, by treating voters on the day of polling, on account of such voters having voted; that another agent of the respondent also committed corrupt practices in the same manner, and that another agent of the respondent committed corrupt practices at the said election by paying for the conveyance of a voter to, and from the poll on the day of polling;\n\"Considering that it is proved that the respondent himself committed corrupt practices at the said election: 1st. By giving money to a voter in order to induce him to endeavor to procure the return of the respondent: 2nd. By threatening another voter with the loss of his place, and also promising to endeavor to procure for the said voter an employment in order to induce him to refrain from voting at the said election; 3rd. By threatening a voter with a prosecution for damages in order to induce him to refrain from voting at the said election; and, 4th. By threatening another voter with the loss of his employment in order to induce him to refrain from voting at the sald election;\n\"I hereby declare and adjudge, that the said respondent Achille Larue was not duly elected and returned at the said election and that the said election is void. And I further adjudge and order that the respondent do pay to the petitioner his costs in this cause.\nBy the Court,\nA. Bender, P. S. C. M.\"\nIt is from that judgment that the present appeal was taken, and the grounds of appeal were:\n1st. That Mr. Justice McCord had no right or jurisdiction to take up the case as he did, and give the judgment complained of; 2nd. That supposing he could have taken cognizance of the case he could not pronounce a judgment upon the merits of the case; 3rd. That the judgment complained of is not supported by the evidence in the case.\nMr. Langelier, Q.C., appeared for the appellant, and Mr. Awyot for the respondent.\nThe charges upon which this appeal was decided, and the arguments and authorities relied on by counsel are reviewed in the judgments. RITCHIE, C. J.:\n(After reading the above statement of the case, proceeded as follows);\nI think there is nothing whatever in the two first objections. It has been very strongly urged that the petition having been heard on the merits and dismissed in the court below it must be assumed to have been dismissed on the merits, and the appellant having expressly confined his appeal in his notice of appeal to the question of jurisdiction, this judgment on the merits was not appealed from. In his factum the appellant thus puts his contention :\n2nd. Mr. Justice McCord, supposing he could take cognizance of the case as he did, could not pronounce any judgment on the merits of the case.\nIt will be remembered that the trial of the case had taken place that after the adduction of their evidence by both parties the case had been argued on the merits and reserved by Mr. Justice McCord; that nearly three months afterwards he gave his judgment of the 22nd April, 1879. By that judgment he does not merely say that he declines to act in the matter, but that he dismisses the petition altogether: the petition of the Petitioner is rejected and dismissed,\nNow the petition could only be rejected and dismissed by him as it had been submitted, viz; on its merits. We therefore say that the petition stood dismissed by a judgment not appealed from, nor impugned in any other way, when Mr. Justice McCord again took it up and rendered the judgment complained of.\nIt is true that Mr. Justice McCord says, in the said judgment that he dismisses the petition only on the ground that he has no jurisdiction. But we contend that we have nothing to do with the reasons of the judgment, and that we must consider the judgment itself which dismissed the petition when it had been fully submitted on its merits\nI fail to see the least force in this objection.\nThe Judge below refused to adjudicate on the petition or on the merits of the case because he held he had no jurisdiction. As to the now respondent's limiting or confining his appeal, there was nothing to limit or confine there was no decision on separate distinct propositions of law and fact, there was only one decision on one proposition of law\u2014all he could appeal against was that decision and all he could do was to ask the court to reverse that determination and hold in opposition to the Judge, that he had jurisdiction, and therefore should have adjudicated on the matter of the petition on the merits; and this is simply what the appellant did do, and all this court did was to say that his contention was right and that the Judge was not without jurisdiction; that he should not have rejected or dismissed or refused to determine the case on the merits, but, instead thereof, should have proceeded to a final adjudication of the matters in controversy on the merits. Suppose we sustained the now appellant's contention, refused to review this case on the merits and adjudged that Judge McCord had no right to go on with the investigation or to adjudicate on the merits of the petition, it could only be on the ground contended for, that the petition had been already dismissed, by the decision of the Judge below, on the merits, when in fact it had not been and that that decision had not been appealed from, when there was no such decision to appeal from. The petition does not, at this moment, in fact or in law stand on the records of any court dismissed on any ground whatever; the only judgment of dismissal, if judgment of dismissal it was, that has ever been given has been reversed. This court has said the Judge was wrong in the conclusion at which he arrived in the only decision or judgment he ever did give and so this court reversed that decision. If we now say further proceedings in the case, after the reversal of his judgment, cannot be had, to dispose of the real matters in controversy which never yet have been adjudicated on, what is to become of the petition? This court could not certify that it had been dismissed if the judgment below was really a judgment of dismissal, because this court reversed that judgment; for the same reason the Judge below could not certify that the petition had been dismissed by him because his judgment of dismissal ceased to be a judgment after reversal by this court. But in no case and under no circumstances, could he truthfully certify that the petition had been dismissed on the merits because the merits never were adjudicated on by him, or by any other court.\nThe only true certificate that could be given would be that the Judge of first, instance had not adjudicated on the petition on the merits but had refused to do so for alleged want of jurisdiction; that this court had adjudged that he had jurisdiction and should have decided the case on the merits and transmitted the record to the court below to be proceeded with according to law. This is not the certificate contemplated by the Act, and could not and would not, I should conceive, be accepted by the House of Commons as a final determination of the matter. The Judge having stayed his hand on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to proceed, and having been set right in this, and his judgment thereon having been absolutely reversed, why should not the petition stand as if no such erroneous decisions had been given? When the Judge discovers his error, why should the case not be heard, determined and disposed of on its merits according to law? When the Judge thought he had no jurisdiction he stopped the investigation and adjudication; when he finds he has jurisdiction, why should he not go on and do his duty? This court, having given the judgment the court below should have given, necessarily leaves the case just in the position it would have been had the Judge delivered that judgment in the first instance, and must necessarily be proceeded with after the judgment given by this court as it should and would have been had the Judge delivered it himself\nI must say I can see nothing in reason or law to prevent this being done; on the contrary, I think it would be a scandal on the law if he could not and if he did not do so.\nSuppose the Judge, at the outset of the hearing, had thought that he had no jurisdiction, or, after having heard part of the evidence in the case it had occurred to him that he was without jurisdiction, and so he decided not to proceed further in the case, (and that is, in fact, just the present case,) and the party aggrieved comes to this court to get the Judge set right and his jurisdiction affirmed, and it is affirmed, is this court to assume the functions and duties of the Judge and try the case on the merits from the start or take it up where the Judge left off? This is or must be the respondent's contention, in fact.\nIn answer to this; section 48 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act has been invoked as sustaining the contention that the appellant should have appealed as against a dismissal of the petition on the merits and that then this court could have heard evidence and adjudicated on the case on the merits under the words of the section \"and in case it appears to the court that any evidence duly tendered at the trial was improperly rejected, the court may cause the witness to be examined before the court or a Judge thereof or upon commission.\"\nI think this has no application at all to the present case. I think this court has no original jurisdiction in election cases, that there can be no appeal to this court except from an adjudication of the Judge who tried the petition on a question of law or fact. The words are; \"Any party to an election petition in said Act (Controverted Election Act) who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge who has tried the petition on any question of law or fact, and desires to appeal against the same, may,\" &c. The latter part of section 48 referred to simply provides that where evidence has been duly tendered, and rejected by the Judge in a case which he has heard and finally determined and this court should hold that the evidence was legally admissible and should not have been rejected and so overrule the decision of the Judge the evidence so rejected may be supplied, on appeal, in the manner pointed out; but surely by no construction can this be held to give this court original jurisdiction to hear and determine a case never determined in the court below and to examine witnesses never duly tendered at the trial, nor improperly rejected, for the reason that the Judge though he heard evidence ultimately refused to try and decide the case on the merits for alleged want of jurisdiction. This court is not a court of first instance, and to give it jurisdiction there must be a decision on a question of law or fact against the decision of which dissatisfied parties desire to appeal.\nIt was also strongly urged that after the judgment of this court J Judge McCord had no right to take up the case as he did.\" The appellant thus puts his contention on this point in his factum:\nNow the appellant contends that Mr. Justice McCord had no right to do so. By his first judgment of the 22nd April, 1879, he had entirely disposed of the case before him; he was by that judgment functus officio, and dispossessed of the case. Unless he was then again put in possession of the same by the judgment of this court, he could no more take cognizance of the case unless he was entrusted with it in the usual course of procedure fixed by law.\nAnd he says:\u2014\nNobody will, for one moment, pretend that the judgment of this court did authorize Mr. Justice McCord or any other Judge or court to take up the case. That judgment, after having reversed Mr. Justice McCord's decision on the ground of jurisdiction, merely 7 1\/2 ordered the transmission, of the record to the Prothonotary of Montmagny to have the said cause proceeded with according to law.\nAnd yet, strange to say, he adds: \u2014\nThis, we contend, had the effect of putting the parties in a position to proceed in the court below as if Mr. Justice McCord's judgment on the question of jurisdiction had not been rendered.\nAnd he further contends:\u2014\nThe appellant contends that if anything more could be done as to the merits of the case, it. could only have been after an application to the court by one of the parties, pursuant to notice to the other, to have a suitable day and place fixed for the trial of the case or for the hearing of the same upon the evidence already adduced (Dominion Controverted Elections Act 1874 sec. 11).\nThe only part of all this contention that I can at all appreciate is where the respondent says the transmitting the record to the Prothonotary of Montmagny to have said cause proceeded with according to law, was to put the parties in a position to proceed in the court below as if Mr. Justice McCord's judgment on the question of jurisdiction had not been rendered.\" This states, in my opinion, with the strictest accuracy, just what the effect of the judgment of this court was namely, saying to Mr. Justice McCord; \"You should not have given the judgment you did, but instead thereof you should have decided that you had jurisdiction, and assumed jurisdiction in the case, and should have decided it on the merits,\" which Judge McCord, acting on the decision of this court, rightfully, I think, proceeded to do.\nAs to the want of notice and as to the necessity of an application to the court to have a suitable day and place fixed for the trial of the case, or for the hearing of the same upon the evidence already adduced under the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874 sec. 11 :\"\nBefore Mr. Justice McCord rejected or dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction, all the evidence Of both parties had been heard, and the case had been argued on the merits and reserved for judgment and so was in a position to be decided on the merits, and doubtless would have been so decided but for the opinion of the Judge on the question of jurisdiction; but, notwithstanding which, when the record went back for a final adjudication, the learned Judge, in his judgment appealed from and now before us, says:\u2014\nOn the 31st January, 1879, the trial of this cause was closed, both parties were fully heard, and the case lay before me for a decision upon the merits subject, however, to certain objections to my jurisdiction filed by the respondent.\nBeing of opinion that I was without jurisdiction, I abstained from adjudicating upon the petition; but my judgment, maintaining the respondent's objections, having been reversed by the Supreme Court, the record was sent back to have the said cause proceeded with according to law,\" and, consequently, I again found the case before me for a decision upon the merits.\nAlthough, as I have just said, the parties had already been fully heard, I felt that, owing to the length of time which had elapsed since the hearing, they might fairly desire to refresh my memory as to their respective arguments and pretensions. I therefore offered the counsel of each of the parties a re-hearing of the case, but on both sides this was considered unnecessary, and my offer was declined. It only remains with me now to render my judgment, and, before doing so, to explain the ground upon which it is founded.\nUnder these circumstances what pretence can the party, now appellant, have to allege that\" the whole case should have been gone through again.\"\nOn the merits of the case, I regret to say that after a careful examination of the evidence I cannot come to the conclusion that the learned Judge who tried this petition was wrong in his appreciation of that evidence in the case of Asselin, and not being so satisfied, it would not be right for me to disturb the judgment As applicable to this case, I fully and entirely agree with the observ\u00e0tions made by my learned predecessor in the case of Somerville v. Laflamme ([2]) where he says:\u2014 In a matter of this kind when the two witnesses appear to be equally respectable, and they positively contradict each other, and the surrounding circumstances do not lead the Judges in the Appellate Court clearly to the conclusion that the decision in the court of first instance is wrong, the Appellate Court ought not to interfere, though they might have decided differently, if they had seen the witnesses.\nAnd I also feel the force of his observations as to the position of the Judge who has tried the case ([3]):\u2014\nBut the Judge who tries the cause in the first instance has many advantages over those who are called upon to review his decision, he sees the witnesses, hears their answers, sees whether they are prompt, natural, and given without feeling or prejudice, with an honest desire to tell the truth, or whether they are studied, evasive and reckless, or intended to deceive, &c.\nA case such as this is very different from a case at common law; there the witnesses are in general disinterested parties unconnected with the case and so more or less impartial, while in election cases the witnesses are generally strong partizans, or more or less mixed up with the election. The opinion of the learned Judge who has heard the case is entitled to great weight and before his decision can be set aside, we must be entirely satisfied that he is wrong. In affirmance of this view we have the repeated declarations of appellate courts that on questions of facts, such tribunals must be clearly satisfied that the conclusion at which the Judge who tried the case arrived is not only wrong but entirely erroneous.\nWith respect then to the charge brought against the appellant for bribing Asselin, the facts are these: it appears that Asselin was an influential man in one of the electoral districts and had been friendly to Mr. Larue in a former election. Previous to the election now in question, Mr. Larue, while on a canvassing expedition, met Asselin on the road and is invited by Asselin to go to his house an invitation which was accepted. Asselin not being at home, Mrs. Asselin gave him and his carter a cup of tea and a biscuit. On a second occasion Mr. Larue called at the house of Asselin and was entertained by Asselin himself with a glass of whiskey and a biscuit, and when leaving Mr. Larue secretly or clandestinely slipped a $5 bill into Asselin's pocket. The witness says: \"Il m'a coul\u00e9 quelque chose dans ma poche, j'ai cru que c'\u00e9tait un $5.\" It was quite clear he never intended to and did not make any charge for this hospitality. When asked what was the value of the refreshments supplied he answered that he had made no charge and that the outside value would have been $1 and that when the appellant slipped the money into his pocket, he said: \"Gardez-\u00e7a.\u201d Mr. Larue does not admit he slipped the money into his pocket. He says he put it into Asselin's hands but does not deny he put it there clandestinely, and assigns as a reason for not giving it to him publicly that he was afraid he might hurt his feelings. The reason he assigns for giving Asselin the money is that it was to pay for the trouble he had given him; to pay his expenses and those of his friends he should send there. No friends were ever sent no expenses were ever shewn to have been incurred, and it is beyond doubt it never was intended that any part of this sum should be returned to Mr. Larue.\nIt is obvious that Asselin received this money not as payment for what he had done, or for what he would do. Asselin does not appear to have been an unfriendly witness to the appellant, but the contrary. There can be no dispute then that Mr. Larue gave Asselin $5 and that he gave it clandestinely, whether slipped into his hand or pocket; that at that time no such money was due Asselin, nor does any subsequent indebtedness appear to have been incurred.\nIn addition to which Mr. Larue distributed among different persons throughout the county various sums of money amounting to several hundred dollars. He gives to one Lamontagne $10 to $15, to Pouliot $10, to Turgeon $5, to Plante $20, to Labrecque $50, to Marcoux $50, &c, in all, as he himself states, some $400 or $500, there being no debt or liability existing, and it does not appear that any one of these parties rendered any account of the disposition of these funds, or that any account was asked for or expected by the appellant, and we are left with the simple fact that this candidate distributed through the county, to prominent men in the county, sums of money clearly to be used in the election. The law is very clear\u2014that each candidate at an election shall appoint an agent or agents for all his disbursements, and shall furnish the returning officer with a proper statement of his election expenses. In this case there was a return, and according to respondent's own testimony, the amount of his election expenses published by his election agent, with his knowledge and approbation, was not $400 or $500 but $20 and this sum did not include the $5 paid Asselin. As appellant says, no account of it was rendered. Can it be said he has not laid himself open to the presumption, which the authorities recognize, that this payment to Asselin and these moneys so distributed were not included because they were illegally expended? The reason he gives for not furnishing a statement of the expenditure of this money is that he considered that it was \"personal expenses,\" and that he was, consequently, not bound by the law to pay it out through an agent or to furnish an account of it. But the learned Judge of the court below very properly answers this in this way:\u2014\nIt is evident that the respondent's pretension that the moneys he expended, which are not included in the published statement of his election expenses, were personal expenses, and such as he was not bound to make known, is defeated by his own testimony. Common sense alone suffices to show that such expenditures, as I have enumerated, are not personal expenses; but even if this were not as self-evident as it is the 125th section of the Election Act would render doubt impossible.\nSurely Mr. Larue cannot say that the clandestine payment of $5 to Asselin was a personal expense. But it does not rest-there for Asselin adds \"that he did not work and performed no service for the benefit of Mr. Larue.\" If the money was intended to be given as money to he spent as agent, Mr. Asselin ought to have returned what he had not earned. Mr. Larue never asked for it, nor for any account, and very obviously never intended Asselin should make any return or furnish any account. What possible avail can any legislation be for the purpose of securing a free and honest vote of the electors if a candidate can slip $5 into the pocket of one voter, give $10 to another and $20 to another, and so on, and these men never render an account of these monies, and the candidate asks for and expects none? Can there be any other conclusion arrived at than that these \"moneys were corruptly expended,\u2014and where the Judge, who has tried the case and heard the witnesses, has arrived at an honest conclusion that such was the case, how can any appellate court, in the face of all these facts and these surrounding circumstances, say that such a conclusion was erroneous? It is always more pleasant for a Judge to arrive at a conclusion favorable to innocence than one which will bear so hard upon the appellant; but it is impossible for us to say, on the evidence adduced in this case, that the learned Judge who tried this case was wrong in his appreciation of the facts.\nThere are other cases put forward to which I do not think it necessary to refer, as the effect of my judgment on this case of Asselin is to confirm the judgment of the court below and dismiss the appeal. FOURNIER, J:\u2014\nIt is the second time that this case comes in appeal before this court. The first appeal, under sec. 48 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, was limited to one point to wit: whether the Dominion, controverted Elections Act of 1874 was constitutional. On this second appeal a very important question, arising from the interpretation to be given to this same 48th section is submitted to us i.e.\u2014whether after a first appeal, in which the right of appeal has been limited (as it may be under section 48) to certain questions of law or of fact, a second appeal may be had on that part of the case which was withdrawn from the consideration of the court in the first appeal. In other words, could this court, under the existing law, at the time of the first appeal, for any reason whatever when seized of a case send it back to the lower court? On the contrary, was it not the duty of this court to give a final judgment and to report its decision to the Speaker of the House of Commons, in conformity with the provisions contained in the 48th section? Or, which would amount to the same thing, at that time could there be two appeals in a controverted election case?\nIn order to properly understand the position of the parties, it is necessary to give a summary of the facts and procedure of the case. It will be remembered that after the general elections of 1878 the question as to the constitutionality of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 was raised in a number of cases, and that the judges who were called upon to deliver their opinion dissented from one another. In the court- Of first instance the parties in this case did not make this objection as a preliminary objection within the delays specified in the rules of practice, for it was only when the trial commenced that the objection was made; notwithstanding the objection, the judge ordered the trial to be proceeded with. The case was then heard on the merits as well on the question of law as on the questions of fact. On; the 27th April 1879, Mr. Justice McCord delivered a judgment, dismissing the petition, with costs. I do not assume that a judgment was rendered on the merits. I have in favour of my position the very words of the judgment, which says the petition is dismissed. To say the reverse, is assuming, in the face of his words, that no judgment was given. The effect of which was to annul the petition made by Deslauriers against the return of the present appellant, as member of the House of Commons for Bellechasse. The only reason given for this decision was that the Controverted Elections Act was unconstitutional. The questions of fact were not dealt with, although by the effect of the judgment the questions of fact as well as the question of law were decided, the petition being finally dismissed with costs. From this judgment the first appeal was taken.\nBefore referring to the proceedings taken on the first appeal I will read that part of section 48 under which they were made. This section after giving a right of appeal to the court, fixing the mode and delays of giving notice of appeal to the adverse party, gives to the appellant the right of limiting his appeal in these words:\nIn and by which notice the said party so appealing may, if he desires, limit the subject of the said appeal to any special and defined question or questions; and the appeal shall thereupon he heard and determined by the Supreme Court, which shall pronounce such judgment upon questions of law or of fact, or both, as in the opinion of the said court ought to have been given by the judge, whose decision is appealed from, and the Supreme Court may make such order as to the money deposited as aforesaid, and as to the costs of the appeal as it may think just; and in case it appears to the Court that any evidence duly tendered at the trial was improperly rejected, the Court may cause the witness to be examined. before- the court or a Judge thereof, or upon commission; and the Register shall certify to the Speaker of the House of Commons the judgment and decision of the court upon the several questions as well of fact as of law, upon which the judge appealed from might otherwise have determined and certified his decision in pursuance of the said Act in the same manner as the said Judge should otherwise have done, and with the same effect, and the judgment and decision of the Supreme Court shall be final to all intents and purposes.\nDeslauriers, the then appellant and the now respondent, wishing to avail himself of these provisions, moved on the 22nd January, as follows:\u2014\n22nd January, 1880.\u2014 Motion on behalf of the appellant that, inasmuch as the present appeal is only upon the question of law raised by the respondent to wit; whether the Dominion Controverted Elections Act 1874 is constitutional, the printing of the record be dispensed with, and further, that the delivery of any factum or points for argument in appeal be also dispensed with.\nIn support of this motion Mr. Tailon as solicitor for the appellant, made an affidavit, and by the following paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, shows what Deslaurier's position was on that appeal.\n2. That by the paid record it appears that the above named appellants petition has been dismissed on the grounds that The Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, is ultra vires, because it gives to the judges of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec and to the said Superior Court of the said Province of Quebec, a new jurisdiction which can be conferred only by the Local Legislature of the said province.\n4. That the question of law referred to in the second paragraph of this affidavit is the only question of law apparent in the said record.\n5. That the said record is very voluminous and contains about 225 pages of foolscap, and that it would be very costly and expensive to get the same printed, and that the printing of the said record and of the lengthy evidence of numerous witnesses on questions different from that before this court would not in any way afford any additional facility in the decision of this case because the only question is one of law namely; whether the said Act is constitutional or not; and I verily believe that the printing of the said record, and of the evidence contained therein on facts and of several documents unconnected with the point in question now before this court will be unnecessary in the decision of the point raised.\n6. That the appeal has been limited by notice to the question of the constitutionality of the said Controverted Elections Act of 1874.\nThis proceeding limiting the appeal, accompanied by affidavit to show that the required notice in such a case had been given, as seen above, was authorized by the 48th section, and was subsequently sanctioned by a judgment delivered on the 22nd January, 1880.\nThus as it was his right to do, the appellant withdrew from the consideration of this court the questions of fact. Whatever were his motives in so doing, and whether by adopting this procedure he well understood his interests or not whether or not there would be a failure of justice if a second appeal is not entertained, it is not for us to say all that I need consider at present is whether he was legally right when he thus limited this appeal. It is impossible to deny that by the 48th section he was given that option. His appeal as limited was then heard and adjudged.\nIn this case as well as in that of Valin v. Langlois this court unanimously decided that the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 was constitutional: and this was the only question upon which the court was called upon to give its decision.\nThe order to transmit the record to the Lower Court is as follows:\u2014\nThat the record in the said appeal should be transmitted to the proper officer of the Superior Court for Lower Canada in and for the District of Montmagny being the officer by whom they said record was transmitted to this court to have the said cause proceeded with ac-cording to law.\nRelying on this order, the learned judge who decided the case in the first instance for a second time undertook to sit on the case and delivered the judgment which is now appealed from. The appellant Larue, \"who by this judgment was not only unseated, but was also adjudged personally guilty of corrupt practices, in his turn brought the case in appeal to this court. He denies that the judge who had finally decided the case once had jurisdiction to give a second judgment, alleging that the judgment of this court given on 3rd March, 1880 was a final judgment and that the case could not be sent back to the Lower Court for a judgment upon the facts. Is he right in his contention? I will at once remark that it would be a grave mistake to rely on any analogy or comparison taken from the procedure regulating civil cases, as applicable to election cases; for there cannot be any. In election cases the right of appeal such as we have it here does not exist anywhere else. It is an exceptional right, heretofore unknown, and which is regulated by special provisions, which are to be found in the 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, and in the special rules of practice made by this Court for the prosecution of these appeals as may be seen by the 50th Rule of the Supreme Court, rules which declare that the rules applicable to appeals in civil cases shall not apply to appeals in controverted election cases\nWe must therefore look only to the 48th section of the Act and the special rules in order to obtain a solution to the question now submitted to us.\nOf course I admit that in ordinary cases this court has not only the power, but very often it may be its duty to send back a cause before the court of first instance for one reason or another bat in election cases under the circumstances of this case, it seems to me equally clear that we have no such power. There can be no circumstance, I think, no procedure, by virtue of sec. 48 which could authorize this court once the appeal is brought before the court to send back the case to the court of first instance in order to be further dealt with. I have state4 already that the necessary proceedings to limit the appeal in this case had been taken, and that they were subsequently sanctioned by an order of a judge of this court. The case having been agreed on and submitted to us what were we obliged to do? Our duty is well defined in the 48th section: \u2014\nIt was to pronounce such judgment upon questions of law or of fact, or both, as in the opinion of the said court ought to have been given by the judge whose decision is appealed from, &c, &c.\nThe court was bound to give the judgment which ought to have been given, and this is what was done so far as it was in the power of the court to do. The court could not do more. Could the court send back to the judge, who first tried the case, that part of the case which had been withdrawn by the act of the present respondent from the consideration of this court? Certainly not. I cannot understand how a contrary opinion can be seriously entertained. The court was bound to deliver a final judgment, as required by the 48th section:\u2014\nIn the same manner as the said judge should otherwise have done and with the same effect, and the judgment and decision of the Supreme Court shall be final to all intents and purposes.\nIt will be remembered that this case had been tried upon the merits, argued on the merits, and that a final judgment dismissing the petition was delivered by the judge who tried the case. The case was, therefore, ripe for an appeal on all questions of law and of fact. If the present respondent had not limited his appeal, it would have been the duty of this court to have given a judgment upon the questions of fact as well as of law, even admitting (which I unequivocally say they were), that they were not adjudged upon by the first judgment dismissing the petition.\nIt is contended that if the appeal had not been limited this court would have had no power to express an opinion on the questions of fact, because the judge of the court below had not given any Other reasons for his judgment, than that he was of opinion the Act was unconstitutional, and therefore did not give any judgment upon the facts. This contention certainly cannot be sustained, for, on the contrary, if a judge, as in the present case, is called upon to express his opinion upon a question of fact, does not do so, that alone in my opinion would be a good and valid ground of appeal, and in such a case the law directs this court not to send back the record to the judge who has not given a decision, but to pronounce such judgment as ought to have been pronounced by the judge whose decision is appealed from.\nIf it is said that this court would then be a court of original jurisdiction, then I say that we do act, and it is the duty of this court to act as a court of original jurisdiction every time that we reverse a judgment and pronounce the judgment that the court of original jurisdiction ought to have pronounced.\nI therefore do not hesitate to say that I am of opinion that if the whole case had been submitted to us on the first appeal, our duty would have been to pronounce a judgment upon the questions of fact, which the judge of the court below ought to have pronounced. \"We are asked also what course would this court have adopted, if the judge, after hearing one or two witnesses at the trial, instead of completing the trial, had refused to hear any more witnesses and pronounced the judgment which was the subject of the first appeal? This objection can easily be answered, for by referring to sec. 48, it is clearly expressed what the duty of the court would be in such a case:\nAnd in case it appears to this court that any evidence duly tendered at the trial was improperly rejected the court may cause the witness to be examined before the court or a judge thereof or upon commission Thus, it is clear, that instead of sending back the case to the court below it is the duty of this court to hear the witnesses. This part of section 48, in my opinion, deprives this court of all power to divest itself of any jurisdiction over the case. On the contrary, upon this court is imposed the duty of completing the trial, no doubt for the purpose of avoiding any delays which would naturally follow the sending back of the case, and also for the purpose of conforming to the spirit of the law respecting Controverted Elections, i.e.,\u2014that these cases should be proceeded with without delay and with all possible despatch.\nBy this same section, the court is directed through its registrar\nTo certify to the Speaker of the House of Commons, the judgment and decision of the court upon the several questions as well of fact as of law upon which the judge appealed from might otherwise have determined and certified his decision in pursuance of the said Act in the same manner as the said judge should otherwise have done and with the same effect.\nOnce an appeal is brought, this court alone can certify to the speaker in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and the jurisdiction of the judge of the lower court ceases and there is no law which gives us the power to send back the case to him in order to make the required certificate.\nThose provisions of the 48th section to which I have just referred, immediately follow that provision of the section which gives a party the right of limiting his appeal. These provisions clearly show that there must be a final judgment given on the appeal, and that although permitting an appeal to be limited, there was no intention that it might be divided and have several appeals in the same case. On the contrary, the legislature clearly intended that the one appeal which was granted should be as simple, as expeditious and as cheap as possible To arrive at the conclusion that because the appeal may be limited, there can be several appeals in the same case seems to me to put oneself in direct contradiction with the letter and spirit of the law.\nI have no hesitation in saying that under the law which we are to look to in deciding this case, there can be no doubt on this point. This court has already decided this question in the case of Brassard v. Langevin, where it was held that a judgment on preliminary objections dismissing a petition, was not appealable, and that under that section (sec. 48, 38 Vic. 0.11) an appeal will lie only from the decision of a judge who has tried the merits of an election petition. I did not concur in that judgment, but since then the interpretation given by this court received the sanction of Parliament by 42 Vic c. 39, sec. 10.\nThis section, although allowing an appeal on preliminary objections to an election petition, does not apply to cases then pending, except cases in which the appeal has been allowed and duly filed. This case cannot be governed by the proviso which is at the end of section 10. As I have just stated, if we are to be guided by the law and the decision in force before the passing of 42 Vic. c. 39 which was sanctioned on the 15th May 1879 there could only be one appeal in an election case. Since in order to remove the serious inconvenience which might result in having an election petition dismissed for some error in the procedure, which otherwise might have resulted in having the election declared null the law has wisely given an appeal from a judgment on preliminary objections, but that is all Section 48 has not been otherwise amended and there is nothing which gives any additional remedy after the case has been tried on the merits.\nI have already shown, when referring to the procedure, that no preliminary objections were filed in this case. The question as to the constitutionality of the Act was raised at the hearing of the case on the merits If even it could be said that the first appeal taken on the question of law was in fact such an appeal on preliminary objections as was subsequently allowed by 42 Vic. c. 39 I would be still of opinion that c. 39 could not avail the appellant on this appeal. For by the proviso in that section, the right of appeal is not given in cases in litigation and then pending, except in cases where the appeal has been allowed and duly filed. The only case pending, in which the appeal had been allowed and filed was that of Valin v. Langlois which was filed in this court on the 30th June 1879 and as the law was sanctioned on the 15th May 1879, the proviso could only apply to that case, and thus this appellant was able to get a judgment of this court pronounced on an appeal from a judgment on preliminary objections. The same rule cannot apply in this case as the case does not come within the proviso of sec. 10. The first appeal was only filed on the 23rd June, 1879, so that, if the then appellant had intended to avail himself of that proviso, he should have filed his appeal before the 15th May, 1879, the date on which the bill was sanctioned.\nIt is very evident that this Act cannot be invoked first, because there were no preliminary objections; secondly, if there had been any, the appeal not being allowed and filed before the 15th May 1879 it would not have come within the terms of the proviso of section 10. Now, as under the law there could only be one appeal, it is clear that the judgment which this court has already pronounced on the first was a final judgment, and that it should have been certified to the Speaker of the House of Commons in accordance with the provisions of the 48th section. The Judge of the court below had no jurisdiction over this case a second time, and this court had no power to confer upon him any jurisdiction over this case, as it was our duty to pronounce a judgment \"final to all intents and purposes.\" The terms further proceedings,\" &c, in our first judgment, relied on by the Judge of the court below, cannot mean anything more than that the record was to be sent back for the purpose of taxing costs, issuing writ of execution, &c, &c.; but surely cannot mean what the learned Judge has thought it did, to give him the power of pronouncing a second judgment.\nI am therefore of opinion that the duty of the court in the case now before us would be to declare that the court below had no jurisdiction to pronounce the second judgment which is now appealed from, and that the Registrar of this court should be directed to certify to the Speaker of the House of Commons that by our judgment of 3rd June, we decided the question of the constitutionality of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act,1874, which was the only question submitted to us by that appeal; and as we were not called upon to give an opinion on the questions of fact, because the appellant had limited his appeal, we had nothing to report upon the facts of the case.\nFor these reasons I cannot concur in, saying that we can entertain a second appeal. I may add also that this is not the first case in which the party has limited his appeal. There have been several cases from Ontario, and amongst others the case of Wheler v. Gibbs. In that case the appellant limited his appeal to the question of disqualification, not appealing from that part of the judgment which declared his election void. Now, on this appeal he succeeded in having the sentence of disqualification set aside, \"What would be now the duty of this court, nay I ask, if the appellant came be-fore this court and asked us to set aside also that part of the judgment which declared the election void? We would treat his contention as being too absurd to be entertained. Yet this is virtually what we are now asked to do on this second appeal. What must be our answer? I certainly am ready to give the same answer that we would give to Wheler on a second appeal.\nI do not express any opinion on the questions of fact, although I have carefully considered them, and in consequence I do not take part in the judgment which is to be delivered, keeping my seat only for the purpose of forming a quorum, in order that the judgment of the majority of the court may he delivered.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe question of the jurisdiction of the learned Judge who tried the merits of the petition in this case and who, after having given a previous one which was appealed from to this court and decided on the point to which the appeal was limited, has since pronounced the judgment now under our consideration, was formally raised at the hearing before us and calls for our decision The position of the case is as anomalous as unprecedented and has demanded and received from me no little consideration and study; and, after briefly referring to the circumstances and law, I will give succinctly my views upon the issues raised.\nNo preliminary objections were taken to the petition; but, before the petitioner's case was opened, the jurisdiction of the learned Judge to try the merits of a petition, under the Dominion Elections Act was objected to and argued before, but not decided by, him. He proceeded to fry the merits of the petition, and after hearing all the evidence on both sides passed an order dismissing the petition, and gave as his reason for so doing the want of jurisdiction. From that judgment the petitioner appealed to this court, but took the necessary steps to limit the appeal to the question of jurisdiction of the Judge and obtained an order from me to limit the printing of the case and factums to that point. After argument of the point of jurisdiction (the only one before us) this court unanimously reversed the judgment below. Some time afterwards (the record having been remitted back to the court below) the learned Judge took it up, and, without further hearing of the parties, or further evidence, gave the judgment in question. The question is, therefore, as to his power or jurisdiction.\nIt is contended that but one appeal can be taken in an election case, and that the Judge who tried the merits could not again have cognizance of the case after dismissing the petition by the order, and that an appeal having been had and determined, the Judge had no further jurisdiction in the case. It is contended, on the other side that as his avowed reason for dismissing the petition was for want of jurisdiction, and his judgment being reversed, he was remitted to his original jurisdiction by the sending back of the record. We must see what are the legal provisions applicable to the case. The jurisdiction of both the Judge and of this court depends solely on the provisions of the statutes. As a Judge, merely, of the Superior Court he had no jurisdiction; nor had we any as a Court of Appeal. It is a distinct jurisdiction given for purposes and objects very different from those coming within the ordinary powers of the two tribunals, with different rules an4 provisions, and requiring different treatment and consideration, and the statute provides that in cases not provided for by the rules of court under it,\nThe principles, practice and rules on which election petitions touching the election of members of the House of Commons in England are at the time of the passing of this Act, dealt with shall be observed so far as consistent1y with this Act they may be observed by courts and Judges thereof.\nThat and. other provisions of the Act show plainly the intention of the Legislature to exclude the ordinary jurisdiction and procedure of the two tribunals created to try the merits of election petitions. The powers vested in the two tribunals must therefore be considered only such as are given specially by the statute, and the Special rules made under it and to be exercised as if the two tribunals had jurisdiction of no other cases or matters. The powers are limited by the statutes and rules made under them, which latter are specially directed to such cases and other rules of this court declared inapplicable to election cases. The proceedings in appeal therefore cannot be affected by the practice or procedure in ordinary cases.\nA majority of this court decided that under the statute first passed there was no appeal from the decision of the Judge on preliminary objections, and the Legislature remedied the difficulty which was felt as the law at first stood. An appeal lies therefore from the decision upon them, but the amended legislation in that respect does not in my view affect at all the question before us. At first sight it appears strange that in a case like this where the petitioner, by the decision of the Judge against him at the trial, on the question of jurisdiction, should be compromised; and that the subsequent judgment of this court on that point alone, although in his favor, could be of no essential service to him. If however, he has, by pursuing a wrong course, shut himself out from the benefit of a judgment on the merits the fault must be found where it existed. By the appeal in the first instance the whole record could have come before this court and as all the evidence had been taken the merits of the case might have been argued before, and adjudged on by, this court, and we would have been authorized and required to give the judgment which in our view should have been given by the Judge below. Having in the first place decided in favor of the jurisdiction we would then have considered and adjudged as to the merits of the petition.\nIt is, however, contended that as the Judge who tried the petition had not given judgment on the merits we could not assume an original jurisdiction. That contention is, I think, unsupported by reason. Suppose for instance an election petition contains several charges, and proof to sustain some of them is adduced; hut in giving judgment the Judge fails to refer to some of the charges proved, but sustains the petition on others, no one will contend that by such omission this court on appeal could not consider and decide upon the omitted cases. The Judge had given no judgment as to them, and still we could do so, although each charge stands independent of all the others. If, then, for several out of a number of cases our right and duty would not be affected by the omission of the Judge should not the same principle apply to all the offences charged ? In this case the learned Judge substantially says \"I have no jurisdiction, and therefore will pronounce no judgment on the merits.\" This court decided he had jurisdiction and that he should have given a judgment on the whole case, and, if the appeal had not been limited, we could have given the judgment he should have given. The Judge, no matter for what reason, gave a judgment on the whole case by dismissing the petition. He could not give any but a final judgment, and that he did give. If he had not done so it could not have come to us by appeal. By coming fully to us we would, under his judgment dismissing the petition, have full cognizance of everything before him; and having all the evidence before us, could have pronounced judgment, as well on the merits as on the question of jurisdiction. Suppose the Judge, as he might have done, had merely dismissed the petition would this court not have jurisdiction over the whole record on appeal? We certainly would, and giving a defective reason for his doing so, does not, in my opinion, alter the case.\nIt is contended that in a case where only part of the evidence had been taken this court could not provide for having the remaining evidence taken, and that therefore we could not decide in a case where the whole evidence had been taken. I submit in the first place that the proposition is unsound, for if under the statute we have jurisdiction when the whole evidence was tak3n, a defect in providing for the other contingency does not affect our jurisdiction; and, in the second place, the statute gives this court the power, and it would be its duty to have the balance of the evidence taken, provided it was as it should be tendered at the trial If either \"party failed to tender the evidence the laches would be his own, and he should suffer the consequences. The words of the statute are so direct and plain that the most ignorant counsel could not be presumed not to understand them But that difficulty does not meet us in this case, and, but for other references, I would not have thought it necessary to touch upon it.\nIf there is one feature more prominent than any other in the Act it is that as little delay as possible should take place in the final decision of election petitions. The time for the different steps or proceedings in them is greatly shortened compared with other cases. The Judge who tries the petition is required, immediately on the expiration of eight days, to report his decision to the Speaker if no appeal has been taken and the Registrar of this court is required to report in the same way the judgment of this court. This court is authorized to deal with the whole costs in the case, and to order in respect of the money paid into court as security, so as finally to deal with all matters connecting with it, showing the intention clearly was that the case was not to be remitted back for any purpose. The policy 01 the Legislature, as exhibited by the Act was to hasten the final decision as far as practicable, and in order to prevent unnecessary delay-by sending the record down to take evidence improperly refused this court is authorized to have it taken in either of three modes pointed out. It is patent to my mind from the whole construction of the Act, that the Legislature deliberately intended that when a case once came to this court the functions of the Judge ceased as regards the merits of the case, and this court should fully deal with the case to final judgment; and to show how the intention of the Legislature in regard to the prevention of delay has been frustrated in this case, I need only state that our judgment on the question of jurisdiction was delivered more than eleven months ago; and but for the limiting of this appeal by the respondent, our judgment oil the merits of the petition might have then ended the controversy.\nThere is no provision in the statutes for sending back the record from this court, and when a judgment has been given by the Judge, final in its nature but for the appeal, I can see no power in this court to authorize the Judge again to assume any jurisdiction in regard to it.\nThe formal order of this court was to remit back the record to be proceeded with according to law. If the law furnished no further means of proceeding, our order could not create them. The order was made without any hearing of the parties, but if they had been heard and the peculiar position of the case brought out before us, I. if then taking the same view as I now do, would certainly have objected to that course, and would have suggested what appears now to me to have been the proper course and that is for the Registrar of this court to have reported the special circumstances by which, through the act of the respondent, we were prevented from giving a judgment on the merits of the petition.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nHolding the opinion I have expressed, I do not consider it necessary to express my view as to the merits of the petition, particularly as the majority of the court who differ from me in regard to the question of jurisdiction have agreed as to the merits of the petition also, and any opinion I might express would not affect the result.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nThe appellant's contention, that Mr. Justice McCord should not have rendered judgment in the case till a new notice of inscription had been given, cannot be now sustained. It would, perhaps, have been more regular if this had been done, but whatever irregularity there may have been in the matter has been waived by the appellant's conduct in the court below. Having been informed by Mr. Justice McCord that the case was to be proceeded with the appellant made no objection to it. He cannot here avail himself of irregularities which he was aware of, and to which he did not object in the court below.\nOn the merits I am of opinion to dismiss the appeal. Indeed I do not see upon what grounds this case has been brought to appeal. Coulure's case, did it stand alone, is so clearly proved by Couture himself, that the appellant's only hope of success before this court must have been based upon the assumption that this court would be disposed to review the judgment of the court below as to the credibility of this witness. Now when the Judge who presided at the trial, who heard this witness who saw his demeanor in the box and. the manner in which he gave his evidence has believed him and has accepted his evidence as entirely reliable, can we here reject his testimony as unreliable and decide that he is not a credible witness ? Is there anything in the record which would authorize us to do so ? The general rule is, as stated by Lord Chelmsford in Gray v. Turnbull ([4]), that upon a question of fact an appellate tribunal ought not to be called upon to decide which side preponderates on a mere balance of evidence. To procure a reversal, it must be shown irresistibly that the judgment complained of on a matter of fact is not only wrong but entirely erroneous.\nIn the Hallon case ([5]) Richards, O. J., said:\u2014\nWe do not think we can properly interfere with the decision of the learned Chief Justice as to the facts found by him, the general rule being that the finding of the Judge who hears the witnesses where there is conflicting evidence, and the decision turns on the credibility of the witnesses, should prevail. He sees the witnesses, hears their testimony, observes the way in which they answer questions and is in a much better position to decide on conflicting evidence than those who merely read the statements of the witnesses, as they have been taken down. We are all of opinion that we ought not to interfere with the finding of the learned Chief Justice as to the matters of fact.\nAnd Strong, J., added:\u2014\nThe question of fact argued on this appeal must, I am of opinion, be held to be concluded by the determination of the learned Judge who tried the petition. * * * It is a principle well established in the procedure of appellate tribunals, including the highest court of the Empire\u2014the House of Lords\u2014that questions of fact depending on the veracity of witnesses, and the credit to be given to them, are concluded by the finding of the Judge of first instance, in whose presence the testimony is given ([6]).\nOf course this rule does not apply where the case depends upon the drawing of inferences from the facts in evidence ([7]) but there is nothing of the kind here.\nTake Couture's case, Couture had been mayor of Buckland for seven years and was in the employ of the Local Government as a forester (garde-forestier). He was a Conservative, had worked against Mr. Boutin the local member, at the last previous election, and had also worked actively against Larue during the election of 1875. On the 10th June, 1878, just three months before the nomination day for the present election, he met the respondent at Mr. Swiberg LaRue's at St. Charles. He states that LaRue then told him that Mr. Boutin had been doing his best to get him (Couture) turned out of place, but that he (LaRue) had done all he could to keep him in office; that an election was about to take place and that if Couture acted as he had done during the previous election, it was pretty sure that he was done for, \"que son affaire \u00c9tait cuite;\" that he (LaRue) had stood by him and that it was on that account that he had not lost his place. He then says :\nJe dis alors l\u00e0 \u00e0 M. LaRue que je serais pour lui. Il me dit alors que si les gardes-forestiers tombaient Il me ferait avoir quelque chose do meilleur quo \u00e7a; j'ai compris une position meilleure du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nHe swears that LaRue promised:\nDe sauver ma position, et due si les gardes-forestiers \u00e9taientabolis, jaurais quelque chose de mieux que a.\nFurther on he says:\nIl ne m'a pas dit quoi; j'ai compt\u00e9 sur sa parole; il m'a dit que ses amis il en aurait soin; c'\u00e9tait pendant la derni\u00e8re election; je me suis rencontre avec M. Achille LaRue pendant la lutte, je ne suis pas capable do dire la date, et l\u00e0 M. LaRue me dit qu'il aurait soin de ses amis, et mille autres t\u00e9moignages do m\u00eame.\nIf Couture's testimony is to be relied upon, the judg ment of the court below is unimpeachable and the court below having relied upon it and given credence to it, there is nothing in the record which would warrant us here to say that it must be rejected as un-worthy of belief.\nThe appellant seems to think that because he on oath as he pretends to have done, positively denied the conversation with him, sworn to by Couture, ipso facto couture's testimony ought not to have been relied upon by the Judge who presided at the trial. Now, we cannot interfere in such a case with the finding of the learned judge on a question of fact. He found Couture a reliable and respectable witness and gave full credit to his testimony, and, without imputing anything derogatory to the character of the appellant he, the said Judge, was of opinion that he, the appellant, must have forgotten a promise made in the heat of an electoral contest. Now, I do not see how the learned Judge could act otherwise. To believe Couture was not to impute perjury to Larue, whilst to reject Couture's evidence would have been imputing perjury to him, Couture.\nIt is a recognized rule of evidence that, ordinarily, a witness who testifies to an affirmative is entitled to credit in preference to one who testifies to a negative, because the latter may have forgotten what actually occurred, whilst it is impossible to remember what never existed. This rule has received a frequent application. I will only refer to the case of Lane v. Jackson in England ([8]), to the case of Wright v. Rankin, in Ontario ([9]), and to the case of Still v. Hindekopers, in the United States Supreme Court ([10]). In Lane v. Jack' son the Master of the Rolls said:\nI have frequently stated that where the positive fact of a particular conversation is said, to have taken place between two persons of equal credibility, and one states positively that it took place, and the other as positively denies it, I believe that the words were said, and that the person who denies their having been said has forgotten the circumstance. By this means, I give full credit to both parties. An axiom of the civil law, originated at a time when the rule testis unus testis nullus prevailed said, in the same sense: \"Magis creditur duobus testibus affirmantibus quam milles negantibus.\"\nI also agree with the Chief Justice that the David Asselin five dollars case has been made out against the appellant. The fact that the appellant did not include this sum in the return of his expenses required by the Act is a strong presumption that, in his own mind, this payment could not bear scrutiny ([11]). The contention that he was not bound to return this payment because it was a personal expense, cannot be sustained. Mr. Justice McCord demonstrates clearly that, according to the appellant's own evidence, a part at least of these five dollars was not for personal expenses, and then the statute requires personal expenses as well as all other expenses to be included in the return required ([12]).\nIn fact, sec. 123 clearly says so; the word expected therein is a misprint for excepted; 26-27 Vic, ch. 29, sec. 4 Imperial. But even as it reads it includes personal expenses: \"A detailed statement of all expenses incurred by or on behalf of any candidate\u201d must include personal expenses.\nI am of opinion to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nUpon the hearing of this appeal, it was objected that, after the case was remitted from this court to be proceeded with according to law Mr. Justice McCord had no jurisdiction to take up the case and to pronounce a judgment upon the merits.\nBut for the countenance which this objection has received in this court I should have thought the point to have been free from all doubt.\nThe election petition came originally before Mr. Justice McCord for trial, when the then respondent, the now appellant, on the 27th January, 1879 before the trial of the petition was entered upon and any evidence tendered, filed, as a preliminary objection to the judge entering upon the case, a formal paper, insisting that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The learned judge did not at once pronounce judgment upon this objection but reserved it for his consideration until the evidence upon the merits should be taken when, if he should be of opinion that he had jurisdiction, he would, of course, proceed with the case upon the merits; but, if he should be of opinion that he had no jurisdiction, he, of necessity, must decline to enter into the merits, for in such case, in his judgment, the evidence which had been taken must needs be evidence taken coram non judice. At the close of the evidence, the learned judge, having taken en delib\u00e9r\u00e9 the objection to his jurisdiction arrived at the conclusion that he had no jurisdiction in the case and he therefore declined to enter into it upon its merits and he made an order in the following terms :\nHaving heard the parties on the objections made by the defendant to the petition of the petitioner and after mature deliberation, the objection made by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court and its judge\u2019s ii declared well founded, and, in consequence; the said objection is maintained, and the petition of the petitioner is rejected and dismissed.\nNow it is contended that this word d \u201cdismissed\" being used here, the petition has been dismissed absolutely, and that the merits were therefore disposed of, and that the judgment given by the learned judge having been appealed it would have been open to this court, upon the former appeal, to have decided the case upon the merits, if the then appellant had not, as is said, limited his appeal to the question of jurisdiction This contention as it seems to me is based upon a very apparent fallacy; and, indeed, if the objection were well founded it would be one to the order made by this court, upon the former appeal, when, for the reason that the merits had not been entered into at all by the court of first instance this court remitted the record to be proceeded with according to law, that is, to be adjudicated upon by the constitutional tribunal of first instance upon the merits. As matter of law and of fact we know that the petition was not dismissed, and the order itself in which the word is used shows that it was not in any other sense than that it was dismissed from the consideration of the learned judge, as the necessary consequence of his having maintained the objection taken to his jurisdiction, thereby holding that he had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the case, and having no such jurisdiction he could not adjudicate by dismissing the petition. It is to the substance that we must look, and not criticize too closely the accuracy of the formal expressions used. The appeal taken against this order was not, in truth, an appeal against an order dismissing the petition, hut against an order maintain-in0, objections taken to the judge's jurisdiction, the consequence of maintaining which objection was that justice had been frustrated by the petition not having been adjudicated upon at all. It is said that the appellant in that appeal limited the appeal to the question of jurisdiction; but there was nothing for him to limit,---that was the sole point which could have been appealed for it was the sole point adjudicated upon or professed or intended so to be and the limitation was affixed by the learned judge from, the nature of his judgment. In that case the evidence taken before Mr. Justice McCord and which his judgment in effect held to have been taken coram, non judice, could not properly have been brought before this court and on motion of the then appellant, that as the appeal was only upon the question of law raised by the respondent, to wit, whether the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 was constitutional, there was no occasion for printing anything, the printing of the record and the delivery of factums were dispensed with. This order was a proper one to have been made not because of the appellant (when in a position to appeal against an adjudication upon the merits) having limited his appeal to a point of law, but because the adjudication of the learned judge to the effect that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition, was the only thing which was decided and which was open to appeal. The 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, which enables this court to give such judgment as the Judge in the court below should have given, plainly applies to the case of an appeal from a judgment on the merits after trial. The whole frame of the section shows this there is nothing in the Act to warrant this court in constituting itself a court of first instance to hear and determine the merits of an election petition-in a case in which the constituted tribunal of first instance has refused to adjudicate upon the petition on the ground that it had no jurisdiction. The former appeal having been, as it only could have been, against the decision of the Judge, which was, that he had no jurisdiction, this court pronounced the only judgment which it could have pronounced, when it allowed the appeal, and held that he had jurisdiction, and remitted the record to him to be proceeded with according to law and this only could be by his exercising the jurisdiction which he had declined to exercise, upon the ground that, in his opinion he had it not. This he did by offering to the counsel of each of the parties a rehearing of the case, which both parties, considering it to be unnecessary, declined, and he proceeded to adjudicate on the petition upon its merits. From this adjudication this appeal is taken, which now for the first time brings the merits before this court to be dealt with under section 48 of the Act.\nI am of the opinion, which I have invariably entertained in these election cases, that if there are any cases in which more than in others we should inflexibly adhere to the rule that we should never reverse upon mere matters of fact the findings of the learned Judge who sees and hears the witnesses and tries the case, unless we are convinced beyond doubt that his conclusions are erroneous it is in these election petitions, where so much of necessity depends upon the manner in which the witnesses give their evidence.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the judgment of the learned Judge should be maintained and that the election should be voided upon all the grounds upon which it has been pronounced to be void in his judgment.\nAs to the case of Eusebe Couture it is urged that such a judgment would be at variance with the judgment of this court in Somerville v. Laflamme, but there is nothing in that case to the effect that where there is but one witness speaking directly to a charge of personal corruption which is denied by the accused person on oath, a Judge is relieved from the duty of seeking for other matter in the evidence which may incline his mind to believe the one in preference to the other, or to reject the testimony of one and believe the other for the manner in which they may have respectively given their evidence or which relieves him from the duty of determining whether he finds anything in the evidence corroborative of the testimony of the one or of the other in the case before us, the learned Judge has taken great pains to show that in truth the present appellant did not in his evidence under oath contradict Couture in the material points, but that it appeared to the learned Judge that the appellant's counsel so framed the questions put to him as to evade eliciting an answer in reality in contradiction of Couture, although upon a hasty view it might seem to be so, and he explains his reasons for believing Couture, and for attributing the appellant's contradiction of Couture if he intended to speak in actual contradiction of him, to forgetfulness of what occurred in the excitement of his canvass. I confess that looking at the loose manner in which the contest, upon the appellant's part, appears to have been conducted, in many matters open to the imputation of corrupt intent there is abundant matter in the evidence which might be referred to as supporting and justifying the conclusions arrived at by the learned Judge.\nThe appeal therefore should be dismissed and the result certified to the House of Commons and Nicolas Pouliot and Anselm Plante should be reported as having been guilty of corrupt practices.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant\u2014Messrs.

The judgment of the Superior Court awarded to the appellant a sum of $1,000 for special and vindictive damages JR. appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), and L., the present appellant, did not ask, by way of cross appeal for an increase of damages, but contended that the judgment for $1,000 should be confirmed. The Court of Queen's Bench partly concurred in the judgment of the Superior Court, but differed as to the amount, because L, had not proved special damages, and the amount awarded was reduced to $500 and costs of appeal were given against the present appellant. L. there upon appealed to the Supreme Court.\nHeld,\u2014(Taschereau J., dissenting) 1. That L., the plaintiff, although respondent in the court below, and not seeking in that court by way of cross-appeal an increase of damages beyond the $1,000, was entitled to appeal, for in determining the amount of the matter in controversy between the parties, the proper course was to look at the amount for which the declaration concluded, and not at the amount of the judgment.

In an action of damages, if the amount awarded in the Court of first instance is not such as to shock the sense of justice and to make it apparent that there was error or partiality on the part of the judge (the exercise of a discretion on his part being in the nature of the case required) an appellate court will not interfere with the discretion such judge has exercised in determining the amount of damages.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, rendered at Quebec in an action of damages for slander, originally instituted at Arthabaskaville by the appellant, and Praying for a condemnation of ten thousand dollars against the respondent. By such judgment the damages awarded by the Superior Court at Arthabaska were reduced from one thousand dollars to five hundred dollars, and the costs of both parties in the Court of Queen.'s Bench were awarded against the appellant.\nThis was an action by one medical practitioner against another for damages for slander.\nThe defences to the action were: the general issue; that defendant was not injured and received no damage; compensation of injuries; and privileged communications.\nThe accusations particularly insisted on by appellant were imputations of his ignorance; that he was not a good doctor; that he killed people by the medicine he gave them; malpractice; that he attended people he could do no good to in order to make a bill; and that he was mad.\nThe evidence is sufficiently referred to in the judgments hereinafter given. On the argument it was admitted that the respondent had made use towards the appellant of language which was not justified nor privileged by the occasion. The principal questions on this appeal were, whether the Court of Appeal was justified in reducing the damages from $1,000 to $500, and 2nd, whether the case was appealable to the Supreme Court.\nOn the latter point, Mir. Laurier, Q. C., argued that the judgment appealed from to the Court of Queen's Bench was for $1,000, and that the present appellant, not having taken out a cross appeal, had acquiesced in the judgment, thereby reducing the matter in dispute between the parties to a sum less than $2000 and therefore the present appellant had debarred himself of the jurisdiction of this court. See Sirey code annot\u00e9 de Proc ([2]).\nMr. Irvine, Q.C, relied on the case of Joyce v. Hart ([3]) in which this court had reviewed all the decisions and had laid down the rule that it was the amount claimed by the declaration which was the amount in dispute.\nThe case was then heard on the merits.\nMr. Irvine, Q.C., and Mr. Gibsone for appellant:\nThe question here is whether this is a case in which the Court of Queen's Bench ought to have disturbed the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction. The only reasons given for reducing the amount were first, because the court considered that appellant had not proved that he suffered any amount of special damages, and that the respondent had been subjected to a much larger amount of costs by the adduction on the part of the appellant of illegal evidence. Now, the principle of reducing the amount of damages because certain costs ought to have been adjudicated against appellant is very erroneous; it would have been more proper to have charged us with the costs of certain witnesses. However, I contend that the judgment of the Superior Court ought not to have been disturbed on that ground.\nIn this case the defendant pleaded the truth of what he had said. When he gave his evidence, he was permitted by the court to answer fully, and in such a manner as to impress upon the public the truth of his slanders; in fact, after hearing the evidence of Dr. Reed, it must have been almost universally believed that his charges against Dr. Levi were true, inasmuch as it could not be presumed that Dr. Reed was guilty of perjury. Had the medical testimony not been taken, the position of matters would have stood thus: Dr. Reed did state him to be a poisoner, and he was a poisoner (and so on as regard the other accusations), but Dr. Reed had no right to make these statements, and therefore we condemn him; thus if we reject the medical testimony, the appellant will suffer a greater injury to his reputation than the one he was complaining of.\nThe next ground was that there was no proof of special damage. Now, I hold it is only necessary for us to prove that a loss to him was the result, and there is evidence that certain parties refused to employ him on account of these reports. It is contended, on the other side, that the appellant's practice increased. But suppose it did increase, is it to be said that it would not have increased more if he had not been injured? Although no actual amount can be shown, yet, as sworn to by some of the medical gentlemen, \"the damage that would be done to Dr. Levi would be serious.\" \u201cThe damage is serious.\"\nAlthough it must be evident from the citations made that the actual damage done the appellant in the practice of his profession must have been and still is very great, let it be assumed, for the sake of argument, that no actual damage was proved, and that the appellant was entitled only to what is known to our law as \" damages vindictis,\" retributive or exemplary damages. In such case it will be seen that the amount awarded was by no means excessive. Our law differs from the law of England, and awards damages without proof of damages to punish the moral wrong, and as a solatium for the mental suffering to the person whose sense of honor has been justly offended.\nIt is also specially to be borne in mind that defamation in our law is considered an offence which is destructive of society and one which specially should be punished with heavy damages; thus it is laid down by Darreau's Traites des injures ([4]).\nOur own courts have decided that exemplary damages will be given without proof of actual damage and that the court will assess the exemplary damages, thus carrying out the doctrine of our law which leaves the case l' arbitrage du judge. Stephen's Digest Vo. Damages ([5]).\nWhy it has been thought proper to disturb the judgment of the judge in the court below, to whose arbitrament the case is by law left, is difficult to ascertain, especially as that judge was personally present when the witnesses for the plaintiff were heard.\nIn estimating the damages the court took into consideration the respective conditions of the parties. The appellant was a young man who had graduated with honors at McGill, and had only been 18 months in practice.\nWith respect to the respondent, his reputation was that of a clever doctor, with 27 years experience in the practice of his profession\u2014 a successful practitioner, a man of great wealth, possessing considerable influence in the community, having enjoyed all possible municipal honors as warden of the county, mayor, &c, and having great influence also through large investments of moneys in the county in question.\nMr. Laurier, Q C, for respondent:\nThere is no question of law in issue between the parties. The only question, upon which this court would be called upon to adjudicate, would be as to whether the evidence warrants the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal, or the conclusion arrived at by the Superior Court in the first instance.\nIt is contended that Courts of Appeal are not justified in disturbing the judgment. of the court of original jurisdiction unless there has been some gross error. If this ruling be not adopted, it would be disturbing the whole course of our jurisprudence.\nIn the province of Quebec, where, in the courts of first instance the judge acts both as judge and jury, Courts of Appeal are ex necessitate compelled to review questions of fact as well as questions of law, but it may well be asked whether such a duty was one contemplated to be devolved upon the Supreme Court of Canada. It may well be asked whether it would be conducive to the public weal, that the Supreme Court should in purely civil cases undertake to scan and scrutinize the evidence and to review facts already reviewed by a court of appeal. It would seem, on the contrary, that questions of fact settled by Courts of Appeal are no more debatable before the Supreme Court and that the mission of the Supreme Court in such cases should rest on the high ground of the law, and upon no other. In the Court of Appeal I argued that there was no evidence of special damages and no actual loss had been suffered. This was the main point upon which the two courts differed. The Superior Court allowed the large sum of $1 000 for \"special and vindictive damages.\"\nOn the other hand, the Court of Appeal expressly avers in its judgment, that no special damages have been proved, and diminishes accordingly the amount of damages granted by the Superior Court. Upon this point, the respondent confidently submits that the evidence warrants, without any possibility of cavil, the view adopted by the Court of Appeal: no proof whatever has been made of special damages.\nAnother reason given by the Court of Appeal to reduce the amount granted by the Superior Court, was the large amount of useless costs made by the appellant, in examining witnesses who should never have been examined, within the hope that perhaps he might find out that the respondent had, in some private and intimate conversation blackened his character\nThe appellant entered also into another kind of evidence still more illegal and irrelevant. The declaration complained that the respondent had attacked both the honesty and skill of the appellant as a physician. Instead of proving that language which he thought slanderous, and resting his case there, and thus putting the respondent on his defence, the appellant chose to bring medical evidence, at great cost, in order to prove the rationale of his treatments.\nAs the whole expense of this irrelevant and illegal evidence had to be borne by the respondent the amount allowed by the original judgment was reduced accordingly by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nBut it was urged in the court below that the respondent had shown great malice, that he was a wealthy man and that the amount of $1000 for vindictive damages alone, was not excessive. The Court of Appeal \u2014Mr. Justice Ramsay dissenting\u2014was of a different opinion.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed the evidence and contended that an examination of the case would fully support the view taken by the Court of Appeal.]\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\n[After stating the facts of the case proceeded as follows:] I do not know that in the whole course of my judicial experience I ever knew of a man who has been so persistently pursued by such slanderous, scandalous and malicious statements as was the appellant in this case, and certainly I have never heard of a brother practitioner trying to obstruct the success of a young man, who has just been admitted to practice by such conduct as that with which the respondent in this case is charged.\nIt is alleged in the declaration, and the allegations have been fully sustained by the evidence, that the respondent\nOn the 4th September, 1877, at the court house at Inverness, in the presence of persons esteemed by the appellant, did publish and say, falsely and maliciously, of the appellant: 'You are a murderer: 'You asked me to murder that woman.' Dr. Levi is the most ignorant man in the profession.'\nAnd again, that at Inverness, about the same time, in the presence of witnesses, respondent said:\nDr. Levi was attending Marley Lambly for his eye, he was doing the boy no good he would have blinded him. Dr. Levi went to attend a little boy of Mr. Ross' s after I grave the boy up, he knew he could do him no good, his object was to extort money from the boy's father, knowing Mr. Ross was a rich man.\u2014\u2014\u2014I and another doctor were attending Mrs. Cox and we gave her up, but Dr. Levi was sent for and he said he could cure her and. after the first dose of medicine Dr, Levi gave her, the woman died. I have twice met Dr. Levi in consultations, and on both occasions Dr. Levi was wrong, but he would not confess it.\u2014\u2014\u2014Dr. Levi is wrong in every case he attends, and mostly all his patients die after the first dose of medicine he gives them.\nThat on the 15th September, A.D. 1877, respondent said at Inverness, in presence of witnesses: If you want a doctor you should send for Dr. Shee, as Dr. Levi is no doctor. Dr. Levi poisoned Robert Reinhardt, and Dr. Hume can prove it.\nThe declaration further alleges that in or about the 20th September, A.D., 1876, the respondent, speaking to one John Cox, said:\nIf Dr. Levi was allowed to do what he wanted to do, your wife would have been dead and Dr. Levi would have been arrested and put in jail.\nAnd on another occasion, speaking to appellant's patients, respondent said:\nIf Dr. Levi had been allowed to do what he wanted to do in the case of Mrs. John Cox she and her child would have been dead and Dr. Levi would have been hanged.\u2014\u2014\u2014Dr Levi poisoned Robert Reinhardt. Dr. Levi is sometimes out of his mind and mad.\nThen what do we find? That when the trial is going on this gentleman is put into the witness stand and persists in his denunciations. However, fortunately for the appellant, medical gentlemen from McGill College came down from Montreal to justify the appellant's treatment of his patients and with their evidence the appellant's character has been entirely vindicated and it was proved that he was a worthy member of his profession.\nNow the learned Judge who had tried this case and had considered all the circumstances, came to the conclusion that there was not the slightest excuse for inducing the respondent to have shown towards the appellant such persistent hostility.\nThe Superior Court gave as its consid\u00e9rants: The principal consid\u00e9rani of the judgment of the Superior Court, was expressed as follows: The facts reproached to the defendant are proved. With the view of injuring the plaintiff in the practice of his profession he seems to have missed no occasion of giving him the worst possible reputation as a physician. His persistence in that respect has been remarkable, and was manifested in the most insulting manner, even in the evidence which he was called upon to give in this cause. The defendant has not proved any provocation on the part of the plaintiff, and I have sought in vain for a justification of the language which he has made use of * * * * The plaintiff had therefore good reason to institute the present action. That the fa1se and malicious accusations proffered against him must have deeply wounded him, and must have caused him damage in the exercise of his profession, and in his pecuniary interests (int\u00e9r\u00e9ts mat\u00e9riels}, is self evident.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal partly concurred in the judgment of the Superior Court, but differed as to the amount of damages to be awarded, on the ground that no special damages had been proved. This is a mistake because in the record I find that there is one instance, at any rate, in which appellant has clearly proved actual damage. A Mrs. Rolston, who was desirous of seeing a physician, was told that she had better go to Dr. Levi, as Dr. Reed was not coming. What does she answer ?\u2014\" I do not like to go to Dr. Levi, some bad reports are going about him, he gives wrong medicine, I would rather wait.\" Then again we find in the evidence Mr. Patrick Browne, who says:\nMost decidedly I was prevented from employing Dr. Levi, on account of these reports. I would not employ him after the reports I heard on any account, on no condition would I employ him.\nUnder such circumstances I have no hesitation in saying that the judge gave moderate damages, and I would have given probably more. Where reputation was to be for weal or for woe, and you find a man, having twenty-seven years experience in the practice of his profession, and who has acquired a high reputation for ability and learning, without proving any provocation whatsoever, undertaking to ruin professionally a young man by malicious and unfounded accusations I think the sum of $1,000 is very moderate, and I cannot see on 'what principle the amount was reduced by the court below, especially when by the judgment the appellant was condemned to pay the costs of the appeal. I think appellant got no more than what he was justly entitled to, and here also I think, as in the case of Gingras v. Desilets, that the cases of Lambin v. South Eastern, Railway Company ([6]), and Ball v. Ray ([7]), are apposite to the one now before us, and therefore that the judgment of the Superior Court should be reinstated.\nFOURNIER, J. :\u2014\nL'appelant a poursuivi l'intim\u00e9 devant la Cour Sup\u00e9ieure a Arthabaska, pour la somme de $10,000 de dom mages pour 4iffamation. Le judgment de cetee cour lui en a accord\u00e9 $1.000 pour damages sp\u00e9ciaux et viudictifs. Le present intim\u00e9 Reed, trouvant cette condamnation excessive, en a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine, qui a adopt\u00e9 cette mani\u00e8re de voir et r\u00e9duit la condamnation \u00e0 $500 avec les frais d'appel contre Levi. Ce dernier se trouvant l\u00e9s\u00e9 \u00e0 son tour par ce judgment qui, non-seulement le prive de la moit\u00e9i de la somme accord\u00e9e par la cour de premi\u00e9re instance, mais qui par la condamnation aux d\u00e9pens d'appel a encore l'effet d'absorber la somme de $500, que cette cour consid\u00e9rait comme une compensa-tion suffisante des injures dont il se plaignait, en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette cour. Les deux premieres cours ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord a reconnaitre que l'appelant Levi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'une diffamation de la plus haute gravit\u00e9. Cependant, sans le pr\u00e9sent appel, le r\u00e9sultat de son recours \u00e0 la justice, serait de sortir de cour calomni\u00e9 et puni par l'obligation de payer une certaine somme pour frais exc\u00e9dant 1g montant qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par la Jour du Bane de la Reine. Sous les circonstances de cette cause l'appelant m\u00e9rite-t-il de subir la d\u00e9plorable situation qui lui est faite ?\nAvant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, de suis oblig\u00e9 de faire quelques observations sur l'objection que l'lntim\u00e9 soul\u00e9ve \u00e0 la juridiction de cette cour. C'est la question sans cesse renouvel\u00e9e de savoir si le droit d'appel dans un cas comme cehui-ci, doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par le montant de la demande ou par le montant du judgment. Je n'entends pas discuter cette question, car je la consid\u00e8re comme r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le judgment dans la cause de Joyce vs. Hart ([8]). La l\u00e8gle adopt\u00e9e par cette cour est conforme \u00e0 la section 25 du ch. 78 des statuts refondus B.C., et \u00e0 la jurisprudence adop\u00e9ee en dernier lieu par les tribu-naux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, apr\u00e8s plusieurs d\u00e9cisions en sens inverse sur cetee m\u00eame question. Les termes de l'acte de la Cour Supreme et d'Echiquier donnant l'appel \u00e0 cette cour \u00e9tant les m\u00eames que ceux qui donnent l'appel dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, cetee cour a cru devoir adopter la jurisprudence des tribunaux de Qu\u00e9bcc pour interpr\u00e9ter cetee clause de notre acte. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la decision dans la cause de Jovcg vs Hart c'est le montant de la demande et non celui de la condamnation qui doit servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le droit d'appel. Dana la pr\u00e9sente cause le montant de la demande est de $10,000,\u2014quoique le judgment de la Cour du Banc de la Reine ne soit que de $500. Confor-m\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette decision, je suss d'avis qu'il y a appel de ce judgment \u00e0 cetee cour.\nJe n'ai trouv\u00e9 nulle part dans le cas special qui nous eat soumis, la preuve d'un acquiescement au judge- ment. Il faut remarquer que nous devons d\u00e9cider cette cause telle qu'elle nous est soumise du consentement des deux parties. Ii est certain que si 1st cause n\u00e9tait pas appelable leur consentement ne donnerait pas \u00e0 cetee cour le droit d'entretenir l'appel; mais il est \u00e9vi-dent qu'elle lest d'aprss le montant de la demande\nJe crois devoir citer en entier le consentement qui forme le cas sp\u00e9cial qui nous est soumis.\nCONSENT.\nThe parties consent and agree to the statement of special case hereto annexed, consisting of the Declaration, the Pleas, the depositions of the witnesses examined by both parties except those of William Edwards, John Gorman, William Lowry, James Bracken, James McCammon, Mary Ann Henderson (Mrs. Rolston) and Thomas Armstrong, together with the documents connected with said depositions. The petition by plaintiff in court below for transmission of record to Montreal with affidavits and judgment thereon. Motion for transmission of record to Montreal affidavit and judgment thereon. The judgment of the Superior Court given at Arthabaskaville. The judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, (appeal side) rendered at Quebec, on the fifth day of June instant. The parties also consent that the exhibits produced by the Appellant in the Superior Court, being a pamphlet written by Dr. Hingston, a communication from the Medical Faculty of McGill College. and a Registrar's certificate, be transmitted to the Supreme Court of Canada as forming part of the said special case.\nQuebec, 30th June 1880.\nSEWELL GIBSONE & AYLWIN,\nAttys. for Appellant.\nLAURIER & LAVERGNE,\nAttys. for Respondent.\nOn voit par ce consentement que la declaration du demandeur Levi en forme partie En y r\u00e9f\u00e9rant on voit qu'elle conclut au paiement d'une somme de $10,000, de damages. Aucun des autres documents qui y sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s ne font voir qu'il y a eu acquiescement au judgment accordant $500. La juridiction de cette cour apparaissant clairement par le dossier fait en vertu du consentement cidessus cit\u00e9, je suis en con-sequence d'ayis que l'on dolt proc\u00e9der \u00e0 rendre le judgment sur le m\u00e9rite de la cause. Sous ce rapport il ne saurait y avoir de difficult\u00e9. Les deux cours appel\u00e9es \u00e0 juger cetee cause out \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord que le pr\u00e9sent intim\u00e9 Reed devait \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 pour les faits diffamatoires qui lui sont imput\u00e9s. Elles n'ont diff\u00e9r\u00e9 d' opinion que quant an montant, l' une a accord\u00e9 $1,000, et l'autre trouvant le montant trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 l'a r\u00e9duit a $500. En r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 ces deux jugements on volt que la cour ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question de droit. La seule question que nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer est de savoir si la preuve est suffisante pour justifier la condamnation de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, on celle de la Cour du Bane de la Reine.\nL'appr\u00e9ciation des damages et int\u00e9r\u00eats est une des questions les plus difficilles et les plus d\u00e9licates de notre droit.\nIi n'est pas, clit Duranton ([9]), de mati\u00e8re plus abstraite quo celle relative aux dornmages et interest aussii la loi n'a-t-elle Pu tracer que des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, en s'en remettant \u00e0 la sagesse des tribu-naux pour leur application, selon lea circonstances et les faits de la cause.\nIl n'y a donc en semblable mati\u00e8re aucunes r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises qui puissent servir \u00e0 guider le judge dans la d\u00e9termination du montant des damages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, et cons\u00e9quemment pas de risque de violer la loi en fixant un montant plut\u00f4t qu'un autre. Comme le dit Laurent, l'arbitraire est ici dans la nature des choses.\nIi est vrai qu'il est impossible d'\u00e9valuer en. argent le dommage moral, le montant des damages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sera donc tou\" jours arbitraire: estce 1,000 francs, estce 10,000 francs. Et pour-quoi 10,000 plut\u00f4t quo 9,000? on no le sait; mais qu'importe ? De ce que le judge no peut pas accorder une r\u00e9paration, on no peut pas con-dure qu'il no doit accorder aucune r\u00e9paration. L'arbitraire eat ici dans la nature des clioses et il peut tourner \u00e0 bien, parce qu'il permet au judge de prononcer des peines civiles sans limite aucune done on lea proportionnant a la gravit\u00e9 du tort moral ([10]),\nL'\u00e9tendue du dommage caus\u00e9 et le montant des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats sont des questions de faits sur les-quelles les juges des trois cours qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 se prononcer sur cette cause out exactement les m\u00eames pouvoirs souverains et arbitraires, d'en decider suivant leurs consciences. Il est de notre devoir de d\u00e9cider la question du montant des damages et int\u00e9r\u00eats, comme c\u00e9'tait \u00e9galement le devoir de Ia Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, suivant notre conscience. C'est surtout sur ces questions qu'on peut dire sans crainte de se tromper, \"autant de t\u00eates, autant d'opi-nions.\" Appr\u00e9ciant \u00e0 notre mani\u00e8re les faits sur les-quels se sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 prononc\u00e9es les Cours Sup\u00e9rieure et du Banc de la Reine, allons-nous declarer que dans une chose si difficile \u00e0 \u00e9valuer, elles se sont tromp\u00e9es toutes deux et qu'un troisi\u00e8me chiffre fix\u00e9 par nous arbitraire-ment comme les autres, est le v\u00e9ritable chiffre qu'elles aurait d\u00fb fixer comme on trouve la solution d'un pro-bl\u00eame d'arithm\u00e9tique ? A cetee question je r\u00e9pondrai comme l'auteur cit\u00e9 ci-dessus, pourquoi $500, pourquoi $1,000, et pourquoi pas $2,000. La profonde m\u00e9chan-cet\u00e9 des calomnies r\u00e9pandues par l'mtim\u00e9 contre l'ap-pelant lui m\u00e9ritait aussi bien une condamnation pour ce montant que pour l'un ou l'autre de ceux qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 Prononc\u00e9s? Fixerons-nous done un troisi\u00e8me montant en conservant le pouvoir que nous avons d'arbitrer les damages suivant notre conscience ? Je ne suis pas de cet avis; si le montant accord\u00e9 en premiere instance n'est pas de nature \u00e0 blesser nos sentiments de \"justice ne fait pas voir qu'il y alt erreur ou partialit\u00e9 de la part du judge, je crois que c'est notre devoir de l'adopter II est de r\u00e8gle qu'un judgment de premi\u00e8re instance ne peut \u00eatre infirm\u00e9 que lorsqu'il y a erreur \u00e9vidente soit sur le fait soit sur le droit. Autrement la pr\u00e9-somption l\u00e9gal9 est en faveur du judgment et il doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nPuisque dans le cas actuel la Cour du Banc de la Reine a reconnu, et que les parties l'admettent devant cette cour, qu'il n'y a dans le judgment de premiere instance, ni erreur de droit, ni erreur de fait, qu'il n'y a de diff\u00e9rence entre les deux cours que sur l'appr\u00e9-ciation cles damages laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 leur arbitrage, n'est-ce pas le cas de faire application de la r\u00e8gie qu'aucune erreur n'\u00e9tant d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, le judgment de premiere instance doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nLe judge de premi\u00e8re instance, pour se d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 fixer le montant qu'il a adopt\u00e9, a eu un avantage que n'ont pas en les jugss des deux autres cours. La plu-part des t\u00e9moins, et en particulier l'intim\u00e9, out \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s devant lui. Il a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 dans sa decision, comme d'ailleurs le fait voir son judgment par l'aggravation, des injures r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es avec persistance devant la cour, en pr\u00e9senee d'un nombreux public. Il avait droit de prendre ces faits en consideration.\nBien qu'il y alt presque similitude entre le droit anglais et le droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, sur les questions de damages, je crois devoir m'abstenir de citer les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux anglais\u2014les principes du droit fran\u00e7ais devant ici recevoir leur application.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nIn conformity with the principles laid down in the previous case of Gingras v. Desilets, which are applicable to this, I think the appeal must be allowed as to the question of jurisdiction. In the case of Joyce v. Hart this court came to the conclusion that the amount of damages claimed in the writ of summons should be the criterion by which the appeal should be allowed. This court came to the conclusion\u2014that in all cases in which the plaintiff would have a right of appeal the defendant also would have the right of doing so. In this case it is said that because plaintiff was satisfied with $1,000 damages awarded to him by the court of first instance, he has lost all right of appeal, but this was not the amount in dispute between the parties, and carrying out the principle laid down in Joyce v. Hart, by which we are bound, we cannot entertain his objection.\nAs to the amount of damages awarded, I do not think there can ever be a case in which exemplary damages may be given, if this is not one. I entirely concur with the judge who tried the case, that appellant was entitled to both real and exemplary damages, and as it is a case where damages cannot be measured, I do not think we ought, under the circumstances, to disturb the judgment of first instance.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nBy sec. 5 of 42 Vic., ch. 39, and the last words of sec. 8 thereof, there is no appeal in the province of Quebec but from the Court of Queen's Bench. Sec. 8 gives an appeal in Quebec cases, only in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding wherein the matter in controversy amounts to the sum or value of $2,000. Now, as appeals are given only from the Queen's Bench, it seems clear that the matter in controversy must be taken to be the matter in controversy \"in the Queen's Bench.\"\nNow, here, did the amount in controversy in the Queen's Bench amount to $2,000? Certainly not. Because Levi, the plaintiff, acquiesced in the judgment of the Superior Court, giving him $1,000; and Reed, the defendant, appealed to the Queen's Bench only to get relieved of this $1,000. The contestation in the Queen's Bench between the parties was then only on a matter of $1,000, and so is not appealable to this court.\nAnd this is not contrary to Joyce v. Hart ([11]). For in Joyce v. Hart, the matter before the Queen's Bench did amount to $2,000. There the plaintiff's action for $2,000 had been dismissed in part by the court of original jurisdiction. He (the plaintiff) brought that judgment on appeal to the Queen's Bench, so that the Queen's Bench had before them a case wherein the matter in controversy amounted to $2,000, whilst here, it had before them only a $1,000 case.\nCould it be contended that if a plaintiff by his declaration demands $2000 and on the day of the return or at any time during the progress of the case, fyles a retraxit for $1,000, the case would be appealable to this court? Then, all that a plaintiff has to do to bring even one hundred dollars to this court is to add $1,900 to his demand and fyle at any time a retraxit for these $1,900. The jurisprudence of the province of Quebec on an analogous question cannot be invoked here, because there sec. 25 of ch. 77 of the Consolidated Statutes (C. S. L. C.) expressly enacts that \" whenever the jurisdiction of the court, or the right to appeal from any judgment of any court, is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded, and not that recovered, if they are different,\" This enactment does not rule the appeals to this court. In limiting the appeal to this court to the cases wherein the value of the matter in controversy amounts to $2,000, it seems to me that the intention of the parliament was that none but cases involving before this court an amount of $2,000 or more should be brought here; that the matter to be settled by this court should not be less than $2000 in value \u2022 that the costs of an appeal to this court would be too large if the matter to be determined by this court did not amount to $2,000. In this case, clearly, we have a matter in dispute amounting to $1,000 only. We therefore, in my opinion, have no jurisdiction.\nThe majority of the court, however, is of opinion that the Supreme Court Acts do not require that the amount of the matter in controversy before this court should be of two thousand dollars and that if the amount demanded by the declaration was $2,000, this alone gives ' jurisdiction to this court upon an appeal by the defendant whatever reductions on that amount have been made in the court below by the plaintiff, and my opinion overruled.\nGWYNNE, J.: \u2014\nAn objection was taken in this case that no appeal lies to this court for the reason that; although the plaintiff claimed in his declaration $10 000 damages the sum of $1,000 was all that was awarded to him by the court Of first instance, and that by the Act constituting this court it is enacted that no appeal shall be allowed from any judgment rendered in the province of Quebec in any case wherein the sum or value of the matter in dispute does not amount to two thousand dollars\nWhatever might be my opinion, if this point was now up for the first time I am of opinion that it is concluded in favor of our jurisdiction by the judgment of this court in Joyce v. Hart ([12]). That there is a difference in the circumstances of this case from those upon which the point was raised in Joyce v. Hart, I am free to admit, but it is impossible not to perceive that the principle which in that case the court clearly enunciated and made the basis of their decision is equally applicable to this case as to that, notwithstanding the difference which exists between the circumstances of the two cases and this court is equally bound by any principle of law clearly enunciated and laid down as the basis of the judgment of the court in a prior case, as it would be by the decision itself where the circumstances of the cases are identical. See the judgment of Lord Justice Thesiger in Kaltenbach v. McKenzie ([13]), and Household Fire Insurance Co. v. Grant ([14]). Whether in every case this court should for all time be bound by a judgment which may have enunciated a principle of law which, upon further consideration by the same judges, or by others constituting the court at a future time, might be thought to be erroneous, is not the question here. If that case should arise, I confess, I think, that nothing short of a thorough conviction that the principle laid down is erroneous, and that the interests of justice demand its reversal would justify us in reversing it; but in a matter affecting the jurisdiction of the court, which depends solely upon the construction of the statute constituting it, if in the construing it there be any doubt, I think it is our duty, in the interest of justice, so to construe it as to support our jurisdiction; for by declining to exercise it, we might perhaps do most grievous wrong; and as the court has put such a construction upon the Act as maintains our jurisdiction I think that construction should be sustained, unless the legislature shall interfere.\nIn this particular case and I say it with the greatest deference and the most profound respect for the learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench in the province of Quebec, from which court this appeal comes I cannot but think that the appellant has most just grounds of appeal from the judgment pronounced by the majority of the court. \"Within the reasons given for that judgment I find myself unable to concur. This is not a case in which the plaintiff, in order to recover, is required to show special damage; and for so very aggravated a wrong, so persistently repeated and attempted to be justified in such a manner as to aggravate the injury, I cannot conceive how the sum of $1,000 damages can be deemed to be excessive. So neither can I concur in the other reasons given for reducing the amount awarded by the judge of first instance, namely, that the defendant in the court below has been subjected to a much larger amount of costs than he should have been, by the adduction on the part of the plaintiff of illegal evidence.\nThe evidence here referred to was said to be the evidence of the medical gentleman called by the plaintiff to contradict the medical evidence which the defendant, on being examined by the plaintiff to prove the slanders complained of, took the opportunity of giving in his own favor. Such evidence was, in my judgment, not only quite legal evidence, but such as, under the circumstances, the plaintiff's counsel very naturally felt called upon to advise the plaintiff to give, and was very proper to be given. For my own part, I must say that I have great difficulty in prescribing a limit to the amount of damages proper to be awarded in so aggravated a case.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for Appellant: Sewell,, Gibsone & Aylwin\nAttorneys for Respondent Laurier & Lavergne.\n[1] 1 Can.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nShipping note\u2014Fraudulent receipt of agent\u2014Liability of company.\nC., freight agent of respondents at Chatham, and a partner in the firm of B. & Co., caused printed receipts or shipping notes in the form commonly used by the railway company to be signed by his name as the company\u2019s agent, in favor of B. & Co., for flour which had never in fact been delivered to the railway company. The receipts acknowledged that the company had received from B. & Co. the flour addressed to the appellants, and were attached to drafts drawn by B. & Co., and accepted by appellants. C. received the proceeds of the drafts and absconded. In an action to recover the amount of the drafts:\nHeld (Fournier and Henry, J.J., dissenting), that the act of C. in issuing a false and fraudulent receipt for goods never delivered to the company, was not an act done within the scope of his authority as the company\u2019s agent, and the latter were therefore not liable.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, setting aside a verdict obtained by the plaintiffs and ordering a non\u2011suit or verdict to be entered for the defendants.\nThis was an action brought by the appellants (plaintiffs), commission merchants at St. John, N.B., against the respondents to recover the value of certain drafts made by T. Brown & Co., dealers in flour at Chatham, Ontario, which were accepted by them and banks, and advances made upon the faith that the goods referred to therein have been actually shipped. The respondents set up that the goods were never received by them, and therefore that they are not liable, and rely upon the authority of the case of Grant v. Norway[1], but it is submitted that that case is not parallel with this. It did not appear there, as it does here, that it was known to the owner of the vessel, as it must be taken to have been known to the respondents, that advances were usually made upon the faith of the bills of lading. It turned upon general usage known to all persons dealing with masters of vessels. The point in question in Grant v. Norway does not seem to have been considered in England since the date of that judgment in connection with the signing of a bill of lading by a station agent.\nThe most apposite case I can find is that of Swire v. Francis[2], decided since the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. The only difference is that the defendants were a firm instead of a corporation, and it would appear that every element which is here was in the case of Swire. That it is a corporation in this case makes no difference. The tendency of the modern decisions is to increase the liability of corporations in just such matters as these. Cooley on Torts[3].\nThe general rule of law now acted upon in almost all cases is that where one of two innocent persons must bear a loss, that one of them who could, by care, have avoided the loss, should bear it, and it is submitted that the company could, by a system of checking, have guarded against this representation having been made; or could have taken security against the fraudulent deeds of their agent.\nIn the State of New York the Court of Appeal of that State has refused to follow the judgment in Grant v. Norway, because it was felt that the meaning was not the same as applied to bills of lading signed by the agents of railway companies. See Armour v. Michigan Central Ry. Co.[4]\nThen again the same point has been up in Merchants\u2019 Bank v. State Bank[5], where all cases are reviewed.\nThis must be treated as a case of apparent authority. See Evans on Principal and Agent[6].\nThe respondents contend that the appellants had no right to rely upon the representation of the receipt of the goods, and that they ought to have inquired whether the goods had actually been received. The appellants submit that having regard to the fact that Carruthers was the chief agent of the defendants at Chatham station, at which place enquiry would have to be made, such enquiry would have been useless, and that in any event the appellants, who carried on their business at St. John, N.B., could not be expected to make any enquiry as to the shipment. The railway companies in fact do their most profitable business in this way, and no one will suggest that the directors are ignorant of the use made of the bills of lading signed by their agents. A corporate body may bind themselves without the solemnity of a seal, that is the universal way in which bills are authenticated, and such documents must be held as binding as if they had affixed to them the corporate seal.\nWe complain that the respondents have armed their agent with the power to practice this fraud on us, and therefore they are responsible.\nThe appellants also submit that the respondents are estopped by the statute of the Legislature of Ontario, 33 Vic., ch. 19, from disputing the receipt of the goods. Mr. Robinson, Q.C., for Respondents:\nNo doubt where a person has put another in such a position as to allow him to commit a fraud he should suffer. But to make a railway company liable under such circumstances as these would be to throw upon them a liability which would be ruinous, and certainly was never contemplated. Now, the cases show that an agent must be doing something within the scope of his authority and within the class of business he is authorized to transact. The class of business Mr. Carruthers was authorized to transact was to receive goods for transport, and to give bills of lading for such goods, and his authority did not extend to giving false and fraudulent receipts as for goods received, when, in fact, none have been received. See Tobin v. The Queen[7].\nThen, it is said that this bill of lading, signed by a clerk of Carruthers as agent, is the same as if it had been a document under seal. If it was it would be the act of the company, but it is not. Then the whole matter is reduced to this, is the act of Carruthers the act of the company? I refer to Brice on ultra vires[8] to show that the powers of an agent are not even so wide as those of the corporation; in other words, an agent is not an alter ego of the corporation, and that for the simple reason that some things can be done but by the corporation. Then, it has been contended that the statute assists the appellants. The statute only professes to deal with documents signed by the company. If the company did not sign, then there is an end of it.\nThen, as to the right to recover under the peculiar circumstances of the case. When the bills of lading were signed, no harm had been done. Then, when was the overt act of fraud committed? As the Chief Justice puts it: \u201cIt is not a little curious to notice precisely what Carruthers did in this matter, and to endeavor to fix the point at which his wrong doing commenced. In procuring Neville to sign the bills of lading or receipts, he was not actually doing more than wasting so many of the company\u2019s forms. It is true that he was then starting the train of circumstances which was to end in the plaintiffs being defrauded. But if he had repented before acting, or if the bank had declined to cash his drafts no mischief would have been done. The first overt act of fraud was the use of receipts to obtain money from the bank. Now, the manager knew perfectly well that Carruthers was to all intents T. Brown & Co. Therefore, when he accepted these receipts he knew that they represented nothing more than that Carruthers, the miller, had delivered to Carruthers, the railway agent, a certain quantity of flour. In what capacity was Carruthers acting when he first committed the direct fraud, which led to the plaintiffs\u2019 injury? Certainly as T. Brown & Co. and not as the defendants\u2019 agent. I have grave doubts whether the bank could possibly in this state of facts, and apart from any other objection, have fastened any responsibility upon the defendants, and if they simply passed on the representation to the plaintiffs it may be that they occupy no better position.\u201d\nRespondents are not estopped from stating the true facts, and saying that when Carruthers, not as their agent, but in fraud of them and for his own benefit, signed or procured to be signed certain fictitious receipts, he was not acting as their agent but for himself and for his own benefit and entirely outside of the scope of any employment which had been entrusted to him. He himself drew for his own use the money raised on the bills or drafts, and no benefit directly or indirectly accrued to the defendants, nor was anything done by them to adopt or sanction what he had done.\nIt may be said that Carruthers knew that the receipt he was signing would be used in the bank and money advanced upon it. But the fraudulent intention of Carruthers, to make that dishonest use of the receipt, cannot be called the act or knowledge of the defendants, nor can it be called a misrepresentation by the defendants.\nThe defendants submit that the documents issued by them as bills of lading or shipping receipts are not intended by them to have the two-fold character assigned to them by Mr. Justice Patterson, in his judgment. They are intended to be a receipt to the shipper. They are not intended by them to be used as a representation to the consignees or the banker. Grant v. Norway[9], Coleman v. Riches[10] and Hubbersty v. Ward[11] ought to decide this case. The defendants referred also to Baltimore and Ohio Ry. Co. v. Wickens[12]; Schooner Freeman v. Buckingham[13].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs on the argument did not rely on the first six counts of the declaration which were based on contract, but relied on the other counts, which were on several bills of lading, and were substantially the same.\nThe seventh count sets out that plaintiffs were commission merchants doing business at St. John, N.B., and were in course of their business accustomed to make advances upon consignments of flour consigned to them upon production to them of bills of lading or shipping receipts of defendants for such flour, such advances to be made by plaintiffs accepting bills of exchange drawn upon them on account of the price of such flour with such bills of lading or shipping receipts attached thereto. The declaration then avers that the plaintiffs contracted with certain persons carrying on business under the name of T. Brown & Co., that if the said T. Brown & Co. would procure from defendants a bill of lading or shipping receipt of the defendants for two hundred barrels of flour marked \u201cCreek Mills,\u201d the plaintiffs would, upon production to them of such bill of lading or shipping receipt of the defendants, accept a bill of exchange for $800 to be drawn upon them by the said T. Brown & Co., on account of the price of such flour, and the defendants falsely and fraudulently by their bill of lading or shipping receipt represented that they had shipped on their railway at Chatham 200 barrels of flour marked \u201cCreek Mills,\u201d in apparent good order, consigned to plaintiffs at St. John, and defendants, at the time they so made said false and fraudulent representations, well knew that the same were untrue, and that the same would be relied upon by the plaintiffs in their dealing with the said T. Brown & Co. The declaration then avers that plaintiffs, relying on the representations on said bill of lading, and believing the same to be true, and believing that the flour had been shipped on defendant\u2019s railway, plaintiffs accepted a certain bill of exchange drawn upon them on account of the price thereof by T. Brown & Co., payable to the order of T. Brown & Co. for $825, which plaintiffs would not otherwise have done. It then alleges that at the time the defendants made the representations they had not received the flour from T. Brown & Co., that bills before due were endorsed by T. Brown & Co. for valuable consideration to the Merchants Bank of Canada, who became holders for value without notice of such false and fraudulent representations, and by reason whereof and of such false, &c., plaintiffs became liable to pay the amount to the said bank, and they lost certain commissions which they would have made if representations had been true.\nThe contract set out in the declaration as the foundation of the claim now put forward is, that plaintiffs contracted with T. Brown & Co., that if T. Brown & Co. would procure from defendants a bill of lading, &c., the plaintiffs would, on production to them of such bill of lading, accept a bill of exchange for $825 to be drawn upon them by T. Brown & Co., on account of the price of such flour. This contract with T. Brown & Co., obviously was that T. Brown & Co. should actually ship the flour, and on obtaining a bill of lading or shipping receipt, and drawing for the price of the flour so shipped, plaintiffs, on production of such bill of lading or receipt, would accept the bill so drawn. The action against the defendants is, however, immediately based on fraud, viz.: That plaintiffs having such a contract, defendants made false and fraudulent representations, knowing that the same were untrue; that is to say, that defendants falsely and fraudulently, by their bill of lading, represented that they had shipped on their railway certain flour consigned to plaintiffs at St. John, N.B., and at the time they so made said false and fraudulent representations they well knew the same were untrue, and that the same would be relied on in their dealings with T. Brown & Co.; and that so relying and believing the same to be true, and that the flour had been so shipped by T. Brown & Co., they accepted the bill drawn by T. Brown & Co., which they would not otherwise have done; that defendants, at the time they made the representations, had not received the flour from T. Brown & Co., and that T. Brown & Co., before the bill became due endorsed the same to the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada, who became holders for value without notice of defendant\u2019s false and fraudulent representations, whereby plaintiffs became liable to pay and did pay the said bill to said bank, and so lost the amount thereof and certain commissions, &c.\nThe sole evidence on which the plaintiffs rely to establish against the defendants this fraudulent conduct, is that Carruthers, a partner of the firm of T. Brown & Co., and also defendants\u2019 freight agent at Chatham, issued, without the acquiescence or knowledge of the defendants, the bill of lading or receipt in question, and made the said bill of lading without the said goods being shipped on the defendants\u2019 railway, or received by defendants or their officers or agents for shipment, claiming that the act of Carruthers was the act of the company, and the knowledge of Carruthers of the false and fraudulent character of the receipt and bill of lading was the knowledge of the defendants, and so the representations contained in the bill of lading were the representations of the defendants made with a knowledge of their false and fraudulent character.\nThe contract as thus set out between T. Brown & Co. and plaintiffs, it is clear T. Brown & Co. never fulfilled; they never did ship the flour for the price of which the bill was accepted, and T. Brown & Co. never did procure from defendants a bill of lading or shipping receipt, but on the contrary; in fact T. Brown & Co. by Carruthers, one of their partners, falsely and fraudulently drew a bill for the price of flour never shipped by them, and falsely and fraudulently made and transmitted simulated bills of lading or receipts, and on the strength of which plaintiffs accepted the bill so fraudulently drawn on them.\nWe must then consider whether the defendants are to be bound by the acts of Carruthers as the agent, and are to be held responsible in like manner as if they, with knowledge that the goods had not been received or shipped, had issued or directly authorized the issuing of this receipt or bill of lading, or after its issue had acquiesced in the act and derived benefit and advantage therefrom.\nThe mere giving a receipt for goods and issuing a bill of lading without any goods having been received was clearly not within the usual scope of the employment of a freight agent, such as Carruthers is shewn to have been; it was only when he had actually received goods to be shipped that the giving a receipt and bill of lading for such goods was within the usual scope of his employment. It was never within the scope of his employment that he should create, for his own illicit gain, as instruments of fraud, \u201cfalse pretences of contracts having the semblance of bills of lading.\u201d Such bills of lading as he issued did not grow out of any transaction between T. Brown & Co. and defendants, or between the plaintiffs and the defendants, or out of the use of the railway as a means of transportation by either T. Brown & Co. or the plaintiffs; they were simulated bills of lading, the result of the direct fraud and forgery or deceit of T. Brown & Co., by their leading partner Carruthers, and if plaintiffs accepted and paid bills on the faith of such documents, their doing so was induced by the act of T. Brown & Co., and not by any act of the defendants either directly or by Carruthers, as their agent, while acting within the scope of the authority conferred upon him by the defendants. I fail to see how such a wilful fraud committed by T. Brown & Co., through their partner Carruthers on plaintiffs, with whom they were dealing, can be considered an act within Carruther\u2019s agency. The authority of Carruthers was a limited authority; his power and authority to sign a bill of lading depended on the actual receipt and shipping of the goods. If the fact on which the power depended did not exist, the authority could not exist.\nThe cases of Grant v. Norway[14], Hubbersty v. Ward[15] and Coleman v. Riches[16] appear to me in principle directly in point.\nIn Grant v. Norway14, the marginal note is as follows:\nThe master of a ship signing a bill of lading for goods which have never been shipped, is not to be considered as the agent of the owner in that behalf, so as to make the latter responsible to one who has made advances upon the faith of bills of lading so signed.\nDuring the argument, Jervis, C.J., says:\nIf the master\u2019s authority is to sign bills of lading only upon receiving the goods on board, the owner does not hold him out as his agent until he receives the goods.\nAfter pointing out the very large authority of a master of a ship and adopting from Smith\u2019s Mercantile Law[17] that \u201cthe master is a general agent to perform all things relating to the usual employment of his ship; and the authority of such an agent to perform all things usual in the line of business in which he is employed cannot be limited by any private order or direction not known to the party dealing with him\u201d asks, is it then usual, in the management of a ship carrying goods on freight, for the master to give a bill of lading for goods not put on board? For, all parties concerned have a right, he says, to assume that an agent has authority to do all that is usual.\nHe then points out that, \u201cthe very nature of a bill of lading shows that it ought not to be signed until the goods are on board,\u201d for it begins by describing them as shipped. He says:\nIt is not contended that the captain had any real authority to sign bills of lading, unless the goods had been shipped; nor can we discover any ground upon which a party taking a bill of lading by indorsement would be justified in assuming that he had authority to sign such bills, whether the goods were on board or not.\nHe then adds: If, then, from the usage of trade, and the general practice of shipmasters, it is generally known that the master derives no such authority from his position as master, the case may be considered as if the party taking the bill of lading had notice of an express limitation of the authority; and, in that case, undoubtedly, could not claim to bind the owner by a bill of lading signed, when the goods therein mentioned were never shipped.\nThis case was followed by Hubbersty v. Ward[18]:\nThe master of a vessel has no power to charge his owner by signing bills of lading for a greater quantity of goods than those on board.\nThe authority of Grant v. Norway was conceded, but it was attempted to distinguish this case from Grant v. Norway, but Pollock, C.B., delivering judgment of the Court, says:\nWe think that when a captain has signed bills of lading for a cargo that is actually on board his vessel, his power is exhausted; he has no right or power, by signing other bills of lading for goods that are not on board, to charge his owner.\nThis case was followed by Coleman v. Riches[19], where the same principle was applied to the agent of a wharfinger who signed a receipt in the usual form for the delivering of corn at defendants\u2019 wharf. In the course of the argument Jervis, C.J., says:\nThe authority of this man was of a limited character. He was only authorized to give receipts when the wheat was actually delivered.\nIn delivering judgment:\nThis, however, is simply the case of a wharfinger\u2019s receipt note, and, that being so, the case is disposed of. Board, the defendants\u2019 agent, had only authority to give receipts for goods which had in fact been delivered at the wharf. And again, when Board gave a receipt for wheat which had never been delivered at the wharf, he was not acting within the scope of his authority; he was not acting for his master, but contrary to his duty and against his master\u2019s interest.\nWith how much more force does this reasoning and the conclusions arrived at in these cases apply to the present case? The authority of the freight agent cannot, in my opinion, be compared in extent with the general authority of a master of a ship who is entrusted with the whole control and management of the property, and that for the most part in the absence of the owner, and when the vessel is out of his reach. Here the authority of the agent was necessarily of a most limited character; he was to receive and ship and give receipts and bills of lading for goods actually received and shipped; outside of this he does not appear to have possessed any authority whatever, nor was any other or greater authority necessary to enable him to manage and conduct that part of the business of defendants railway confided to him. He certainly was not authorized to grant receipts for goods unless the goods were actually received, nor was he empowered to contract for the company that goods should be sent by the company, when no goods were ever received by the company to be sent, and consequently never could be sent. Nor, in like manner, had he any authority to sign a bill of lading declaring the property was shipped in apparent good order, when it never was shipped, and declaring the property was to be delivered in like good order, when there was no property in the possession of the company or of their agent to be delivered.\nIt may be even questioned whether the general manager of this railway could legally issue or authorize to be issued bills of lading for goods never received and never shipped, such an act being wholly inconsistent with the object of a railway company, which is incorporated to transport goods delivered to them for transportation, not to issue feigned and fraudulent receipts and bills of lading for goods never received to be forwarded.\nBe this as it may, it cannot be doubted that every person in business who deals with a railway company knows that, in the ordinary and usual course of business, no such receipts and bills of lading are ever given or issued unless the goods have been actually received to be shipped, and nobody so dealing but must know that if a freight agent, discharging the ordinary duties of a freight agent, did give or issue such receipts and bills of lading without the goods having been delivered, he would be acting in direct opposition to his duty and in fraud of his principals, and no one would knowingly act on a bill of lading so issued, when goods had never been delivered or actually shipped, unless indeed it could be shewn that some specific authority had been given to the agent outside of the ordinary course of business, authorizing the signing of such documents without delivery of the articles.\nI cannot conceive it possible, in the usual course of business, that any business firm would accept drafts on their mere production, with bills of lading attached, without any notice or advice, or without anything indicating the nature of the transaction. It is very different from the buying or negotiating a bill of exchange, and the position of a holder for value of a bill of exchange purchased on the market is very different from that of a person accepting a bill of exchange drawn on him. No one, I take it, in the usual and ordinary course of business, draws on another in whose hands he has no funds, but on the strength of funds to be supplied, without advising that the funds against which he draws will be forthcoming; and, therefore, in a case like the present, where the plaintiffs allege that the transaction originated on a contract with the drawers, that on certain conditions they would accept, that is on goods consigned they would advance by accepting drafts, can it be supposed that those who were to draw drew without advising the shipping of the goods and the drawing against them through the bank for their value? Can it be doubted that the acceptance of the bills so drawn was on the strength of such advice rather than on that of the bill of lading. Bills of lading attached are generally more for the security of the drawer than the drawee\u2014it is that the goods shall not be delivered over till the bills are accepted; in other words, that the consignees shall not receive the goods till they have secured the payment by accepting the bills drawn for their price. In this case the transaction in connection with the bills, with which the railway had nothing to do, was an illusion and a fraud; the consideration on which the bills were drawn, and the consideration on which the plaintiffs accepted the bills never existed, the bills were drawn against flour to be shipped and for the price of the flour, on the sale of which the plaintiffs were to make a commission; the flour never was shipped, there never was any property on the sale of which the plaintiffs could make a commission, and the reason was that the parties with whom the plaintiffs dealt deceived them, and have endeavored to cover their deceit by transmitting to their dupes feigned documents as purporting to have been legitimately issued by defendants\u2019 authority.\nI can only look on this as a case of fraud pure and simple. Carruthers, in signing these receipts and bills, was not acting within the scope of his authority or in the course of his employment, or for his employers\u2019 benefit, and the company never adopted Carruther\u2019s act or profited by his fraud. Carruthers had no authority to make statements or representations. He was employed to receive goods, and on receipt to give acknowledgments therefor, and to ship the goods so received, and on such shipment to give bills of lading; in other words, sign a contract for their transportation and delivery. As said by Cresswell, J., in Coleman v. Riches[20]: \u201che was not employed to represent that to be true which he knew to be false.\u201d\nHis position was, as described by Crowder, J., in the same case that \u201cof a servant whose only duty was to give a receipt when the goods had been delivered.\u201d\nThe case we are dealing with is, in my opinion, much stronger against plaintiffs than those I have referred to, because it is quite impossible in this transaction to separate plaintiffs from T. Brown & Co., and equally impossible to separate T. Brown & Co. from Carruthers, who unquestionably was the leading partner, in fact substantially the firm of T. Brown & Co., and therefore, so far as the defendants are concerned, plaintiffs must be looked upon as, if not identical with Carruthers, as immediately connected with him, and cannot fix on the defendants a liability growing out of a breach of T. Brown & Co.\u2019s contract with them as set out in the declaration, and out of the fraudulent conduct of T. Brown & Co. in drawing against goods they never shipped, and fraudulently transmitting bills of lading of their own fraudulent concoction. No doubt T. Brown & Co., were, by reason of the employment of their leading member, enabled the more easily to perpetrate and carry out successfully this fraud; still I think this fraud of T. Brown & Co. in their dealing with plaintiffs, cannot be attributed to the company. The defendants had no knowledge of the transaction between T. Brown & Co. and plaintiffs. The falsehood, fraud and knowledge, was on the part of T. Brown & Co., with whom plaintiffs contracted, and who, instead of shipping the flour to plaintiffs, on the security of which the advances were to be made, and procuring bon\u00e2 fide bills of lading or shipping receipts therefor from defendants, in fulfilment of their contract with plaintiffs, falsely and fraudulently, by their senior and principal partner, made out a false and fraudulent bill of lading or shipping receipt purporting to be the bill of lading or the receipt of the defendants, and thereby falsely and fraudulently represented to plaintiffs that they had fulfilled their contract and had shipped and consigned to them the flour in question, and had procured from defendants a bill of lading and shipping receipt therefor, when in truth and in fact the flour never had been consigned and shipped to plaintiffs, nor delivered to be shipped, and defendants never had given any bill of lading or shipping receipt therefor. This was a roguish transaction on the part of T. Brown & Co. through their senior and principal partner, whereby they sought and obtained advances from the bank, not on the strength of flour consigned by them to plaintiffs, but on the strength of a false bill of lading concocted by themselves, handed to the bank with a draft on plaintiffs, which the bank, in ignorance of the fraud, transmitted to the plaintiffs as genuine documents, representing a real transaction, namely an actual shipment by T. Brown & Co., of 200 barrels of flour to plaintiffs, when, in fact, they never had shipped a barrel, and, upon being so transmitted, the plaintiffs, in like ignorance of the fraud and believing such documents represented to be a bon\u00e2 fide transaction, accepted and paid the bill.\nBy what process of reasoning can this be said to be a transaction of defendants, or with which defendants are in any way connected in the due course of business?\nI think, therefore, that Carruthers was in this transaction between plaintiffs and T. Brown & Co., and to which defendants were no party, acting as and for the firm of T. Brown & Co., to enable that firm to raise money by false and fraudulent means and pretences in their dealings with plaintiffs, and that defendants are in no way responsible for a transaction of such a character concocted for the benefit of T. Brown & Co., and carried out by Carruthers wholly outside of and apart from and contrary to his authority and duty as freight agent of defendants.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nConcurred in the judgment of the majority of the Court of Common Pleas in Oliver v. Great Western Railway Co.[21]\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am in favor of allowing this appeal, for the reasons given in the judgments of Mr. Justice Patterson and ex-Vice Chancellor Blake[22].\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action brought by the appellants, who reside at St. John, N.B., upon six bills of lading or freight bills dated at Chatham, in the Province of Ontario, in August, 1876. The declaration contains twelve counts six of which are based on the contract contained in the freight bills to deliver the goods to the appellants at St. John, N.B., and the other six are founded on the alleged fraudulent representations of the respondents, of having received the goods, when, in fact, they had not so received them.\nThe respondent pleaded seven pleas.\nTo the first six counts: 1st. That they did not promise as alleged. 2nd. Denies the delivery to them of the goods for the purpose and on the terms alleged. 3rd. That the bills of lading were not for a valuable consideration delivered to the appellants, and that the plaintiffs were not the bon\u00e2 fide holders of the same for valuable consideration, as alleged, nor entitled to the property in and possession of the goods. 4th. Alleges the delivery of goods to the appellants at St. John, N.B., according to the alleged contracts. 5th. Denies delivery of the goods to the respondents, and alleges that the appellants had actual notice when they received the bills of lading that the goods had not in fact been delivered to the respondents. 6th. Denies the delivery of goods to the respondents by T. Brown & Co., and alleges that the bills of lading were, without any default on the part of the respondents, obtained from them wholly by the fraud and collusion of T. Brown & Co., and of the appellants and of others through whom the appellants claim. To six remaining counts \u201cnot guilty.\u201d\nThe six bills of lading or freight bills were put in evidence. Each embodies a receipt of the goods and an undertaking to deliver them to the appellants at St. John, N.B. All are signed by W. Carruthers, the acknowledged shipping agent of the respondents at Chatham, and are filled up on the printed forms of the respondent\u2019s company.\nThe goods in fact were never delivered to the company, or to any of its agents or servants, and, as between the alleged shippers and the respondents, there would be no liability on the latter. It would appear that the agent, Carruthers, was a partner or had some interest in the firm of T. Brown & Co., or partially managed it. The evidence is anything but conclusive on that point; but that would not, in my view of the matter, make any great difference. It would not affect the rights of the parties in this suit whether Carruthers really was a partner. If it were a question between the shipper and the respondents it would be important and essentially different. It is clear the appellants thought bon\u00e2 fide they were dealing with a responsible firm. They had previous consignments from them all in order, and they had also received consignments when the business was done under the name of A.D. Bogart & Co. before the firm of T. Brown & Co. was formed. In the usual order of business, the way bills were given for the goods in question as had been done previously, and signed and executed as the preceding ones. For the later shipments the respondents would have been accountable if the goods had been delivered, and were not delivered through the negligence or default of the respondents or their agents or servants. But for the non-delivery, in this case, of the goods, there should be, in my opinion, no question of the liability of the respondents. Under the statutes passed for the purpose of enabling parties to obtain advances on goods about to be moved from one part of the country to another, such receipts, when executed by the proper officer of the railway company, are made evidence of transfer of ownership, and a lien is created in favor of any party making advances on the security of such bills of lading (see 31 Vic., c. 11, sec. 7, D.). That section provides that any carrier may give a bill of lading or freight receipt in his capacity as such carrier even for his own goods, and makes the transfer of it for advances as effectual as if the goods belonged to another. Such receipts are then, by the statute, made evidence of title as between the parties. The bills of lading in this case made the appellants the consignees, and the property in any goods forwarded under them would pass to them subject to the shippers\u2019 right of stoppage in transitu. In consequence, then, of the acknowledgment of the receipt of the several shipments of the goods in question by the respondents, through their long accredited agent, the bank and the appellants were induced to do what they otherwise would not have done. The bank discounted the bills drawn by T. Brown & Co., as they had often done before, and the appellants accepted and paid them. The bills of lading were signed for the respondents by their duly authorized agent for that purpose, which makes it their act. They were bound to know the consequences of giving powers to their agent, and to remember, when appointing or continuing one, that his receipts in their name for property to be moved from one part of the country to another, were made evidence of the property in the goods upon which banks and others would, from time to time, be induced to advance immense sums of money. There was, then, thrown upon railway companies and other carriers, the duty and responsibility of having faithful and honest agents, and, independent altogether of the common law obligations of principals to answer for the fraud of their agents, I am of the opinion that their obligation under the terms, provisions, purview and spirit of the statute I have quoted, includes that of making good to the appellants the loss they have sustained. The law which, in my opinion, should govern our decision in this case, is clearly and properly expressed by Story in his work on Agency (sec. 127), where he says:\u2014\nThe maxim of natural justice here applies with its full force, that he who, without intentional fraud, has enabled any person to do an act which must be injurious to himself or to another innocent party, shall himself suffer the injury rather than the innocent party who has placed confidence in him. The maxim is founded on the soundest ethics and is enforced to a large extent by Courts of Equity.\nIn a note to the section just mentioned, he says:\u2014\nThe principle which pervades all cases of agency, whether it be a general or special agency, is this: The principal is bound by all acts of his agent within the scope of the authority which he holds him out to the world to possess. * * * * And this is founded on the doctrine that where one of the two persons must suffer by the act of a third person, he who has held that person out as worthy of trust and confidence and having authority in the matter shall be bound by it.\nThis is the admitted doctrine in all courts in England, and the law in France holds the principal liable for the fraud of his agent in cases similar to this. See 20 Laurent, p. 609, where he approves this doctrine as held by Pothier. I might also cite in confirmation of it from the Roman law.\nI have fully considered, as alleged to be applicable to this case, the law as between the endorser of a bill of lading for value signed by the master of a ship and the ship owner, which holds the latter not responsible for goods not shipped on board, but I think a different principle is involved in respect to bills of lading signed by a general receiving agent of a railway company. In Grant v. Norway[23], Chief Justice Jervis, in giving the judgment, gives reasons why a ship owner should not in such a case be held responsible, and says:\u2014\nThe very nature of a bill of lading shows that it ought not to be signed until goods are on board; for it begins by describing them as shipped.\nAnd adds:\u2014\nNor can we discover any ground upon which a party taking a bill of lading by indorsement would be justified in assuming that he (the captain) had authority to sign such bills whether the goods were on board or not.\nHe then shows that from the usage of trade and the general practice of shipmasters it is generally known that the master has no authority to sign bills of lading, except for goods on board. It is, however, only by mercantile law and the usage of trade that bills of lading become negotiable by assignment or indorsement, and although as binding as if regulated by statute the ruling in such cases should not necessarily determine the rights of parties under the statutory provisions referred to. The case of traffic by railways from its nature and peculiarities may be essentially different from that by means of a ship.\nThe legislature has provided as a means of enabling the trade of the country to be effectively carried on, that those who advance means for that purpose shall be secured in the way provided by the acts referred to. The statute before referred to created new responsibilities and liabilities, without which it would be ineffectual for the intended objects. Having expressly given to the delivery receipts of railway companies and others an importance and value which they would not otherwise possess, it necessarily enjoined the obligation for faithfulness regarding them, and called upon those who issued them, either by themselves or their agents, to exercise the necessary caution, so that the public relying upon them would be justified in advancing funds on their security. If, therefore, railway and other companies and proprietors are not to be held answerable for the acts of their duly authorized agents or servants there would be really no security in such cases, and railway and other forwarding companies or associations might retain the services of irresponsible and unreliable agents and servants, the certain results of which would be to render such receipts as those in this case comparatively worthless and require every person, before advancing or paying on the strength of them, to verify the truth of them, which, in a great many cases, would be impracticable and a drag upon the operations they were intended to promote. When we are bound to know that large advances are, and were intended to be, made on the faith of them, even by parties at great distances from the point were they are issued, we are, I think, equally bound to conclude that the legislature intended to enjoin and require that those who issued them should bon\u00e2 fide do so. It will not be questioned that if the delivery receipts in question in this suit had been issued directly by the respondents they would be answerable for the misrepresentations complained of. I think the obvious intention of the legislature was to make them equally answerable for the agent they employed to perform faithfully on their part the duty imposed by the act upon them. If they are not so responsible the object of the legislation must be to a great extent frustrated, and its benefits relatively curtailed and diminished. It is our duty in construing an act to give the fullest effect to its manifest objects and intentions, and we cannot do so if we do not hold the principals answerable for the fraud or negligence of their agents or servants, through whose misrepresentations losses are occasioned to persons induced by the legislature to place confidence in them. I am of the opinion, that by a contrary decision we would lessen, if not wholly destroy, the security the legislature intended to give to outside parties when making advances on the security of such delivery receipts, and thereby to a great extent frustrate the object the legislature had in view to foster when passing the act in question. I think myself bound by motives of public policy to adopt this view, and, for the reasons I have given, I think the appeal should be allowed and that our judgment should be for the appellants with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nIn this case, I am of opinion to dismiss this appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI desire to add nothing to what was said by me in Oliver v.

Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAgreement\u2014Additional parol term\u2014Conditions\u2014Carriers\u2014Wilful negligence\u2014\u201cAt owner\u2019s risk.\u201d\nThe respondents sued the appellants for breach of contract to carry petroleum in covered cars from L. to H., alleging that they negligently carried the same upon open platform cars, whereby the barrels in which the oil was were exposed to the sun and weather and were destroyed. At the trial, a verbal contract between plaintiffs and defendants\u2019 agent at L. was proved, that the defendants would carry the oil in covered cars with despatch. The oil was forwarded in open cars, and delayed in different places, and in consequence a large quantity was lost. On the shipment of the oil, a receipt note was given which said nothing about covered cars, and which stated that the goods were subject to conditions endorsed thereon, one of which was, \u201cthat the defendants would not be liable for leakage or delays, and that the oil was carried at the owner\u2019s risk.\u201d\nHeld, per Sir W.J. Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier and Henry, J.J., that the loss did not result from any risks by the contract imposed on the owners, but that it arose from the wrongful act of the defendants in placing the oil on open cars, which act was inconsistent with the contract they had entered into, and in contravention as well of the undertaking as of their duty as carriers.\nPer Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J.J.:\u2014The evidence was admissible to prove a verbal contract to carry in covered cars, which contract the agent at L. was authorized to enter into, and which must be incorporated with the writing so as to make the whole contract one for carriage in covered cars, and that non-compliance with the provision as to carriage in covered cars, prevented the appellants setting up the condition that \u201coil was carried at the owner\u2019s risk\u201d as exempting them from liability. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal of the above named appellants to the said Court of Appeal from the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of the said Province on the 28th day of June, A.D., 1878, as of Easter Term 41st Vic., discharging a rule nisi made in the said Easter Term in a certain cause in the said Court of Common Pleas, whereby respondents were ordered to show cause why the verdict obtained in the said cause should not be set aside, and a verdict entered for the said defendants or a non-suit, pursuant to The Common Law Procedure Act, or why a new trial should not be had between the parties on the ground that the said verdict is contrary to law and evidence, and for admission of improper evidence.\nThe action was commenced by the respondents against the appellants on the 21st March, 1875, to recover the value of oil said to have been lost in the course of transit from London to Portland upon the appellants\u2019 railway.\nThe facts of the case are as follows[1]:\nThe respondents, having a contract with the Government of Canada for supplying oil at Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, for the use of the Government, towards the end of April or beginning of May, A.D., 1873, entered into a verbal agreement with the appellants, through their general agent at London, for the carriage of the oil from London to Halifax. In the agreement it was expressly stipulated that, at a certain fixed rate per barrel then agreed upon, the oil should be carried in covered cars, and with as quick dispatch as possible. Afterwards it was discovered that owing to the gauge of the appellants\u2019 railway between London and Stratford differing from the gauge on the remainder of their road, that they could not get a sufficient num- ber of covered cars at London to carry the oil to Stratford, whereupon the respondents consented to vary the original agreement in this, that the appellants might carry the oil, from London to Stratford, on open or platform cars, taking the same from London in the evening, so as not to expose the oil to the heat of the sun in the daytime, and that the oil should be transhipped into covered cars at Stratford, and should be carried in covered cars from Stratford with quick dispatch. The agreement was to apply to, and did apply to, all the oil the respondents would ship to Halifax for the Government during the year.\nAt the time that each of the shipments of oil was made a request or shipping note for the same was signed by the respondents, and a receipt given by the appellants; neither notes nor receipts say anything about covered cars, the mode of carriage, nor do they fix the rate of freight to be paid, but on the back of each of them was indorsed a condition or proviso that \u201cOil and Molasses will under no circumstances be carried save at the risk of the owners, or parties by whom the same are consigned,\u201d and another condition or proviso that \u201cno claim for loss or damage for which this company is accountable, will be allowed unless notice in writing is given to the Station Freight Agent within 24 hours after the goods are delivered,\u201d together with other conditions, and the appellants contend that under these conditions they are not responsible for any loss to the respondents\u2019 oil.\nThe respondents shipped oil to Halifax by two shipments, one on the 6th of May, 1873, and one on the 10th of June, 1873. Both shipments were sent out from London on open or platform cars, and no part of either shipment was transhipped into covered cars at Stratford, as agreed by the appellants, but both shipments were carried over the whole line of the appel- lants\u2019 railroad on open or platform cars, and were also greatly delayed on the way, and exposed to the sun and weather on the way, and on the sidings of the appellants\u2019 railway at Montreal and elsewhere, and on the wharf at Portland, and in consequence of such delays and exposure, great loss and damage was sustained by the respondents, and this action was brought to recover compensation for such loss.\nThe learned Judge who tried the case found, as a fact, that the verbal contract with the appellants\u2019 agent was to carry in covered cars as alleged, and rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs, with $1,114 damages.\nDr. McMichael, Q.C, and Mr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellants:\u2014\nThe complaint is for leakage of oil carried by the appellants. The ordinary letter of request to the appellants to forward the oil upon the basis of the conditions of the appellants as railway carriers was filled up by the respondents, and they accepted from the agent a receipt for the same, given to them upon the terms of the ordinary bill of lading of the appellants. Now, one of the special conditions of the contract was that they should not be liable for leakage, and \u201coil and molasses will, under no circumstances, be carried save at the risk of the owner or parties by whom they are consigned.\u201d The only question therefore for enquiry is, whether or not the appellants bring themselves within the conditions of the contract which absolve them from the liability and whether these conditions have that effect.\nThe appellants submit that the effect of the notice contained in these printed documents has freed them from any liability they would otherwise have had as common carriers with regard to these commodities. For a carrier can relieve himself from the common law liability by notice. In this case it was impossible to use more comprehensive language. See Lewis v. G.W. Railway[2].\nBut then the respondents also contend that the contract sued on was not simply a contract containing ordinary conditions of the appellants\u2019 usual shipping notes, but was either partly verbal and partly written, having certain stipulations outside of these conditions, which either controlled or were incorporated with them, or that there was an independent verbal contract, and that the appellants were not entitled to the benefits of the conditions, and so the case, as launched by the respondents, proceeded upon this special contract, stated to have been made with Mr. Thorpe, the appellants\u2019 agent at London, to be read by itself, or that the special contract should be read as having this verbal contract forming part of it.\nWe deny that any contract was made with Thorpe, the agent, except one upon the basis of the ordinary conditions of the appellants, and that if he made any such contract it was beyond the scope of his powers as an agent.\nParol evidence is inadmissible for the purpose of varying the terms of the contract; and Mr. Thorpe had no power to make a new or any other contract than this written one, or to vary that contract.\nWhat the respondents desire, is to vary that term of the contract which provides that \u201coil and molasses will under no circumstances be carried save at the risk of the owners or parties by whom they are consigned,\u201d making that passage read as if it were as follows: \u201cIn case the oil and molasses are carried in covered cars the Company will, under no circumstances, be liable for oil and molasses carried save at the risk of the owners or parties by whom they are consigned.\u201d Mason v. Scott[3], Jervis v. Berridge[4], Harris v. G.W.R.[5], re Delaware[6].\nIn any event the appellants submit that it is clear from the evidence, that there was no power on the part of Mr. Thorpe to make any contract on behalf of the appellants on any other terms than those embodied in the terms and conditions of the ordinary bills of lading of the appellants.\nThe cases which have been referred to in the English Courts in the Court below afford no guide as a proper rule of decision in a case in this country, because the English statute, 17 and 18 Vic., ch. 31, has laid down a rule so entirely different from the rule for interpretation of carriers\u2019 contracts at Common Law as to make these decisions entirely inapplicable. That statute avoids all conditions except such conditions as shall be adjudged by the Court or Judge, by whom the question relating thereto shall be tried, to be just and reasonable.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Carr v. The L. & Yorkshire Ry. Co.[7]; Austin v. The M.S. & Lincolnshire Ry. Co.[8]\nFitzgerald had notice that Thorpe had no authority to vary the contract, for the railway authorities had furnished him, as well as the public dealing with them, with the forms of contract containing the conditions upon which they were willing to carry such goods. Surely it is not an unjust inference to say that under these circumstances Fitzgerald was affected with notice of the limited authority of Thorpe. See Davis v. Scottish Provincial Ins. Co.[9]\nMr. Glass, Q.C., and Mr. W.W. Fitzgerald for respondents: The contract and agreement relied on by the respondents was separate and distinct from the said shipping note relied on by the appellants; the contract was a distinct and complete contract in every respect, stating the mode of carriage, viz, in covered cars, and the rate of freight to be charged for the through rate, the place of shipment and of destination, and that the goods should be carried with all possible expedition, and was such a contract as a general agent had full power and authority in the scope of his business to enter into and to bind his principals for the fulfilment of. The evidence shows that Thorpe was such general agent, and was accustomed to enter into such contracts on behalf of the appellants, and that as such general agent he did actually enter into the said contract with the respondents.\nThe case of Lewis v. G.W. Ry.[10], referred to by the learned counsel for appellants, was entirely a different case from this, because there was a specific provision that the carriage was for a lower rate than was ordinarily charged. In this case there was no reduction, but the appellants were told by the respondents, when the agreement was entered into for the carriage, that unless they would undertake to carry them in covered cars, the goods would not be delivered to them for carriage, as the respondents could have the goods carried in covered cars by the Great Western Railway, whereupon the appellants covenanted and agreed to carry the said goods in covered cars, and this express stipulation or agreement was the chief and paramount consideration moving and inducing the respondents to enter into the said contract. In addition to this the learned judge who tried the case, found it as a fact that the contract was to carry in covered cars, See Cooper v. Blacklock[11]; Broom\u2019s Common Law[12]; Smith on Contracts[13]. As to clause number four in the special conditions relied on by the appellants, it only binds the respondents to assume and bear the risks ordinarily incurred in the carriage of goods of the class specified in said condition, and does not excuse the appellants from wilful negligence, misconduct, or malfeasance, and does not operate so as to excuse the appellants from wilful destruction of property delivered to them for carriage, by exposing it in such a manner as to render its destruction inevitable, as the appellants did in this case, it being shewn by the evidence that goods of the class and quality in this case could not be safely carried in open or flat cars at the season of the year when these goods were carried, nor does this condition release them from the consequences of the breach of their special contract to carry in covered cars: D\u2019Arc v. London and North Western R.R. Co.[14]\nWe also contend the appellants were guilty of gross and inexcusable negligence and malfeasance in carrying the respondents\u2019 goods in open or platform cars at the season of the year when they did, and in leaving the same exposed to sun and weather at Montreal and elsewhere on the line of their railway and on the wharf at Portland, as shewn in the evidence, and the great delay in the carriage from London to Halifax.\nThe following, with the authorities already quoted, will be relied on by the respondents: Morgan v. Griffith[15]; Lindley v. Lacy[16]; Harris et al., Assignees of Foeman v. Rickett[17]; Parsons v. Queen Ins. Co.[18]; Malpas v. London and South Western R.W. Co.[19]; Robinson v. Great Western R. Co.[20]\nDr. McMichael, Q.C., in reply:\nWe say our agent had no general authority to carry oil or molasses, and that the respondents had notice of his limited authority, and the court of appeal have come to the conclusion that the agent had no authority to make a verbal contract. If the respondents wanted to bind the company on the agent\u2019s agreement, they should have got a different receipt. As to the written contract there has been no breach proved.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nIn the view I take of this case, it is wholly immaterial whether the alleged verbal contract is imported into and incorporated with the printed receipt or not, for, without reference to any verbal agreement, I think the evidence very clearly shows that both the shipper and the company knew that open cars were not proper to be used, and the company, through its agent, had direct notice that the plaintiffs would not allow their goods to be shipped in open cars, and the company, through their shipping agent, in the usual course of business, received the goods to be conveyed in covered cars, and the contract, if it rested alone on the printed receipt, must be read in connection with these considerations to enable the Court to put on it the proper construction. It cannot be supposed possible that plaintiffs could have agreed that their goods should be shipped in vehicles which, if the uncontradicted evidence is correct, would, to the knowledge of both parties, assuredly involve almost certain injury. I therefore think both parties contracted on the assumption that the railway company would provide cars fit for the service; that in undertaking to carry the goods from one place to another, the company bound itself to provide proper vehicles and means of conveyance to enable it to do what it undertook, otherwise there would be a total abandonment of its character as a carrier, and that their not doing so, was not mere neglect in the course of the performance of the contract, but the company\u2019s conduct amounted to a refusal to execute the engagement entered into. The written contract therefore was, in my opinion, to send these goods in a proper conveyance. Any other construction would be most unreasonable and unjust, and there is nothing whatever in the contract to absolve the company from the consequences of neglecting to perform a duty that naturally and rightfully belongs to them, nor any stipulation exempting them from gross negligence or misconduct. If sent in proper conveyances the goods would, under the provision that oil was only to be carried at the risk of the owners, be at the risk of the owners, that is, the owners would be responsible for the ordinary risks incurred by the goods in the course of transit along the railway, but not for losses arising from the gross negligence of the carriers. But instead of so sending these goods, the defendants sent them, not in fit and proper conveyances, but in cars wholly unsuited and unfit for the carriage of such goods, and therefore did not carry in pursuance of, but in direct contravention of, their duty and their contract. The case is therefore not one of mere negligence, but of wilful negligence amounting to direct misfeasance. When these goods were placed on open cars, the company divested themselves of the ability to carry the goods as they were bound to do, and the loss arose from the wrongful act of defendants inconsistent with the contract they had entered into, and in contravention as well of their undertaking as of their duty as carriers.\nThis does not at all resemble the case of a Railway Company charging for the use of cars and the locomotive power only, as in the cases of Austin v. The Manchester, Sheffield, &c., Railway Co.[21], and Morville v. The Great Northern Railway Co.[22]; but much more like D\u2019Arc V. London & N.W. Railway Co.[23], Philipps v. Clark[24], Lewis v. Great Western Railway Co.[25], and Wyld v. Pickford[26].\nIn D\u2019Arc v. The London & N.W. Railway Co.[27], Lord Coleridge, C.J., says:\nThis Court, in Robinson v. Great Western Railway Co.[28], determined upon a contract in terms very similar to those of the contract in the present case, that the words \u201cat owner\u2019s risk\u201d only exempted the company from the ordinary risks incurred by goods going along the railway, and does not cover injury from delay caused by the negligence of the company.\nIn Philipps v. Clark[29], the marginal note is:\nA stipulation in a bill of lading that the ship owner \u201cis not to be accountable for leakage or breakage,\u201d does not exempt him from responsibility for a loss arising by these means from gross negligence.\nCockburn, C.J., says[30]:\u2014\nHe stipulates to be exempted from the liability which the law would otherwise cast upon him in other respects. But there is no reason why, because he is by the terms of the contract relieved from that liability, we should hold that the plaintiff intended also to exempt him from any of the consequences arising from his negligence.\nAnd Crowder, J.,[31]:\u2014\nIt is clearly not intended to relieve him from responsibility for leakage or breakage, the result of his negligence and want of care.\nIn Lewis v. Great Western Railway Co.[32], Bramwell, L.J, says:\u2014\nThere is such a mass of authorities to show what \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d is, that we should hardly be justified, as a Court of Appeal, in departing from them, even if we thought them to be wrong. \u201cWilful misconduct\u201d means misconduct to which the will is a party, something opposed to accident or negligence; the misconduct, not the conduct, must be wilful. It has been said, and, I think, correctly, that, perhaps, one condition of \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d must be that the person guilty of it should know that mischief will result from it. But, to my mind, there might be other \u201cwilful misconduct.\u201d I think it would be wilful misconduct if a man did an act not knowing whether mischief would or would not result from it. I do not mean when in a state of ignorance, but after being told, \u201cNow this may or may not be a right thing to do.\u201d He might say, \u201cWell, I do not know which is right, and I do not care; I will do this.\u201d I am much inclined to think that that would be \u201cwilful misconduct,\u201d because he acted under the supposition that it might be mischievous, and with an indifference to his duty to ascertain whether it was mischievous or not. I think that would be \u201cwilful misconduct.\u201d\nBrett, L.J., says:\nNow I apprehend that, in order to construe a written document, the Court is entitled to have all the facts relating to it and which were existing at the time the written contract was made, and which were known to both parties. Certain facts existing at a time when a written contract is made are sometimes customs of trade, or the ordinary usages of trade; sometimes the course of business between the parties; sometimes they consist of a knowledge of the matter about which the parties were negotiating; the Court is entitled to ask for these facts, to enable it to construe the written document; not simply because they are customs of trade, or the course of business between the parties, but because they are facts which were existing at the time, and which have a relation to the written contract, and which are things which must be taken to have been known by both parties to the contract. Here there were certain facts given in evidence which, I think, we are entitled to look at to enable us to construe the phrase \u201cowner\u2019s risk.\u201d\nBrett, L.J., again says:\u2014\nIn a contract where the term wilful misconduct is put as something different from and excluding negligence of every kind, it seems to me that it must mean the doing of something, or the omitting to do something, which it is wrong to do, or to omit, where the person who is guilty of the act or the omission knows that the act, which he is doing or that which he is omitting to do, is a wrong thing to do or to omit; and it involves the knowledge of the person that the thing which he is doing is wrong; I think that if he knows that what he is doing will seriously damage the goods of a consignor, then he knows that what he is doing is a wrong thing to do, and also, as my lord has put it, if it is brought to his notice that what he is doing, or omitting to do, may seriously endanger the things which are to be sent, and he wilfully persists in doing that against which he is warned, careless whether he may be doing damage or not, then, I think, he is doing a wrong thing, and that that is misconduct, and that, as he does it intentionally, he is guilty of wilful misconduct, or, if he does or omits to do something which everybody must know is likely to endanger or damage the goods, then it follows that he is doing that which he knows to be a wrong thing to do. Care must be taken to ascertain that it is not only misconduct but wilful misconduct, and I think that those two terms together import a knowledge of wrong on the part of the person who is supposed to be guilty of the act or omission.\nCotton, L.J., says:\u2014\nNow, I do not think there can be any doubt at all that wilful misconduct is something entirely different from negligence, and far beyond it, whether the negligence be culpable, or gross, or howsoever denominated. There must be the doing of something which the person doing it knows will cause risk or injury, or the doing of an unusual thing with reference to the matter in hand, either in spite of warning or without care, regardless whether it will or will not cause injury to the goods carried or other subject-matter of the transaction. It was asked by counsel, in argument, would it not be wilful misconduct on the part of the servants of the Great Western Railway to put a horse into an open truck? Certainly it would, because every one must be aware that putting a horse into an open truck, out of which he could jump, would, in all probability, lead to the consequence that as soon as the train started, the horse would try to jump out, and be seriously injured.\nIn Wyld v. Pickford[33], the marginal note states that a carrier is liable, not only for any act which amounts to a total abandonment of his character of a carrier, or for wilful negligence, but also for a conversion by a misdelivery arising from inadvertence or mistake, if such inadvertence or mistake might have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care.\nPer Parke, J., delivering judgment:\u2014\nBut still he undertakes to carry from one place to another, and for some reward in respect of the carriage, and is therefore bound to use ordinary care in the custody of the goods and their conveyance to and delivery at their place of destination, and in providing proper vehicles for their carriage. And surely if the owner takes on himself all risk of accident and injury of conveyance, the railway companies are bound to find proper carriages.\nI therefore think the Court of Common Pleas and the Appeal Court of Ontario were quite right in holding that defendants must bear the loss which obviously resulted from their improper dealing with the goods, and not from any of the risks by their contract imposed on the owners.\nSTRONG, J., concurred in the judgments delivered in the Court of Common Pleas.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI think the appeal in this case should be dismissed. The parties, through their agents duly authorized, entered into a contract to carry this oil from one point to another, and in doing so undertook impliedly to carry it in a proper manner. They undertook to provide the proper means of transport, so that it should not be subject to damage ordinarily occasioned to such property when exposed to the weather. Oil has been shown, on this trial, to be of such a nature that it loses very largely by absorption into the material of the cask which contains it. To prevent that it is necessary that these casks should be all glued inside before the oil is put into them. The effect therefore of exposing them to the hot sun is to melt this glue, and the oil, though the cask may be apparently tight, will lose largely by absorption. The parties who undertake to carry articles of that kind are to be presumed to carry them in a way that they will not be necessarily injured. The oil in this instance was stipulated to be carried in covered cars, so as to be kept from the action of the sun. That is evidence of the necessity of carrying it in that way. I think the parties entered into an implied contract to carry it in cars, by which the casks would be protected from the effects of the sun. I am of opinion that, notwithstanding the conditions, that is a part of their contract. The written condition that oil and molasses were to be carried at the owner\u2019s risk would not apply to that portion of the risk which was to be provided for by the undertaking to furnish covered cars. Carriers are bound as part of their contract to provide proper means of transportation, and the party dealing with them says, \u201cyou have undertaken to furnish proper means of transport I will run the other risks.\u201d It was no part of the risk therefore, under that condition, that the casks of oil should be subjected to the rays of the sun, by which great damage was done, and loss incurred. I am of opinion, that that was a part of the original contract independently of the special contract made with the agent. Now, it has been objected, that the agent had not the authority to enter into that contract because he had private instructions against it. The public know nothing of those private instructions, and the rule is, where one man authorizes another, and holds him out to the world as his agent to carry on any particular kind of business, there is an implied authority on his part to do everything within the compass of his authority to carry on the business. Parties outside know nothing about private instructions, and are not governed by them. If they had known of the private instructions in this case, the parties, it is clear, would not have sent the oil in that way, and it would be unjust in the extreme that they should suffer loss by private instructions given to agents of which they knew nothing.\nI am of opinion, that the agent had full authority to enter into that contract, and I can see nothing that at all militates to alter or vary the written contract. The latter provides only for the carrying without any particular mode or means; the other is additional to the contract. The shipper says: \u201cI will enter enter into that contract with you provided you will carry the oil in covered cars.\u201d He undertakes to do so. The other party agrees to it. It would be a fraud, then, upon the man who was induced to enter into the contract, to allow the parties to say that there was a variation, or that the one contract was not supplementary to the other. I think it is, and the parties are responsible for the contract made by the agent. There is no doubt about the damage being done through the wilful misconduct of the servants of the company, but independently of that wilful misconduct, independently of negligence, I hold it is part of the contract, that the company is answerable for it, on the principle that every one who undertakes to perform a service for another undertakes to perform it by proper and ordinary means. If he does not do so the contract fails, and I think they might as well ask to be held harmless in this case, for no better reason than they would if they put quarters of fresh beef beside a hot stove and kept them there for days, or put eggs in an ice box. In those cases there is no question it would be gross and wilful misconduct, and even if the shippers did undertake to run the risk in shipping eggs, they would only run the risk of being broken or injured in the usual manner; but certainly it is not to be imagined that running the risk includes that for which the other parties would be answerable, and through their improper conduct caused damage. I think therefore this case is as strong as that. This oil was shown to have been for days and days left at different stations on the road exposed to the operation of the sun\u2019s rays, the very thing that the party undertook to guard against, and for which, we have reason to suppose, he paid extra.\nUnder all the circumstances the merits are all in in favor of the respondent, and law in his favor, and therefore I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI should not think it is necessary to add anything to what appears in the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, if it were not that some observations made in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, calculated to throw doubt upon the applicability of Malpas v. L. & S.W. Railway[34] to the determination of this case, if not also upon the soundness of the judgment in that case, seem to me to call for remark. The principle upon which that case proceeded, in my opinion, plainly justified the reception in this case of oral evidence, to shew that the contract entered into between the parties was for the carriage of the oil in covered cars. Such evidence, not being in contradiction of anything in the delivery bill, but an addition to it, and indeed relating to matter not necessary to be in a delivery bill, was clearly admissible, and equally so whether the oil was intended to be forwarded in one, two, or more carloads. The result is, that the conditions endorsed on the delivery bill could only be applied to qualify the liability of the defendants conditional upon their carrying the oil in covered cars, in accordance with the essential term of the contract, upon the faith of which alone they were given the oil to carry.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitor for respondents: W.W.

B.).\nJ. brought an action against G., the Police Magistrate of the city of St. John, for wrongfully causing the plaintiff, a commercial traveller, to be arrested and imprisoned on a warrant issued on a conviction by the Police Magistrate, for violation of a by-law made by the common council of the city of St John, under an alleged authority conferred on that body by 33 Vic., c. 4, passed by the legislature of New Brunswick. Sec. 3 of the Act authorized the mayor of the city of St John to license persons to use any art, trade, &c., within the city of St John, on payment of such sum or sums as may from time to time be fixed and determined by the common council of St. John, &c.; and sec. 4 empowered the mayor, &c., by any by-law or ordinance, to fix and determine what sum or sums of money should be from time to time paid for license to use any art, trade, occupation, &c.; and to declare how fees should be recoverable; and to impose penalties for any breach of the same, &c. The by-law or ordinance in question discriminated between resident and nonresident merchants, traders, &c., by imposing a license tax of $20 on the former and $40 on the latter.\nHeld,\u2014That assuming the Act 33 Vic., c. 4, to be intra vires of the Legislature of New Brunswick, the by-law made under it was invalid, because the act in question gave no power to the common council of St. John, of discrimination between residents and non-residents, such as they had exercised in this by-law.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, whereby judgment was given for the Defendant (respondent).\nWilliam Sandall, as Chamberlain of the City of Saint John, New Brunswick, made a complaint to Humphrey T. Gilbert, the Police Magistrate of the City of Saint John, that Henri Jonas, who was not a free citizen of the said City or a registered freeman, or paying rates or taxes in the said City, did, at the City of Saint John, on the seventeenth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, engage in mercantile business by selling or offering for sale goods to persons in the City of Saint John without being duly licensed therefor, as provided by the ordinance of the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Saint John.\nThat the said Police Magistrate, upon such complaint being made, on the eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, issued a summons for the said Henri Jonas to appear before him, the said Police Magistrate, at the Police office in the City of Saint John, on the nineteenth day of June then next, to answer the said complaint, and shew cause, if any he had, why a fine of twenty dollars as provided in said by-law or ordinance, should not be imposed upon him for violating the said bylaw.\nThat in pursuance of the said summons the said Henri Jonas attended, and on hearing the matter of the said complaint and the evidence adduced, the said Henri Jonas was adjudged to be guilty of violating the said by-law, and a fine of twenty dollars was imposed upon him; but the said Henri Jonas having no goods and chattels whereon to levy the said fine or penalty thus imposed, a warrant was issued by Humphrey T. Gilbert, the Police Magistrate, under which the said Henri Jonas was arrested and imprisoned, and he then paid the fine of twenty dollars.\nThereupon Henri Jonas brought an action against the said Humphrey T. Gilbert for such arrest and imprisonment; and to his declaration the defendant demurred, alleging that from the proceedings set out therein, namely, the complaint, summons, conviction and arrest, and the plaintiff having no goods and chattels whereon to levy the fine or penalty, the defendant was warranted in his proceedings, and the declaration disclosed no cause of action against the defendant as such Police Magistrate.\nThe plaintiff joined in demurrer, and contended that the Act of Assembly under which said by-law was made was ultra vires the Legislature, and also that the by-law or ordinance of the Mayor, &c., was void in law, and therefore the defendant acted without jurisdiction, and the proceedings could not be sustained.\nIn Trinity Term last, the Second Division of the Supreme Court, consisting of Judges Weldon, Fisher and Wetmore, gave judgment for the defendant on the demurrer.\nThe Acts of the Legislature of New Brunswick and the by-law or ordinance in dispute in this case are referred and set out at length in the judgment of Court hereinafter given.\nAs the Court held that it was not necessary to enter into the question raised whether the Act 33 Vic., ch. 4, N. B., is or not ultra vires of the provincial Legislature, nor the question whether or not a commercial traveller is a person within the operation of the Act, the elaborate arguments of counsel on these points are omitted.\nMr. Bethune, Q. C., and Mr. McLaren, for appellant:\nThe Common Council have no power in reference to matters of trade to discriminate against non-residents; if such Council has the power to compel persons doing business in the City of Saint John to take out a license they must take the same license fee payable by nonresidents as by residents.\nThe charter gave no power to the Common Council to distinguish between residents and non-residents of the City as to the amount of fee to be paid for a license,\u2014it simply restrained all but freemen from trading. And even if the Act 33 Vic. c. 4 gave power to the Common Council to put a license in the place of freedom, it gave the City Council no power to distinguish between residents and non-residents; if the Act gave that power, it is claimed it was ultra vires the Local Legislature; if it did not and the by-law of the City so discriminates, then the by-law is ultra vires the Common Council. Does this Act authorize the City Council to say, for example, residents can do business here by paying $20 per year, non-residents by paying $500 per year? Is not this discrimination not contemplated by the Legislature? Yet, this is the principle the City of St. John under its by-law seeks to enforce. If the Act 33 Vic. c. 4 had provided that residents and non-residents should be licensed instead of being made freemen, it might be said that to a certain extent it was relaxing the restraint, &c., but it says in effect that the Common Council may make a by-law putting as much heavier a license fee upon non-residents than upon residents as they please, whereby the power is given the Common Council to altogether prohibit non-residents from doing business in the City. A by-law must not go beyond the statute. Hardcastle, on Statutes[1], Cooley on Taxation[2]. Dillon, on Municipal Corporations[3].\nDr. Tuck, Q. C., for respondent:\u2014\nThe point is whether 33 Vic., c. 4 is constitutional, and not whether 33 Vic. c. 4 gave power to the Common Council of St. John to pass the by-law in question. However I will first answer the argument of my learned friends on this branch of the case. I admit that under the original charter, no power was given to tax wholesale dealers, but the object of 6 Vic., c. 35, was to enlarge the powers of the Council, in order to reach all traders. Then 33 Vic., c. 4, was passed, and under that Act I contend that any body doing business within the city of St. John may be taxed. Now if the General Assembly had power to pass 33 Vic., c. 4, then this Act gave to the Common Council of St. John the power to make this by-law. If the Act gives them power to tax, it gives them power to tax them $20 or $40, there is no restraint.\nSee American Express Co. v. City of St. Joseph[4]; Cooley, on Taxation[5]. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nThis was an action against the Police Magistrate of the city of St. John for wrongfully, as it is alleged, causing the plaintiff to be arrested and imprisoned on a warrant issued on a conviction by the Police Magistrate, for a violation of a by-law made by the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of St. John, under an alleged authority conferred on that body by the 33 Vic., c. 4, passed by the Legislature of New Brunswick, which Act plaintiff contends was ultra vires of the Legislature of New Brunswick, or if it had the legislative power to pass it, the by-law or ordinance made by the corporation of St. John was not justified or authorized by the said Act.\nWe do not think it necessary to enter into the question raised as to whether the Act 33 Vic., c. 4, N. B., is or not ultra vires of the provincial Legislature, nor the question whether or not a commercial traveller is a person within the operation of the Act, for we are of opinion that the by-law or ordinance made under it is invalid, and therefore conferred no power or jurisdiction on the Police Magistrate of St. John to convict and imprison for its violation.\nBy the charter of the city of St. John, dated the 18th May, 1775, confirmed by 24 Geo. III, c. 46, it was ordained \"that no person whatever not being a free citizen of the said city shall at any time hereafter use any art, trade, mystery or occupation within the said city liberties and precincts thereof, or shall by himself, themselves, or others, sell or expose to sale, any manner of goods, wares, merchandizes, or commodities by retail in any house, shop, place, or standing within the said city, or the liberties, or the precincts thereof (save in the times of public fairs), &c.\" The charter likewise provided that none shall be made free, but natural-born subjects, or such as are naturalized or made denizens; blacks were excluded from the privilege of becoming free citizens, but it was ordained that the mayor might license them to reside and carry on business in the city. This charter was amended by 6 Vic., c. 35, an Act for the amendment of the charter of the city of St. John, whereby it was enacted:\u2014\nSection 3.

If transient persons, not having taken up a residence, forty dollars ($40.)\nAll such payments to be made at the office of the chamberlain of the said city, and to be over and above all other charges, taxes, rates, or assessments which any inhabitant of the said city may by law be liable to or chargeable with, and also over and above any and all fees and sums of money payable for licenses which, under any statute of the Legislature or by-law of the city corporation, any person may be required to pay for carrying on any special business in the said city. 2. All such licenses granted under this law shall be issued under the common seal of the city, and shall be and continue for a term from the date of such license up to the first day of May next following, and shall expire on such first day of May in each year.\n3. Any person, not being a free citizen of the said city of Saint John, registered as a freeman thereof, or not having been assessed in the general assessment for the city rates and taxes in and for the year next preceding, who shall at any time use any art, trade, mystery or occupation in the said city, or carry on or engage in any profession or mercantile or other business or employment in the said city of Saint John without having been duly licensed therefor, as provided by this law, under license existing and in force, shall forfeit and pay for each and every time he shall so act in contravention of this law, a penalty of twenty dollars, to be sued for, prosecuted and recovered in the name of the chamberlain of the said city for the time being, before the Police Magistrate or sitting Magistrate at the police office, as provided by law, to be paid and applied in manner and to the use directed by the charter of the city of Saint John and the laws in force relating to the local government of said city, and in every case on the adjudication of any such penalty and non-payment thereof, the same shall be levied by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the person upon whom the penalty shall be imposed, and for want of goods and chattels whereon to levy, the person shall be committed to the common gaol of the city and county of Saint John for the term of ten days.\nThis Act, in my opinion, only contemplated and authorized the establishment of a uniform rate to be paid by persons to be licensed under it, to do business in the said city. I think this general power to tax by means of licenses involved the principle of equality and uniformity, and conferred no power to discriminate between residents and non-residents; that this is a principle inherent in a general power to tax; that a power to discriminate must be expressly authorized by law and cannot be inferred from general words such as are used in this statute; that a statute such as this must be construed strictly; and the intention of the legislature to confer this power of discrimination, must, I think, explicitly and distinctly, appear by clear and unambiguous words. Mr. Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations[7], says:\nThe general rule that the powers of a municipal corporation are to be construed with strictness is peculiarly applicable to the case of taxes on occupations. It is presumed the legislature has granted in plain terms all it has intended to grant at all.\nThe legislature never could, I think, have intended that the corporation of Saint John should have the arbitrary power of burthening one man or one class of men in favor of another, whereby the one might possibly be enabled to carry on a prosperous business at the expense of the other, but must have contemplated that the burthen should be fairly and impartially borne, and the legislature must be assumed to have been quite alive to the distinction between a general uniform power and a power to discriminate, for by 6 Vic., c. 38, which they were then altering, authority is given to discriminate between British subjects and aliens, which is entirely ignored in the 33 Vic. c. 4.\nUnless the legislative authority otherwise ordains, everybody having property or doing business in the country is entitled to assume that taxation shall be fair and equal, and that no one class of individuals, or one species of property, shall be unequally or unduly assessed.\nUniformity and impartiality in the imposition of taxes may in many cases, we all know, be very difficult; still, in construing Acts of Parliament imposing burthens of this description, I think we must assume, in the absence of any provision clearly indicating the contrary, that the legislature intended the Act to be construed on the principle of uniformity and impartiality; and in this case, I think it never could have been the intention of the legislature, not only to discourage the transaction of business in the city of Saint John, but to do injustice to those seeking to do business there, by granting to any one person or class pecuniary advantages over other persons or classes in the same line of business; in other words, to restrain the right of any particular individual or class to do business in the city by enabling the corporation to favor, by the imposition of a license tax, one individual or class, at the expense of other individuals or classes transacting the same business, thereby enabling certain individuals or classes to do business on more favorable terms in the one case than the other.\nI therefore think, if the legislature contemplated such a departure from uniformity and impartiality as is established by this by-law, such an intention would have been made apparent on the face of the Act and cannot be inferred, and, in the absence of any such declared intention, I think no power of discrimination such as they have exercised in this by-law has been conferred on the corporation of Saint John, and therefore the by-law, supposing the local legislature has the power of enacting the 33 Vic., c. 4, is ultra vires of that Act, and therefore the defendant had no jurisdiction to act under it or to give it effect as he did.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant:\u2014 W.

J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA,\nMarine policy\u2014Total loss\u2014Sale by master\u2014Notice of abandonment.\nT., respondent, was the owner of a vessel called the \"Susan,\" insured for $800 under a valued time policy of marine insurance, underwritten by G., the appellant, and others. The vessel was stranded and sold, and T. brought an action against G. to recover as for a total loss. From the evidence, it appeared that the vessel stranded on the 6th July, 1876, near Port George, in the County of Antigonish, adjoining the County of Guysboro', N. S., where the owner resided. The master employed surveyors, and on their recommendation, confirmed by the judgment of the master, the vessel was advertised for sale on the following day, and sold on the 11th July for $105. The captain did not give any notice of abandonment, and did not endeavor to get off the vessel. The purchasers immediately got the vessel off, &c., had her made tight, and taken to Pictou, and repaired, and they afterwards used her in trading and carrying passengers.\nHeld, on appeal, that the sale by the master was not justifiable, and that the evidence failed to show any excuse for the master not communicating with his owner so as to require him to give notice of abandonment, if he intended to rely upon the loss as total.\nPer Gwynne, J., that it is a point fairly open to enquiry in a court of appeal, whether or not, as in the present case, the inferences drawn from the evidence by the judge who tried the case without a jury, were the reasonable and proper inferences to be drawn from the facts.\nThis was an action brought by the respondent in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, against the appellant to recover the amount insured by the appellant, as one of the underwriters upon a policy of Marine Insurance issued by the Ocean Marine Insurance Association of Halifax, upon the schooner \"Susan,\" belonging to the respondent, alleged to have been totally lost by a peril insured against.\nThe appellant having appeared and pleaded in said action, the same was tried before the Honorable Mr. Justice James, one of the assistant Justices of said Court, at the sittings of said Court, at Halifax, in November, 1878, who gave judgment in favour of the Respondent for the amount claimed by him.\nA rule nisi to set aside the judgment so given was taken out by the appellant, and at the last term of the Supreme Court at Halifax was argued before four of the Judges of that Court sitting in banco, a majority of whom subsequently gave judgment discharging said rule nisi with costs.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows: \u2014\nOn the 6th of July, 1876, the vessel in question having been caught in a gale of wind, was driven on shore by the fury of the storm, and stranded at or near Cape George in the County of Antigonish, N.S., and at low water persons could walk round her.\nThe Captain immediately went off to Antigonish (four hours journey), noted his protest and telegraphed to Messrs. Harrington & Co., of Halifax, who had acted as agents for the owners in effecting the insurance\u2014\"Schooner Susan on shore Cape George, likely a total wreck.\" Messrs. Harrington showed this telegram to the agents of the underwriters on the 7th of July.\nOn the 7th of July the Captain returned to the vessel, and caused her to be surveyed by three persons, who reported that it would be useless attempting to repair her or get her off, and thereupon condemned her as totally unseaworthy, and recommended that she and her hull and materials should be sold for the benefit of all concerned.\nThe owner of the vessel resided at the time at Isaac's Harbor; this is in the County of Guysborough, Nova Scotia, the county adjoining that within which the vessel was stranded.\nThe place where the vessel was stranded was within from four to eight hours drive from the town of Antigonish, the shire town of the county of that name, which was in telegraphic communication with Halifax, and with Pictou, the shire town of the adjoining county of that name. There was also a tri-weekly mail to and from the town of Antigonish.\nThe vessel valued at $1200, insured for $800, was advertised on Saturday, July 8, to be sold, and was sold on Tuesday following, July 11th, for about $105.\nThe weather continued fine from the day after the stranding until the sale; there was no evidence that any effort was made to save or get off the vessel before the sale, but on the other hand, the captain admits that he made no effort to get her off, and one of the surveyors, Donald McEachren, stated that \"If weather kept fine, he allowed she could be got off.\"\nThe evidence as to the actual damage done to the vessel was conflicting; but she undoubtedly continued to exist as a vessel at the time of sale, and on that day a contract was made to take her off for $35. She was got off by the following Saturday, July 15th. She was made tight on the shore and then taken to Pictou and there put on the Marine Slip; was repaired, and for over a year was used as a packet between Antigonish and Pictou, and made one trip to Halifax, during which time she carried freight and passengers.\nMr. Rigby, Q.C., for appellant:\nIn view of the uncontradicted facts and under the authority of Knight v. Faith[1] and Kaltenback v. McKenzie[2] I contend there was no total loss of the \"Susan,\" actual or constructive, no notice of abandonment having been given. It was for the plaintiff to make out all the elements, at the time the vessel was sold, of an actual total loss. In this he has entirely failed.\n[Ritchie, C J.: We will call on the other side to see if they can make out a case.]\nMr. Gormully and Mr. Graham for respondent:\nIt is submitted that this case turned, as appears by the opinion of the Court below, on questions of fact, such as, was the loss total or only constructively total; was the sale by the master justifiable under all the circumstances so as to pass the property in the wreck. Unless, therefore, this Court is of opinion that there was no evidence at all to support this verdict, this case is not appealable.\nThe objection and the only objection to the verdict, urged by the appellant in the Court below, was that the loss was not an actual total loss but a constructive total loss, that consequently to entitle the respondent to recover as for a total loss, it was necessary to prove notice of abandonment to the underwriters.\nNow, whether the vessel in this case was an actual total loss or a constructive total loss, whether she was a mere wreck or still a ship, though in a damaged condition, was a question of fact which the tribunal of fact has disposed of in the respondent's favor. Having regard to the injuries the ship had received, her position on the rocks, the imminence of the danger of her complete destruction, there was ample evidence to go to the jury that she was an actual total loss. But if there were only a scintilla of evidence to go to the jury as to this fact then this Court cannot review the finding of the jury.\nSee Cobequid Marine Insurance Co. v. Barteaux[3]; Cambridge v. Anderdon[4]; Roux v. Salvador[5]; Farnworth v. Hyde[6]; Kaltenbach v. Mackenzie[7].\nBy the text writers and authorities there appears to be a sort of middle case between an actual total loss and a constructive total loss. This middle case arises where the ship, though something more than a mere congeries of planks is in a position of imminent peril, and where, by the Maritime law, an implied power to sell her for the benefit of all concerned is reposed in her master. Arnold treats such a case where a sale takes place, under actual total loss. The facts of the case bring it within this principle.\nSee Arnold[8]; Idle v. Royal[9].\nIf it be found that the master was justified in selling the ship and the notice of the loss of the ship and the sale reached the owner at the same time, then we contend, on the latest authorities, that no notice of abandonment would be necessary. This also has been found as a fact.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff seeks to claim in this case as for a total loss. I think the evidence most clearly shows that the sale was wholly unjustifiable. There was no such necessity as justified it. The master could, and clearly should, have communicated with his owners. I do not think it necessary to go through the evidence in this case, as my brother Gwynne has reviewed the evidence at length in his judgment, and I entirely concur with him. It cannot be denied that there was not an actual total loss, and there being no justification for the sale, no abandonment, in fact nothing to make this a constructive total loss, the plaintiff, claiming a total loss, and declining to claim for a partial loss, should have been non-suited, or a verdict entered against him.\nFOURNIER, and TASCHEREAU, J J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur in the view expressed by the Chief Justice that there is no evidence to show there was a total loss. The vessel was lost in July, the Captain had an opportunity to communicate with the owners, he did not do so, but sold the vessel for a nominal sum. She was immediately got off and repaired, and afterwards carried freight and passengers.\nUnder such circumstances we must hold that notice of abandonment should have been given. The owner is always in such cases answerable for the neglect of the Captain. If the law left it to the owner to say that he had notice of the loss only after the sale, then all the owner need do, would be to instruct his captain to use his own judgment when a loss took place and never refer to him. Such is not the law. Under the circumstances of the case I am of opinion there is no evidence to justify the sale, in fact there is no evidence that the vessel was ever in actual danger.\nNow as the plaintiff insisted on a total loss, he cannot succeed. He declined to recover for a partial loss. We must hold that he is not entitled to recover in this action for a total loss when no notice of abandonment was given, even if otherwise entitled to our judgment.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis case raises no question as to the weight to be attributed to the finding of a Judge, who tries a case without a Jury, upon matters of fact, for here the Judge's finding is the result of inferences drawn by him from evidence as to which there is no dispute, and in that case, inasmuch as the question is whether or not the inferences so drawn are the reasonable and proper inferences to be drawn from the facts proved, the rule is that this raises a point which is fairly open to inquiry in a court of appeal.\nNow in this case, as it appears to me, the learned Judge before whom the trial took place and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the majority of which Court sustained the verdict which was rendered for the plaintiff as in the case of a total loss, have proceeded upon the basis that the loss of the schooner was a constructive and not an actual total loss. The learned Judge who rendered the verdict says that he considered the vessel as she lay on the beach at Cape George before the sale, taking into consideration the risk to which she was exposed, to be of no value as a ship, and that therefore he was of opinion there was a total loss, and accordingly he found for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. In the judgment given by him in the court above, upon the rule nisi to set aside this verdict, he says:\nSeveral defences were set out in the pleas, but the only question really at issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover for a total or a partial loss. A partial loss was not denied, but the plaintiff's counsel contended that the circumstances of the case were such as to constitute a constructive total loss which was denied by the defendant's counsel.\nAnd after repeating his opinion as above expressed in his verdict he explains his meaning more fully by adding:\nShe was a ship, it is true, in outward form after the accident, but never a good one. The purchasers made nothing of their bargain, and when she went on shore some eighteen months after, although she was insured and might have been got off she was not considered worth the expense. And finally he says:\nI think there is sufficient evidence given by the plaintiff that the vessel could not have been got off and repaired so as to be a good vessel except at an expense exceeding her value, if at all, and if not the Plaintiff had a right under the cases to treat her as a total loss.\nBut for the words \"so as to be a good vessel\" the learned Judge would have in precise terms applied the test which distinguishes a constructive from an actual total loss, that question being whether the damage sustained can be so far repaired as to keep it a ship, though perhaps not so good a ship as it was before, without expending on it more than it was worth. If she was repairable there was no actual total loss, but if she was repairable only at an expense exceeding her value when repaired, then the loss was a constructive, not an actual total loss[10].\nIn view of the evidence, which excludes in this case all idea of an actual total loss, and of the above observations of the learned Judge in support of the opinion he had formed at the trial, we must fairly conclude that the learned Judge proceeded upon the basis of there having been established to his satisfaction a constructive total loss only. The learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, also plainly treated the case as one of constructive total loss only, and he was of opinion that the circumstances appearing in evidence constituted a waiver of notice of abandonment.\nA point was argued before us which does not appear to have been discussed in the court below, namely: that the verdict for the plaintiff as for a total loss is sustainable upon the ground that the sale was justified under the circumstances appearing in evidence, and that the plaintiff did not receive notice of the loss until after the sale when he received notice of both at the same time, and that therefore notice of abandonment was useless and unnecessary. The loss, if total, being only constructively not actually so, it cannot be, and has not been, disputed, that notice of abandonment was necessary to be given, unless the non giving it was excused in law, or was waived in fact, by the defendants, or must in law be treated as having been so waived, under the circumstances appearing in evidence.\nThat notice of abandonment was not given is admitted.\nThe questions therefore which we have to determine appear to me to be, 1st. Was there any actual waiver by the defendant of notice of abandonment, or is it a proper inference to draw from the evidence that the defendant did waive such notice? 2nd. Does the evidence establish that the sale by the master was justified in view of the circumstances under which that sale took place?\nIt is not pretended that there is any evidence of an express waiver by the defendants of notice of abandonment, but, as I understand the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, he rested his judgment that the notice was waived upon the ground that he found from the evidence\u2014\nThat the defendants had a competent agent on the spot who was left without instructions though he wrote for them and was cognizant of all that was taking place.\nMr. Justice James, who tried the case, says, in his judgment upon this point:\nThe captain, after examining the vessel next morning and taking such advice a she could get on the spot, went to Antigonish where he noted his protest and telegraphed to the vessel's agents in Halifax who at once informed the defendant's company, but did not give notice of abandonment. They telegraphed to their agent, Mr. Whidden, who, on 8th July, proceeded to the wreck and examined her. He knew she had been examined by the Surveyors; saw the advertisement of sale; he also conversed with the captain and abstained from cautioning him that the vessel ought not to be sold; he and another witness (McDonald) while not differing materially from the five witnesses for plaintiff as to the facts expressed an opinion at the trial that she could have been got off for a small sum and rendered perfectly tight, but at the time he expressed no such opinion to the Master as I think he as the agent of the underwriters ought to have done if he thought he was about to do wrong.\nAnd again:\nHe promised Captain Sullivan to communicate with the Insurers by letter and by telegram. He telegraphed to them from Antigonish and if they had answered by telegraph instead of by letter Whidden could have been at the sale with their instructions; as it was the master expected him and waited for him at the sale.\n\"Apart from the other evidence,\" he adds,\nI consider that the conduct of the Insurers under the circumstances in neglecting to advise the master when their agent had virtually undertaken that they would do so, and had encouraged him to proceed with the sale by promising to be present, to be a very material circumstance for the consideration of a Jury. It appears to me that he had a right under the circumstances to assume that they agreed with him in his opinion as to the sale of the vessel and were satisfied that the sale should be held, and my opinion at the trial was and still is largely influenced by these facts.\nIt appeared in evidence that Mr. Whidden above referred to was only an agent for the defendants when specially employed pro re nat\u00e2. No evidence was offered as to what was the nature or extent of his agency in the particular case. It may have been simply to inspect the damage as well as he could, advise his principals and to observe what was passing so as to enable his principals to form an opinion as to whether every thing had been done by the master that should have been done under the circumstances.\nIn the above observations the learned Judge, as it appears to me, indicates the nature of the enquiry which he considered the circumstances would have rendered proper to be submitted to a Jury by the impression which he says those circumstances had made upon his own mind, namely, that the master had a right to assume that the defendants agreed with him in his opinion as to the sale of the vessel and were satisfied that the sale should be held. If indeed the evidence had shewn that Mr. Whidden had been appointed by the defendants as their agent, not only to inspect the vessel, but invested with fall power to act for them in accepting, if he should think fit, possession of the vessel as an abandoned wreck, and to do whatever he might think most for their interest, either by sale of the Wreck or otherwise, and that under such circumstances he had assented to the sale taking place under the direction of the master, there might have arisen a proper question to be submitted to a Jury \u2014whether the underwriters had not in fact accepted possession of the wreck to deal with it as they thought best for their own interests, and whether the subsequent sale by the master should not in fact be regarded as a sale by the underwriters themselves so as to preclude them from disavowing it in a suit by the owners upon the policy? But the evidence raised no such question; all that the evidence established was that the underwriters, having been notified of the fact that the vessel was aground, but having no intimation from the owner that he elected to abandon, appointed an agent to inspect the condition of the wreck who did not interfere with the master either by assenting or objecting to his proceedings. He seems to have left the master to exercise his own judgment, although informing him that he had written and telegraphed to his principals and would communicate to him any instructions he might receive, if he should receive any, before the sale which upon his own authority the master had advertised. No case has been cited in support of the proposition that under these circumstances there was any legal obligation imposed upon the defendants to notify the master whether they assented or objected to the proceedings taken by him. It was quite competent for them, if so disposed, to watch his proceedings, and the obligation rested upon him, in the event of his employers setting up a claim for a total loss, to take care to be furnished with evidence that his proceedings were conducted legally and that a sale by him was strictly warranted by the circumstances of the case.\nThere is nothing in the evidence, in my opinion, from which an inference of fact or of law can be properly drawn that the defendants waived their right to receive from the owners notice of abandonment if the owners intended to claim for a total loss; or to estop the defendants from resisting such a claim upon the ground that they had no such notice; or from insisting that the evidence failed to establish that the sale by the master was justified. And this brings me to the consideration of that question.\nMr. Justice Blackburn in Rankin vs. Potter[11] says:\nAs has often been observed, a sale by the Master is not one of the underwriters' perils and is only material as shewing that there is no longer anything which can be done to save the thing sold for whom it may concern.\nThe effect of a valid sale being conclusively to determine that neither assurers nor assured could do anything, it is of the utmost importance that an imperative necessity for the sale should exist in order to justify it.\nAccordingly, in Robertson v. Clarke[12], cited by Lord Campbell, C. J., delivering judgment in Knight v. Faith[13], it was held that it is not sufficient to shew that the sale was bon\u00e2 fide and for the benefit of all concerned, unless it also be shewn that there was urgent necessity for its being resorted to; and in Farnworth vs. Hyde[14] Bytes, J., says:\nIn all cases of alleged constructive loss where the Captain takes upon himself to sell the ship, the necessity of so doing ought to be strictly proved and the jury are not at liberty to act upon conjecture.\nNor will it be enough to shew that to sell the vessel was a prudent course for the Master to pursue. In Kaltenbach vs. McKenzie[15] Lord Justice Thesiger says:\nIf at any moment an assured who is entitled to treat a loss as a constructive total loss may at the same time absolve himself from giving notice of abandonment by selling the vessel, which although a prudent course is not a necessary one, it would lead to the greatest danger of frauds upon underwriters and, at all events, to very considerable inconvenience in reference to policies of marine insurance.\nAnd referring to the particular circumstances of that case, he says:\nAlthough it is admitted that the vessel was a constructive total loss in the sense that the cost of repairs would be greater than the value of the vessel when repaired, I cannot trace any evidence to the effect that if the sale of the vessel had been postponed for two or three or four months she would have ceased to exist in specie, or that the loss from a constructive would have become an actual total loss. If that be so, then upon principle and authority it appears to me the plaintiff is not entitled to use the fact of that sale as a reason for excusing himself from giving notice of abandonment.\nAnd in Lapraik v. Burrows[16] the law is laid down by the Privy Council thus:\nThe law as we conceive it to be settled is this\u2014that there must be a necessity for the sale, that when the master has no authority from his owner to sell he is not at liberty to sell merely because he deems it to be advantageous to his owner, but that there must be a necessity for the sale. The necessity which the law contemplates is not an absolute impossibility of getting the vessel repaired; but if the ship cannot be sent upon her voyage without repairs, and if the repairs cannot be done, except at so great and so certain a loss that no prudent man would venture to encounter it, that constitutes a case of necessity. We should be exceedingly reluctant to relax the law upon this head because it is of great importance that masters of ships should not divest their owners of their interest in those ships without due authority except they are strictly justified by the necessity of the case.\nThe like law prevails in the Courts of the United States, as will appear by reference to Hall vs. Franklin Insurance Co.[17] and Bryant v. The Commonwealth Insurance Co[18] and many other cases cited in Prince v. The Ocean Insurance Co.[19].\nAs the authority of the master is not derived from express power to sell given to him by the owner, but from the necessity of the thing when placed in the position of being unable to consult with the owner, it is obviously of the first importance to enquire as to the opportunity the master had of consulting with the owner.\nIn the American Insurance Co. vs. Center[20] it is laid down, that the master is not authorized to sell except in a case of absolute necessity, when he is not in a situation to consult with his owner and when it is necessary for him to act as agent for whom it may concern; and in Parsons on Marine Insurance[21] the rule is laid down thus:\nNor is the master at liberty to sell without notice to, or the advice of, the owners, provided he be so near them that he can delay the sale for this purpose without endangering greater loss.\nThe law as laid down by Mr. Parsons is approved in the Privy Council in Cobequid Marine Insurance Co. vs. Barteaux[22] where Sir Henry Keating, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, says:\nWith reference to the law upon the subject there seems now to be no doubt whatever; and it cannot be questioned that the master, under circumstances of stringent necessity, may effect a sale of the vessel so as thereby to affect the insurers. That he can only do so in cases of such stringent necessity has been laid down in a great variety of cases unnecessary more particularly to be referred to as they are well summarised in the work of Mr. Parsons at page 147, where he also takes the distinction between the rule that a sale is justified by stringent necessity only, and what was sometimes supposed to be a rule, that the sale would be justified if made under circumstances that a prudent owner uninsured would have made it. He distinguishes between them and establishes upon satisfactory authority that whilst what a prudent owner would have done under the circumstances if uninsured may illustrate the question as to how far there was a stringent necessity for selling, yet that the rule is that there must be a stringent necessity. In Arnold on Insurance the circumstances that will justify the master in selling seem to be well and clearly put and to be quite borne out by the authorities that are cited in its support. Mr. Arnold says, the exercise however of this power, that is, the power of the master to sell, is most jealously watched by the English Courts and rigorously confined to cases of extreme necessity, such a necesssity, that is, as leaves the master no alternative, as a prudent and skilful man acting bon\u00e2 fide for the best interest of all concerned and with the best and soundest judgment that can be formed under the circumstances, except to sell the ship as she lies. If he come to this conclusion hastily, either without sufficient examination into the actual state of the ship, or without having previously made every exertion in his power with the means then at his disposal to extricate her from the peril, or to raise funds for the repair, he will not be justified in selling her, although the danger at the time appear exceedingly imminent. That seems to be the true rule to apply in these cases where it is most important to confine within strict limits the power of a master to sell the ship.\nApplying then the principle of these cases to the facts of this, we find that on the 6th July, 1876, the vessel while on her voyage from Guysboro to Pictou was stranded at Cape George, which is distant about 25 miles from Pictou, where a tug boat could have been procured if required; about 20 miles from Antigonish, where there was telegraphic communication with Halifax, and about 50 or 60 miles from Isaac's Harbour where the plaintiff resided. On the morning of the 7th July, the master went to Antigonish and telegraphed news of the disaster to the Messrs. Harrington & Co., who as the plaintiff's agent had effected for him the insurance upon the vessel. It is not alleged that they had any authority from the plaintiff enabling them to bind him by a notice of abandonment, and if they had, it is plain that they did not exercise it, for no notice was given. On the same day the master placed the vessel in the hands of one Cunningham, an auctioneer at Antigonish, as his, the master's agent. Cunningham appointed three persons named Graham, McMillan and McEachren to survey her, of these, two were called as witnesses upon the trial, one of whom, namely McEachren, although he said that he did not see any chance of getting the vessel off in the condition she was and taking the risk of the weather, admitted that if the weather kept fine she could have been got off. He, however, said that he did not see any broken timber or broken plank except where the hole was; the other, McMillan, who described himself as a farmer, said that he had had no experience with vessels, and he says that he saw no chance of getting her off. They all three, however, signed a report to the effect that\nThere is no prospect of the said schooner ever being floated off where she now lies. That it would be useless to attempt repairing her or getting her off, and we therefore condemn the said schooner as totally unseaworthy and recommend that the said schooner, her hull and materials, be sold for the benefit of all concerned.\nUpon this report, Cunningham, who describes himself as agent of the captain, whom he understood to be the owner, gave notice of sale of the vessel for the following Tuesday, the 11th July, when she was sold by Cunningham (acting as auctioneer) to one Mullins. The account given by Cunningham of the sale is as follows. He says:\u2014\nJohn Graham (the third surveyor) and I were owners of the vessel afterwards. I obtained an interest in her on the day of sale. The morning of the sale Capt. Mullins was lying off the wharf, and I asked him to buy her. He said he had no means. I had asked Graham before. My object was to sell to the best advantage. Graham did not agree to take an interest before the sale. I told Mullins if he bought her I would back him.\nThat Mr. Cunningham did not think he was selling the vessel as a wreck, but as a vessel capable of navigating the Ocean appears from his own statement, for he says:\nAfter the sale I induced Graham to take an interest, as he and I had some business requiring a vessel of that class. Mullins was to have an interest too: this was arranged after the sale on the same day.\nShe was accordingly sold by Cunningham to Mullins for $157.50 leaving after the deduction of all charges the sum of $52.53 in the hands of Cunningham after the sale, and on the same day Mullins gave up to Cunningham and Graham the interest which he had acquired by the sale to him. He in fact, as shewn by the evidence, purchased for Cunningham and at his request., As to the damage which the vessel had in fact sustained Cunningham says:\nI don't think she was very much logged, can't tell if her timbers were affected. I think 3 or 4 of the butts were started. There was a hole in her forward where she struck a rock, don't know of any other damages.\nAnd he adds:\nOn the same afternoon as the sale had taken place we employed McDougall to take her off for $35 for labor only, we supplying all materials, they gathered some of the stuff that day, Tuesday, and she was got off by Saturday.\nIt thus appears that with the appliances there at hand she was got off at an expense of $35. What it cost to repair is not stated; but from the above description of the damage, and from what Cunningham further says, the expense does not appear to have been great. He says:\nSome of the repairs were done before she was got off. She was caulked on the shore, then taken to a wharf and partly repaired, then taken to Pictou and put on the slip. Her timbers were not rotten\u2014her bottom was perfectly sound and good when we tried her and bored into her upper timbers the next year.\nHe adds:\nThe started butts were spiked down again and a new piece of plank was put where there was found a hole from striking on the rock. Then it appears that Cunningham and Graham used her that season and the following one as a packet between Antigonish and Pictou, and she was lost in October, 1877, and as Cunningham did not know the vessel before she was stranded in July, 1876, he cannot say whether after the repairs then done to her she was or not in as good condition as she had been in before she was stranded.\nThe Master in his evidence admits that he did not make any effort to get her off. Nor did he try to get assistance to get her off, neither did he communicate with his owner, and he does not give any reason in excuse of his not having done so. Thus it appears that although the vessel lay from the 6th to the 11th July on the beach from which she could have been and in fact was removed at an expense of $35, the Master made no attempt whatever to get her off and made no communication to the owner, who was distant only about 50 or 60 miles from the place where the vessel lay.\nNow, wholly irrespective of the above evidence as to the circumstances attending the conduct of the sale, which, whatever may have been the motive for such conduct, can only be mentioned to be condemned; but wholly apart from that, it is apparent that the evidence fails to shew any excuse for the master not communicating with his owner, so as to enable him to give notice of abandonment if he intended to rely upon the loss as total; it fails to shew that, having regard to the cost of repairs, the loss could have been converted from a partial into a constructive total loss, or that notice of abandonment would in this case, any more than in Knight v. Faith, have entitled the plaintiff to recover as for a total loss, or have deprived the defendant of the right to dispute the validity of the sale; it utterly failed in short to shew those attendant circumstances which are absolutely necessary to establish that urgent necessity for the sale which alone can justify a sale by the Master so as to subject the insurers to liability as for a total loss.\nThe Appeal must therefore be allowed and the rule in the Court below made absolute for a new trial, and as it is not suggested that any better evidence could be given, and as it appears that the insurers have been always willing to deal liberally with the plaintiff upon the basis of a partial loss, which is all that under the evidence he is entitled to, I think that the appellant should have the costs of this his successful appeal and that the rule in the Court below should be for a new trial without costs.\nThe circumstances of this case differ from those of Cobequid Marine Insurance Co. v. Barteaux[23] where both sets of costs were ordered to abide the event of the new trial, because the verdict there was deemed to be only against the weight of the evidence. Here the evidence wholly fails to justify the sale.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: S. G. Rigby.\nSolicitor for respondent: N. H. Meagher.\n[1] 15 Ad. & E. N.S. 647.\n[2] 3 C.

The father had allowed the plaintiff to occupy 100 acres of the 400 acres, and he was to look after the whole and to pay the taxes upon them, to take what timber he required for his own use, or to help him to pay the taxes, but not to give any timber to any one else, or allow any one else to take it. He settled in 1849 upon the south half of Lot 1 in the 13th Concession. Having got a deed for the same in November, 1864, he sold these 100 acres to one M.K. In December following he moved to the north half of this lot No. 1, and he remained there ever since. The father died in January, 1877, devising the north half of the north half, the land in dispute, to the defendant, and the south half of the north half to the plaintiff. The defendant, claiming the north 50 acres of the lot by the father\u2019s will, entered upon it, where upon the plaintiff brought trespass, claiming title thereto by possession. The learned Judge at the trial found that the plaintiff entered into possession and so continued, merely as his father\u2019s caretaker and agent, and he entered a verdict for the defendant. There was evidence that within the last seven years, before the trial, the defendant as agent for the father was sent up to remove plaintiff off the land because he had allowed timber to be taken off the land, and that plaintiff undertook to cut no more and to pay the taxes and to give up possession whenever required to do so by his father.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the evidence established the creation of a new tenancy at will within ten years. Per Gwynne, J., that there was also abundant evidence from which the judge at the trial might fairly conclude as he did, that the relationship of servant, agent, or caretaker, in virtue of which the respondent first acquired the possession, continued throughout.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal of Ontario. The action, which was for trespass to realty, was brought by the respondent Michael Ryan in the Court of Common Pleas for Ontario, and was tried at the Fall Assizes of 1878, at Berlin, before the Honorable Chief Justice Hagarty, without a jury, when a verdict was entered for the defendant with leave reserved to move to enter a verdict for the plaintiff for such amount of damages as the Court might deem proper. In Michaelmas Term following, a rule nisi was granted calling upon the defendant to show cause why the verdict for the defendant obtained at the trial should not be set aside, and a verdict entered for the plaintiff for such amount as the Court might deem the plaintiff entitled to recover pursuant to the Common Law Procedure Act, and to the leave reserved at the trial, on the grounds that the verdict is contrary to law and evidence, and that the plaintiff established a title by the Statute of Limitations under the evidence given at the trial, and that such possessory title to the land in question was made out as against the plaintiff\u2019s father, the late Thomas Ryan, under whose will the defendant claimed, and that on the evidence the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict.\nIn the same Term the rule was argued, and judgment, which was reserved, was delivered on the eleventh day of February, 1879, when, the Court being equally divided, the rule dropped.\nOn the seventh day of March, 1879, the Court again delivered judgment discharging the rule nisi, without costs, for the purposes of appeal. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal, when the appeal was allowed with costs, and a verdict ordered to be entered for the plaintiff (respondent), for $10.00 damages.\nThe facts and pleadings will be found in the judgments hereinafter given[1].\nMr. King for appellant:\u2014\nThe only question to be determined is whether the respondent (the plaintiff) has acquired a title to the locus in quo by length of possession. The question is one of facts or inferences of fact, and I shall have to refer to the evidence.\nI contend that the respondent was the servant, agent, or caretaker of his father, the owner of the land, and that his occupation was in fact the possession of the father, and not adversely to him, or as tenant under him.\n[The learned Counsel then reviewed the evidence bearing on this point.]\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, before whom this action was tried without a jury, found as a fact that \u201cwhatever occupation plaintiff had of this land was acting as agent and caretaker for his father, and, as between the father and a stranger, I think plaintiff\u2019s possession would be the father\u2019s possession. On the evidence it seems the father used to send up money to pay the taxes till 7 or 8 years ago. He then said, knowing plaintiff was using it, that he must pay the taxes for the use of the land. I find as a fact that plaintiff, even to his father\u2019s death in 1877, did not occupy or claim it as his own against his father, but merely as acting for him, living on the south 50 acres and using this north 50 (now in suit,) clearing some of it, taking timber off some part and protecting it.\u201d\nThis finding was approved of by Mr. Justice Gwynne, then one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, and subsequently by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal.\nIn so far as the evidence on this, or in fact any other, branch of the case is conflicting, the appellant would merely refer to the well known rule which is indicated by Mr. Justice Patterson where he says: \u201cThe solution of these questions depended upon evidence, which was conflicting, and the details of which have been discussed in the judgments. From that discussion it is obvious that the reliance to be placed on the testimony of one witness or another became a very material element in the decision. It was, therefore, a case in which the opinion of the Judge who heard and saw the witnesses would have been of great value, and ought to have been conclusive whenever the choice lay between conflicting versions of the same incident.\u201d\nThe following cases all bear on this branch of the argument:\u2014Perry v. Henderson[2]; Quincey v. Caniff[3]; Silverthorn v. Teal[4]; Heyland v. Scott[5]; Ellis v. Crawford[6]; Moore v. Doherty[7]; Allen v. England[8], quoted in Keffer v. Keffer[9].\nThen if, on the facts, the proposition already contended for that the respondent was the servant, and not the tenant, of his father the testator, is not the proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence, it should be assumed that the respondent obtained possession under such circumstances as to create a tenancy between the testator and him, such tenancy would be a tenancy at will; and such tenancy at will was determined, and a new tenancy created, by what took place between the appellant, as the testator\u2019s agent, and the respondent in the year 1872, before the eleven years had expired, and this constitutes a terminus a quo since which sufficient time has not elapsed to constitute a statutable bar.\nAssuming therefore a tenancy at will, the tenant not having any rent to pay on the original taking of possession, there is clearly evidence of an agreement made between the appellant, acting as his father\u2019s agent, and the respondent, that, from the time of their interview, the respondent would pay as rental the taxes on the adjoining property of his father. This was a new tenancy, which, if followed by payment of the taxes, would become a tenancy from year to year,\u2014and there is evidence that subsequently the taxes were paid by the respondent. Mrs. Ryan, after speaking to the father of the appellant\u2019s business up to the time the new arrangement was made, proceeds: \u201cThe old man told me he could not trust Patrick (the appellant) to pay taxes and get the receipt for it. He asked me if I would look after 14 and pay the taxes. I paid the taxes several times.\u201d\nThe cases of Doe dem. Stanway v. Rock[10]; Locke v. Matthews[11]; Hodgson v. Hooper[12], shew that such an arrangement or agreement would constitute a new tenancy.\nAnother view of the case presented by the evidence may be more in accord with the reading that some may be inclined to give to it. From the first taking possession of this half lot in the latter part of 1864, until the testator\u2019s death, there were, from time to time and from year to year, dealings between the testator and the respondent, which establishes that the original tenancy at will (and for the purposes of this contention a tenancy at will is conceded) continued, the tenant acknowledging as he did from year to year that he was but a tenant at will, and that he was ready at any moment to give up possession to his landlord. This, it may be said, cannot avail unless under the 13th sec., of the Statute of Limitations, the acknowledgment is in writing. But it is insisted that the distinction is this: If the tenancy at will by force of the statute is terminated, so that the tenant, ceasing to hold as tenant, holds adversely to the true owner, then the acknowledgment, in order to interrupt the statute running, must be in writing. If on the other hand the tenant, by continual dealings or in other ways, acknowledges the title of the owner and his position as tenant at will, so that the statute does not operate to terminate the tenancy, the acknowledgment need not be in writing; the statute has never commenced to run: Foster v. Emerson[13].\nMr. Bowlby, for respondent:\u2014\nIn 1863, plaintiff leased to one Richardson the land in question, and in 1864 plaintiff put Richardson off the land at great cost to himself and then took possession of the land not as caretaker, but for his own use. I contend that on the 3rd of December, 1864, most certainly the statute began to run. The actual occupation of this land by the plaintiff on the 3rd December, 1864, did not begin with the permission of his father, who (according to the evidence of the defendant and his witnesses) was always opposed to the plaintiff\u2019s occupation of this land. The plaintiff was not let into possession as a tenant at will in 1864, but he then entered as a trespasser, holding adversely. If the plaintiff did not then enter as a trespasser, then he must be held to have been in possession as a tenant at will before that date, and in that view, the statute began to run on the 17th September, 1850. The plaintiff\u2019s father, after December, 1864, was merely passive and simply allowed the plaintiff to remain in possession after he became aware of his actual occupation thereof. There is nothing in the evidence to show that subsequent to Richardson\u2019s occupation of this land in 1864, the plaintiff was ever bound by any agreement, either by parol or by deed, to hold this land at the will of his father as lessor. A statement to the plaintiff by his father, long after the plaintiff was in adverse possession as a trespasser, to the effect that plaintiff must leave the land whenever any of his brothers wanted it (even if made) without proof of anything having been said in reply by the plaintiff, would not create a tenancy at will, and it is submitted that no tenancy at will existed between the plaintiff and his father after the 3rd December, 1864, and that the statute began to run on that date, and there having been no written acknowledgment of title under C.S.U.C., cap, 88, sec. 15, the statute did not cease to run by reason of the expression first made by the father about Christmas, 1865, of his willingness that the plaintiff might build upon and continue to occupy the lands in question till the plaintiff would get another place, and other similar expressions made by the father at other times, and that such expressions on the father\u2019s part would not create a tenancy at will between him and the plaintiff, nor would the conversation between the parties in the presence of Clark, in 1871, have that effect, indeed nothing would stop the running of the statute except a written acknowledgment of title, and it is therefore submitted that the plaintiff acquired a title by possession on the 3rd December, 1874, under 28 Vic. c. 16, (Vide R.S.O.[14]; Coke Litt. 55 a; Banning\u2019s Limitation of Actions[15]; Sugden\u2019s Real Property Statutes[16].\nIf it should be held that a tenancy at will was created by the letter of the 14th January, 1865, from the father, in which he was silent as to the fact that plaintiff had gone into possesssion and actual occupation of the land, although knowing this fact from the plaintiff\u2019s letter to him and from information received by him from Kennedy, or if a tenancy at will should be held to have been created by virtue of the assent given by the father to the plaintiff\u2019s occupation of this land, in his conversation with the plaintiff or his wife about Christmas, 1865, then such tenancy at will must have commenced on the 3rd December 1864, or on the 14th January 1865, or else at Christmas, 1865, and for the purposes of this action it is immaterial which of those dates be taken as the date of the commencement of such tenancy at will, if any such tenancy ever existed, and the right of action under the statute[17] must be deemed to have first accrued to the father one year after such dates, being at latest Christmas, 1866, at which time the alleged tenancy at will, under which the plaintiff\u2019s actual occupation and dwelling or residing upon this land began, must, for the purposes of the bar of the statute, be deemed to have determined, and the statute then began to run, and the operation of the statute, having so begun to run, can be stopped only by the creation of a fresh tenancy at will after the determination of the original tenancy at will, and within the period of limitation, and so the plaintiff\u2019s title became complete at Christmas, 1876, at the latest, unless before that date the original tenancy were determined and a fresh tenancy created, and it is submitted that a conclusion could not be drawn from the evidence that there was legally any determination of the tenancy at will by what took place between the plaintiff and defendant in the presence of Clark, some seven years before the trial (in or about 1871), and that no new tenancy between the plaintiff and his father was then created, and that the circumstances attending that interview between the parties to this action did not constitute a new terminus a quo, Doe d. Perry v. Henderson[18]; Keffer v. Keffer[19]; Gray v, Richford[20]; Doe d. Baker v. Coombes[21]; Truesdell v. Cook[22]; Williams v. McDonald[23]; and especially Day v. Day[24]; Banning\u2019s Limitation of Actions[25]; Foster v. Emerson[26] relied upon, is overruled by Truesdell v. Cook22. As to whether a fresh tenancy at will was created some seven years before the trial, between the plaintiff and the defendant as agent for his father, although the defendant alone said there was a promise then made by the plaintiff that he would pay the taxes in future, if left on the land, yet in this he is contradicted not only by the plaintiff but also by his own witness, Clark. In the letter of the 14th January, 1865, written by the father to the plaintiff, after he, the father, knew from the plaintiff\u2019s letter to him, and from Kennedy, that the plaintiff was then living on this land now in dispute, and that in consequence thereof the plaintiff would always be obliged to pay the taxes to avoid a distress, the father says \u201cit is the last taxes I will pay on it,\u201d indicating thereby that he threw upon the plaintiff one of the burdens of ownership, that of paying the taxes from that date, and consistently with this letter the land in dispute was ever afterwards assessed in the name of the plaintiff only, who thereafter was alone liable to pay such taxes. It is submitted that the alleged agreement or promise to pay the taxes is clearly disproved by the evidence, and that even if such an agreement had ever really existed it would not have made any difference, because prim\u00e2 facie the plaintiff, as the occupant of the land, was bound to pay the taxes. See the observations on this head of Richards, C.J., in Williams v. McDonald[27]; also, the observations of Robinson, C.J., in Doe d. Henderson[28], which was a case in almost all respects resembling the present case, and in which it was held that the running of the statute was not interrupted by the fact that the father had, during the period of limitation, required the son to pay the taxes for him, which the son had done. If it were agreed (although it was not proved) that the plaintiff should pay the taxes on the 200 acres in the 14th concession as an uncertain yearly rent for the 100 acres in the 13th concession after the 14th January, 1865, (as intimated in the father\u2019s letter) then there is no evidence that he paid such taxes during the period of limitation[29].\nThe view taken of the language of the statute (R.S.O. c. 108, sec. 5, sub-sec. 7,) by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal, is not justified by authority, but on the contrary is in direct antagonism to a long line of authority, both in this country and in England. It is difficult to conceive that the legislature intended to make new bargains for parties, and where it is agreed that there shall be a tenancy at will without any fixed period, to say that the parties are not in the relative positions they have agreed they shall be, but are under an entirely different arrangement\u2014the creature of the statute. The correct view appears to be that held by all the other judges of the Court of Appeal, that the tenancy at will determined at the end of the year for the purposes of the bar of the statute only and not for all purposes.\nMr. King in reply:\u2014 The respondent starts out with the statement that there was some new arrangement in 1864, all I can say this is not borne out by the evidence. As to the case of Truesdell v. Cook[30], it is not very difficult to distinguish it from this case, for here we say that from the acts and dealings of the parties a new tenancy was created. An arrangement made with the agent of the owner of the property is proved, and there was no such evidence in Truesdell v. Cook.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe declaration sets forth that the defendant broke and entered certain land of the plaintiff, called the northerly half of lot number one, in the thirteenth concession, western section, of the township of Wellesley, in the County of Waterloo, and Province of Ontario, and cut down and removed from off the said lot, and applied to his own use, a large number of timber and other trees standing, growing and being upon the said land.\nPleas\u20141. Not guilty. 2. Land was not the plaintiff\u2019s as alleged. 3. Land was the freehold of the defendant.\n4. Did what is complained of by the plaintiff\u2019s leave.\nThe plaintiff joined issue on the defendant\u2019s pleas.\nThe trial took place before the Hon. Mr. Chief Justice Hagarty, without a jury, at Berlin, on the 24th day of September, 1878.\nThe dispute was confined to the south 50 acres of the north 100.\nHagarty, C.J., at the trial found as follows:\u2014\nFor the present I enter verdict for the defendant. * * *\nThe difficulty arises as to the effect of this occupation for over 10 years before the bringing of this action, and that will require serious consideration. The claim to these 50 acres seems very unjust. The plaintiff never was promised over 100 acres which he got and sold in 1859, and his father, as I understand, devised the south 50 acres of this half lot to him in addition. Whatever occupation plaintiff had of this land was acting as agent and caretaker for his father, and as between the father and a stranger I think plaintiff\u2019s possession would be the father\u2019s possession. On the evidence it seems the father used to send up money to pay the taxes till 7 or 8 years ago, he then said, knowing plaintiff was using it, that he must pay the taxes for the use of the land. I find as a fact that plaintiff, even to his father\u2019s death in 1877, did not occupy or claim it as his own against his father, but merely as acting for him living on the south 50 acres and using this north 50 (now in suit) clearing some of it, taking timber off some part and protecting it. Within the 10 years it is sworn by defendant that he was sent by his father to complain to plaintiff of his cutting timber, &c., and told him so, and plaintiff promised to forbear and to pay the taxes if he was left on this place until the father would want it (see defendant\u2019s evidence on this head).\nIn Michaelmas term following, a rule nisi was granted.\nOn the 11th of February, 1879, the Court delivered judgment, when the court was equally divided in opinion, and the rule nisi dropped. And on the seventh day of March, 1879, the court again delivered judgment, discharging the said rule nisi without costs, for the purposes of appeal.\nOf the judgments delivered on the 11th February, 1879, Wilson, C.J., was of opinion that the plaintiff \u201cwas not his father\u2019s servant or agent as to the land which he held in possession. He was a trespasser, if he were there wrongfully, or a tenant at will, if he were there rightfully, but he was not a caretaker of that land. He and he alone was in the sole and beneficial occupation of it. The first question then is, whether the plaintiff was a trespasser or a tenant at will.\u201d\nAfter summing up the evidence on this point the learned Chief Justice says: \u201cIt is quite clear to me then, the plaintiff was not a trespasser and wrong-doer from the first. If he were to be considered so, it would not prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s claim, but it would seriously endanger the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d And he finds that the plaintiff was tenant at will to his father of the north 50 acres, as well as of the south 50 acres of the same north half lot from December, 1864. The next question he says is: \u201cWhether the plaintiff has had possession of the disputed 50 acres for a period of ten years from one year from December, 1864, that is until December, 1875, and his father was dispossessed for the same period.\u201d\nHe says: \u201cI name these dates without continuing the time to a period after December, 1875, because if the plaintiff\u2019s possession were broken at all and the father\u2019s possession restored these events happened about seven years before the trial, and the plaintiff\u2019s possession subsequent to December, 1875, would not affect the case.\n\u201cIf the plaintiff\u2019s possession were put an end to between December, 1865, and December, 1875, by his becoming tenant at will again to his father, and it is not said it was put an end to in any other manner, then the plaintiff as to the disputed fifty acres fails in his action. If it were not, he is entitled to the verdict. That question depends entirely upon the evidence.\u201d\nAfter reviewing the defendant\u2019s evidence and referring to Clarke\u2019s evidence, he says: \u201cThat is no evidence of a new tenancy at will having been created between the parties; firstly, because the plaintiff refused to leave unless he got the acre of land he asked, and secondly, because he never promised to pay the taxes.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no further point for discussion or argument than the one last mentioned, namely, whether the tenancy at will, which was determined in one year from December, 1864, when the statute began to run, a new tenancy at will was created between the father and the plaintiff at the time mentioned, seven years before the trial, and as a fact I am of opinion, for it is not a matter of law, it was not. It was neither proved nor found as a fact. \u201cIf I am to pronounce my opinion upon this evidence, which I think the learned Chief Justice ought to have pronounced, that opinion is that the verdict should be entered for the plaintiff.\u201d\nMr. Justice Galt delivered a judgment prepared by Gwynne, J., before leaving the common pleas, thoroughly concurring in it, and reading it and adopting it as his own. After saying that the whole question as it appeared to him was one of facts and of inference from facts to be decided by the court as a jury would, and after carefully considering the evidence, the learned judge says:\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, before whom this action was tried, without a jury, found as a fact that the plaintiff, down to his father\u2019s death in 1877, did not occupy, or claim to occupy, the land for which this action is brought on the north fifty acres of the north half of the lot, otherwise than as agent of his father, living on the south 50 acres of the north half, and protecting the north half, clearing some of it, taking timber off some of it, but in the character merely of agent of his father. There is much in the above evidence, as it appears to me, in support of this finding. The plaintiff\u2019s own account, that he was authorized by his father to take timber for his own use, and to cut down timber to pay the taxes upon the block, and his account of his habit every time he would go down to see his father, that is every year or every second year, of telling him everything he was doing, what he chopped, and what he cleared, and the repeated injunctions he received not to allow any stranger to take off any timber, seems to me to be very consistent with what would be natural and likely to occur in the case of a steward, caretaker, or agent, giving an account of his stewardship, which was compensated by his being allowed to live on the south 50 acres and by using the cleared part of the land for the support of his family. I am not prepared to hold that a son might not occupy land as the steward or agent of his father under an arrangement of that description, and so that the statute of limitations should not begin to run against the father. But I do not think it necessary to hold that, in this case, the occupation of the plaintiff was only as steward or agent of his father; for assuming him to have been tenant at will of his father, even from his entry in December, 1864, if the evidence given upon the part of the defendant be true, and I see no reason to doubt it, there is, as it appears, abundant evidence; the proper inference from which is that about six or seven years ago that tenancy was determined, and a new tenancy at will created between the plaintiff and his father.\nAnd after referring to the evidence bearing on this point, the learned judge says:\nNow it appears to me that there is no reason to doubt the truth of the evidence for the defence, and that there should be no difficulty in arriving at the following conclusions, namely; That about 7 years ago the plaintiff, in violation of the express orders of his father, the owner of the land, was cutting down, or permitting to be cut down, the timber upon the lot, to the injury of the land, and that the father sent up the defendant in consequence, as his agent, with authority to enter upon the land on behalf of the father, and to remove the plaintiff therefrom, unless he should come to terms satisfactorily to the father\u2019s agent; that accordingly the defendant did go up and did enter upon the land in assertion of his father\u2019s title, and did prevent persons who were cutting and taking away the timber from doing so, and that this entry and assertion of right was done by the authority of the father and enured to his benefit, and determined any tenancy at will then existing in virtue of which the plaintiff had then possession, and that thereupon the defendant saw the plaintiff and communicated to him that he had come up with power and authority to remove him, unless he would cease cutting timber and would pay the taxes, and that thereupon the plaintiff came to an understanding and agreement which was satisfactory to the defendant, as his father\u2019s agent, that if he was allowed to remain on the place until such time as his father or any person claiming under him, should want the place, he would cut no more timber and would pay the taxes, and would give up the place whenever required so to do; and so that the proper inference to draw is, that then a new tenancy at will under the father was created, to which new tenancy the plaintiff being permitted to continue thereafter upon the place is to be attributed, and that consequently the father\u2019s title was not barred in his lifetime, and, I think, what passed between the brothers after the father\u2019s death, the manner in which they dealt with the land and the reference to arbitration is more consistent with this being the true state of the case than with the plaintiff having obtained a title by the statute of limitations, acting as he would now seem to wish to represent under advice throughout with that view.\nAgain, he says:\nFor, believing as I do the evidence of the defendant, that in reply to his informing the plaintiff that he had authority from his father to remove him because of his wrongful cutting the timber and neglecting to pay the taxes, the plaintiff undertook not to cut any more timber and to pay the taxes, and to give up the possession whenever required to do so by his father, I think no other construction can be put upon this conduct than that then a new tenancy at will was agreed to in order to avert the threatened eviction, and that this did take place I see no reason to doubt.\nIf plaintiff was in as a mere trespasser, then entering into this agreement made him a tenant at will.\nIf he was in as a tenant at will, on the terms of not cutting any timber but for his own use, and of not suffering or permitting others to cut timber on the land, and he did cut on his own account, contrary to his agreement, and without the assent or authority of his father, the owner, and did suffer and permit others to cut, did he not by such acts and conduct become a trespasser, and so put an end to the tenancy at will? And the father being cognizant of this, and sending his son with authority to put him off the premises, did not the new agreement by which his father, through his agent, permitted him to remain, constitute a new tenancy? So that in any view of the case, whether originally caretaker, or trespasser, or tenant at will, he was tenant at will from the time of the last agreement.\nThe defendant, in my opinion, was not in the full possession of his lot nor occupying it as his own. On the contrary, I think that his possession was the possession of the father; he held it subject to the control of his father, and under him, as his agent or caretaker; that as his father\u2019s agent, and for his father\u2019s benefit, he kept off trespassers; that by the direction and under the authority of his father he sold timber off it to pay the taxes; that the timber he took was, by agreement with his father, confined to timber for his own use only, and was taken under the authority and by the permission of his father; and when the father heard he was cutting more than he ought, Patrick, the other son, was sent by the father to stop him and others, which he did; all of which doings in connection with the property he continuously, from time to time, if not every year, reported to his father and received from him, as owner, directions respecting the management of the property. That about seven years ago, the father hearing that, in opposition to his orders, plaintiff was cutting or permitting timber to be cut and taken off the lot, the father sent his son, the defendant, as his agent, to prevent the plaintiff and others from cutting and taking any timber, and if need be to remove the plaintiff off the land; and he did enter on the land as agent of the father, the owner, and did prevent the plaintiff and others from further cutting and taking away the timber, and did permit the defendant to continue under a new agreement, that he should be allowed to remain on the place till his father or any person claiming under him should want the place, if he would cut no more timber, and would pay the taxes, and would give up the place when required so to do. If he did not from this time continue in possession as agent or caretaker of his father, continuing in under this new agreement, he must be considered holding under the agreement as tenant at will.\nChief Justice Wilson in his judgment says:\n\u201cI am quite sensible the plaintiff\u2019s claim is a most unrighteous one. He is setting it up against his father, who has all along dealt kindly by him, and who has left him a portion of land by his will, because he could not bear so large a family should want if not further helped.\u201d\nChief Justice Moss says:\n\u201cHe took posession for his own benefit, and in order to derive his sustenance from the land as long as his father did not interfere. He commenced and continued to use it according to his own pleasure. He communi- cated to his father the fact that he had taken possession and impliedly asked his assent to continuing in possession, but he said nothing of being a bailiff or guardian of the property.\u201d\nIf this is so, did not he cease to use it according to his own pleasure, at any rate after defendant was sent to turn him off unless he ceased cutting timber, kept off trespassers and paid the taxes? And when he agreed to do this did he not from that time become a tenant at will? He was permitted to continue the occupancy of the land, limited as to the timber, performing the service of keeping off trespassers and taking in recompense the profits of the land; does not this arrangement create a tenancy at will?\nBe this as it may, Michael Ryan was on the land as a mere caretaker for his father, and if so the statute did not run, or he was on as tenant at will to his father on the terms as stated by himself: \u201cI was to take care of the other land; to mind it; let no timber be cut off it; see that no timber was taken off it, or harm done to it. He sent me up money to get some chopped on the north half. I was allowed to take timber off any part of it, but not to give it to any one else, or let any one else take it away.\u201d He did cut and sell timber off the land and allow others to cut. This, in my opinion, determined the tenancy: and when Patrick went up to put him off for so doing, and he agreed to pay the taxes and cut no more, a new tenancy was created.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, J.J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe plaintiff in this action took this property admittedly belonging to his father. He first settled on 100 acres, got a deed of the same from his father and then sold them, and he remained caretaker as to the balance of the property, some 300 acres. After selling his own 100 acres, he settled on another 50 acres, not the portion of the lot in question, but on running his lines it was found that he had cut trees and that a portion of the land in dispute was in his possession. He then applied to his father for permission to remain in possession, which was granted on certain conditions. Subsequently he got by devise from his father, the 50 acres he had gone to settle on, and by the same will the defendant got the 50 acres now in dispute.\nI cannot see that there is any evidence that he ever got these 50 acres otherwise than as caretaker for his father, and he therefore could have no title against his father. I consider for this reason the appeal should be allowed.\nI consider further that, whether he is regarded as trespasser or tenant at will, he could not set up his possession beyond a certain date, because at that time his brother, by direction of his father, went to him, complained of allowing the trees to be cut and entered with him into a new arrangement and a new contract. Some of the Judges of the Court below seem to have been of opinion that the original tenancy at will could not be set aside unless there was evidence of a demand of possession or notice to quit. I do not think it was necessary and therefore the appellant is entitled to the land and to our judgment in his favour on this appeal.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nWhen the facts of this case are thoroughly understood it appears to be free from difficulty. Both parties relied mainly upon Day vs. Day[31] and Keffer vs. Keffer[32], but the appellant with greater reason. Both of these cases proceeded upon the admitted basis that the estate of the party claiming to have acquired a statutory title was at its commencement a tenancy at will, whereas here, as appears very clearly, the possession of the respondent in its commencement was that of servant, agent, or caretaker for his father. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, who tried the case without a jury and himself heard all the witnesses give their evidence, found as a matter of fact that, not only was the respondent\u2019s possession in its commencement that of a servant, agent, or caretaker for his father, but that this relationship continued throughout until the father\u2019s death in 1877, and so that the respondent never had any estate of the nature of a tenancy whether by the year, or at will, or otherwise. Now, this is just one of those cases in which a Court of Appeal should not reverse the finding upon matters of fact of the Judge who tried the cause and had the opportunity of observing the demeanour of the witnesses, unless the evidence be of such a character as to convey to the mind of the Judges sitting on the appellate tribunal the irresistible conviction that the findings are erroneous. So far from that being capable of being said in this case, the finding of the learned Chief Justice appears to be perfectly justified by the evidence. It appears that the respondent\u2019s father, who lived with his family, consisting of several children, in the Township of Tecumseh, and owned a block of 400 acres in the Township of Wellesley, which is very remote from Tecumseh, sent the respondent his eldest son in the year 1849, up to Wellesley, to take care of the block of land under an arrangement then made of which the respondent himself gives this account:\u2014\nWhen I first went up I got instructions from my father. He told me to go up and take my choice of the 400 acres. I picked out the south half of lot 1 in the 13th concession. I was to take care of the other land\u2014to mind it\u2014to let no timber be cut off it\u2014to see that no timber was taken off it or harm done to it. I was allowed to take timber off any part of it, but not to give it to any one else or to let any one else take it away. In November 1864 I sold the S\u00bd of the lot 1 in the 13th concession and I moved on to the north half in December 1864. I wrote a letter to my father before I moved on telling him that I was going to move on.\nHe then, altho\u2019 no foundation was made to enable him to give secondary evidence in his own favor of the contents of the letter, proceeds to say:\nThe substance of my letter that I sent to my father was that I had sold out the place and was going to move on to the next one. I did not say how long I was going to stay, or what I was going to do on it. I wrote to get some money to pay the taxes. I had not asked him for this lot. I had not intimated to him that I would like another hundred acres.\nNow, in all this, there is not a suggestion that he contemplated making any, the slightest, difference in respect of the relationship then existing between himself and his father as regards this land, or that he contemplated converting his possession as caretaker for, into a tenancy under his father, if the latter would consent. At the time of his selling the S\u00bd of the lot he was in possession of that piece as his own by deed from his father, given in pursuance of the arrangement whereby he was in possession of the other 300 acres as the agent, servant, or caretaker for his father. This relationship still existed at the time of his writing to his father the letter of November and at the time of his going on to the N\u00bd of this lot 1 to live in December 1864. A letter written by his father in January, 1865, was produced, but there is nothing in it at all inconsistent with the continuance of the relationship of master and servant, or caretaker, as before. In it the father intimates that the respondent must not expect to get a deed of the N\u00bd as he had got of the S\u00bd. It was quite consistent with that letter and with everything of which there is any evidence up to its receipt by the respondent, that the relationship of master and servant, or caretaker, was to continue between the father and son as before. The onus therefore lay upon the respondent to show precisely when, if ever, that relationship was changed and that of tenancy was first created. That it continued throughout until the death of the father in 1877, as was found by the learned Chief Justice who tried the cause, there is evidence to justify the conclusion.\nThe respondent himself says that he thinks he went down to see his father the next winter after he had moved on to the N\u00bd. He says:\nEither my wife or I went down every second winter. I cannot tell which of us went down first after December 1864. It was not more than two years after that, that I went down myself.\nAnd again:\nI told him, [his father] everything I was doing. I would tell him when I had so much chopping or clearing done. I would tell him every time I went down. He told me to take care of the place and to let no one take lumber off it. People had gone to him and complained that I was allowing too much timber to be taken off. He told me I could sell timber to pay the taxes, but I was not to let others haul it away.\nNow, this occurring every time the respondent went down is exactly what would be natural between a steward or caretaker and his master, and is quite consistent therefore with the relationship in virtue of which the respondent first entered still continuing. Then there is the evidence of Duncan McKenzie, which is very strong. He says:\nSomewhere about 8 or 9 years ago, a man of the name of West and I went to buy some timber. Michael [that is the respondent] was then living on the south fifty of the north half. He told us, his father allowed him to sell the timber on the place,\u2014that referred to the whole bush as I understood it, wherever we could get timber to suit. Then, two years ago, my cattle got into that bush\u2014the bush of the hundred that Pat is on, and the bush of the 50 Michael disputes about, was all in one,\u2014he said they had got through it a number of times, he told me he would put them in pound. I told him, it did not belong to him any more than to me. He told me that made no difference, he was the agent of his father and if I did not keep them out, he would put them in pound.\nNow here is abundant evidence from which a jury might fairly conclude, as the learned Chief Justice who tried the case did, that the relationship of servant, agent or caretaker, in virtue of which the respondent first acquired the possession, continued throughout. The respondent\u2019s own evidence of what passed between him and his father from time to time after December 1864 is quite consistent with the continuance of the original relationship of master and servant, and this is confirmed by the evidence of Duncan McKenzie, by which it appears that upon two different occasions within the last 8 or 10 years the respondent asserted the right to deal with the land as the agent of his father, upon one of which occasions he sold timber to the witness, asserting that his father allowed him to do so, and it is part of his own evidence that by the arrangement in virtue of which he became and was caretaker for his father he was authorized to sell the timber, as well to enable him to pay taxes as for his own use, and this permission was continued apparently upon every occasion that the respondent visited his father after December, 1864, accompanied with the peremptory injunction against the son permitting other persons to cut and haul away the timber except for the purposes aforesaid.\nIt is contended, however, that the evidence of Duncan McKenzie is valueless as relating only to a verbal admission by the son of the father\u2019s title which, as is contended, is not admissible under the statute, and Doe Perry v. Henderson[33] is referred to in support of this view: but the contention involves a manifest petitio principii, and indeed a misconception of the provisions of the statute and of the decision in Doe Perry v. Hen- derson, for although true it is that the statute enacts that \u201cwhere any person is in possession &c., &c., as tenant at will the right of the person entitled subject thereto, or of the person through whom he claims to make an entry, &c., &c., shall be deemed to have first accrued either at the termination of such tenancy or at the expiration of the year next after the commencement of such tenancy,\u201d and that where any acknowledgment of the title of the person entitled to any land is given to him or his agent in writing the right to make an entry or to bring an action to recover such land shall be deemed to have first accrued at and not before the time at which such acknowledgment, or the last of such acknowledgments, if more than one was given, and although true it is that Doe Perry v. Henderson determines that when the statute has begun to run a mere verbal acknowledgment while it is running by the person in possession that the land is the property of the true owner will not stop the running of the statute, still where the question is whether or not the relation of tenancy ever existed?\u2014whether the possession to which the provisions of the statute are sought to be applied was that of a servant, agent or caretaker, or on the contrary that of a tenant?\u2014there is no case which excludes evidence of the fact that the person seeking to avail himself of the statute has verbally acknowledged that his possession was not at all that of a tenant, but was that of a servant, agent or caretaker. In Doe Perry v. Henderson the late learned Chief Justice Robinson draws plainly the distinction between the two cases. He there says: \u201cThe son was in fact occupying for his own benefit and not as the servant or agent of his father.\u201d\nNow, the principle of Day v. Day and of Keffer v. Keffer is this: that acts which were quite consistent with the continuance of the original relationship created between the father and son could not be relied upon as putting an end to that relationship, and in Day v. Day it was held to be a proper question of fact to submit to the jury, (and it is therefore a proper one for a judge trying a case without a jury to determine) whether the acts relied upon as terminating the first relationship existing between the father and son as regarded the possession of the land were consistent with the continuance of that relationship; and in Day v. Day, the jury having decided that they were, it was held that the first relationship was not determined. This decision, when applied to this case, supports the contention of the appellant, and not that of the respondent, and it is quite right that it should be so, for it would certainly tend to render the title to land very insecure if it should be competent for a person who obtains the possession of land in the character of servant, agent or caretaker for another, at his own sole pleasure, without the knowledge and consent of the other, to convert that relationship into one of tenancy at will so as to enable the agent, who is confided in as such by his principal, to dispossess his principal, and in process of time to extinguish his title.\nThen, we have the evidence of the appellant, who says that he was sent up by his father who had heard that the respondent was cutting more timber than was right, and that he was destroying the land, with instructions to tell him to stop cutting the timber, and that if he would not pay the taxes the father would put somebody else on the land. That accordingly the respondent did go up to the land as his father\u2019s agent; that he found a man hauling timber off the place for rafters, and that he interfered and forbid him, and that he promised to desist; that he next saw the respondent and told him the purpose for which he had come up, and the instructions he had from his father, and he forbid the respondent to sell or dispose of any more timber off the place. That in reply the respondent promised that he would cut no more timber, and that he would pay the taxes if he should be left on the place until such time as his father or the boys, his brothers, wanted it. The respondent, having been himself examined in his own interest upon this point, admitted that he may have said that he would give up the place if his father wanted it, but he could not swear whether he did say so or not. The appellant, however, swears that he did say so, and it is plain that the interview resulted in an arrangement whereby the respondent was allowed to remain on the land, for this is the only natural inference to draw under the circumstances, from his being permitted to continue in possession and from the mutual occupation of the land for a short time before and after the father\u2019s death. Now, this evidence of the appellant is also quite consistent with the fact that throughout the respondent continued in possession in the same character of caretaker in virtue of which he had originally obtained the possession.\nIt is however urged, that there is that in the evidence of the respondent\u2019s wife which tends to shew that there was at some time a change made in this relationship; if there be, it must be said that her evidence is defective in a most important point, namely, in not shewing when precisely that change occurred, for upon that turned the question whether or not the statute had run for a sufficient time from that event occurring to give to the plaintiff in the action a statutory title, the onus of establishing which wholly lay upon the respondent, who was the plaintiff; but further, it is only necessary upon this point to say that the judge who tried the case had the best opportunity of determining from the demeanor and manner of the witnesses in giving their evidence which appeared to be most worthy of credit, and he has adopted the evidence, of which it must be admitted there is abundance, which supports the continuing existence of the original character of caretaker, and a Court of Appeal cannot in such a case with propriety say, that his finding, which is in such plain accord with justice and the integrity of parties originally placed in a fiduciary relation, is in point of fact plainly erroneous. Nor would it avail the respondent if it should be established beyond all doubt that the relation of landlord and tenant did exist between the father and himself, for, assuming the respondent had been tenant at will to his father and that the statute was running in his favor at the time that the appellant was sent up about six years before the action brought, there is abundant evidence to justify a jury in coming to the conclusion that what occurred then evidenced the creation anew of the relationship of landlord and tenant, and that is the inference which under the circumstances a jury should draw. The fact of the respondent being allowed to continue to remain upon the land at all after the appellant had been sent up for the purpose detailed in the evidence, and the subsequent dealings of the brothers in relation to the land shortly before and after the father\u2019s death, and when the respondent was aware that the father had left by his will the south fifty acres of the N\u00bd of the lot in question to the respondent and the residue to the appellant, tend to support the evidence of the latter, and that evidence, if believed by a jury, and I see no reason to disbelieve it, would justify the conclusion, as the proper inference to be drawn, that a new tenancy at will was created and was then acknowledged to be in existence between the father and the respondent so as to create a new point of departure for the running of the statute. The question in such case, as said by Lord Denman in Doe Groves v. Groves[34], is merely one as to which of two suppositions is most consistent with the facts in evidence, and that which appears to be most consistent with those facts is, that if not then in possession as agent or caretaker for his father the respondent by what passed between him and the father\u2019s agent acknowledged himself to be and agreed to be a tenant at will to his father. The learned counsel for the respondent seemed to be of opinion that, assuming the statute to have begun to run in favor of the respondent before that interview, a verbal acknowledgment made by the respondent in that interview with the father\u2019s agent, though made as detailed in the evidence of the appellant, would not have been sufficient within the authority of Doe Perry v. Henderson. But what Doe Perry v. Henderson decided upon this point was, that the mere acknowledgment by the party in possession verbally made that another person was the true owner of the land was not sufficient to stop the running of the statute, such an acknowledgment though made to the true owner would be quite consistent with the fact that the person making it was nevertheless availing, and intending to avail, himself of the continual running of the statute in his favor, it would involve no acknowledgment of there existing at the time the relation of landlord and tenant between him and the true owner, it would be no more than if he said to the true owner: \u201cYou certainly have the title, but I am acquiring it under the statute,\u201d but Doe Perry v. Henderson does not, nor does any case, decide that the verbal acknowledgment by a party in possession made to the owner or his agent, that the relation of landlord and tenant is then existing between the person in possession and the true owner is not good evidence, as against the person making it, of the fact of the present existence of the relationship so as to give a new departure for the run- ning of the statute\u2014equally as does the payment of a sum of money by way of rent, it may be for the first time several years after the statute had begun to run, but before its efflux, which is but an act in acknowledgment of the existing relationship of landlord and tenant. Again, it was urged that in Day v. Day it is said: \u201cWhen the statute has once begun to run it would seem on principle that it could not cease to run unless the true owner, whom the statute assumes to be dispossessed of his property, shall have been restored to the possession,\u201d but the judgment goes on to explain that he may be restored to the possession so as to control the continuance of the running of the statute by three different ways\u2014either, 1st, \u201cby entering into the actual possession of the property, or 2nd. by receiving rent from the person in occupation,\u201d the payment of which is but an act in acknowledgment that the party paying it is then tenant of the party to whom he pays it, or 3rd. \u201cby making a new lease to such person which is accepted by him, and it is not material whether it is a lease for a term of years, from year to year, or at will.\u201d\nNow, Hodgson v. Kosper[35] and Day v. Day are authorities that the fact of such new lease having been made and accepted by the person in possession may be implied from acts and conduct, and certainly it appears to me that the acts and conduct, to which I add expressions from which a tenancy at will should be implied to have been then created, unless as I have said the respondent was then still invested with the character of agent and caretaker for his father, are stronger than were the circumstances which were held to be sufficient for that purpose in Doe Groves v. Groves[36], Doe Bennett v. Turner[37], and Doe Shepherd v. Bayley[38]. As to the further point which was urged in favor of the respondent\u2019s contention, namely, that he had been assessed and paid the taxes upon the land for several years, it is only necessary to say, that by his own shewing it was provided by the arrangement in virtue of which he originally became agent and caretaker of the land for his father that he should be at liberty to sell timber to pay the taxes, and there is ample evidence to shew that he exercised this privilege to an amount greater, as it would seem, than was necessary to pay taxes.\nUpon the whole I am of opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in reversing the verdict rendered by the learned Chief Justice who tried the case, and that this appeal should be allowed and the verdict and judgment thereon of the Court below in favor of the appellant, the defendant in the action, should be restored with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: John King.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bowlby, Colquhoun & Clement.\n[1] See also reports of the case, 29 U.C.C.P. 449 and 4 Ont.

Co.\u2014Action by creditor against a shareholder\u2014Conditional agreement\u2014Allotment, notice of, necessary.\nThe appellant, a judgment creditor of the T.G. & B. Railway Co., sued the respondent as a shareholder therein, for unpaid stock. From the evidence it appeared that the respondent signed the stock book, which was headed by an agreement by the subscribers to become shareholders of the stock for the amount set opposite their respective names, and upon allotment by the company \u201cof my or our said respective shares\u201d they covenanted to pay ten per cent of the amount of the said shares and all future calls. The company, on the 1st July passed a resolution instructing their secretary to issue allotment certificates to each shareholder for the amount of shares held by him. The secretary prepared them, including one for the respondent, and handed them to the company\u2019s broker to deliver to the shareholders. The brokers published a notice, signed by the secretary, in a daily paper notifying subscribers to the capital stock of the T.G. & B. Railway Co., that the first call of ten per cent. on the stock was required to be paid immediately to them. The respondent never called for or received his certificate of allotment, and never paid the ten per cent, and swore that he had never had any notice of the allotment having been made to him.\nThe case was tried twice and the learned judge, at the second trial, although he found that the respondent had subscribed for fifty shares and had been allotted said fifty shares, was unable to say whether respondent had received actual notice of allotment.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the document signed by the respondent was only an application for shares, and that it was necessary for the appellant to have shown notice within a reasonable time of the allotment of shares to respondent, and that no notice whatever of such allotment had been proved.\n[Ritchie, C.J., and Gwynne, J., dissenting.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[2], and directing a verdict to be entered for the defendant.\nThis was an action or proceeding, in the nature of scire facias quare executionem non, instituted by the plaintiff, a judgment creditor of The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway Company against the defendant, who, as the plaintiff alleges and contends, is a holder of fifty shares in the capital stock of the said company, of which there remains still unpaid an amount more than sufficient to pay and satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s judgment.\nTo the plaintiff\u2019s declaration the defendant pleaded:\n1. That he was not nor is the holder of the said shares as alleged.\n2. That he was induced to become the holder of the said shares by the fraud of the said company, and that within a reasonable time after he had notice of the said fraud, and before he had received any benefit from or in respect of said shares or any of them, and before the debt due by the company to the plaintiff was incurred, he repudiated and disclaimed the said shares and all title thereto and all liability in respect thereof, and gave notice thereof to the company, whereof the plaintiff had notice.\n3. That he was induced to become the holder of the said shares by the fraud of the said company and the plaintiff, and that he repudiated the stock after notice of the fraud, as in the second plea, and afterwards, in order to defraud the defendant, the plaintiff, colluding with the said company, instituted the action in which the plaintiff obtained judgment against the company.\n4. That the company had sufficient goods to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s judgment and from which the amount of the execution could and would have been realised, but for the fraud and collusion of the plaintiff and the said company, whereby the sheriff was induced falsely to return the said execution, as if the said company had no goods and chattels in his bailiwick whereof he could make the amount of the said execution in whole or in part.\n5. That it was agreed between the defendant and the said company that if the defendant would sign an agreement to take the shares, the company would give to the defendant and one John Ginty a contract for the construction of the company\u2019s railway, and that until the said contract should be given the defendant should not be bound by his signing said agreement, that relying upon such agreement of the said company and not otherwise, the defendant did sign the said agreement to take said shares, but that the company have refused to give the said contract to defendant and the said John Ginty.\nThe sixth plea is somewhat similar to the fifth.\nIssue being joined the case came down for trial before Armour, J., without a jury in the spring of 1878, (the evidence is set out in the report of the case in 29 U.C.C.P. 34 and 5 Ont. App. Rep. 127,) when a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. Upon a motion to set aside that verdict, a rule was made absolute for a new trial in consequence of a then recent decision in Denison v. Lesslie[3] in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and in the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and in consequence of the construction which the company by a certificate of allotment produced at the trial seemed to have put upon the document signed by the defendant, namely, that it was only an application for shares, which if a correct construction would, upon the authority of several English cases, have required a response either in writing or verbally, or by conduct communicating to the defendant that the company had accepted his application and himself as a shareholder before he could be liable as such, a point as to which there had been no finding at the trial.\nThe case accordingly went down to trial a second time and was tried by Cameron, J., without a jury, who by his verdict found: 1. That the defendant subscribed for fifty shares in the stock book of the company, and that the fifty shares were allotted to him by the company, and that the company sent notice to him of calls, and that his name was published in the Globe newspaper as a shareholder, and that he was at the time of such publication a subscriber to the Globe, and that all was done by the company to give the defendant a claim against the company for the stock and to have any benefit that might accrue therefrom. He further added that he could not say that the defendant received actual notice of the allotment, but he found that the company by notices sent to his address gave him notice of their considering him a shareholder. Upon this verdict being moved against the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench after argument held, that the evidence supported the findings of the learned judge.\nUpon appeal by the defendant to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, the majority of that court reversed the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and ordered a verdict and judgment to be entered for the defendant. From that judgment the plaintiff has appealed to this court.\nThe printed documents connected with the case, viz.: the heading of the stock book, extract from the minutes of a meeting of the directors of the company, the form of certificate of allotment, resolutions and notices, &c., are referred to at length in the judgment of Ritchie, C.J., hereinafter given.\nMr. Blake, Q.C., and Mr. Proctor, for appellant:\nThe appellant is a judgment creditor of the Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway Company, incorporated by 31 Vic., c. 40, Ontario. The several clauses of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d[4], relating to calls, shares, and their transfer, are expressly incorporated therewith.\nBy referring to sections 1, 2, 6, 7, 15, 17, 18, 27 and 28 of this Act it will be seen that in the mind of the legislature the word \u201csubscriber\u201d is equivalent to the word \u201cshareholder.\u201d\nThe paper signed by Manning was a paper prepared by the company, and was executed under seal. The Act empowered the provisional directors to open stock books, to make a call upon the shares subscribed therein, and to call a meeting of the subscribers for the organization of the company, and it was in pursuance of this statute that the subscription of the respondent was made in the company\u2019s stock book under his hand and seal. It seems fanciful to give decisions in this country based on decisions of another country where an entirely different mode of dealing with subscribers exists. We all know of the mania that prevailed in England some years ago, to get stock in a joint stock company. It was sufficient to announce that a company was being organized, the eagerness of the public was such that there were immediately more applications for stock than was wanting, and it was only after allotment that the applicants could be said to be shareholders.\nThe document signed by respondent being a covenant to pay under seal, the assent of the company thereto is sufficient, and such assent might be inferred, if, as in this case, it was not repudiated by the company; but the evidence shows the company did actually assent to the subscription, and sent respondent notices to pay calls.\nThe earliest decision on this point in our courts was that given by the Court of Common Pleas in the case of Smith v. Spencer[5]; so again in Lake Superior Navigation Co. v. Morrison[6]; so again in European & North American Railway Co. v. McLeod[7].\nNow, what are the admitted facts as to the mode in which Mr. Manning became what he did become.\nThe capital stock of the company was $3,000,000. It was never contemplated to get more than 10 per cent. of that amount subscribed, the intention of the provisional directors being to get a respectable list of Toronto shareholders in order to induce the counties to give the company municipal aid. Accordingly, after a deal of manipulation and canvassing, Mr. Laidlaw, one of the most active provisional directors, and Mr. Campbell, the company\u2019s broker, succeeded in getting subscriptions for their stock to the amount of $300,000, the amount required for organization. Manning was induced to subscribe stock at the instance of Mr. Laidlaw. This subscription was admitted by him, although at first he alleged it was conditional, and his main defence was that he was only to become a shareholder on his getting the contract to build the company\u2019s road about to be constructed in connection with one John Ginty, who was also a partner of his in building another road. The court held this defence could not avail him, but in the latter stage of the proceedings he thought it better to say he was not a shareholder at all. But how can it be seriously contended that the company who wanted all the subscribers they could get, who sent out brokers canvassing, intended to take conditional subscriptions? There, was no danger of any subscriber not having his stock. It was even deemed necessary to publish the stock sheet, in order to show who were interested in the scheme, and that the company was bon\u00e2 fide organized. All this was known to Mr. Manning, and we are entitled to contend that what took place is real evidence of his becoming a shareholder. Then, also, it is in evidence that he not only consented to sign the list of subscribers which was published, but he aided publicly the directors in getting municipal bonuses and aid. This, it is argued, does not prove he had knowledge of the allotment, but surely he knew he was a shareholder, and if anything more was to be done, it was only some mere formal matter. Under all these circumstances we have very strong evidence to sustain that construction upon which we primarily rely, i.e., that the effect of signing this document was to create that relation between the company and the respondent as to make him a subscriber. Within the four corners of this paper we find a perfect contract, the minds of both parties were brought together.\nThe second point relied on is, that if it was an imperfect contract, the only condition was the \u201callotment,\u201d and upon allotment, and not upon \u201cnotice of allotment,\u201d the respondent became a shareholder. What the court of appeal has done is this: that they have interpolated the words \u201cupon notice of\u201d in this document under seal. They have not taken into consideration that acceptance by the subscriber had taken place. Now, there can be no doubt that an allotment was made, and we cannot therefore be hampered with this objection, for the evidence shows that the company sent respondent calls to pay.\nIf notice of allotment were necessary it may be implied from the facts of the case, or the conduct of the parties; and the court of first instance having found that respondent was aware of the company\u2019s acceptance of his subscription, or was in a position to have known the same and could have taken advantage of any benefit which might have resulted from the acceptance of himself as a shareholder, consequently he is liable. Levitas\u2019 Case[8]; Wheatcroft Case[9]; Pritchard v. Walker[10]; Crawley\u2019s Case[11]; Fletcher\u2019s Case[12].\nIf the respondent expected or required notice of the allotment or call, he should have taken pains to have informed himself when the same was made, for there was a duty upon him to pay the calls made by the directors. Sec. 48, 49 and 50, Con. Stat., c. 66. Sparks v. The Liverpool Water Co.[13]; Aylesbury Railway Co. v. Mount[14].\nThe cause having been twice tried, and a verdict on both trials having been for the plaintiff upon evidence deemed sufficient by the learned judges who tried the case, and the same having been expressly approved of by the court below, the Court of Appeal should not have turned the verdict so obtained into a verdict for defendant, but should have ordered a new trial. Merchants\u2019 Bank v. Bostwick[15].\nThe following authorities were also cited and commented on by counsel: Denison v. Lesslie[16]; Gun\u2019s Case[17]; Nixon v. Hamilton[18]; Harrison\u2019s Case[19]; Moore v. Murphy[20].\nMr. Ferguson, Q.C, for respondent:\nIf the true construction and meaning of the document signed by respondent, is, that it was not an application for shares, but a subscription without any condition, I must admit the authorities cited by the learned counsel for appellant have great weight; but if it is only an application for shares, and that on the face of the document itself there was something else to be done, it is clear the company have no right against the respondent until they do that further act\u2014so I say that upon signing this document respondent did not become eo instanti a shareholder. By this document the company need not allot unless they choose, and therefore at that time there was no complete contract, the mind of the company and of the subscriber had not yet come to any decision as to the ownership of the $5,000 stock.\nIn this document which is said to be the stock book, we find the expression \u201cupon allotment,\u201d it shows clearly that in the minds of the parties there was to be an allotment. The proposal was to take, if allotment is made and not otherwise, and it is upon these words that the construction of this agreement must turn. The remedy sought is an extraordinary one given by statute, and unless the requisites of that statute were in all matters strictly made out by the appellant, he was not entitled to succeed.\nNow, in order to make out that the respondent was a shareholder, and liable as such by reason of his having so signed the same, it was necessary for the appellant to prove that the respondent had received notice of an allotment of the shares, or at least that there had been a response to this application received by, or communicated to, the respondent, stating, or to the effect, that the said company had accepted his application and himself as a shareholder of the said shares, and this within a reasonable time after the making of such application, and in this respect the evidence adduced by the appellant entirely failed, and there was a positive denial by the respondent of his having received any such notice of allotment or response. It was not proved that there was any verbal response to the said application, even if that were possible and would be sufficient. Nor was it proved that any letter or other document containing any such response was delivered to the respondent or even mailed to him, if this last could have been held sufficient in the face of the respondent\u2019s denial of the receipt of it, which it could not. Nor was it proved that the respondent had any knowledge of an allotment of the said or any shares to him, and besides, it appears by the evidence and the circumstances thereby disclosed, that a long series of years passed away after the time of the said application during which neither the said company nor the respondent considered that the respondent was such shareholder, and for these reasons it was not established that the respondent was such shareholder, and the judgment of the court below is correct and should be affirmed. Denison v. Lesslie[21]; Redpath\u2019s case[22]; Wall\u2019s case[23]; Pellatt\u2019s case[24]; Gunn\u2019s case[25]; British American Tel. Co. v. Colson[26]; Kipling v. Todd[27]; Ness v. Angus[28].\nThe newspaper publication and the publication of list of shareholders relied upon by the appellant as being some evidence that the respondent had notice or knowledge that the company had accepted the said application and the respondent as a shareholder, were not evidence against the respondent, and besides; knowledge of them was not brought home to the respondent by the evidence.\nThe findings of the learned judge who tried the cause were not sufficient to warrant the entry of a verdict for the plaintiff (the appellant), nor were the said findings supported by the evidence, and it was competent to the court below, if necessary, to reverse these findings, they being based, at least in part, upon inferences of fact drawn by the learned judge, from facts stated in the evidence and not resting upon different degrees of credibility considered to be due to the witnesses from their demeanor before the court, and, moreover, I submit there was no finding on the point for which the case was sent back The Glannibanta[29]; in re Randolph[30].\nThe learned counsel also referred to and relied upon the authorities following: Household Fire Insurance Company v.

Campbell & Cassels, 60 King Street East.\nBy order,\n(Signed,) W. Sutherland Taylor,\nSecretary.\nThe above notice appeared in the daily Globe from the 2nd to the 9th July, 1869.\n(5)\nTORONTO, GREY & BRUCE RAILWAY.\nTake notice, that a further call of ten per cent. on the capital stock of the Toronto, Grey & Railway Company has been authorized by the directors, and that the same is payable at the company\u2019s offices, corner of Front and Bay Streets, Toronto, on the 16th day of May, 1870.\nBy order of the Board.\n(Signed,) W. Sutherland Taylor,\nSecretary.\nThe above is a copy of the notice for calls in Gazette on the dates mentioned by the secretary of the company.\nI think on allotment by the company, the subscribers became in fact and in law shareholders in the company, liable to pay to the company ten per cent. of the amount of the shares, and to pay all future calls, subject to the proviso in the memo. so signed and sealed; and they became entitled to all privileges, benefits and advantages that might accrue to such shareholders in said company, and became subject to all liabilities and responsibilities attaching to shareholders in the company.\nThe contract in this case was this: The company applied to the respondent to take shares; the respondent agreed to do so, and bound himself under seal to pay a percentage on allotment, the assent of the respondent to the application of the company, and the binding agreement signed and sealed by him, imposed on the company the binding duty of allotting the specified shares to him, and constituted an agreement completed, binding on both parties, which either could enforce, entirely distinguishable from an agreement merely resting on an application for shares. The applicant was the company, and the sealed undertaking of the respondent was the acceptance of the company\u2019s offer, and fixed on the company the obligation to allot them, and when so allotted, they became eo instanti vested in the respondent. In other words, the company sent an offer by which they were bound, and under which, on receiving back the offer accepted, signed and sealed by the respondent, a contract complete and binding on both sides was constituted. This conclusive and binding agreement on both parties was, on the respondent\u2019s part, that he should become a shareholder of 50 shares and pay; and, on the company\u2019s part, that they should grant him the said fifty shares, and the company being under this direct obligation to grant those shares, discharged that obligation by allotting to him the shares in a due and formal manner, and regularly placing him on the register. Surely the contract was then full, perfect and complete; a valid and unimpeachable contract, the effect of which was to make this respondent the holder of 50 shares in the company. I think there was quite enough to satisfy the judge who tried this case, that the respondent knew that the company had acted on the agreement, had treated him as a shareholder, and had placed him on the register, and so had notice that the company had allotted to him the stock; and had the application come from the respondent to the company, that would have been sufficient to show that he knew that the company had assented to his request, and had completed the contract. In fact, this is to be gathered from defendant himself.\nHe says:\u2014\nI am the defendant. I have not and never had any papers or documents relating to the shares in question in this action. I have no allotment of shares, and never heard of any allotment. Some eight years ago I put my name down for shares conditionally in the Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway, and in the Toronto & Nipissing Railway. I cannot swear what amount I took in each; I think it may have been about $5,000 worth in the Toronto, Grey & Bruce, and $2,000 or $2,500 in the Toronto & Nipissing. This was just before the companies were organized, to the best of my recollection. George Laidlaw asked me to take these shares. No call was ever made on me for these. I have never paid any call or anything on the Toronto, Grey & Bruce shares. I forget what it was that I signed. I do not know whether it was the stock book that I signed or some other paper. The proposal on the part of Laidlaw was made on the corner of King and Church Streets, I think the south-west corner; we agreed there, but I cannot positively say where I signed. Mr. C.J. Campbell came up afterwards, or else Laidlaw took Ginty and myself round to his office. I do not know who was present when we signed; I think that Ginty was there, and signed at the same time that I did. I think that Campbell was present when I signed. As far as I recollect, there was nothing appearing in the books in connection with my name, except my signature. I refused to take stock in the first place; then there was a verbal agreement made between Laidlaw and myself. I would not have taken the stock except for the inducement that Laidlaw offered. He asked Ginty and myself to take stock, and I refused. He wanted to raise a large amount of stock here, so as to show to the people outside who were giving bonuses that the people here were contributing largely to the undertaking. He agreed that if we took stock we should get the contract for building the road; that we would not be called on to pay unless we got the contract, and he said that if we got the contract, under any circumstances we should not be called on to pay more than ten per cent. upon the stock. Upon that agreement and conversation we agreed to take the stock. I think that we each took stock separately. We tendered for the Nipissing work and got it; we also tendered for the Grey & Bruce Railway and did not get it. I supposed that the contracts would be let by tender, but not necessarily to the lowest tender. Laidlaw was the only one who had made the agreement with me. I had been out with him and Gordon canvassing for a week in the townships. If I got the contract I understood that my stock would be paid out of my estimates, but not more than ten per cent. I supposed that if I had got the contract I should have been in the same position as any other stockholder. I subscribed to the Toronto & Nipissing on the same terms. They were separate transactions, but Laidlaw was acting in both as the prime originator. We got the contract for the Nipissing; I paid up my stock in full in this. My stock was paid principally out of my estimates. I sold out my stock in this road, and hold no stock in it now. Tenders were called for the Toronto, Grey & Bruce, and I put in one; the tender was that of Manning & Ginty. I do not know why it was refused. I cannot tell whether it was the lowest. When my tender was rejected, I did not consider that I had any stock. No director ever spoke to me about my stock. I never was asked to pay any calls; I may have been notified when the first call was made. I never wrote to the directors about my stock, nor they to me. I was surprised when I was served with the writ in this action.\nBy Mr. Ferguson\u2014I never at any time paid anything on account of the stock, either when I signed or afterwards. It was distinctly agreed that I was not to pay anything on it unless I got the contract; without this condition, I would not have taken a cent\u2019s worth of stock. There was no connection between my subscriptions to the two railways each was a separate transaction. I did not get the contract for the Toronto, Grey & Bruce road, and never was asked to pay; I never was a shareholder. I would have been a shareholder if I had got the contract. Mr. Laidlaw was the moving spirit in the undertaking; there would have been no Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway without him. I do not recollect whether they had the act at the time that he solicited me to take stock: he was the chief actor in soliciting stock. The Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway is in operation, and there is a large amount of rolling stock in use on it, and the company has other property, such as furniture and safes at all of their stations, and tools on the line of their railway. The road runs through the counties of York, Peel, South Simcoe, Grey and Bruce. Some of the property I refer to is in each of these counties.\n(Signed,) Alexander Manning.\nCertified a true copy.\n(Signed,) Geo. M.

Manning.\nToronto.\n50\n5,000\n00\nBut apart from this, I think there was a completed contract, and no notice of allotment was necessary to constitute the defendant a subscriber to the stock and a shareholder.\nIt is clear the company allotted the stock, 50 shares, to the defendant. This is not the ordinary case where a person applies for a maximum number of shares undertaking to accept them or any less number, and the company is under no obligation to give him any, in which case, I take it, a reply to the application is necessary, for the very good reason \u201cthat when an individual applies for shares in a company, and there is no obligation to let him have any, there must be a response by the company, otherwise there is no contract[37];\u201d but in this case the application or offer proceeds, from the company, and the answer comes from the party applied to, who signs the company\u2019s stock book, and who binds himself under seal to become the holder of the number of shares set opposite his name, and on allotment of his shares agrees to pay a certain percentage, &c. The company allotted the shares, and he was placed on the registry, and this constituted a completed transaction, and made him to all intents and purposes, in my opinion, a shareholder in the company.\nI think there cannot be the slightest doubt that the defendant did intend and agree to become a member in praesenti; there may or may not have been an agreement or understanding\u2014I should rather say simply an expectation\u2014that he should get a contract; but this, whatever it was, was purely collateral, and as was said in Bridge\u2019s case[38], \u201chaving agreed to be a shareholder in praesenti, he cannot be heard to say that he was not a shareholder because of this collateral matter.\u201d\nSee Elkington\u2019s case[39], and what was said by Lord Cairns cited in this case.\nBut the contention set up on this point has been abandoned. I think the authorities clearly establish that no notice of allotment in a case of this kind was necessary.\nIn the last edition of Mr. Leake\u2019s work, 1878, on Contracts, p. 36, it is said:\u2014\nIf a definite offer of the shares proceed in the first instance from the company, or if there be a previous definite agreement respecting them, the application for the shares in pursuance of the offer or agreement may make a complete contract without further notice of allotment.\nHe cites Tucker\u2019s case[40]; Adams\u2019 case[41]; Davies\u2019 case[42].\nThis doctrine was enunciated and acted on by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in European & North America Ry. Co. v. McLeod[43], and also in The New Theatre Company (limited)\u2014Bloxam\u2019s case[44].\nThis latter case is as follows:\nThis company established under the 25 and 26 Vic., c. 89, had been ordered to be wound up. This was an application on behalf of the official liquidator to settle Mr. Bloxam on the list of contributors in respect of 100 shares.\nIt appeared that Mr. Bloxam had verbally applied for 100 shares, and he was told by the secretary that he could have them on payment of the deposit. He called at the office of the company in Cornhill on the 25th of April, 1863, and handed to the secretary his cheque for \u00a3100 for the deposit upon the shares; but before handing it over he asked the secretary when he could have the shares, and was told by him that he could have them in a few days, as the company were about to allot them. He then stipulated with the secretary, that if he did not get the shares in a few days, the secretary would return him the cheque. The cheque was duly paid into the bankers of the company.\nThe shares were actually allotted to Mr. Bloxam on the 27th of April at a meeting of the directors, and his name was entered as the allottee for 100 shares in \u201cthe Register of allotment of shares.\u201d It was not shown that Mr. Bloxam\u2019s name had been entered in the share registry book (25 and 26 Vic., c. 89, s. 25). Mr. Bloxam did not sign any written application for the shares, and no letter of allotment, no scrip certificate of the shares, and no return of the allotment had ever been sent to him.\nIt did not appear that Mr. Bloxam had ever applied for the scrip certificates, but he had called at the office in Cornhill, and found it closed, and he was told that the company had gone to pieces, but the office had in fact been removed to Westminster. He appeared to have done nothing further, when, on the 27th of July, 1863, the company was ordered to be wound up. Mr. Selwyn and Mr. Beavan for the official liquidator, argued that Mr. Bloxam ought to be placed on the list of contributories, for the contract for the shares by application and payment of the deposit was complete when the shares had been allotted to the applicant by the company, and that nothing further was wanted to make the allotment effective. They cited ex parte Yelland[45]; ex parte Cookney[46].\nMr. Roxburgh, contra, argued that no perfect and complete contract fixing Mr. Bloxam with the ownership of any particular shares existed. That an allotment alone, without notice to the allottee was insufficient, for it was not possible to know what number of shares had been allotted, or which they were. That here there had been no notice, no acceptance of the shares, and that no entry on the share registry, as required by the act had been proved.\nThe Master of the Rolls:\u2014\nI must hold Mr. Bloxam to be a shareholder. Cookney\u2019s case and Yelland\u2019s case determine this: that if a person applies for shares and pays what is necessary and has the shares allotted to him he becomes a shareholder, and that the application need not be in writing.\nHere Mr. Bloxam applies for 100 shares, and he is told he can have them; he then pays a deposit of \u00a3100, the secretary promising him that if they are not allotted the cheque shall be returned. There is a book called a register of allotment of shares which answers all the requirements of a register, and in this the allotment to Mr. Bloxam appears. It is true that no further deposit is made, and that no notice of the fact of allotment was given to him. But if the company had been extremely prosperous, how could the company deny that Mr. Bloxam was a shareholder; how could they dispute the fact after this entry in their book? After accepting his money they allot him these shares. The rights and obligations are co\u2011extensive, and I must hold him to be a contributory.\nAnd in Tucker\u2019s case[47] it was contended that Tucker had never received notice of allotment of the shares to him, and Pellatt\u2019s case[48] and Bloxam\u2019s case[49] were cited.\nIn Tucker\u2019s case Bacon, V.C., says:\nIn order to constitute a man a shareholder, all that was required by the provisions of the Companies Act, 1862, was that he should agree to take shares, and that his name should be duly placed upon the share register. These provisions had been made for the benefit of the creditors of the company; therefore in questions as between shareholders and creditors, persons who had complied with the requirements of the act could not be heard to say that they were not shareholders.\n* * *\nAs regarded Mr. Tucker, the evidence was not quite so satisfactory. He had, however, received a letter and form of application similar to those sent to Mr. Brown, which form he had filled up and returned to the company, and therefore the company was bound to allot to him, and he was bound to take the shares for which he had so applied. There was therefore a binding contract between Mr. Tucker and the company, of which either party might have enforced the specific performance.\nMr. Tucker\u2019s affidavit, stating that he had no recollection of ever having received, and that he did not believe he ever had received, any notice of allotment, was not sufficient; but it was immaterial whether or not he had received notice of allotment, for the contract with the company was complete immediately on his filling up and returning to the company the form of application for shares. Messrs. Brown and Tucker must therefore be placed on the lists of contributories.\nThe marginal note in Adam\u2019s case[50] is:\nB. Company agreed to transfer their business to P. Company. One of the terms of such agreement (which was sanctioned by the court under the winding-up of B. Company) was that the holders of shares in B. Company should receive an equal number of shares in P. Company. A circular letter was sent by P. Company to the shareholders in B. Company, referring to these terms, and requesting the B. shareholders to fill in a form of application for the shares to which they were entitled under the arrangement. A., a holder of fifty shares in B. Company, filled in and returned this form, applying for fifty shares in P. Company. The directors of P. Company by resolution allotted to him that number of shares. Before receiving notice of allotment, A. wrote to withdraw his application. After considerable delay the solicitor of P. Company, to whom the question of A\u2019s withdrawal had been referred by the directors, wrote to A., stating (erroneously as now appeared) that by a resolution of the board the allotment of shares to him had been cancelled. The company had no share register, but A\u2019s name was entered in their allotment book for fifty shares, though no particular shares were appropriated to him: Held, that as soon as A\u2019s application had been accepted by the company, there was a binding contract between them without any notice of allotment being given to A.; that even if the resolution cancelling the allotment had been passed the directors had no power, under a general authority to compromise proceedings, &c., contained in the articles of association, to sanction A\u2019s withdrawal; and that as between A. and the company the entry in the allotment book was sufficient.\nLord Justice Mellish says in Davies\u2019 case[51]:\nThe only real question appears to me to be this: First, is there not sufficient evidence on this statement that there was an agreement that Messrs. Templeman & Co. should take the 250 shares between them? It appears to me that there is sufficient evidence, because he says so. Then there being that arrangement, I think that the written application having been sent in by Mr. Templeman for 200 shares, and by Mr. Davies for fifty shares, and the company having made no objection to that, there is sufficient proof that the company assented to this division of the 250 shares, which were to be taken by Messrs. Templeman & Co., in the proportion of 200 shares by Mr. Templeman and fifty by Mr. Davies. If there had been no such previous arrangement I should certainly not have thought that the mere keeping the deposits would have been sufficient evidence.\nBut assuming that there was, as there appears to me to have been, a valid binding arrangement previous to the written application being made, that Messrs. Templeman & Co. should take between them 250 shares, and there not being any objection on the part of the directors to taking the deposit, there is sufficient evidence to show that the directors assented to the 250 shares which Messrs. Templeman & Co. agreed to take being divided between Mr. Templeman and Mr. Davies in the proportion contained in their written applications.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the order of the Vice-Chancellor is right, and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nI am of opinion that the defendant was liable in this action, and that the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench should have been affirmed, and that the appeal should therefore be allowed, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench should be reversed with costs in all the courts.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred in the judgment about to be delivered by Henry, J.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the Appeal Court of Ontario. Three of the four learned judges who heard the appeal gave judgment for the respondent, on the ground that it was necessary for the appellant to have shown notice within a reasonable time of the allotment of shares to him, and that no notice whatever of such allotment had been proved. The late lamented Chief Justice of that court agreed that such proof was necessary, but he was of the opinion that from the facts in evidence such notice might be inferred. On this latter point only did he differ from the majority of the court. I do not consider it necessary to give my views at any great length, but will commence by saying that I entirely adopt the views of the learned judges who decided in favor of the respondent. The document signed by him, as I consider it, formed but an offer on his part to accept fifty shares of the company\u2019s stock when allotted to him. It being under seal makes no difference as to the legal construction to be put on it. It was signed as an original subscription or offer to take stock in a company not then, but subsequently to be, organized. The company did not then exist, but was subsequently to be formed, or not, according to circumstances; and we must look at this document from a stand point very different from that we should occupy in the case of a subscription to the stock book of a company already in existence. A party in the latter case would, after his application for stock had been accepted, be called upon to sign the stock list in the book of the company kept for that purpose. Before a company is formed there is an offer on the part of those wishing to become stockholders to take certain shares. It is only, at the most, a unilateral contract, if one at all; and one which could not be enforced by the party subscribing. He could not by his offer oblige the provisional directors to allot any of the shares to him. A larger amount of stock than required might be subscribed for; and no one will doubt the power of the provisional directors to reject such applications as they pleased. So up to the time, at least, of the allotment, any subscriber could withdraw his offer to take the stock he subscribed for. The agreement in this case was to receive fifty shares when allotted; and that, in my opinion, threw upon the provisional directors the onus of not only allotting the stock within a reasonable time, but of giving him notice that they had done so, also within a reasonable time.\nI concur with the three learned judges of the Appeal Court that there is no evidence of any notice of allotment. It is in fact not contended there was any, and there is no evidence of a waiver of it by the respondent. At the first meeting to organize the company, nearly two months after the subscription by the respondent, it was decided to call in ten per cent of the allotted shares, but it does not appear that any notice was given to the respondent of that resolution, and no notice given of the allotment. Suppose in the absence of both the respondent had been sued for the recovery of the ten per cent. of the shares, could he not have successfully resisted that claim for the want of such notice of allotment? The stock was subscribed for in April, 1869, and a meeting of the provisional directors held on the 1st of July following. At that meeting the president is reported to have stated \u201cthat on the previous evening the amount of stock required by the charter for organizing the company, viz.: $300,000, had all been subscribed, and that, therefore, it was necessary at once to devise means to collect and pay into the bank the first instalment of ten per cent. on the shares, so that the meeting for the election of directors and organizing the company could be called at as early a date as possible, &c.\u201d The minute goes on to state that \u201cthe brokers, Messrs. Campbell & Cassels, were instructed at once to collect the first instalment,\u201d and have the amount, $30,000, paid into the bank on the tenth of the same month, \u201cso as to enable an advertisement calling the general meeting of the shareholders to appear in the Ontario Gazette of that date.\u201d The secretary was also instructed to prepare advertisements to be inserted in other papers calling the meeting\u2014the day to be determined by the company\u2019s solicitor. The secretary was \u201calso instructed to issue allotment certificates to each shareholder for the amount of shares held by him.\u201d\nBy this extract from the company\u2019s minutes it is clearly shown that when the respondent signed the document in question the company existed only by the charter. There were no stockholders or members. Even the provisional directors were not actually such, and could only become so by subscribing and paying for stock. There could be no regular stock-book until the shares had been allotted, which is generally prepared after the company is organized, and therefore the document signed by the respondent could not be tortured into one so as to bind the respondent; but let me pursue the inquiry a little further. Suppose on the day of the meeting to organize the company and appoint directors &c., the respondent attended, but had not paid, and declined to pay the ten per cent., would he or any other similarly situated be allowed to vote or take part in the organization of the company? Sections 14, 18 and others of the act of incorporation require the 10 per cent. to be paid before any subscriber could vote or be elected a director or even called to attend the first meeting to organize the company. He would have been very delicately informed that he was not a stockholder, and denied the privileges of one. Any other course would be a violation of the statute. If the mere signing the document in April previous made him a stockholder he could have insisted upon his right to participate in the proceedings, and if the amount of stock subscribed for by him was sufficient he might have been elected a director. That would be the necessary legal result of the position he would so claim, but who would venture to assert that by his mere signature to the document in question he could acquire such a position, and yet to bind him as a shareholder it becomes necessary to admit the position I have stated.\nThe appellant claims that the respondent was a shareholder in the company from the time of the allotment of shares, but if the signature of the respondent to the agreement was sufficient to bind him, then no allotment was necessary to be shown. If the agreement, however, is not sufficient alone, and that the allotment was necessary, does it not legitimately follow that a notice of it became necessary? If the signature of the respondent was to the regular stock book of the company after being organized, no allotment would require to be shown, and does not the acknowledged necessity for showing the allotment at the same time characterize the document signed as an incomplete contract? If so incomplete, does it not necessarily require, to complete it, that notice should have been proved of the allotment within a reasonable time. I cannot see how the company at the time of the judgment at the suit of the appellant against the company could have enforced the contract as one fully completed against the respondent. He, in fact, never was a shareholder in the company, and the company never during the seven or eight years after he signed the document treated him as such. He never was called upon to pay any call on his shares, never had any notice to attend a meeting of the company, nor did he attend any. I am free to admit that if he at any time became a shareholder, the company could not by laches or otherwise release him from his liability to its creditors, and that nothing but the payment in full of his stock would release him; but I have been unable to realise his position as being at any period a stockholder. Once a stockholder, a subscriber to the regular stock book, which latter itself would show him to be one, I am free to admit that if he became a delinquent in the payment of subsequent calls, he might by the by-laws be incapacitated from voting at or taking part in any meeting of the company, but still be liable to the company or its judgment creditors for any balance due on his stock; but that I hold is not the case here.\nThe statutes make the shareholders answerable to creditors for the amount due on their stock to the company, but do not include those who merely signed a conditional agreement to take stock when allotted, and whose contract is left open for want of notice of such allotment. Sec. 80 of chapter 66 of the Consolidated Statutes, referred to in the Act of Incorporation, provides for the liability of its shareholders thus: \u201cEach shareholder shall be individually liable to the creditors of the company to an amount equal to the amount unpaid of the stock held by him,\u201d &c. It will be observed that the only term used is \u2018shareholder,\u2019 and he is to be held liable \u201cto an amount equal to the stock held by him.\u201d In either case, in order to make him liable he must be a shareholder holding stock in the company, or the right to do so. Sub-sec. 19, sec. 2 of the same act, defines the term \u201cshareholder.\u201d \u201cThe word shareholder shall mean every subscriber to or holder of stock in the undertaking, &c.\u201d But the term subscriber to stock is one who by his own act and that of the company becomes a subscriber. No one can be a subscriber to stock so as to make him a shareholder without the concurrence of the company through its officers. I must say I think the evidence of his ever having been a shareholder is wholly insufficient.\nBy the charter the provisional directors were authorized to open stock books, but they could be only provisional, and it would be as monstrous in my opinion to bind the subscribers thereby absolutely as it would be to bind the provisional directors to allot shares to every one who subscribed for them. The provisional directors guarded themselves, for what reason we need not inquire, by inserting the words \u201cwhen allotted,\u201d but as I look at the document, I am of opinion they had also the inherent right to reject the application of any subscriber they pleased. The true legal meaning in my opinion, of the document signed by the respondent, amounts to this and to nothing more: \u201cI hereby undertake to take and pay for fifty shares in your company if allotted to me. I will wait a reasonable time for your acceptance of my offer, and if in the meantime I hear nothing from you I shall conclude you have not accepted my offer, and shall otherwise dispose of the funds I shall keep for that reasonable time uninvested and unemployed.\u201d What the provisional directors did after the respondent subscribed was known to them, but not to him. The charter authorized the issue of stock to the extent of a million dollars, and when he received no notice of allotment to him he might very well have presumed they had got other subscribers that they preferred to him. The fact of their raising and paying into the bank $30,000, being ten per cent. of $300,000 required by the charter to be paid before organizing, shows there must have been sufficient so ck without his to organize the company, and that being the case the directors might have considered it unnecessary, and, in view of the bad feeling existing between Laidlaw, the most active promoter and him, failed to notify him of the allotment. Whatever the reason, they certainly gave none, and I have no doubt that in law they were bound to have done so.\nReference has been made to the fact that the respondent went into several counties to forward the interests of the company, but that took place before he subscribed for the stock, and his doing so could not in the least affect the transaction. It is also suggested that after he subscribed as he alleges, conditionally upon his getting the contract for building the road, it was an improper act to allow his subscribed stock to form a portion of the published list of stock absolutely to be taken, which was dependent on the contingency. With that I do not think we have anything to do. If he bon\u00e2 fide expected to retain his subscription by obtaining the contract, I can see nothing to reprehend, or fraudulent, in his permitting his subscription to appear before the public. If he had got the contract which he says was promised him, I have no doubt he would have waived the want of notice of allotment, but in my view of the law he would not be bound, under the document he subscribed, even in that event, to have accepted it in the absence of notice of allotment. Before closing my remarks I think it not out of place to state that I have carefully read the judgments of the seven learned judges before whom this case was argued, and no one of them suggested that the subscription of the list was binding as a complete contract, but held the opposite view, which seems not to have been contested. The judgments of four of them were based on the assumption that there was evidence to show an allotment and knowledge of it by the respondent, while three judges of the Appeal Court considered the evidence of notice of the allotment insufficient.\nChief Justice Hagarty, in his judgment, says:\u2014\nAfter the first trial, this case with that of Newman v. Ginty was argued in the Common Pleas and was sent down for another trial. The general principle was settled, that after proof of defendants subscription there should, in the language of Mr. Justice Gwynne[52] \u201cbe shown to be some response, either in writing or verbally, or by conduct communicating to the defendant that the company had accepted his application and himself as a shareholder.\u201d\nMy own language there was: I concur in thinking that our best course is to direct a new trial, so as to have it expressly found as a fact, whether the defendant was notified or received notice in any shape, or was made aware of the company having accepted him as a stockholder according to his sub-scription\u2014notice in substance that the directors, or the company assented to or accepted him as a holder of the subscribed shares.\nThe same doctrine was held by all the other judges. The only differences between them was as to the sufficiency of the proof of notice of allotment.\nBefore arriving at the conclusion I have stated, I considered fully the law as applicable to the question of notice of allotment. Some would appear to think that if the respondent found out through other means than from the directors that they had accepted his application or agreement to take shares, it would bind him. I differ with those who say so. If a notice of allotment be necessary in any case it is necessary to come directly from the one party to the other. Whatever the directors did amongst themselves could not bind the respondent, unless by some binding act of theirs, on which he could rely, they communicated their acceptance to him of his offer to take the shares. If a party to whom an offer is made accepts it by words or in writing to the party making it, the contract is completed, but if after resolving to accept the offer a communication by words or in writing is made to other parties without any authority or request to inform the other party of the acceptance of his offer, and the party who made the offer accidentally hears from third parties that the offer was accepted, he would not be bound by such information. Nor would the other party be bound. The one party may contend that he is not bound by what he hears from third parties whose communication would bind none of the parties, and the other may as properly say: \u201cI resolved to accept your offer, but as I did not communicate that resolution to you the bargain never was closed, because I did not communicate any acceptance to you.\u201d At the most a jury in this case might possibly find in the evidence sufficient to infer that the respondent had outside knowledge of the intention to accept, but as I view the law a judge would not be justified on the evidence in submitting such an issue to them.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below confirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. I cannot see that, by subscribing for shares as he did, Manning became a shareholder in pr\u0153senti; no company existed then as a matter of fact. The receiv- ing of subscriptions were provisional acts towards the organization of the company. It might have been that not a sufficient number of shares would have been subscribed for, and so there would have been then no company. Then, if Manning\u2019s subscription was only an offer to take shares, that offer, to bind him, must have been accepted by the company and notice of such acceptance given to him within a reasonable time. Such an acceptance did take place, but no notice thereof was ever given to him. Without this notice there was nothing to bind him. I need not say that, though the principles which govern this case are the same in the province where I come from as in Ontario, and consequently there are no new questions for me in the case, yet I have felt great embarrassment in coming to a conclusion, and have vaccillated a good deal about it. The diversity of opinions in this court and in the Ontario courts demonstrates that the case is far from being free of difficulties. After the fullest consideration I have come to the conclusion to dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThis appeal opens a point which, by reason of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Denison v. Lesslie[53], was not available to the plaintiff in the courts below, namely, whether the instrument signed by the defendant constituted a completed contract, or is to be regarded as an application only for shares, requiring a response from the company signifying to the defendant the fact of his application having been acceded to and of his having been himself accepted as a shareholder.\nThe difficulty upon this point has arisen from the form of the certificates of allotment adopted by the provisional directors, or it may be by their secretary, at a period posterior to the subscription by the defendant of his name in the stock book of the company as a holder of fifty shares in the capital stock of the company, a certificate which, according to the defendant\u2019s own showing, could have had no operation upon his mind, for his contention is that he never saw one until at the trial of this action, and the main contention before us was that because he had not received one, he is not a shareholder.\nThat the defendant, in signing his name in the stock book, did not conceive that he was setting his name to an application merely for shares, calling for a response either of acceptance or of refusal from the company, but that he understood that he was executing a contract made by him, as a shareholder, and completed by his name being subscribed in the stock book for fifty shares, is to my mind abundantly apparent.\nBy the second section of the special act incorporating the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway Co.[54], several enumerated clauses of the General Railway Act[55], and, among those, the clauses respecting \u201cInterpretation\u201d and \u201cShareholders\u201d are incorporated with and made part of the special Act. By the former of these clauses in sec. 7, sub-secs. 5 and 19 of the general Act, it is enacted that in the special act the word \u201cshareholder\u201d shall mean \u201cevery subscriber to, and holder of, stock in the undertaking,\u201d and the personal representatives of such shareholder, and by sec. 80 of the general Act, it is enacted that each \u201cshareholder\u201d shall be individually liable to the creditors of the company to an amount equal to the amount unpaid on the stock held by him for the debts and liabilities of the company, and until the whole amount of his stock has been paid up. Then by the 8th sec. of the special act the capital stock of the company was declared to be $3,000,000 divided into $30,000 shares of $100 each, and by the 14th section it was enacted that as soon as shares to the amount of $300,000, or one\u2011tenth part of the capital stock, shall have been subscribed other than by municipalities, and ten per cent. thereof paid into some chartered bank having an office in Toronto (which on no account shall be withdrawn therefrom except for the service of the company), the directors shall call a general meeting of the subscribers to the said capital stock, who shall have so paid up ten per cent. thereof, for the purpose of electing directors of the said company.\nBy sec. 15, it is provided that in case the provisional directors neglect to call such meeting for the space of three months after such amount of capital stock shall have been subscribed and ten per cent. thereof so paid up, the same may be called by any five of the subscribers who shall have so paid up ten per cent., and who are subscribers among them for not less than $1,000 of the said capital stock, and who have paid up all calls thereon.\nBy sec. 17 it is enacted that at such general meeting the \u201csubscribers for the capital stock\u201d assembled who shall have paid up the ten per cent. thereof, with such proxies as may be present, shall elect the regular board of directors. By the 27th sec. it is enacted that on the subscription for shares of the said capital stock each \u201csubscriber\u201d shall pay forthwith to the directors, for the purposes set out in the act, ten per cent. of the amount subscribed by him, and the directors shall deposit the same in some chartered bank to the credit of the company; and by the 7th section, it is enacted that the provisional directors, who are named in the act and empowered to act as directors until the election of directors by the stockholders, shall have power to open stock books, to make a call upon the shares subscribed therein, to call a meeting of the subscribers thereto for the election of other directors. Now it is apparent that the opening of stock books was for the purpose of obtaining therein subscriptions for shares in the capital stock of the company, and that subscribers for shares therein\u2014\u201cSubscribers to,\u201d \u201cfor,\u201d or \u201cof\u201d the capital stock\u2014and \u201cshareholders\u201d are equivalent expressions to represent what, by sec. 7, sub-sees. 5 and 19 of the general Railway Act, is declared to be the meaning of the term \u201cshareholder,\u201d namely, \u201cevery subscriber to, and holder of, stock in the undertaking.\u201d\nIt has been held, and I think well held, in Denison v. Lesslie[56], that the paying of the 10 per cent. at the time of subscribing is not made by the act a condition precedent requisite to make the person subscribing a shareholder. It was competent for the provisional directors to open stock books, to obtain subscriptions for stock therein, and to postpone the period for the payment of the 10 per cent. by the subscribers for such stock until the $300,000 of stock necessary to be subscribed to enable the company to organize should Be subscribed, when the directors might make a demand or call upon all subscribers for stock in the stock books for payment of the ten per cent.\nThe payment of the 10 per cent. is made a condition precedent only to the right of voting, that privilege being by the act conferred only upon those subscribers who shall have paid the 10 per cent. It is the subscription for the stock which the act makes a condition precedent to the accruing of the privilege, as well as of the liability to be called upon to pay the 10 per cent. The account given by the defendant himself in a suit similar to this of Jaffray v. Manning, the evidence in which case is part of the evidence made use of in this case, is this. He says: \u201cGeorge Laidlaw asked me to take these shares.\u201d It may be here observed that this George Laidlaw was one of the provisional directors and the chief promoter of the company and the undertaking; the defendant describes him as the moving spirit in the undertaking, without whom there would have been no Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway. Defendant then says:\u2014\nI refused to take stock in the first place, then there was a verbal agreement made between Laidlaw and myself. I would not have taken the stock except for the inducement that Laidlaw offered. He asked Ginty and myself to take stock and I refused. He wanted to raise a large amount of stock here, so as to show to the people outside who were giving bonuses that the people here were contributing largely to the undertaking. He agreed that if we took stock we should get the contract for building the road, that we should not be called upon to pay unless we got the contract, and that if we got the contract under any circumstances we should not be called upon to pay more than ten per cent upon the stock. Upon that agreement and conversation we agreed to take the stock. I think we each took stock separately. We tendered for the Nipissing work and got it, we also tendered for the Grey & Bruce Railway and did not get it. Laidlaw was the only one who made the agreement with me. If I had got the contract I understood that my stock would be paid out of my estimates, but not more than ten per cent. I supposed that if I had got the contract I should have been in the same position as any other stockholder. I subscribed to the Toronto and Nipissing on the same terms, they were separate transactions, but Laidlaw was acting in both as the prime originator. We got the contract for the Nipissing; I paid up my stock in full in this; my stock was paid principally out of my estimates.\nThen, in his evidence in the present case, he repeats:\nIt was Mr. Laidlaw who asked both of us, (that is defendant and Ginty,) at the corner of King and Church streets. Mr. Laidlaw asked me to take stock. He asked Ginty and me together. An agreement was made verbally, that if we did not get the contract we were not to be considered stockholders; we afterwards tendered.\nHaving said that he had signed the stock book on a verbal agreement between him and Laidlaw, that if he did not get the contract the subscription was to go for nothing, he was asked: \u201cWhy then did he want you to put your name on at all?\u201d To which he replied: I supposed that he was making up his stock list to see how much he could get to enable him to comply with the charter.\nThe stock book was signed by the defendant and his seal set thereto as his act and deed in the presence of a Mr. C.J. Campbell, who signed his name thereto as subscribing witness, and who says that he went out as broker of the company, being also a provisional director, to get subscribers to the stock book. He does not appear to have had, nor is it alleged that he had, any knowledge of the verbal agreement spoken to by the defendant as having been made with him by Laidlaw. From this evidence it is plain that the defendant never entertained the idea that he was merely making an application for shares, to which he expected a response from the company signifying whether they would allow him to have any shares and accept him as a shareholder. The character of the whole proceeding is totally different, in fact the very reverse of this. The provisional directors, under the provisions of the act, open stock books for the purpose of obtaining therein subscriptions for stock, in order to enable the company to be organized, which could only be done after the subscriptions should be obtained therein for $300,000 stock subscribed. One of these books is placed in the hands of a broker who is himself a provisional director, and who is authorized to get persons willing to take stock to subscribe therein for as many shares as they may please to hold. The defendant, according to his own showing, instead of being an applicant for shares is canvassed and pressed by a provisional director, not to become an applicant for shares but to become a shareholder, and to take as many shares as he wished to take by subscribing therefor in the company\u2019s stock book. At length the defendant consents, being moved thereto, as he says, by a verbal agreement made with him by the provisional director who solicited him to become a shareholder. The defendant thereupon goes and signs his name in the stock book opened by the provisional directors as a subscriber for fifty shares in the capital stock of the company. The book so signed contains a covenant signed by every one subscribing for shares, expressing the terms of their subscription, but the defendant contends that his subscription is to be affected by a collateral verbal agreement made, as he alleges, with him by one of some twenty provisional directors. The provisional director so referred to denies that any such agreement as that spoken of by the defendant ever was made. However, whether it was made or not, matters not. The principle of Elkington\u2019s case[57] and of Bridgers\u2019 case[58] is that which must govern upon this point, namely, that if the defendant\u2019s agreement was to become a shareholder in pr\u0153senti, with a collateral agreement as to what should be the effect of his subscription contract if he should not get a contract to build the road, which is, as it appears to me, the true light in which to view his own evidence, then the defendant is a shareholder, and is liable in this action; but if the agreement which the defendant entered into was that, if and when a contract should be given to him for building the road, he would subscribe for and become a shareholder in the undertaking to the extent of fifty shares, then he would not be liable unless nor until he should get the contract to build the road. But it is to the instrument signed in the stock book under the defendant\u2019s hand and seal (construed in the light of the surrounding circumstances), that we must look to determine what the defendant\u2019s contract was, and that cannot be qualified by any verbal agreement such as that spoken of by the defendant. Now, looking at the stock book, we find that the defendant subscribed an agreement prepared for signature, and signed by all persons taking stock in the undertaking, under the provisions of the Act of Incorporation, which is as follows:\nWe the several persons, firms and corporations, whose names and seals are hereunto subscribed, severally and respectively agree to and with the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway Co., and bind ourselves, our executors and administrators or successors respectively to become holders of the capital stock of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway Co. for the number of shares of one hundred dollars each and amounts set opposite to our respective names, and upon the allotment by the said company of my or our said respective shares we severally and respectively agree to pay to the said company ten per centum of the amount of the said shares respectively, and to pay all future calls that may be made on the said shares respectively, provided always that no calls shall be made until sixty days shall have elapsed from the time that a previous call was made payable, and no call shall exceed ten per centum of the amount subscribed.\nAmong several other persons who subscribed this covenant in the stock books was the defendant, who subscribed by himself for \u201c50 shares, amount $5,000.\u201d Now if the body of the above agreement had stopped at the words, \u201cfor the number of shares of one hundred dollars each and amounts set opposite to our respective names\u201d with the \u201c50 shares,\u201d and amount $5,000 opposite the name of the defendant subscribed by himself, it is not disputed that the taking of the shares would have been complete, and the defendant beyond all doubt or question would have been a shareholder in pr\u0153senti, whatever agreement, if any, had been made as to the mode of payment, or as to any conditions regulating the payment of calls, but it is to be observed that what follows does not qualify what had gone before, which related to the taking and subscribing, for stock. The agreement is not that if and when the company shall allot to the several parties named the number of shares set opposite to their respective names, they will accept such shares and subscribe the stock book. If that had been the intention, the agreement would not have been entered in the stock book, which the provisional directors were by their act of incorporation empowered to open for the purpose of having shares subscribed for therein, but the agreement is that the subscribers in the stock book, of the several shares and amounts set opposite to their respective names, will pay the calls in certain events, namely, upon allotment of the said shares so subscribed for the first call of ten per centum and all future calls that may be made, provided, &c., &c. It is the subscribers for shares, who, under their hands and seals, covenant to pay the calls, and the qualification involved in the expression \u201cand upon allotment by the said company of our said respective shares, &c., &c.,\u201d whatever may have been intended by that, is attached only to the payment of the calls upon the stock then subscribed for. The expression, in view of the fact appearing in the defendant\u2019s evidence that he was pressed to take the stock, and did so, being moved thereto by the verbal collateral agreement of which he spoke, and that he signed his name in the book for the fifty shares for the purpose of assisting in showing upon the stock book the subscription of the amount necessary to enable the company to organize under their act, is, it must, I think, be confessed, an inappropriate one; for the circumstances show that the defendant was subscribing for shares pressed upon him, and not proposing to take stock which the company might or might not afterwards allot to him. It is sufficient for the purposes of this suit to say that the nature of the transaction was not an application for shares by the defendant requiring a response to be signified to the company before his contract to become a shareholder should be complete, but an actual acceptance by him of stock offered to him and a subscription therefor by him in the stock book of the company, it was a completed contract, and taking of the stock, and a covenant by the defendant as a subscriber for the stock to pay the calls in certain named contingencies, and thereby the defendant brought himself within the statutory definition of a \u201cshareholder,\u201d that is to say, \u201ca subscriber for stock in the undertaking,\u201d and this, upon the authority of Moss v. Steam Gondola Co.[59], Bailey v. The Universal Provident Life Association[60], and Ness v. Angus[61], is all that is required to make the defendant liable to the plaintiff in a proceeding of this nature. It might be that the defendant, although a subscriber for stock in the undertaking within the meaning of the statute, might never have become liable to pay to the company any calls thereon, by reason of the contingencies, upon the happening of which the same respectively became payable under the defendant\u2019s covenant, never having happened; or it may be that the company might never have made any calls upon the stock, or might never have asked for, or required, any payment from the defendant in respect of his stock, relying, as the defendant says Laidlaw informed him he did, upon constructing the railway upon bonuses so as to make the stock almost free; but whether or not the contingencies happened which, in the terms of the defendant\u2019s covenant, made the calls or any of them recoverable by the company, or whether or not the company ever asked for or required from the defendant payment of the first call of 10 per cent. upon the amount subscribed for by him, or of any other call, still the defendant would be liable to the plaintiff in this proceeding if he comes, as by signing the stock book as a subscriber for fifty shares I think he does, within the statutory definition of a \u201cshareholder.\u201d If calls had not been made, the effect in such case would only be to make the amount to be reached by a process of this nature at the suit of creditors larger than it would be if some calls had been made and paid. In this case, however, it appears that the provisional directors, with the view, no doubt, of subjecting the defendant to a liability under his covenant to pay the first call of ten per centum, did go through the form of directing the secretary to issue allotment certificates to each shareholder for the amount held by him. It is the form adopted (apparently by the secretary) for this certificate which has given occasion to the discussion upon this point, for, aside from the expression in this form, there is nothing that I can see affording foundation for an argument that the subscription by the defendant in the company\u2019s stock book was merely an application for 50 shares. In my judgment the plaintiff was entitled to succeed upon the record in this action upon the ground, notwithstanding the form of the certificate, that the defendant, by subscribing his name in the stock book as a subscriber for 50 shares, amounting to $5,000 in the capital stock of the company, had brought himself within the statutory definition of a \u201cshareholder\u201d without any further assent by the company being necessary to his becoming a subscriber for that amount. I cannot doubt that by his subscription in the stock book the defendant acquired the right to compel the company to receive his 10 per cent. if he had pleased to tender it so as to entitle him to the privilege of voting or of selling his shares if they had risen to a premium. He was by his signature in the stock book a subscriber for the 50 shares, whatever qualification from the form of the defendant\u2019s covenant may have been imposed upon the company affecting their right to enforce against the defendant\u2019s will payment of calls.\nThe certificate prepared for the defendant is as follows:\u2014 Toronto, 1st July, 1869.\nTo Alexander Manning, Esq., Toronto:\u2014\nThis is to certify that the Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway Company, in accordance with your application for 50 shares of $100 each of their capital stock, have allotted to you 50 shares amounting to $5,000, the first instalment of 10 per cent. thereon being payable forthwith, and all future calls to be made at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent. on the amount of said shares and at intervals of not less than sixty days.\nW. Sutherland Taylor,\nSecretary.\nThe case in the court below turned upon the question whether or not in writing, verbally, or by conduct, the defendant had had notice or knowledge that the company regarded him to be a shareholder, his subscription in the stock book having, upon the authority of Denison v. Lesslie[62] been assumed to be a mere application for shares requiring some response from the company. The learned judge before whom the case was tried found as matter of fact, that the defendant subscribed for the 50 shares in the stock book; that the 50 shares were allotted to him by the company; that the company sent notices to him of calls; that his name was published in the Globe newspaper as a shareholder, and that during the period of such publication the defendant was a subscriber to the Globe; that all was done by the company to give to the defendant a claim against the company for the stock, and to have any benefits that might accrue therefrom. He added that he could not say that the defendant received actual notice of the allotment, but he found as a fact that the company by notices sent to his address gave him notice of their considering him a shareholder.\nNow it appears to me that it would be highly improper and indeed mischievous that a court sitting in appeal should reverse these findings of the learned judge, upon whom devolved the special duty of endea- voring to reconcile conflicting evidence\u2014of observing the manner in which the several witnesses gave their evidence, although the credibility of none of them was attacked\u2014and, with the advantage of that observation, of arriving at a just conclusion upon the question submitted. Starting with the admission by the defendant that he had subscribed for the shares upon a verbal promise that by doing so he should secure a contract to build the road, which, as he says, was promised him, and that relying upon such promise he had tendered for the contract so promised after the company had become so organized as to enable it to give a contract for building the road, to assist in reaching which point his subscription had been asked for and given; contrasting also the defendant\u2019s admission in the former case of Jaffray v. Manning, \u201cthat he may have been notified of the first call,\u201d with his denial now of having received any notice of call, it is obvious that in order to arrive at a just conclusion one way or the other, upon the question submitted, not only was great care necessary in the endeavor to reconcile conflicting evidence, but in forming his judgment the learned judge would naturally be influenced by the manner in which the respective witnesses gave their evidence, as well as by the way in which the defendant professed to explain how his view could be reconciled with matter testified to, and which appeared to the learned judge to be established by other witnesses. It is obvious that the learned judge, as well from the manner of the defendant giving his evidence as from its matter, would have to estimate the proper degree of weight to be attached to the defendant\u2019s memory when he now says that he never received any notice of calls, when the judge was satisfied from independent evidence that such notices were sent to the defendant\u2019s address, and when it appeared that in Jaffray v. Manning the defendant admitted that he might have been notified of the first call; so likewise, when it appeared that the list of shareholders with the defendant\u2019s name on it was published for sometime in the Globe newspaper, to which paper at the time the defendant was a subscriber, and when it appeared that the defendant tendered for the contract to build the road in pursuance, as he says, of the promise made to him upon the faith of which he had subscribed, and that he took great umbrage at the promise not being kept, I confess it seems to me to be difficult to conceive a case in which the manner in which the several witnesses gave their evidence would form a more essential feature in enabling a jury, or a judge acting as a jury, to determine which was the most proper conclusion of fact to arrive at. A court, not having the opportunities which the judge at the trial had, assumes in such a case a grave responsibility, when it ventures to reverse the conclusions on matters of fact of the judge who had them; a responsibility which, in my judgment, should never be assumed by a Court of Appeal, unless the matter of the evidence conveys to the minds of the judges sitting in appeal a clear conviction that the conclusions of fact arrived at by the learned judge who tried the cause are erroneous. In the case before us, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, consisting of three judges, one of whom was the judge who tried the cause, and who had, therefore, an opportunity of conveying to his brother judges in consultation the impression made by the respective witnesses upon his mind during the progress of the trial, has concurred in his findings. One of the four judges of the Court of Appeal takes the same view. How is it possible then to say that conclusions of fact so concurred in are so clearly erroneous as to justify a Court of Appeal in reversing them? It is admitted that if a jury had found, as the learned judge who heard the witnesses, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, of which he is a member, have found, it would not have been competent for the Court of Appeal to reverse the findings; but a distinction has been drawn between the effect of matters of fact found by a judge trying a case without a jury, and the effect of the finding of the same matters by a jury, and in support of this distinction the observations of Lord Justice Bramwell in Tones v. Hough[63], have been referred to, but these observations do not appear to me to go further than the rule as I have stated it above. True it is, although by the course of procedure in Ontario either party may have issues joined in an action at law tried by a jury, or by a judge without a jury, at their option, it is known that the full court in which the action is pending may be moved to review the judge\u2019s findings upon matters of fact upon the evidence as taken before him; but it is discretionary with the court to grant the motion or to refuse it, and if the case be clear it is not unusual to refuse it. Now, what Lord Justice Bramwell holds is that, when the decision of a judge of first instance, finding matters of fact without the aid of a jury, is brought before a court by way of appeal, and the judges of the court sitting in appeal see that the conclusions arrived at by the learned judge who tried the case are erroneous upon the materials before him, they should not accept his finding, but should exercise their own independent judgment. These observations do not touch the point as to the weight to be attached to the finding of a judge of first instance upon matters of fact, when such finding from the nature of the case depends upon the credibility of the witnesses examined before him, or upon the manner in which they give their evidence, or upon the balancing conflicting testimony where no imputation may be cast upon the honesty and credibility of any of the witnesses. They relate to cases where, from the materials before the judge, and which are brought before the Court of Appeal, the latter can clearly pronounce the finding of the judge at the trial to be erroneous. The particular question which arose in the case in which the observations occur was whether the judge at the trial was correct in finding that the defendant was guilty of conversion of goods put on board his ship, because he had sailed with his vessel without a bill of lading of the goods having been signed. The case was one as to the proper inference to be drawn from facts as to which there was no dispute. In such a case there can be no doubt that it is within the jurisdiction and the power and the duty of a Court of Appeal to interfere and to pronounce the finding of the learned judge to be erroneous, if convinced that it was so; but such language is manifestly inapplicable to a case in which the manner of the witnesses, as well as the matter of their evidence, must, or may, be an essential ingredient to enable a judge to balance conflicting evidence, for this is a species of testimony which cannot be brought before the court sitting in appeal. The same learned Lord Justice had already held in a case from the Court of Chancery tried before a Vice-Chancellor who had seen the witnesses, that a Court of Appeal ought not to reverse the finding of the Vice-Chancellor upon matters of fact, unless satisfied that he was wrong, and proceeded to say:\u2014\nI feel satisfied, and I need not say I say it with perfect respect, that I can put my finger upon the error or the mistake which the Vice-Chancellor made, and I am satisfied that if he had had those materials before him which we now have [the court had allowed additional evidence to be given] he would not have made the mistake, if indeed, it can be properly said to have been a mistake of his making[64].\nThe general rule laid down by the Privy Council, sub- ject to possible exceptions, is that they will not reverse the concurrent findings of two courts upon a question of fact, and the test to be applied to determine whether there have been the judgments of two courts, is to enquire whether the first judgment, if not appealed or brought in review before the second tribunal adjudicating in the matter, would have been a conclusive judgment, or whether it required confirmation by the tribunal before becoming operative[65]. But the rule of universal application in all courts is that enunciated in the House of Lords in Gray v. Turnbull[66], where Lord Chelmsford says:\u2014\nUpon a question of fact an appellate tribunal ought not to be called upon to decide which side preponderates on a mere balance of evidence. Different minds will, of course, draw different conclusions from the same facts.\nAnd he comes to the conclusion, that upon an appeal from the decision of the judges of the court of first instance, it should be irresistibly established to the satisfaction of the appellate tribunal that the opinion of the judge or judges on the question of fact was not only wrong but entirely erroneous; and Lord Westbury, in the same case, said:\u2014\nIn the English tribunals, when a question of fact has once been decided by the verdict of a jury, it requires an overwhelming case of error by the jury, or the disregard of some cardinal rule of law, to induce the court to grant a new trial. Unquestionably I should have pressed upon your lordships to abide by that rule if it had not been that the case now brought before us has unfortunately been decided, not on evidence taken in the presence of the court, but upon the written depositions of witnesses; and it has been the practice in courts of equity, where that mode of taking evidence prevails, to allow appeals on matters of fact, although the court below has felt no hesitation in the conclusion to be arrived at on the deposition; but if we open a door to an appeal of this kind, undoubtedly it will be an obligation upon the appellant to prove a case that admits of no doubt whatever. Now, applying the principle of these cases, it is impossible to say that the findings of the learned judge at the trial are erroneous; for my own part I cannot say that I am at all disposed to differ from them; and adopting them, as consistently with the principle of the above cases, we must, I can see no other conclusion resulting from them than that arrived at by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench concurred in by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, the majority of which court, in my opinion, erred, in reversing that judgment; and this appeal from the judgment of that court should therefore be allowed, and the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench restored, with costs as well upon this ground as upon the other.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant: Lauder & Proctor.\nAttorneys for respondent: Ferguson, Bain, Gordon & Shepley.\n[1] 5 Ont.

The policy sued on was on a printed form and had the attestation: \u201cIn witness whereof, The London Life Insurance Co., of London, Ont., have caused these presents to be signed by its president, and attested by its secretary and delivered at the head office in the city of London, &c.\u201d\nTo a plea that the policy sued on was not sealed, and therefore not binding upon the appellants, the plaintiff replied on equitable grounds, alleging that the defendants accepted the deceased\u2019s application for insurance, and that the policy was issued and acted upon by all parties as a valid policy, but the seal was inadvertently omitted to be affixed, and claiming that the defendants should be estopped from setting up the absence of the seal or ordered to affix it.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the setting up of \u201cthe want of a seal,\u201d as a defence, was a fraud which a court of equity could not refuse to interfere to prevent, without ignoring its functions and its duty to prevent and redress all fraud whenever and in whatever shape it appears; and therefore the respondent was entitled to the relief prayed as founded upon the facts alleged in her equitable replication.\n[Ritchie, C.J., and Taschereau, J., dissenting.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing appeals from the judgments of the Courts of Queen\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas, in this and eight similar cases.\nThe action was brought to recover the amount of an accident insurance policy upon the life of John Wright, the father of the respondent. The policy was issued on 8th September, 1875, and the death of the insured occurred on 7th December of that year.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne hereinafter given. See also reports of the case, 5 Ont. App. R. 218 and 29 U.C.C.P. 221. Mr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellants:\n[The argument of counsel upon the question of fact whether the death had been accidental or not, was not entertained by the Court, and is therefore omitted.]\nThe alleged policies of the appellants\u2019 company do not purport to be under their seal.\nThe appellants are incorporated by Act of the Legislature of Ontario (37 Vic., c. 85).\nIt is by section 7 of the said Act, amongst other things, enacted as follows: \u201cNo contract shall be valid unless made under the seal of the company, &c.\u201d\nMr. Justice Patterson in the court below gave his judgment upon the ground that this paper could be treated as an interim receipt. The other judges admitted that there was no evidence to go to the jury to show that this was a contract; but the Court of Common Pleas thought that an equitable replication of estoppel should be allowed to be pleaded, and the Court of Appeal were of opinion that a count in the nature of a bill for specific performance should be allowed to be added.\nThe appellants submit that both views were erroneous.\nAs to the interim receipt Mr. Justice Patterson seems to have been under the impression that no form of \u201cinterim receipt\u201d used by the appellants had been used. This was erroneous, as may be seen by the case. Moreover, it was only to be a temporary contract.\nThe declaration in the case imported that the instrument upon which the plaintiff was suing was a sealed instrument. After trial, and after the verdict had been moved against, the Court of Common Pleas gave leave to the plaintiff to add an equitable replication, and it was only in the Court of Appeal that appellants got leave to plead to this equitable replication. I contend the Court of Common Pleas had no jurisdiction in such a case, the Court of Chancery being the proper forum. The record in this case presents the anomaly of a plaintiff suing upon a policy of insurance, and the issues arising upon that action being tried, and all of them going to the whole cause of action, determined by a jury against the plaintiff, and then the Court of Appeal taking up a distinct and separate head of relief, upon evidence not taken before it but directed to a different end, usurping the function of a court of original jurisdiction, and decreeing in effect the specific performance of a contract.\nThe Court of Appeal did not try the other two issues itself apart from the findings of the jury, but while it discarded the findings of the jury upon one issue adopted their findings upon the other two issues.\nThere being no representation of a seal having been affixed the appellants submit that no estoppel could arise, in respect of which a Court of Equity could estop the appellants from pleading the want of a seal.\nThe statute is just as binding upon a Court of Equity as a Court of Law, and a Court of Equity could not decree specific performance of a contract against the appellants, unless that contract was entered into in the only way in which the defendants could contract.\nThe appellants are the creature of the legislature, and the same legislature has determined that the only way in which they can contract is under their seal.\nWhat right has any court to say that they may contract otherwise?\nThe cases referred to by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal, it is submitted, are distinguishable. There was not, in any of these cases, an express prohibition against contracting except under seal. It may be quite true that in cases where the act of incorporation is silent as to the mode of contracting by the corporation, the courts may determine that trading corporations are bound by contracts made otherwise than under their corporate seal, but that must be so determined only because the courts do not assume that in such cases the legislature did not intend to allow contracts to be authenticated in that way solely, but where the legislature has expressly declared, as in this case, that the contract shall not be binding, except when under seal, the appellants submit that no Court of Equity can enforce a contract not so authenticated. Hunt v. The Wimbledon Local Board of Health[1]; Newd v. Dunnett[2]; Brice on ultra vires[3]; Montreal Ass. Co. v. McGillivray[4]; Sumott v. London Dock Co.[5]; Kelly v. The Isolated Risk[6]; Hardcastle on Statutes[7].\nMr. Scott for respondent:\nIf it was necessary that an amendment should be made in the pleadings by adding the equitable replication, the courts in term had ample power to make such amendment[8], and the Court of Appeal has similar powers[9].\nThe appellants object that an amendment should not be allowed when it raises a new issue, but every amendment necessarily does this, and courts are always entitled to amend, and then judge as to whether the amendment renders necessary a new trial. In this case no new issue was really raised, all the facts being either admitted or found by the jury, and the sole question was whether on those facts the respondent was entitled\u2014the record being first put into a proper shape\u2014to succeed. Both courts have power to take further evidence[10].\nAs to the defence for want of a seal, I don\u2019t think any court of justice would sustain it. The instrument was produced at the trial, and the effect of the jury\u2019s verdict, I contend, is that the policy was delivered sealed.\nThe evidence before the jury was that, as a matter of law, the appellants could only issue policies under seal; that they issued and delivered to the assured this paper as a legal policy; that it purported to be an act not of the officers, but of the company; that they admitted, at a previous trial, that this paper was a policy binding on them; but that their inspector says that they did not seal their accident policies, and that his impression is that this particular policy is not sealed. No evidence was given that the appellants had any special common seal. Any seal affixed by the proper authority of a body corporate will suffice, and any impression would be sufficient[11].\nAnd there was ample evidence to go to the jury. Grellier v. Neale[12]; Talbot v. Hodson[13].\nThen the evidence is also such as to amount to an estoppel in pais upon the question of sealing, and on that ground the jury were justified in finding a verdict for the respondent. All the requisites of an estoppel exist in this case, and corporations are bound by an estoppel in the same way as individuals, and can waive their rights. Herman on Estoppel[14]; Bigelow on Estoppel[15]; Laird v. Birkenhead R.W. Co.[16]; Steven\u2019s Hospital v. Dyas, this was a case of a statute[17]; London & Birmingham R.W. Co. v. Winter[18]; Wilson v. West Hartleford R.W. Co.[19]\nThe cases relied upon by the appellants as to the necessity of a contract being under seal, do not apply here, as they all are cases where there never was any intention that a formal contract should be entered into by the corporations, and the contracts were, at the time they were attempted to be enforced, really incomplete. Here both parties intended to complete the contract, and, as a part of such completion, intended to do everything necessary to attain that end, and among these things to affix the seal.\nThe replication is not equivalent to a bill for specific performance, but is more in the nature of a bill to restrain an inequitable defence, and if such a bill would lie prior to the Administration of Justice Act a replication is now proper. The respondent submits that such a bill clearly would lie, and that a Court of Equity would not allow the appellants to take advantage of their own fraud in neglecting to affix the seal and delivering a worthless piece of paper as a valid and binding policy. Bond v. Hopkins[20]; Hovinden v. Annesley[21].\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply:\nThe applicant was dealing with a corporation and it was his duty to enquire what the power of the directors of the corporation were, and the moment he did so he would have to enquire what the statute enacted. Then nothing short of a paper signed and sealed can be said to be a binding representation.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nIn this case it is beyond dispute that the instrument declared on as a policy of insurance was not under seal and was not declared on as being under seal, nor did it purport to have been sealed, and the simple question, in my opinion, is: Can the plaintiff, not producing a contract under seal, recover in this action? The Ontario Act incorporating the London Life Insurance Company, 37 Vic., c. 85, s. 7, declaring the powers of the directors, after specifying certain particulars, enacts: \u201cAnd generally to transact all necessary matters and things connected with the business of the company, but no contract shall be valid unless made under the seal of the company and signed by the President or one of the directors, and countersigned by the manager, except the interim receipt of the company, which shall be binding upon the company on such conditions as may be thereon printed by direction of the Board.\u201d\nThe reason why interim receipts are thus excepted is very obvious, because practically they could not be sealed by the company, inasmuch as these interim receipts are issued by agents at a distance from the domicile of the company and transmitted to the company, and, as the name indicates, are subject to the acceptance or rejection by the company of the risk tendered to the agent, and to be in force for a certain number of days, or until, in the mean time, such acceptance or rejection by the company.\nIf accepted a policy issues, if rejected the insurance ceases; in either case the insurance, under the interim receipts, is at an end, and, if neither accepted nor rejected, is at an end at the expiration of the days named.\nHere is the copy of the interim receipt of this company as in evidence:\nLONDON LIFE INSURANCE CO\u2019Y, OF LONDON, ONT.\nAMOUNT, $... INTERIM RECEIPT.\u2014ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT. PREMIUM, $...\nReceived from................................of......................................................................Dollars, for which I agree to furnish him an Accident Insurance Policy in the above-named Company within thirty days from date, provided the Application is accepted and the Policy written by the Company, or to return the same to him, or his order, on demand.\n..........................................187................................Agent.\nSo far then as this company is concerned, it only obtains power to contract by virtue of the statute, and that power is specially conferred, and the statute has in prohibitory language declared that no contract shall be valid unless in the mode pointed out, and the clear declared policy and object of the statute is that this company, the creature of the legislature, so far as language can declare it, shall not be bound, except by contracts under seal. We have no right to inquire into the reason or motive which prompted the legislature to require this formality; it is, I think, our duty to say that all formalities required by the statute must be punctually complied with, and to declare that neither this court nor any other court has any right or power to dispense with a regulation so imperatively prescribed by the statute in such prohibitory language. I do not think it is for me to question the policy or impolicy of this provision, or any hardship which giving effect to this provision would entail in this case. I consider this enactment quite as binding and obligatory on Courts of Equity as Courts of Law. I know of no principle on which courts can set the statute law of the country at defiance and say that an artificial body, owing its existence to a statutory enactment, can contract without seal, when the legislature, which created the body, declares it shall not, or to make a binding contract for such a body corporate that they have not made for themselves. The very exception of interim receipts proves, I think, that the legislature intended that the term contract should apply to every other insurance contract, and to say that the company could make a contract of insurance such as is contained in the policy declared on in this case without its being sealed is, in my opinion, simply to repeal the statute. It is my duty to read the Act as it is written. The language is clear, plain, positive, free from all ambiguity, admitting of no doubt: the words are \u201cno contract shall be valid unless made under the seal of the company.\u201d There must be a binding contract to enable the plaintiff to recover either in law or equity. There has been no contract under seal, how then can I judicially say there has been a binding, legal, valid contract, unless I am prepared to set at naught an express legislative enactment, and so override the law of the land? The legislature has been pleased to say \u201cno contract shall be valid unless under seal.\u201d What right have I, sitting here to administer the law as it stands on the statute book, practically to repeal a provision so clear and unequivocal, and say that a contract shall be valid, which the legislature says in unmistakable language shall not be valid? The same difficulty exists as to specific performance or other relief in equity in this case as to a recovery at law.\nThe first point to be determined is to ascertain whether there is an agreement, for if no agreement the court cannot make one, and any bill filed must be dismissed, and how can there be any agreement when the Act expressly declares that these defendants shall not contract but in a particular manner? In other words, shall not make a contract of insurance, except by interim receipts, in any other manner than under seal. Therefore any contract, in order to lay the foundation of a suit at law or in equity, must be under seal. You cannot raise an equity without a contract, and you cannot get a contract without a seal.\nLet us now see what the authorities say as to the contracts of corporations generally not under seal, when there is no prohibitory clause, and then as to the effect of express statutory requirement of a seal.\nIn relation to trading corporations, modern cases have engrafted numerous exceptions on the old rule, that a corporation cannot contract except under seal, which rule is thus stated by Tindal, C.J., in Gibson v. East India Company[22]: The general rule of law is not denied on the part of the plaintiffs to be, that no action founded on contract can be maintained against a corporation aggregate, unless where such contract is under the seal of the corporation. Such, indeed, is the language of all the authorities beginning with those collected from Year Books in Bro. Abr, tit. Corporations and Capacities, down to the latest of the present day; the ground of that rule, as it is to be extracted from such authorities, being that as a corporation is a body politic and invisible, it can only act and speak by its common seal; or as it is said arguendo, in Rex v. Briggs[23], the common seal is the hand and mouth of the corporation.\nBut though, as said by Tindal, C.J., \u201cOn this general rule, both in ancient, and still more frequently and largely in modern times, have exceptions been grafted, so that it is now undoubted law, that in very many cases actions are maintainable in our courts upon contracts entered into, by and on behalf of corporations aggregate, though such contracts are not under seal,\u201d these exceptions have not abrogated the old rule, and had they done so this Act of incorporation prevents the engrafting of any exceptions with respect to contracts of insurance, except that named in the statute, and peremptorily prevents this company from effecting a valid contract of insurance except by instrument under seal.\nThe agreement, I think, must be considered as ranging itself, as was said by Tindal, C.J., in the same case, under that class of obligations which is described by jurists as imperfect obligations, obligations which want the vinculum juris, although binding in morals, equity and conscience, an agreement which the defendants, as was said there, \u201care bound in foro conscientiae to make good, but of which the performance is to be sought for by petition, memorial or remonstrance, not by action in a court of law,\u201d and Tindal., C.J., concludes his judgment thus:\nIt is enough, however, to say, though the company undoubtedly might, if they had thought proper, have made a grant under their common seal for the payment of this pension, by which they would have rendered themselves liable to an action in a court of law, yet they have not done so; and it appears to us that this grant, not under seal, does not fall within the reason or principle of the exception which has been above adverted to, and consequently that it must be governed by the general rule of law, that a corporation aggregate cannot be sued upon a contract not being under their common seal;\nIn Lamprell v. Billericay Union[24], an action for additional work, to which want of written directions from the architects was a complete answer so far as such claim depended on the deed, Rolfe, B., delivering the judgment of the Court, says:\u2014\nBut it was suggested at the bar, that though for want of written instructions the plaintiff might have no remedy under the deed, yet, as the defendants had, accepted the additional works, and so had the full benefit of them, the plaintiff had a right to be paid on a quantum meruit independently of the deed. The case of Lucas v. Godwin[25] was relied upon. But there the defendant was an individual capable of making a new contract by parol, as he might think fit, whereas here the defendants are a corporate body incapable of contracting otherwise than by deed. We adhere on this subject to the doctrine laid down by this court, in The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton[26], and subsequently acted on in the Common Pleas in Arnold v. The Mayor of Poole[27], and by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in Paine v. The Strand Union[28]. The principle of those cases clearly exempts the present defendants from all liability as to the matters in question in this action, except such as arose by instrument under their seal.\nIn Diggle v. The London & Blackwall Railway Co.[29], where all the cases were cited on the arguments, the marginal note is:\nA railway company, duly incorporated by Act of Parliament, entered into an agreement not under seal, with a contractor that he should execute certain works upon their railway, for the purpose of changing the system of locomotion which they had employed, the rope and stationary engine system, to the ordinary locomotive principle. The contractor, in pursuance of the agreement, entered upon the works and performed a portion of them, but before they were completed he was dismissed by the company: Held, that he could not recover the value of this work.\nIn Homersham v. Wolverhampton Waterworks Co.[30], this Court (Exchequer) again affirmed the principle that a corporation can contract only under seal, or if it is a body established under Act of Parliament, general or special, under the authority of the provision of such Act; and in The Governor and Company of Copper Mines v. Fox and others[31], the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, per Lord Campbell, fully sustained the general principle that a corporation can contract only under seal, and said that \u201cwe regret very much that any technicality should interfere with the enforcement of a fair contract,\u201d but the law by which a corporation is not bound, unless the contract is under seal, can be altered only by the legislature.\nIn Williams v. The Chester and Holyhead Railway Company[32], Martin, B., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\u2014\nWe cannot conclude without calling attention to the extreme imprudence of persons dealing with railway or other companies upon letters or documents signed by the secretaries of such companies. There is no reason to suppose that any fraud was intended in this case, or that the mistake originated otherwise than in an unintentional oversight. But the consequences to him are the same as if the gross fraud had been practised upon him, of the directors authorizing one contract, and their secretary knowingly communicating one varying from it to him, &c., &c.\nPersons dealing with these companies should always bear in mind that such companies are a corporation, a body essentially different from an ordinary partnership or firm, for all purposes of contracts, and especially in respect of evidence against them on legal trials, and should insist upon these contracts being by deed under the seal of the company, or signed by directors in the manner prescribed by the Act of Parliament. There is no safety or security for any one dealing with such a body upon any other footing. The same obser- vation also applies in respect of any variation or alteration in a contract which has been made.\nIn Cope v. The Thames Haven Dock and Railway Company[33], the marginal note is:\u2014\nA railway company was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, one section of which enacted that the directors should have power to use the common seal on behalf of the company; and that all contracts relating to the affairs of the company, signed by three directors, in pursuance of a resolution of a court of directors, should be binding on the company. The following section enacted that the directors should have full power to employ all such managers, officers, agents, clerks, workmen and servants, as they should think proper.\nBy a resolution of the board of directors, signed by their chairman, the plaintiff was appointed agent to negotiate with another railway for the lease of the line.\nAssumpsit for work and labour.\nHeld, that the contract was not binding on the company, it not having been sealed or executed with the required formalities.\nParke, B.:\u2014\nThe rule must be absolute, on the ground that this is a contract by which the company cannot be bound, unless made in the form required by the 119th section, which gives a power of binding the company by an instrument under seal, or in writing signed by three directors, in pursuance of a resolution of the board. Neither of these requisites has been complied with. There is no doubt about the rule of law. We had occasion to consider it in the cases of The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton[34], and Cox v. The Midland Railway Co.[35] The reason why a corporation cannot be bound, except by their common seal, is satisfactorily explained by my brother Rolfe in the judgment in The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton, where it is shown that the doctrine was not, as suggested, a relic of ignorant times.\nThis language of Rolfe, B., in Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton, was adopted by Pollock, B., in Mayor of Kidderminster v. Hardwicke[36].\nIn the Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton[37], where it was held that a municipal corporation was not bound by a contract to pay money, although the consideration had been executed, such contract not being made under their common seal, Rolfe, B., says:\nBefore dismissing this case, we feel ourselves called upon to say that the rule of law requiring contracts entered into by corporations to be generally entered into under seal, and not by parol, appears to us to be one by no means of a merely technical nature, or which it would be at all safe to relax, except in cases warranted by the principles to which we have already adverted. The seal is required, as authenticating the concurrence of the whole body corporate. If the Legislature, in erecting a body corporate, invest any member of it, either expressly or impliedly, with authority to bind the whole body by his mere signature, or otherwise, then undoubtedly the adding a seal would be matter purely of form, and not of substance. Every one becoming a member of such a corporation, knows that he is liable to be bound in his corporate character by such an act; and persons dealing with the corporation know that by such an act the body will be bound; but in other cases the seal is the only authentic evidence of what the corporation has done, or agreed to do. The resolution of a meeting, however numerously attended, is, after all, not the act of the whole body. Every member knows he is bound by what is done under the corporate seal, and by nothing else. It is a great mistake, therefore, to speak of the necessity for a seal as a relic of ignorant times. It is no such thing: either a seal or some substitute for a seal, which, by law, shall be taken as conclusively evidencing the sense of the whole body corporate, is a necessity inherent in the very nature of a corporation; and the attempt to get rid of the old doctrine, by treating as valid contracts made with particular members, and which do not come within the exceptions to which we have adverted, might be productive of great inconvenience.\nIn Frend and another v. Dennett[38], the marginal note is:\u2014\nBy the 85th section of the Public Health Act, 11 and 12 Vic., c. 63, it is amongst other things enacted that \u201cthe local board of health may enter into all such contracts as may be necessary for carrying the Act into execution; and every such contract, whereof the value or amount shall exceed \u00a310, shall be in writing and sealed with the seal of the local board,\u201d &c., &c.: Held, that a contract which did not comply with this condition is not capable of being enforced. Cockburn, C.J., in strong terms expressed his reprehension of the turpitude of the defence. Cockburn, C.J.:\u2014\nThis rule must be made absolute. I very much regret that we are compelled to come to that conclusion; but I see no alternative. It is sought to make the rates for the district liable upon this contract, by means of an action against the clerk to the local board. Now, the power given to the board to make contracts so as to bind the rates is the creature of the Act of Parliament; and that, by the very same clause which gives the board power to enter into contracts, amongst other things, expressly enacts that \u201cevery such contract, whereof the value or amount shall exceed \u00a310 shall be in writing, and (in the case of a non-corporate district) sealed with the seal of the local board by whom the same is entered into, and signed by five or more members thereof, and (in the case of a corporate district) sealed with the common seal.\u201d I think the local board had no power to contract so as to bind the rates, unless they did so in the manner pointed out by the statute.\nWilliams, J.:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. I do not see how we can, consistently with the ordinary rules by which statutes are construed, hold this part of the 85th section to be directory. It is not like the case of a thing which is to be done by the board, where those dealing with them have no means of knowing whether or not it has been done in the manner required by the Act. Here, however, is a public Act which requires that all contracts to be entered into by the local board shall be entered into in a particular way, viz.: \u201cIn writing and sealed with the seal of the local board by whom the same is entered into, and signed by five or more members thereof.\u201d\nThe plaintiff, therefore, must have been well aware that the board had no power to contract so as to bind the rates, except in the manner pointed out by the Act.\nWilles, J.:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. This case has been argued as if the 85th section of the Act had been a controlling section, and as if all the terms in which matters therein mentioned are required to be done were directory only. But it is that section which alone confers upon the local board the power of entering into contracts; and they must exercise that power in the terms in which it is by the act conferred upon them. I regret to be obliged to come to this conclusion; the more especially as this is not the first instance of fraud and oppression occasioned by this state of the law, within my own observation.\nIn Hunt v. The Wimbledon Local Board[39], the marginal note is: Section 85 of the Public Health Act, 1848, and section 174 of the Public Health Act, 1875, enact (without any words of prohibition) that \u201cevery contract made by a local board,\u201d or by an urban authority, whereof the value or amount exceeds [\u00a310] \u00a350, shall be in writing, and sealed with the common seal of such authority.\nThe defendants, a \u201clocal board,\u201d and an \u201cUrban authority\u201d under the above mentioned Acts, verbally directed their surveyor to employ the plaintiff to prepare plans for new offices. The plans were prepared and submitted to, and approved, and used by the defendants, but the proposed offices were never erected. There was no contract under the corporate seal, nor any ratification under seal of the act of the surveyor in procuring the plans; nor was there any resolution of the board authorizing their preparation:\u2014\nHeld, that by reason of the non-compliance with the statutory requirements, the contract could not be enforced,\u2014notwithstanding that the jury found that the board authorized their surveyor to procure the plans and ratified his act that new offices were necessary for the purposes of the defendants, and that the plaintiff\u2019s plans were necessary for the erection of them.\nLindley, J.:\u2014\nIn this case, however, I have to construe and apply a special Act of Parliament; and although some of the provisions of the above mentioned sections are not, in my opinion, applicable to such a contract as I have here to deal with, the provision requiring a seal where the contract is for more than \u00a310 or \u00a350, as the case may be, is, I think, applicable to it; and, having regard to the objects and terms of those sections, and to the case of Frend v. Dennett[40], I am unable to hold that the clause requiring a seal is a merely directory clause.\nIn Nowell v. Mayor of Worcester[41], other clauses requiring other things to be done by the board were held to be directory only, because the plaintiff could not ascertain whether they were done or not. This reason has no application to the clause requiring contracts to be sealed; and it appears to me that I should be depriving the ratepayers of the protection intended to be afforded them by the statutes with which I have to deal, if I held the defendants liable to pay for work done under a contract required by those Acts to be under seal, and not in that form.\nThe observations of Baron Rolfe in Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton[42], are, in my opinion, very pertinent to cases of this description; and thoroughly concurring, as I do, with those decisions which have relaxed the old rule as to the necessity for a seal to bind certain classes of corporations, I do not feel myself at liberty to depart from the plain words of the statutes by which this case is governed.\nBramwell, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the judgment of Lindley, J., was right, and ought to be affirmed. First, I think that s. 174 is applicable to cases other than those alluded to in it, and that it is not limited to them. The section is general, and refers to every class of contract, and there is no reason for limiting it. In the next place, I think the section is not merely directory but obligatory. It is not prohibitory so as to constitute the making of a contract, otherwise than in writing and under seal, an offence; but it is a mandatory direction that contracts shall be made in a particular way, that is to say, in writing and under seal. The enactment relates to a contract which is the act of both parties, and is applicable not to one of them alone, but to both of them. I do not mean to say that the section makes anything particularly necessary upon the part of the contractee, but it requires that the evidence of the obligation of the two parties must be in writing and sealed with their seals. In this particular case the section is of importance, as drawing a line between cases where the contract shall or shall not be under seal. If it rested at the common law there might be a discretionary power as to what contracts should be entered into by parol, and what contracts should be made under seal, such as contracts of small amount or acts of daily necessity, and some others which are said to be within the exception to the general rule that a corporation must contract under their corporate seal. If it were not for section 174 it might be contended that contracts to the amount of \u00a35 or \u00a320, or even \u00a3100, came within the rule. The legislatures, however, have drawn the line, and said that all contracts over \u00a350 must be entered into under seal and contracts for a less amount may be made by parol. That being my opinion as to the effect of the statute, I think it clear that this is a contract, upon which, if after the order had been given it had been countermanded by the defendants, and defendants had said to the plaintiffs: \u201cDo not go on with it, we shall not employ you,\u201d no action could have been maintained. Then it is said that this is not an executory contract, but an executed contract, of which the defendants have got the benefit, and for which they must pay. I will deal with that question presently. First, reliance is placed on the doctrine in equity as to contracts relating to land. It is said that a part performance by entering into possession of the land under a verbal contract for its purchase is sufficient to take it out of the statute of frauds. I think that that doctrine has no analogy to the present case, and the ground on which that law rests has been clearly stated by the Master of the Rolls in Ungley v. Ungley[43]. He says: \u201cThe law is well established that if an intended purchaser is let into possession in pursuance of a parol contract, that is sufficient to prevent the statute of frauds being set up as a bar to the proof of the parol contract. The reason is that possession by a stranger is evidence that there was some contract, and is such cogent evidence as to compel the court to admit evidence of the terms of the contract, in order that justice may be done between the parties.\u201d That reason is not applicable to a case like the present.\nBrett, L.J.:\nThe general rule is, that where the defendants are a corporation and the contract made with them is not under seal, the defendants are not liable. I think this case is within the general rule, and would not be within any of the recognized exceptions. It is not within the exception which is mentioned\u2014if it can be called an exception\u2014or within that doctrine of the Court of Chancery which is applicable to the statute of frauds. That doctrine of equity with regard to the statute of frauds is equally applicable, whether the defendant be a corporation, or whether the defendant be only an individual, and is founded upon the view that the statute of frauds only deals with a matter of evidence upon a suit or trial. In the case of the statute of frauds, the original contract is perfectly valid, and the only effect of the statute is, that in a contested suit no evidence can be given of that contract unless certain formalities have been observed. The Court of Chancery has held that in certain circumstances they will allow evidence to be given of the contract although the formalities of the statute have not been fulfilled. But that decision cannot have any reference or any application to a case where the contract originally, by a rule of law, is invalid. I think, also, that this case is not within any of the common law exceptions which have been suggested.\n* * *\nAnother exception is suggested. It is said that there is a rule that where orders are given by or on behalf of a corporation, and those orders result in an apparent contract, though not under seal, and the party with whom that apparent contract is made has fulfilled the whole of his part of the contract, and the corporation on whose behalf such apparent contract has been made, accept and enjoy the whole benefit of the performance of the contract, that then the corporation is liable, although the contract is not under seal. I doubt very much whether there is any such rule, either in law or equity.\n* * *\nBut I am further of opinion that the statute in this case is conclusive; and it seems to me that the statute is clearly more than directory. It is what has been called mandatory. It prevents certain contracts from being valid in any way, and the real meaning of the section seems to be this: The legislature knowing of the exception which existed at the time the statute was passed with regard to small contracts of frequent occurrence, which are necessary for the carrying on of the business of the corporation, intended to get rid of any discussion as to what were small matters, and to say that contracts which the board would not otherwise be authorized to make might be made for amounts less than \u00a350\u2014that is to say, that if they were necessary and under \u00a350, they should be brought within the recognized exception as to small matters; and that if they were over \u00a350, the mere fact of their being over \u00a350 would prevent their coming within the exception.\nCotton, L.J.:\nThe statute of frauds says that in certain cases no action shall be maintained unless there is evidence in writing to show what the contract was. But if a Court of equity finds an overt act, such as the possession of land, then the presumption of a contract is raised, and the court will in consequence of that overt act, allow parol evidence to be given for the purpose of ascertaining what the actual contract was. These are the cases in which the Courts of Equity have given an effect to contracts valid at common law, which could be enforced but for the statute of frauds. That is the ground on which these cases rest, and that it is not on the ground of fraud is shown by this, that the payment of the price to a vendor will not take the case out of the statute. But surely it is as great an injustice for a man to receive the price, and then say: \u201cYou cannot enforce the contract,\u201d as to repudiate the contract where possession has been given. When there is an overt act, a Court of Equity will receive parol evidence of the contract, but that is in cases of specific performance of contracts relating to land which are valid at common law.\nPollock, C.B.:\u2014\nThe case, therefore, stands precisely in this position: That there was a contract under seal; that there was more work done than the plaintiff was bound to perform under that contract; but there was no evidence of the extra work having been either ordered by the company, sanctioned by the company, or ratified, or adopted by the company. These clauses of restriction are of the same nature as the old common law distinction between a corporate body and a private individual, according to which the latter can in general be bound only by a contract under seal; and the rule is for the benefit of subscribers to works of this description, for the protection of their interests. We are, therefore, of opinion, that they can only contract either under seal, if they are a corporation; or, if they are a body established under any special or general Act of Parliament, they can only contract according to the terms by which the contract is authorized to be entered into by the clause of the special Act, or of the general Act by which they are controlled. In the present case there was no evidence of any contract which could be brought under either of these classes; and, therefore, we think the manner in which the case was disposed of at the trial was perfectly correct, and that there is no ground for granting a rule to show cause why a different result should not be obtained.\nMr. Maxwell in his work on statutes[44] says:\u2014\u201cIt has frequently been held that a statute which prescribes the formalities to be observed by a corporate or public body constituted for a special purpose in executing contracts is imperative, and that a contract not executed in conformity with such provisions was of no binding effect on the body.\u201d\nCiting many cases already referred to.\nIn the face of these authorities I cannot, by any forced construction or artificial reasoning, permit myself to set at defiance the declared will of the legislature so simply, so plainly, and so positively expressed.\nThe language of Mr. Justice Maule in Freeman v. Tranah[45] commends itself to my mind as being applicable to this case.\nI agree that in this particular case, justice would be better administered by making the rule absolute, than by discharging it. But there is no court in England which is intrusted with the power of administering justice without restraint. That restraint has been imposed from the earliest times, and although instances are constantly occurring where the courts might profitably be employed in doing simply justice between the parties, unrestrained by precedent or by any technical rule, the law has wisely considered it inconvenient to confer such power upon those whose duty it is to preside in courts of justice. The proceedings of all courts must take a defined course, and be administered according to a certain uniform system of law, which in the general result is more satisfactory than if a more arbitrary jurisdiction was given to them. Such restrictions have prevailed in all civilized countries; and it is probably more advantageous that it should be so, though at the expense of some occasional injustice. The only court in this country which is not so fettered, is the Supreme Court of the Legislature.\nIf I have any feeling in this matter I may be permitted to say that I am very glad that the majority of this court have been enabled to see their way clear to a conclusion the opposite of that at which I have felt myself constrained to arrive, for the language of Lord Cockburn in the case of Frend v. Dennett can hardly be held to be too strong to apply to this defence.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI am in favor of dismissing this appeal for the reasons statein the judgments of the Court of Appeal.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nWere this a case at common law, and the action brought before a common law court, I would have no doubt in saying that the plaintiff could not recover. It is not necessary to explain why, but in courts of equity of late years a great number of additions have been grafted upon instruments of insurance. When companies are chartered for certain purposes, and they enter into ordinary dealings necessary to carry out the business for which they are chartered, I cannot admit that every thing should be under seal, in order to make good their contracts; in fact, trade could not be carried on if all their engagements were to be under seal.\nHere is a company established for carrying on life insurance business, and doing business for a number of years in a particular manner; and we find by the same Act which empowers them to do business in a certain way they are given power also to engage agents \u201cand to appoint their duties, obligations and securities, and generally to transact all necessary business of the company;\u201d also to appoint \u201cagents in any town\u201d\u2014agents to transact business, \u201cwith such duties and powers as they may deem proper.\u201d Now, at the same time the legislature said this, they authorized them to make rules and regulations which would be binding in regard to the policies which they might issue; and among other provisions they can issue interim receipts without the necessity of affixing the seal. This policy was applied for at a local office, and an interim receipt was issued. Now, after the issue of this receipt, it was the duty of the company either to issue a proper policy or reject the application. They kept the money, and the party insured was killed by an accident. Then when sued upon the policy, they do not rely on defence that there is no seal, but set up six other issues, and a verdict for plaintiff is given. A new trial is then asked for and granted, and again a verdict is given in favor of the plaintiff, and it is only after this that the objection is raised for the first time. Had they raised this objection on the first trial, I doubt whether a new trial would have been granted otherwise than on the condition that the objection set up as to the seal would not be raised. The question here is whether the courts of equity of Ontario had the inherent power to award that the respondent was entitled to a good policy, and if not, to condemn appellants to pay damages, as if a good one had issued. Appellants rely on their act of incorporation to say that they are bound only by a document under seal, but I do not agree with them, for if they receive the premiums they are bound to give a valid policy. The business of the company is to issue policies, and there is nothing in the Act to prevent local agents from receiving applications and forwarding them and if the company accept an application and keep the premiums, can it be said they are not bound by their contract. In such a case a Court of Equity has a right to interfere and say you have no right to set up a fraud, and more especially, as in this case, when the fraud is committed upon the court. My brother Gwynne has more fully gone into this matter, and I will only add that I concur with him.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nHere also, as in Nasmith v. Manning[46], I have had some difficulty in forming an opinion. However, here I find myself in the minority, and must say that it is with a sense of relief that I see the judgment in the case not affected by the conclusion I have come to. The recent case of Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[47], cited by the Chief Justice, seems to me conclusive against the plaintiff not only at law, but also in equity, for there can be no doubt that under the Judicature Act in England, it was open to the plaintiff in that case to put his claim on equitable grounds, and it appears by the report that the court did not lose sight of this, and that he must be considered as having done so, and the court as having decided against him in equity as well as in law. The case of Kirk v. Bromley[48] seems to me also conclusive against the plaintiff on the equitable counts. I cannot understand by what sense of reasoning a court can say that there was no contract of insurance for want of the seal, but that in equity the company defendants can be bound to perform such contract. Is not that petitio principii? Is it not taking for granted that there was a contract, whilst that is the very question to be decided? How can we say: True, in law, there was no contract of insurance, but in equity the company will be obliged to fulfil the obligation of that contract. Nor can I see how it can be said that the company was guilty of fraud; as a corporation it was not guilty of fraud. Its officers may have committed a fraud, or an act of negligence, but the corporation did not do so. To hold the contrary is, it seems to me, taking away from this corporation the special protection that the Ontario legislature granted to it, in enacting that it could not contract except under seal. I cannot see that courts of justice\u2014never mind under which system of jurisprudence\u2014can thus override or set at naught the positive enactments of the legislative authority.\nI concur with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE, J.\u2014\nThe plaintiff in her declaration alleged that by a policy of accident insurance made by the defendants, signed by the president and attested by the secretary of the company, defendants, in consideration of the representations made in the application for the said policy, and of the payment of $7. 50 it was declared that the defendants insured one John Wright in the principal sum of $1, 250 for the term of 12 months, ending the 6th of September, 1876, at noon, the said sum, so insured, to be paid to the plaintiff, a daughter of the said insured, or to her legal representatives, within ninety days after sufficient proof that the insured at any time within the continuance of the policy should have sustained bodily injuries effected through external violent and accidental means, within the intent and meaning of the said contract and the conditions thereunto annexed, and such injuries alone should have occasion- ed death within 90 days from the happening thereof. The declaration then set forth the conditions endorsed on the policy, and averred that while the policy of insurance remained in full force, to wit, on the 7th day of December, 1876, the said insured was killed by external violent and accidental means within the terms and meaning of the said policy, and that all conditions were fulfilled and all things had happened and all times had elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action, yet that the defendants had not paid the said sum of $1,250, but that the same is wholly due and unpaid.\nThe declaration also contained the common money count.\nTo this declaration the defendants pleaded, firstly to the first count, that they did not insure or promise as alleged, and nine other pleas which all were in confession and avoidance of the policy as set out in the first count.\nTo the common count they pleaded never indebted. Issue having been joined on these pleas the case went down for trial before a jury, when the defendants rested their defence wholly upon their 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th pleas.\nThe 3rd plea was that the death of the said John Wright was caused by suicide.\nThe 4th. That the death of the said John Wright happened in consequence of the exposure of himself to unnecessary danger or peril.\nThe 5th. That he was killed by a railway train while he was walking on the track in violation of the by-laws of the company.\nThe 6th, That he was killed by a railway train while he was walking on the track in violation of the laws of the State of Michigan in which the railway was situate, and The 7th. That he was killed by reason of his not using due diligence for his personal safety and protection in the walking on a railway track at night, by means whereof he fell into a cattle guard, and was killed by a passing train.\nThe 8th. That immediate notice of the injury or accident was not given to the defendants.\nThese defences were rested upon certain provisions contained in the conditions endorsed on the policy. The jury, when the case was first tried, found a verdict for the plaintiff upon all the issues. On an application for a new trial, the court in the exercise of its discretion granted a new trial, thinking it proper to take the opinion of a second jury upon the special pleas: no suggestion of any defect in the policy from the want of a seal had been made; if it had been, (as observed by the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, upon a motion to set aside the second verdict at the trial of which the objection was first taken,) the court in granting the new trial would have granted it only upon condition that no such defence should be set up, which it could have done by confining the second trial to all the issues except that which arose upon the first plea to the first count.\nThe second trial resulted as did the first, in a verdict for the plaintiff upon all the issues. Thereupon the defendants obtained a rule nisi to set aside this verdict, and for a new trial on the ground that the paper produced as a policy was not sealed with the seal of the defendants, and that there was no evidence to go to the jury in support of the contention that the policy was sealed, and that upon the issue as to the alleged policy of insurance the defendants were entitled to a verdict; on the ground also that the verdict was against law and evidence, and the weight of evidence; that upon the issue as to exposure to danger on the part of the assured, the only evidence of how the deceased fell into the cattle-guard showed that he fell into the same while walking along the track of the railway, and that, having regard to the contract, that was such exposure to danger as avoided the policy, and that the learned judge at the trial misdirected the jury, in telling them that there was evidence to go to them of the death having resulted from an accident within the terms of the contract; and on the ground that under the terms of the contract it not being certain as to how the accident happened, the plaintiff cannot recover.\nIn disposing of this rule the court determined all the grounds of objection except that relating to the first plea against the defendants, thus supporting the finding of the jury upon all the issues to which they related, and as to the issue upon the first plea they gave leave to the plaintiff to file nunc pro tunc, such a replication as should justify the court in restraining the defendants from relying upon any such objection to the form of the policy.\nThat the court had the power to grant leave to file such a replication and to give effect to it when filed does not appear to have been doubted by the court. As I was one of the judges of that court at the time I can say with certainty that it was not, nor indeed, as I think, by the learned counsel for the defendants. In the report of the cases, (for there were others under somewhat similar circumstances argued at the same time) in Wright v. Sun Mutual Life Insurance Co.[49], we find the Chief Justice, when delivering judgment, saying:\nUnder the old system a Court of Equity would, we consider, have compelled the defendants to seal the policies. We think this court, in the present state of the law, can effect the same end, and the pleadings should be amended to meet the case. Mr. Bethune, in his very able defence, urged that this ought not now to be done, as the defendants may have and have an answer to any application to compel them to complete the contract. We do not think we can at this stage listen to this objection to the exercise of our statutory powers. * * * In the case of the London company, the attestation clause does not profess a sealing, but merely declares that in witness whereof the company have caused these presents to be signed by their President and attested by their Secretary and delivered at their head office, &c. Yet they now point to their charter which declares (sec. 7) that no contract shall be valid unless made under the seal of the company, &c., &c., &c. Having obtained this very special clause from the legislature, they adopt a printed form of policy, omitting all reference to a seal and (as it were) expressly directing and adopting an insufficient form of execution.\nAnd at p. 236 I am thus reported:\u2014\nUpon the point arising under the plea of non est factum and the general issue in the cases in which the policy is not declared upon as a deed, I concur with the Chief Justice in thinking that, under the circumstances referred to by him, we should not permit this objection now made to prevail; and that we have power, under the Acts for the better administration of justice, to allow such an equitable replication to those pleas to be filed, as would justify us in restraining the defendants from relying upon those pleas. Mr. Bethune in his able argument for the defendants, admitted, as I understood him, that the court has sufficient power to authorize now such a replication, and that when allowed its undoubted effect would be to deprive the defendants of all benefit from the objection which they now rely upon arising from the want of seals to the policies; but he contends that when the replication should be filed as it raises an equitable consideration as against a legal plea, the case should be tried over again by a judge without a jury, and he says that if the case had been tried before a judge without a jury that objection would not have been raised. I do not think we can yield to this argument, or that allowing the replication, we should now order a new trial before a judge alone without a jury, inasmuch as we feel compelled to concur with the verdict of the jury upon all the other issues.\nIn pursuance of the leave thus granted, the plaintiff filed a replication on equitable grounds to the first plea, whereby she alleged:\nThat the policy declared on was delivered by the defendants to the deceased John Wright, after payment of the premium to the defendants in that behalf as a policy duly executed binding upon the defendants, and the said policy was and is signed and countersigned by the proper officers of the defendants to make the same a valid policy, and as required by the defendants\u2019 act of incorporation, and nothing was omitted or required to be done by the defendants or the deceased to make the said policy valid and binding, except the mere affixing thereto of the defendants\u2019 corporate seal, and the deceased acted upon the faith of the said policy having been duly executed and binding on the defendants, and the defendants kept and retained the premium or consideration paid by the deceased for the risk assumed, and intended to be undertaken by the defendants under the said policy, and the plaintiff says that she is now entitled to have the said policy made complete and perfect by the affixing thereto by the defendants of their seal, or to have the defendants estopped and debarred from setting up the said defence, and enjoined against pleading the said first plea as a fraud upon the deceased, and the plaintiff prays that the said defendants may be ordered by the court to affix their corporate seal to the said policy, or that they may be declared to be estopped and debarred from setting up the defence that the said policy was not their deed, and enjoined against pleading the said first plea.\nThe authority for this pleading is contained in the Ontario Administration of Justice Act Revised Statutes ch. 49, by which it is enacted:\u2014\nFor the more speedy convenient and inexpensive administration of justice in every case, the Courts of Law and Equity shall be as far as possible auxiliary to one another;\nThat:\nAny person having a purely money demand may proceed for the recovery thereof by an action at law, although the plaintiffs right to recover may be an equitable one only, and no plea demurrer or other objection on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s proper remedy is in the Court of Chancery shall be allowed in such action;\nAnd\nFor the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of this Act and for causing complete and final justice to be done in all matters in question in any action at law, the court or a judge thereof, according to the circumstances of the case, may at the trial or at any other stage of an action or other proceeding, pronounce such judgment, or make such order or decree as the equitable rights of the parties respectively require, * * * and may as fully dispose of the rights and matters in question as a Court of Equity could. That no proceedings at law or in equity shall be defeated by any formal objection;\nAnd finally that:\nAt any time during the progress of any action, suit, or other proceeding at law or in equity, the court or a judge may upon application of any of the parties or without any such applition, make all such amendments as may seem necessary for the advancement of justice, the prevention and redress of fraud\u2014the determining of the rights and interests of the respective parties and of the real question in controversy between them, and best calculated to secure the giving of judgment according to the very right and justice of the case.\nThe defendants appealed from the rule of the Court of Common Pleas, which was issued in the terms following:\nUpon reading the rule nisi made in this cause during the present term, the affidavit of service thereof and hearing counsel for the parties on both sides, it is ordered that the said rule be and the same is hereby discharged, the plaintiff to have leave to reply equitably and to join issue for the defendants.\nUpon this appeal coming up in the Court of Appeal that court in its discretion thought fit to give leave to the plaintiff to file a new equitable replication, and to the defendants to rejoin and demur thereto, and the court directed that either party might adduce further evidence upon any issue to be raised upon such equitable replication.\nThe authority for this course of proceeding is to be found in \u201cThe Act respecting the Court of Appeal,\u201d Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch. 33, sec. 22, whereby it is enacted that:\u2014\nThe Court of Appeal shall have all the powers and duties as to amendment and otherwise of the court or judge from which or whom the appeal is had, together with full discretionary power to receive further evidence upon questions of fact, such evidence to be either by oral examination in court, by affidavit, or by deposition taken before any person whom the court may nominate. Sec. 23. The court shall have power to dismiss an appeal, or give any judgment and make any decree or order, which ought to have been made, and to direct the issue of any process or the talking of any proceedings in the court below, or to award restitution and payment of costs, or to make such further or other order that the case may require.\nIn pursuance of the leave thus given the plaintiff filed a second replication upon equitable grounds to the defendants\u2019 first plea, which is as follows:\u2014\nAnd the plaintiff for a second replication on equitable grounds to the defendants first plea says, that the said John Wright in the declaration mentioned being desirous of effecting an insurance against his death by accident for the sum of $1,250, to be paid to the plaintiff in case of such death, made an application to the agent of the defendants for the taking by the defendants, then being an insurance company doing business in the Province of Ontario, of the said risk and insurance for reward or premium to be paid to them, and the said application was delivered by the said agent to the defendants, and they accepted the said application and risk, and communicated the said acceptance to the said John Wright, and thereupon it became and was the intention of the said John Wright and the defendants to complete the contract for such insurance by the issue by the defendants of a policy therefor, and the defendants, for the purpose of completing the said contract as aforesaid, prepared the policy mentioned in the said declaration, which policy was prepared in the ordinary course of the business of the said defendants and was attested and signed by the President and Secretary of the defendants, being the officers of the said company duly authorized to execute policies and contracts in the name of the said company, and having the custody of the seal thereof, and by which said policy it was declared that the defendants had caused the same to be so signed and attested and delivered as the said policy, and the plaintiff says that the said officers of the said defendants omitted inadvertently and by mistake to actually affix the corporate seal of the defendants to the said policy, and the defendants delivered the said policy to the said John Wright in consideration of the payment of the premium or reward to the defendants for the assuming of the said risk and insurance as a policy duly executed by them and as their deed, and the said John Wright with the knowledge of the defendants accepted the said policy, acting on the faith of the said contract and the belief that the said policy was a duly executed policy of the defendants and their deed, and paid the said insurance premium or reward to the defendants, and relying upon the said insurance neglected to insure elsewhere and complied with all the conditions of the said contract and policy, and the defendants accepted and kept and retained the premium or consideration for the risk intended to be assumed by the said defendants by their said contract and by their said policy, and never in any way repudiated the making of the said policy as their deed until after the bringing of this action; and the plaintiff avers that there was and is nothing to be done by the defendants or the said John Wright to make the said contract and policy a binding and valid contract and policy, except the affixing of the defendants corporate seal thereto, and the plaintiff avers that in all other respects the said policy was duly signed and executed, and that the plaintiff is now entitled to have the said contract completed, and the said policy made perfect and complete by the affixing of the defendants seal thereto, or to have the defendants estopped and debarred from setting up the said defence that the said policy is not their deed, and enjoined against pleading the said first plea, and the plaintiff prays that the said defendants may be ordered by the court to affix their corporate seal to the said policy, or that the defendants may be declared to be estopped from setting up the said defence and enjoined against pleading the said first plea.\nThe defendants filed a joinder in issue upon this replication, and they pleaded by way of second rejoinder thereto, that they did not accept the application or risk under their seal nor by their interim receipt; nor did they communicate such acceptance to the said John Wright under the seal nor by their interim receipt, nor did they enter into or make any contract with the said John Wright under their seal, nor by their interim receipt to execute or issue under their seal any such policy as alleged. They also demurred to this replication, alleging among other grounds that it is a departure from the declaration which alleged that this action was brought upon a valid policy of the defendants, while the replication admits that no valid policy was issued, and that the said replication shows no grounds upon which an injunction should be granted against the defendants as therein prayed, nor any contract binding upon the defendants to issue a policy or affix their seal. The plaintiff thereupon demurred to the above second rejoinder as insufficient in law, and joined issue on the demurrer to their replication, and the defendants joined in the demurrer to their replication.\nNo further evidence was offered by either party, each relying upon the evidence already taken as supporting their respective views.\nNow, before referring to the judgment of the Court of Appeal upon the record, it will be convenient to draw attention to the substance and effect of the issues joined upon these replications to the defendants first plea.\nThe first replication upon equitable grounds set up certain conduct of the defendants, which was relied upon as showing that the point urged by the defendants under their first plea would be a fraud upon the plaintiff, and it prayed that the defendants might be restrained by the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of the court from committing that fraud, or that they should be decreed to make the policy perfect as they had represented it to be, by affixing the seal.\nThe second equitable replication set out more at large than the previous one had done the several matters of facts relied upon as showing that the non-affixing of the seal was a mere mistake relievable in equity, or that it was a designed fraud, of which the defendants should not under the circumstances be permitted to take advantage, and it prayed that they should be decreed either to affix their seal nunc pro tunc, and thus make the policy good, or that they should be restrained from relying upon their own fraud in not affixing the seal, as a defence to the action.\nThe joinder in issue upon these replications only put in issue the matters of fact alleged in the replications, and I presume there can be no doubt that the evidence taken does establish the matters so alleged to have been as pleaded, therefore upon the joinder in issue upon the replications the plaintiff is clearly entitled to a verdict and judgment. The sufficiency or insufficiency of those facts to entitle the plaintiff to the relief prayed in respect thereof does not come up for judgment upon the joinder in issue; that question arises solely upon the demurrer to the second equitable replication.\nThen, as to the special rejoinder to the second equitable replication, this rejoinder does not dispute any matter alleged in the replication; it must be treated as admitting all those allegations to be true, but insisting that certain of them were not under the seal of the defendants; in other words, the defendants admitting the matters and representations, acts and conduct set out in the replication, the existence of which is relied upon as making the objection of the want of a seal to the policy to be a fraud on the part of the defendants, from the commission of which they should berestained, claims exemption from liability as to the fraud so committed upon an allegation that some of the matters, representations, acts and conduct so relied upon by the plaintiff were not made or done under the seal of the company.\nThe sufficiency of this rejoinder as an answer to the matters alleged in the replication, and not denied by the rejoinder, comes up under the demurrer to the rejoinder.\nThe whole question, therefore, rests upon the demurrers to these respective pleadings.\nNow, as to the objection raised to the second replication, that it is a departure from the declaration, it may be as well to dispose of this objection at once, by saying that in view of the provision in the Administration of Justice Act, that a plaintiff, in an action at law for a purely money demand, may recover, notwithstanding that his right to recover is purely equitable, and that for carrying into effect the object of the Act, which was to do away with the distinction between legal and equitable claims, and for causing complete and final justice to be done in all matters in question in any action at law, the court or judge thereof, according to the circumstances of the case, may, at the trial, or at any other stage of an action or other proceeding, pronounce such judgment or make such order or decree as the equitable rights of the parties respectively require, and may as fully dispose of the rights and matters in question as a Court of Equity could, the objection of departure has no application to this case. Moreover, to terminate all controversy upon this point, the Court of Appeal in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it, has allowed a count to be added to the declaration, which has been accordingly added, asserting the same ground of equity in the declaration as is set up in the equitable replication. The sole question which remains, therefore, is simply are the matters alleged in the second equitable replication (admitted as they are to be true,) sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to relief in equity, either upon the ground of mistake or of fraud relievable against in equity?\nThe plaintiff, by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the unanimous judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Ontario, has been held to be entitled to the relief prayed as founded upon the facts alleged in her equitable replication, and which are admitted to be true.\nIn the argument before us it was contended that the force of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is weakened by what was contended to be the ground upon which Mr. Justice Patterson in that court rested his judgment, which was said to be that the instrument declared upon can be construed to be an interim receipt. It must be confessed that some of the observations which fell from the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Morrison give some color for this contention, but, with great deference to those learned judges, a careful perusal of Mr. Justice Patterson\u2019s judgment has satisfied me, not only that it is not fairly open to any such construction, but that so to construe it would be to do great injustice to that judgment.\nThe learned judge at p. 229 of vol. 5, Appeal Reports, starts with the assumption that the omission to set the seal to the instrument produced was merely a negligent omission and mistake, and not a designed fraud. He then enters upon a review of the state of the law affecting the contracts of trading corporations, and the exceptions which had become engrafted upon the general rule of the common law that corporations could only contract under their corporate seal. Then at p. 237 he shows what the contention of the defendants is (to combat which is the whole and sole object of his judgment). He says:\nThe defendants insist that not only are they free from liability on the policy before us because no seal has been affixed to it, contrary to the doctrines now so universally established and settled, but that even the jurisdiction of chancery to compel execution of a policy is excluded unless a contract under the corporate seal can be shown.\nAnd he adds:\nThe high ground thus contended for must not be conceded without a careful examination of the basis on which it is claimed, as we cannot assume a priori any intention on the part of the legislature to create for this corporation a position so very exceptional and so capable of being used to the injury, in place of the advantage, of the public. The whole passage to be construed is in these words: \u201cBut no contract shall be valid unless made under the seal, &c., except the interim receipt of the company which shall be binding upon the company on such conditions as may be thereon printed by the direction of the Board.\u201d\nAnd he adds:\nWe are asked to give to the word \u201ccontract\u201d (in this sentence,) its literal and unrestricted force, which will necessarily cover a policy or contract of insurance, but will also include every such petty transaction as the hiring of clerks or servants, and not merely petty and every day engagements but everything which can be technically said to \u201csound in contract.\u201d\nAnd he continues:\nWhen we consider that in the practical business of life a formal contract like a policy of insurance, or an agreement to build a house according to plans and specifications, is rather the exception than the rule, and that contracts are more frequently made by an offer on one side and acceptance on the other; and more particularly when we bear in mind the general use in business of the telegraph as well as the post-office, the absolutely impracticable character of what the literal reading requires becomes very apparent; to carry on business under such a constitution would be a simple impossibility; and to hold that such a rule was enacted in the statute, and yet that the violation of it in all the daily concerns of the business was to be winked at would be a suggestion not to be entertained either by a legislative or judicial court.\nHe then analyses the expression \u201cinterim receipt of the company,\u201d and shows that it is a contract of insurance. It is true that in this connection, at p. 239, he makes use of the language which is the sole foundation for what appears to me to be a very unjust construction put upon his judgment, viz.:\nWe should thus have the statute declaring that there was one kind of contract of insurance which would bind the company without the seal, and finding before us a policy issued by the directors with numerous conditions printed upon it but without seal, it would be our duty ut res magis valeat quam pereat to treat this as the contract so authorized by the name of the interim receipt of the company.\nPerhaps such a construction might be excusable and necessary, if there was no other mode of preventing the fraud attempted to be perpetrated by the defendants, but that the learned judge does not rest his judgment in whole or in part upon this foundation plainly appears from the sequel, whereby he goes on to show his argument to be that by reason of the use of this expression \u201cinterim receipt of the company,\u201d imbedded in the sentence in which appear the words \u201cno contract shall be valid, &c., &c., &c.,\u201d this word \u201ccontract,\u201d as so used in contrast with the insurance by interim receipt, must be read as referring to a contract of insurance by policy as the only contract of insurance which can be contrasted with insurance by interim receipt, and he continues to say:\u2014\nIt is impossible to believe that the legislature can have intended or consented to create in the case of this company a state of things so anomalous, so inconvenient, and so fraught with the means of deception and fraud, as that which would result from the literal and unrestricted rendering of the word \u201ccontract\u201d on which the defendants rely. It is keeping sufficiently far behind the advance of modern law to require an insurance company to seal its policies, but to make a seal and other formalities essential in all matters which take the technical form of contracts, and as a consequence of the impossibility of so conducting its affairs, to enable a company to repudiate those common and every day engagements on the faith of which the poorer classes of the community depend for their living, would be a feat of legislation not to be credited while any escape from belief in it is possible.\nHe then suggests the way of escape in which he lays down the principle upon which he rests his judgment, and sums up with the conclusion to be deducted from the premises he lays down thus:\u2014\nIt is evident, therefore, and is shown by this exception in favor of the interim contract of insurance that the \u201ccontract\u201d dealt with and understood and intended to be dealt with is contract of insurance only. We may, therefore, read the clause as declaring that no contract of insurance shall be valid without seal, except an interim receipt. By the same rule, contract of insurance must be taken as synonymous with policy, and the whole passage interpreted as enacting that while the company shall be bound ad interim by an agent\u2019s receipt, its policies must be sealed, signed, and countersigned as directed.\nHe then proceeds to show that the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity to afford redress in the case of mistake or fraud is not interfered with by the statute, and he illustrates his argument by the case of an instrument which since 8 and 9 Vic., c. 106, s. 3, Imperial Statute, to operate as a lease must be by deed, will, if not under seal, be construed and be held to be an agreement for a lease.\nWhile I entirely concur in the conclusion arrived at by all the judges of all the courts, namely: that whether the omission of the seal to the instrument produced is to be attributed to mistake or fraud, the jurisdiction of equity is not affected by any thing in this Act, I incline to the opinion that the object and intent of the legislature, in inserting in the Act the clause under consideration, was not so much to impose the condition of the affixing of a seal to a contract of insurance as essential to its validity (for that was already sufficiently provided by the common law) as it was to provide that, although having a seal and so valid by the common law, such contracts should not be valid under the statute, even though sealed, unless they should be also signed by the president or vice-president, or one of the directors, and countersigned by the manager, which were provisions not required by the common law; the design of the company being in this private Act of their own preparation, for which they required the sanction of the legislature, to protect themselves against their own agents to a greater extent than they would be protected by the provisions of the common law. The clause is in the section which defines the powers of the directors, and enacts, among other things\u2014that they shall have power to appoint officers and agents, and to approve their duties, obligations and securities, and generally to transact all necessary matters and things connected with the business of the company, but no contract shall be valid unless made under the seal of the company and signed by the president or vice-president, or one of the directors, and countersigned by the manager, except the interim receipt of the company, which shall be binding upon the company upon such conditions as may be thereon printed by direction of the board. The directors may also appoint local directors in any city or town in which the company transacts business, with such duties and powers as they may deem proper for the supervision of the business of the company in such places; and by the 8th section the board is empowered to fix the rates at, and the rules and conditions under, which the company\u2019s policies shall be issued. It is then competent, under the express provisions of the Act, for the directors to appoint officers and agents, and to prescribe their duties; to appoint local directors in cities and towns remote from the head office where the seal is kept, and to prescribe their powers and duties; to prescribe also the rules and conditions under which policies shall be issued. They may, therefore, authorize their agents and local directors to canvass persons to effect insurances with the company; to deliver to such persons forms of application to be subscribed by them containing warranties of divers matters; to receive such applications to be forwarded to the head office; to negotiate upon the terms of insurance; to receive the premiums to be agreed upon; to convey the applications to the head office and to communicate to the applicants the action of the board thereon, either by letter or orally, notwithstanding anything in the Act. There is nothing in the Act which expresses or implies that the company shall be exempt from liability for frauds committed by their authorized agents unless such frauds should be evidenced under seal; in fine, there is nothing in the Act to justify the contention that any equitable jurisdiction which existed in the Court of Chancery before the Act was passed, and which still exists in it as respects all other similar companies, shall have no existence as regards this company.\nThe power of the Court of Chancery to prevent and redress fraud is not a power derived from an Act of Parliament. In the Province of Ontario, it is true that the court was constituted by an Act of Parliament, but by that Act it was invested with the like jurisdiction and powers as by the laws of England were on the 4th March, 1837, possessed by the Court of Chancery in England in all cases of fraud and accident; and by the laws of England, without any Act of Parliament, the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery extends to the prevention and redress of all frauds. This power constitutes the chief vital organ of the court without which a Court of Equity can exist only in name; no Act of Parliament therefore, much less a private Act of this nature, could strip a Court of Equity of this power without divesting it of its vitality and reducing it to the condition of a Court of Equity only in name. It is impossible, therefore, from the terms of this Act, to attribute any such intention to the legislature.\nBut it is said that no reported case can be found in which the Court of Chancery has interfered in the manner in which the court has interfered here in a case and under circumstances similar to the present. I am not concerned to seek whether this be so or not. It may be so, but it is of little consequence that it should be so. It may, indeed, be that to the appellants is due the unenviable reputation of having been the first to design and contrive the peculiar phase of fraud which they rest upon as their defence to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, crescit in orbe dolus; but as fraud increases and extends its ramifications the remedial power of the Court of Chancery to prevent its consequences and to give ample and effectual redress extends also. It matters not how gigantic are its proportions or how new and uncommon the shape which it assumes, the remedial power of the court rises with, and becomes equal to, the occasion. It is, however, the duty of the court to adopt its practice and course of proceeding as far as possible to the existing state of society, and to apply its jurisdiction to all those new cases, which from the progress daily making in the affairs of men must continually arise, and not, from too strict an adherence to forms and rules established under different circumstances, decline to administer justice and to enforce the rights for which there is no other remedy. The jurisdiction of the court must not be narrowed to cases in which the jurisdiction has been exercised. The cases in which the jurisdiction has been exercised are merely examples, and must not be looked on as the measure of the jurisdiction[50].\nLord Redesdale, in his treatise upon the jurisdiction of the court, gives among other heads of jurisdiction the following:\nWhere the powers of the law are abused and exercised contrary to conscience, and where the law gives no right but the principles of complete justice require the interference of the court to prevent the recurrence of wrong.\nAnd in High on Injunctions, an American work, it is said[51]:\nCourts of Equity in the exercise of their general jurisdiction for the prevention of fraud are often called upon to interfere by injunction where fraud constitutes the gravamen of the bill. The manifestations of fraud are so various that it is impossible to embrace all its varieties of form within the limits of a precise definition. Indeed the courts have generally avoided all attempts in this direction, and have reserved to themselves the liberty to deal with it in whatever aspect it may be presented by human ingenuity.\nThat the company is responsible for the fraud of its agents there can be no doubt. They are responsible for the tort of their agents, whether of violence or even of slander; and in Kerr on Fraud[52] as to the liability of company for fraudulent misrepresentions of the directors, it is said:\nThe general interests of society demand that as between an innocent company on the one hand, and an innocent individual defrauded by the company on the other, misrepresentations by the directors of a company shall bind the company, although the shareholders may be ignorant of the representations and of their falsehood. But in the case before us the fraud is in truth committed by the company itself, which must be responsible for everything done in the suit. It is committed and only perfected in the progress of the cause, and in such a manner as to constitute as it appears to me a fraud upon the court itself, which ought not to be overlooked.\nThe evidence establishes beyond all question that the company by their duly authorized agents received the application of John Wright for insurance; that they in like manner negotiated with and agreed upon the terms of the insurance; that they received the premium agreed upon as the consideration for a valid policy; it thereupon became their duty to deliver him a valid policy or to return him his money and enable him to insure elsewhere; that they elected to retain the money paid by him, and as for the consideration which he negotiated for, namely, a good and valid policy for the amount agreed upon, they delivered to him the instrument sued upon and produced with divers conditions thereon endorsed, subject to which the instrument, which was signed by the president and countersigned by the manager, was issued as and for a good valid policy of insurance; that when this instrument was declared upon as such good policy, although the defendants pleaded a plea denying that they had insured the party named in the instrument as insured, a plea usually pleaded for the mere purpose of compelling the production of the instrument at the trial in order to show the conditions upon which it was granted, they filed therewith seven or eight other pleas, setting up in bar of the action divers matters alleged to avoid the policy in the terms of the conditions thereon endorsed; that when these issues went down to trial they did not dispute the validity of the policy, but relied wholly upon the pleas setting up the matters relied upon as avoiding the policy by reason of alleged breaches of the conditions, subject to which it was issued; that upon a verdict being rendered for the plaintiff on all these issues they moved the court for a new trial, and (here comes in the point which appears. to me to amount to a fraud upon the court) suppressing all intention of opening the verdict upon the first plea for the purpose of setting up the defence subsequently relied upon thereunder, they permitted the court to grant a new trial under the impression that the sole defence relied upon was that appearing upon the special pleas. Now, if the defence subsequently relied upon under the first issue had never been set up, if the appellants had only asked for and had obtained a new trial of the issues joined upon the special pleas, no fraud would have been completed, the fraud which the appellants have committed was not perfected until at the second trial they set up the defence that there was no seal to the instrument so issued as a perfect policy; and that the setting up of that defence under the circumstances above detailed was a gross and flagrant fraud upon the plaintiff, and as it seems to me upon the court which under the above circumstances was induced to grant the new trial, cannot, as it seems to me, admit of a doubt, and that it is one which a Court of Equity could not refuse to interfere to prevent without ignoring its functions and its duty to prevent and redress all fraud whenever and in whatever shape it appears.\nIt is said, however, that there are two cases which decide that in such a case a Court of Equity has no such jurisdiction as that which has been asserted, viz.: Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board[53], in appeal, and Crampton v. Varna Railway Co.[54], but these cases, when properly understood, have no bearing upon the present case, or whatever bearing they may have, if any, is in support of the jurisdiction here asserted. In the former case the point arose out of the doctrine affecting the jurisdiction exercised by the Court of Chancery in decreeing specific performance of contracts relating to land not in writing, upon the ground of part performance, a totally distinct and very different head of jurisdiction from that relied upon here, as is shown by the judgment of Lord Justice Cotton in that case. He says there:\nThe Statute of Frauds says that in certain cases no action shall be maintained unless there is evidence in writing to show what the contract was; but if a Court of Equity finds an overt act such as the possession of land, then the presumption of a contract is raised, and the Court will in consequence of that overt act allow parol evidence to be given for the purpose of ascertaining what the actual contract was.\nThis is the principle, as he explains it, upon which the Court proceeds in cases of specific performance of oral contracts relating to land partly performed and not upon the ground of fraud\u2014that this principle does not affect the doctrine of the Court of Chancery as to giving relief in cases of mistake either is apparent, so that Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board is no authority against the exercise of the jurisdiction which has been exercised in the present case. In Cramplon v. Varna Railway Co., it was merely held that a Court of Chancery has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit for a purely money demand. That is so in England, but not so in Ontario, where by statute a suit for a purely money demand may be instituted and determined in the Court of Chancery, and a suit may be brought in an action at law and recovery had in that suit upon the case appearing to be one of a purely equitable nature.\nIn giving judgment in that case, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherley, says: The truth is, that every one who deals with corporations like these must be taken to know what are their powers of contracting, and must take a contract accordingly, and when there is only a money demand and there is no valid contract, then this Court cannot interfere in the matter.\nThis language is not used with the design of throwing any doubt upon the jurisdiction of the Court to interfere in cases of fraud, or even in cases of mistake, as plainly appears, if proof upon such a point could be required, by the succeeding paragraph in the judgment, wherein he says:\nI certainly was impressed with the consideration of the length to which these doctrines might be carried but I think that the arm of the court is always strong enough to deal properly with such cases. There might be a contract without seal under which the whole railway was made and of which the company would reap the profit, and yet it might be said that they were not liable to pay for the making of the line; when any such case comes to be considered; I think there will be two ways of meeting it. It may be, and perhaps is so in this case, that the contractor has his remedy against the individual with whom he entered into the contract although he may have no remedy against the company; or it may be that the Court, acting on well recognized principles, will say that the company shall not in such a case be allowed to raise any difficulty as to payment.\nNow, it is some of those well recognized principles as precisely applicable to the circumstances of the present case, which are invoked to prevent and redress the fraud which the appellants, after failing upon all the defences upon the merits urged by them, persistently have been endeavouring to procure the sanction of a court of justice to aid them in perpetrating. Certain it is that the courts of the late Province of Upper Canada, now Ontario, never doubted that the arm of a Court of Equity was long enough and strong enough to prevent the attempt to commit such a fraud being successful. About 80 years ago, an action was brought against an insurance company to recover back the premium paid by an insurer upon the ground that the instrument issued by the company as a policy was defective; Perry v. Newcastle Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[55] The defect was precisely similar to that in the present case. The Act of incorporation of the company enacted that any policy signed by the president and countersigned by the secretary, but not otherwise, should be deemed valid and binding on the company. The insertion here of the words \u201cbut not otherwise\u201d makes the case identical with the present. The defect was, that although the policy issued was sealed with the company\u2019s seal and was signed by the secretary, it was not signed by the president. It was held that the plaintiffs could not recover back the premiums they had paid, although it was admitted that in case of loss they could not have recovered at law upon the policy as it stood, and that it was clearly invalid, but C.J. Sir John Robinson, delivering the judgment of the court, said:\nThirdly, which indeed is of itself conclusive against this action, the plaintiffs cannot be said to have paid their money for nothing since the company were in fact bound to execute a policy having accepted the risk and received the money.\nAnd again:\nI do not consider that the company could in this case have escaped from their liability after what has taken place, for if they were disposed to be dishonest they could surely be compelled to execute a valid policy of the proper date. In effect, therefore, the plaintiffs have been all the time insured, as they probably have considered themselves to be, notwithstanding the accidental omission of the president\u2019s name, which they have had no reason as it appears for apprehending would not be made right on their request at any time.\nHere is an express assertion of the existence of the jurisdiction to relieve against mistake in a case, the circumstances of which are precisely similar to the present. A fortiori does the jurisdiction exist in a case of fraud, when, as here, the company having enjoyed the premium, upon the loss occurring, fraudulently set up their own wrongful neglect as a defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 action, after they had failed upon all the grounds of defence which were legitimately open to them to raise. If this court should now hold that a jurisdiction so long and so uniformly claimed and asserted by the courts of Ontario, which, until now, does not appear to have been questioned, does not exist, such a decision would, in my opinion, be greatly to be deplored, and would indeed be extremely mischievous as crippling the arm of the courts of that province in the exercise of one of their most wholesome weapons for the prevention of frauds and the due administration of justice.\nThe appeal in my judgment must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Harris, Magee & Co.\nSolicitor for respondents: S.S.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nWill\u2014Annuities, sale of Corpus to pay.\nJ. R. died on the 3rd August, 1876, leaving a will dated 6th August, 1875, and a codicil dated 21st July, 1876. By the will he devised to his widow an annuity of $10,000 for her life, which he declared to be in lieu of her dower. This annuity the testator directed should be chargeable on his general estate. The testator then devised and bequeathed to the executors and trustees of his will certain real and personal property particularly described in five schedules, marked respectively, A, B, C, D and E, annexed to his will, upon these trusts, viz.:\u2014Upon trust, during the life of his wife, to collect and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof which should be, and be taken to form a portion of his \"general estate;\" and then from and out of the general estate, during the life of the testator's wife, the executors were to pay to each of his five daughters the clear yearly sum of $1,600 by equal quarterly payments, free from the debts, contracts and engagements of their respective husbands. Next, resuming the statement of the trusts of the scheduled property specifically given, the testator provided, that from and after the death of his wife, the trustees were to collect and receive the rents, issues, dividends and profits of the lands, etc., mentioned in the said schedules, and to pay to his daughter M. A. A., the rents, etc., apportioned to her in schedule A; to his daughter E., of those mentioned in schedule B; to his daughter M. of those mentioned in schedule C; to his daughter A. of those mentioned in schedule D; and to his daughter L. of those mentioned in schedule E; each of said daughters being charged with the insurance, ground rents, rates and taxes, repairs and other expenses with or incidental to the management and upholding of the property apportioned to her, and the same being from time to time deducted from such quarterly payments. The will then directed the executors to keep the properties insured against loss by fire, and in case of total loss, it should be optional with the parties to whom the property was apportioned by the schedules, either to direct the insurance money to be applied in rebuilding, or to lease the property. It then declared what was to be done with the share of each of his daughters in case of her death. In the residuary clause of the will there were the following words:\u2014\"The rest, residue and remainder of my said estate, both real and personal, and whatsoever and wheresoever situated, I give, devise and bequeath the same to my said executors and trustees, upon the trusts and for the intents and purposes following:\" He then gave out of the residue a legacy of $4,000 to his brother D. R., and the ultimate residue he directed to be equally divided among his children upon the same trusts with regard to his daughters, as were thereinbefore declared, with respect to the said estate in the said schedules mentioned.\nThe rents and profits of the whole estate' left by the testator proved insufficient, after paying the annuity of $10,000 to the widow and the rent of and taxes upon his house in L., to pay in full the several sums of $1,600 a year to each of the daughters during the life of their mother, and the question raised on this appeal was whether the executors and trustees had power to sell or mortgage any part of the corpus, or apply the funds of the corpus of the property, to make up the deficiency.\nHeld, on appeal, that the annuities given to the daughters, and the arrears of their annuities, were chargeable on the corpus of the real and personal estate subject to the right of the widow to have a sufficient sum set apart to provide for her annuity.\nThis was an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in a suit brought by the executors and trustees under the will of the late Hon. John Robertson, for the construction of said will.\nThe parties agreed to the following case.\n\"1. The respondents, James D. Lewin, Charles Duff, Sophia Robertson and DeLisle Gracie, filed a bill in the Supreme Court in Equity, of the province of New Brunswick, for the construction of the last will and testament of the late Honorable John Robertson, which said last will and a codicil thereto form a part of this case [See head note and judgments for provisions of the will] 2. The several defendants appeared and answered, and the case was heard on bill and answers before the Supreme Court in Equity; 3. Among the facts admitted were the following: (a) That the testator's estate consisted, 1st. Of certain lands and tenements, stocks, and other personal property, set forth and described in the several schedules marked A, B, C, 1) and E, annexed to said will. 2nd. Of a debt due by David D. Robertson, the son named in the will, to his father of over fifty-three thousand dollars; and 3rd. Of a large estate, real and personal, exclusive of and in addition to the property mentioned in the schedules in the hands of respondents, James D. Lewin, Charles Duff, Sophia Robertson and DeLisle Gracie, as executors and trustees under said will; (b) That Mary Allen Almon had received, in the life-time of the testator, the sum of nine thousand five hundred dollars, which sum is charged against her in the testator's books. (c) That the whole net income of the testator's estate, including the properties mentioned in the several schedules, was not sufficient to pay the amount of the annuity of $10,000 to the widow Sophia Robertson, and also the several annuities of $1,600 each to the five daughters, Mary Allan Almon, Eliza, Agnes Lucas, Margaret Sophia and Laura Campbell. (d) That, in order to pay each of the daughters the yearly annuity of $1,600, the respondents would have to take a large portion thereof out of the corpus of the estate. 4. Among the questions submitted by the above named respondents to the Supreme Court in Equity were the following, which they prayed it might be declared and decreed. First\u2014Whether the trustees are or are not bound or authorized to pay the annuities of $1,600 each to the daughters of the testator, during the life of the testator's widow, in full out of the corpus of all or any part or parts of the real or personal estate of the testator, if the rents, issues and profits of the whole of the said estate, or the whole of the said estate applicable for that purpose, prove insufficient. Second\u2014Whether, if the trustees are so bound or authorized, they, during the life of the widow, have not power to sell or mortgage any and what part or parts of the corpus of the estate to raise funds to pay said annuities of $1,600 to each of said daughters in full, so far as the rents, issues and profits of the said estate prove insufficient for that purpose, or to any and what extent. Third\u2014Whether the trustees, during the life of the widow, before selling the corpus of the testator's estate to meet the said annuities of $1,600 to each of said daughters, ought or ought not to reserve so much of any and what part of the said estate as may be necessary to provide for and secure the widow's annuity, and if so, how is the extent of such reserve to be ascertained and determined, and by whom. 5. The appellants in this case claim that after setting aside so much of the estate outside and exclusive of the property mentioned in the schedules as may, together with the income derived from the scheduled property, be sufficient to provide for and secure the widow's annuity, they are entitled to have the amount of their several annuities of $1,600 a year each paid to them out of the corpus of the estate, outside of and beyond the scheduled property, if the income is not sufficient to do so, and that the trustees should sell so much of said estate outside of scheduled property as may be necessary for said purpose. 6. That in the Supreme Court in Equity, His Honor the Chief Justice, delivered judgment, and decreed, among other things, as follows: 'And, as to the first and second questions, it being admitted that the rents and profits of the whole estate left by the testator are insufficient, after paying the annuity of $10,000 to his widow and the rents and taxes upon his house in London, to pay the several sums of $1,600 a year to each of his daughters during the life of their mother, whether under these circumstances the executors and trustees have power to sell or mortgage any part of the corpus of the property to make up the deficiency, his honor doth declare that the said executors and trustees have no such power. The answer to the said first and second questions being thus given renders it unnecessary for his honor to answer the third.' 7. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, when the appeal was heard before their honors Mr. Justice Weldon, Mr. Justice Fisher, Mr. Justice Wetmore and Mr. Justice Palmer, and after consideration their honors gave judgment, and were divided in opinion. Mr. Justice Weldon and Mr. Justice Wetmore concurring with the Chief Justice, while their honors Mr. Justice Fisher and Mr. Justice Palmer were of a different opinion, and the division being equal the decree of the Supreme Court in Equity was affirmed.\"\nDr. Barker, Q. C., representing the administrators who are nominal parties, declared he would take no part in the case.\nMr. Weldon, Q.C., for appellants, E. & M. and A. & L. Robertson:\u2014\nThe question now is simply whether the annuities to the children are chargeable on the corpus of the real and personal estate. It is one of those cases where the testator thought his property worth more than it really was. The manifest intention of the testator is clearly shown that there should be equality amongst his children in the participation of the benefits of his estate, as well during the life-time of their mother as after her death. The testator divided his estate into two divisions. The one which may be called the scheduled estate and the other which he calls the general estate, the former to be held intact during his wife's life, and then to be held in trust and with limitations over for his daughters respectively, the latter consisting of two parts, namely, the rents and profits of the scheduled estate and the residue of his property.\nOut of this general estate so made he directs an annuity of $10,000 to be paid to his wife during her life, and also \"from and out of the said general estate during the life of my said wife, to pay to each of my daughters, Mary Allan Almon, Eliza, Margaret Sophia, Agnes Lucas, and Laura Campbell, the clear yearly sum of $1,600, dominion currency, by equal quarterly payments, free from the debts, control or engagements of any husband they may respectively have, the first of such quarterly payments to be made at the expiration of three months from my decease.\"\nBy his will he also orders and directs that his said executors shall reduce the amount of the advances made by him to his son David Dobie, and interest thereon, as aforesaid, by crediting him with \"the like annual sum of $1,600, by quarterly credits of $400 each.\"\nThis deduction or allowance, in effect an annuity, was to be made under any circumstances, whether the income of the estate was sufficient to pay the whole of the annuities or not.\nAnd having estimated the property in each schedule to be worth $50,000, he directs that upon the death of his wife that amount shall be credited to his son.\nAfter payment of certain legacies he directs the residue to be divided equally among his children.\nIt now appears, that after the payment of the annuity to Mrs. Robertson, the residue of the income is not sufficient to pay the daughters their several annuities, and the question is, are they entitled to have the deficiency made up out of the corpus of the estate? This question, it is submitted, must be answered in the affirmative.\nThe law on this subject has been very fully discussed in a late case, Gee v. Mahood[1], where Vice-Chancellor Hall made a decision somewhat similar to that of the Chief Justice in the present case. On appeal the Lords Justices and the late Lord Chancellor, Earl Cairns, reversed the Vice-Chancellor's decision[2]. The case was then taken to the House of Lords, where the decision of the Court of Appeal was affirmed. The case in the House of Lords is reported as Carmichael v. Gee[3]. We rely on this decision and contend that the annuities are chargeable on the corpus of the real and personal estate of the testator.\nMr. Gilbert for appellants, L. J. Almon and Mary A. Almon:\u2014 The only question which arises is, what did the testator mean by the term general estate?\nThe word general is defined as \"belonging to or relating to the whole\" opposed to \"partial or special\" on the one side and to \"universal\" on the other, i.e., being the greater part but not the entirety. Or applying it to a devise or bequest, it would be out of the whole of the estate, except so much thereof as is carved out and separated from the whole, and thereby made special in contradistinction to general. Then the meaning of the term general estate would be found by ascertaining if there was any portion of his estate which the testator intended to separate and set apart, and this being found, the whole of the residue would constitute the \"general estate,\" unless indeed the context of the will, or some expressions contained in it, would show that the testator had used the word in a more limited sense.\nThe only expression used by the testator bearing on the meaning of the term is, he directs his executors to collect the income arising from the scheduled properties, \"which shall be and be taken to form a portion of my general estate.\" This income, then, is a portion, not the whole of his general estate; only a portion. Where, then, is the balance? for balance there must be, if this is only a portion. It can not be the corpus of the scheduled properties, for these are afterwards in the will (not only directed to be held by the trustees after the death of the widow in their entirety for the benefit of his daughters) but the trustees are directed if any portion should have been disposed of by the testator in his life-time, \"or if any stocks, mortgages, bonds or debentures therein named shall have depreciated in value, to substitute therefor or add thereto, in money or otherwise, from and out of 'my residuary estate' some other property or security or its equivalent in money which they or the majority of them may consider of equal value to the property so disposed of or depreciated.\" Nor can it, the balance, be the debt due from his son David, for this is to remain uncollected during the life of the widow, undergoing a process of reduction by $1,600 a year, and after her death is to be reduced or extinguished to at least the extent of $50,000 by giving or crediting that amount to his said son, and the balance of it treated as an investment of his (the son's) portion of the estate. If so, then the balance or other portion of the general estate, of which the income of the scheduled property is one portion, must be sought for and can only be found in that large amount of real and personal property not included in the schedules, and which, if not then consumed in the payment of the annuities and the other charges laid on it in the will, becomes at the death of the widow, and not until her death, and all other previous bequests paid, his residuary estate.\nIt is true that when the death of the widow occurs that then what is left of the large estate not included in the schedules passes out of the category of general estate and becomes residuary, and as such is to be kept intact. But there can be no residuary estate until all previous bequests are satisfied, annuities as well as other charges, and the testator has well marked this in his will, for he says: \"And from and after the death of my said wife the amount of such premiums of life policies and all other monies which my said executors and trustees shall pay, lay out or expend in the execution of the trusts of this my will shall be deducted from the income of the property of my estate.\" In other words, the testator says, as clear as words can, the scheduled property shall be kept intact.\nIt will be said, however, that the reduction of debt to his son should also abate pro tanto as the daughter's annuities abate. But this cannot be, for the testator has provided a fund from which the son's yearly allowance is to come, i. e., the debt due from him, not the interest of the debt but the debt itself. And the annuity or reduction to him cannot abate until the fund from which it is to be taken is exhausted, which cannot happen because it is perpetually renewed by the accruing interest on it. And this debt or fund and the interest accruing on it can form no part of the general estate available for the purpose of paying either the annuity to the widow or the annuities to the daughters, because it is to remain until the widow's death for the purpose of being then applied or given to him to the reduction of the son's debt, and the balance, after such reduction is made, is specifically appropriated to be held as an investment of his portion. Under no circumstances (at any rate, before the widow's death) is it to be collected and applied or the interest on it collected and applied to the payment of any charges on the general estate, the interest from it, unlike the income of the scheduled properties, not forming a portion of the general estate, but specifically appropriated to the preservation of the fund from which his allowance of $1,600 a year is to be had.\nMr. Kaye, Q.C., for respondents:\nIt is my duty, as representing the trustees and executors, to call the attention of this honourable court to the passages in the will which, in their opinion, shows the testator's intention was that the corpus should not be touched. The general estate (which includes all but the corpus of the scheduled property), comes to the trustees subject to a charge of an annuity to the widow, and is to be held upon the same trusts for the daughters as the schedule property. Under the trusts, as to the scheduled property, the corpus is to remain intact until the daughters' decease, therefore the corpus of the general estate, which is to be held upon the same trusts, is also to remain intact in like manner. The widow has a primary charge on the general estate, therefore, so far as the daughters are concerned, the corpus of the general estate is to remain intact for the purpose of securing the widow's annuity as intended and provided by the will.\nThe provisions of the will in favor of the widow are in lieu of dower, and as the testator left real estate in which her dower right existed at his death, she is a purchaser for value[4], her claim is therefore preferential to that of the daughters, and the fund provided for her security ought not to be taken to pay their annuities.\nNow, by referring to the will it will be seen that the testator gives to his wife the annuity which, he says, \"shall be a charge upon my general estate;\" thus making an independent gift of the annuity to her, and expressly charging it upon his general estate; but it will also be seen that there is no charge of the annuities to the daughters, and no independent gift of the annuities to them; the gift to them consists only in the direction to the executors and trustees to pay them from and out of the general estate.\nHow could the trustees pay out of the general estate, unless that general estate is first in them from and out of which they can pay? How is the estate in them except by the residuary clause?\nIf they take nothing as trustees except what is left after deducting the annuities to the daughters, what have they in them from and out of which to pay those annuities? It is a fallacy to assume that there was a charge of those annuities in favor of the daughters, or an independent gift of such annuities to them; they take only through the trustees, who take at the decease of the testator the whole legal estate, both real and presonal, in order to fulfil and discharge the trusts thereof. As to so much of the whole estate as is comprehended under the term general estate, the trustees take subject to a charge in favor of the widow, and subject to no other charge.\nCan the trustees, by selling to pay the annuities to the daughters, destroy or diminish the estate expressly charged in favor of the widow, and subject to which charge the trustees take the estate? If they can sell to pay the annuities to the daughters, what becomes of the express charge in favor of the widow? So to sell, implies that the daughters, with respect to the annuities, stand on equal terms with the widow.\nIn the case of Baker v. Baker[5], the testator gave his estate to trustees in trust to invest a sum, the dividends of which would realize the clear annual sum of two hundred pounds, and to pay such dividends to his wife, and at her death the trustees were to hold the principal money intrust for other parties, and it was there contended, on behalf of the widow, that if the, dividends were insufficient, the corpus should be taken to pay her annuity; referring to this contention, the Lord Chancellor observed: \"According to the construction which is contended for on behalf of the widow, this strange state of things would arise, that, supposing her life to continue for many years, the provision which was clearly intended for her by the will might, in the course of time, by appropriating annually a portion of the corpus of the property, be utterly annihilated, and she would be left without any provision at all, and therefore, as the question is one regarding intention, I apprehend that nobody can suppose that such an intention could have ever existed in the mind of the testator.\" Now it is the daughters in the present case, and not the widow, who seek to use the corpus of the general estate. Can anybody suppose that an intention existed in the mind of the testator that the corpus of the estate charged by him with the widow's annuity should be taken to pay the daughters annuities, whereby possibly the corpus may be annihilated and his widow left without the provision intended for her, and in return for which he required her to relinquish her right to dower out of his estate?\nThat it was not the intention of the testator that the corpus of the general estate should be taken to pay the annuities to the daughters is further shown by the effect which the taking of such corpus would have in possibly destroying the equality of shares amongst his daughters which he plainly desired to preserve; thus Mrs. Almon, one of his daughters, received in her father's lifetime advances to over nine thousand dollars, while the other daughters received nothing. Under the provisions of the will, the amount of these advances are to be taken as a part of her share of the residuary estate. Mrs. Almon has therefore received upwards of nine thousand dollars on account of her share of the residuary estate, and to make the shares of the other daughters equal, each would have to receive nine thousand dollars; or, the whole of them together, 4\u00d79,000=$36,000; but if the corpus of the estate be used, it does or may take away the fund out of which this $36,000 has to be paid to make the shares of the four daughters equal, and the using of the corpus does or may defeat the intention of the testator that the shares of the children should be equal.\nSTRONG, J.\nThe question presented for our decision on this appeal arises on the will of the Hon. John Robertson, who died on the 3rd of August, 1876. The provisions of the will material to be considered may be stated as follows: The testator, in the first place, gave his widow an annuity of $10,000 for her life, which he declared to be in lieu of dower. This annuity the testator directed should be chargeable on his general estate. The testator then devised and bequeathed to the executors and trustees of his will certain real and personal property, particularly described in five schedules marked respectively A, B, C, D and E, annexed to his will, upon the trusts hereafter stated, viz., upon trust during the life of his wife to collect and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof, which should be and be taken to form a portion of his \"general estate,\" and then, from and out of the general estate, during the life of the testator's wife, to pay to each of his five daughters the clear yearly sum of $1,600 by equal quarterly payments, free from the debts, control, and engagements of their respective husbands. Next, resuming the statement of the trusts of the scheduled property specifically given, the testator provides that from and after the death of his wife the trustees are to collect and receive the rents, issues, dividends and profits of the lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises mentioned in the several schedules, and to pay to his daughter Mary Allen Almon the rents, issues, dividends and profits of the lands, tenements and hereditaments apportioned to her and mentioned in the schedule A; to his daughter Eliza the income arising from the property comprised in schedule B; to his daughter Margaret that of the property comprised in schedule C; to his daughter Agnes Lucas that of the property comprised in schedule D, and to his daughter Laura Campbell the income arising from the property in schedule E. Such payments to be made to the separate use of his daughters. Then there is a provision that each of the daughters are to be charged with insurance, ground rents, rates and taxes, repairs and other expenses connected with or incidental to the management and upholding of the property apportioned to her, the same being from time to time deducted from such quarterly payments. The will then, after directing the executors to keep the properties described in the schedules insured against fire, and giving the devisees an option either to re-build or to lease the ground, in case of loss by fire, proceeds as follows: \"And upon trust, on the death of either of my said daughters, to convey one-third of the said lands, tenements, hereditaments and premises apportioned to her in such schedule to such person or persons, upon the trusts, and for the ends, intents and purposes, or in such manner, as my said daughter may, by any writing under her hand, attested by two or more witnesses, or by her last will and testament, direct and appoint, and in default of such direction and appointment, then and in such case the said two-thirds and one-third shall be held by my said executors and trustees in trust for such child or children, and be equally divided between them and their heirs, share and share alike, on the youngest child living attaining the age of 21 years, and in the mean time and until such child shall attain such age the rents, issues and profits thereof shall be applied by my said executors towards the support, maintenance and education of such child or children; and in the event of my daughter dying leaving no issue her surviving, then and in such case I will and direct that the said two-thirds and the one-third before mentioned (if no disposition of the same shall be made by my said daughter) shall be equally divided by my said executors and trustees between her sisters and brother and their respective heirs per stirpes and not per capita\". The testator then gives a \"like\" annuity of $1,600 to his son David Dobie Robertson, and directs that after the death of the testator's wife his son shall have a legacy of $50,000, which he estimates to be the equivalent in value of the property contained in the schedules given to each of his daughters; and he directs that as well the annuity as the legacy of the capital sum shall be paid to his son by setting it off against a debt due by his son to himself, on which debt he directs interest to be charged at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. Subject to these specific devises and bequests, annuities and pecuniary legacies already mentioned, the testator gives the residue of his estate to his executors upon trust by the following words, which are important to be considered: \"The rest, residue and remainder of my said estate, both real and personal, and whatsoever and wheresoever situated, I give devise and bequeath the same to my said executors and trustees upon the trusts and for the intents and purposes following.\" He then gives out of the residue a legacy of $4,000 to his brother Duncan Robertson, and the ultimate residue he directs to be equally divided among his children, upon the same trusts with regard to his daughters as are hereinbefore declared, with respect to the said estate in the said schedules mentioned.\nFor the purpose of obtaining a declaration as to the proper construction of this will, the executors filed a bill in the Supreme Court in Equity of the Province of New Brunswick, and the defendants, the present appellants, having answered, the cause was heard upon bill and answer before his honor the Chief Justice of New Brunswick.\nAmong the questions submitted by the respondents for the decision of the court were the following:\nFirst\u2014Whether the trustees are or are not bound or authorized to pay the annuities of $1,600 each to the daughters of the testator, during the life of the testator's widow, in full out of the corpus of all or any part or parts of the real or personal estate of the testator, if the rents, issues and profits of the whole of the said estate, or the whole of the said estate applicable for that purpose, prove insufficient. Second\u2014Whether, if the trustees are so bound or authorized, they, during the life of the widow, have not power to sell or mortgage any and what part or parts of the corpus of the estate to raise funds to pay said annuities of $1,600 to each of said daughters in full, so far as the rents, issues and profits of the said estate prove insufficient for that purpose, or to any and what extent. Third\u2014Whether the trustees, during the life of the widow, before selling the corpus of the testator's estate to meet the said annuities of $1,600 to each of said daughters, ought or ought not to reserve so much of any and what part of the said estate as may be necessary to provide for and secure the widow's annuity, and if so how is the extent of such reserve to be ascertained and determined and by whom.\nBy the decree pronounced by the Chief Justice, sitting in the Supreme Court in Equity, it was declared as follows: \"And as to the first and second questions, it being admitted that the rents and profits of the whole estate left by the testator are insufficient, after paying the annuity of $10,000 to his widow, and the rents and taxes upon his house in London, to pay the several sums of $1,600 a year to each of his daughters during the life of their mother, whether under these circumstances the executors and trustees have power to sell or mortgage any part of the corpus to make up the deficiency, his honor doth declare that the said executors and trustees have no such power. The answer to the said first and second questions being thus given, renders it unnecessary to answer the third.\"\nThe appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and the appeal was there heard before four judges, two of whom, Mr. Justice Weldon and Mr. Justice Wetmore, concurred with the Chief Justice, whilst Mr. Justice Fisher and Mr. Justice Palmer were of opinion that the part of the decree complained of should be reversed, and the court being thus equally divided the decree of the Supreme Court in Equity was affirmed. From this order of the Supreme Court the appellants have appealed to this court.\nThe gifts to the testator's daughters of the property, real and personal, included in the schedule, are specific, and are, in the absence of a contrary intention indicated in the will, to be taken free from any charge in respect of the annuity given to the testator's wife, as well as from those given to the daughters themselves.\nThe learned Chief Justice proceeded upon the assumption that the annuities were not merely charged on the property described in the schedules, but were so charged in exoneration of the general estate of the testator. The testator, after directing that the income of the property specifically devised to the daughters shall, during the life of his wife, be added to and form part of his general estate, expressly directs that \"from and out of his general estate during the life of his wife,\" his executors shall pay to his daughters the annuities in question. And as regards the annuity to the widow the words are equally decisive to show, not merely no intention to charge the specific gifts with the annuities, but to restrict them to the fund out of which they would be prim\u00e2 facie payable, the general personal estate, for, after giving this annuity, he adds the words \"which shall be a charge upon my general estate.\" It seems, therefore, very clear that, as in the simple case of a testator first giving a particular chattel by way of specific bequest and then an annuity to another legatee the whole personal estate other than the subject of the specific legacy is available for the payment of the annuity, so in the present case the whole personal estate, other than that specifically given to the testator's wife and comprised in the schedule, is liable for the payment of the annuities.\nIn so applying the fund to be produced by the conversion of the general personal estate, the income is of course to be first applied to the payment of the annuities, but if this should prove insufficient then recourse may be had to the capital, unless the testator has expressly or by implication demonstrated an intention to restrict the annuitants to the income. Is there, then, to be found in the will anything which will authorize us to say that the persons to whom these annuities are given are to be confined to the income? As regards the annuity to the widow, which, having been given in lieu of dower, is of course entitled to priority, no question arises, since it is admitted that the income is sufficient for its payment. The conclusion at which the learned Chief Justice arrived seems to have been entirely founded on a misapprehension of the terms of the will, for he assumed, as I have already said, that the annuities were charged exclusively on the scheduled properties, but this, as I have already pointed out, was beyond all question not the case; had it been, the construction adopted by the Chief Justice would undoubtedly have been right, for the case of Baker v. Baker[6], quoted in his judgment, and many other authorities, a collection of which will be found in Theobald on Wills, at p. 410, shew that where the corpus is dealt with by the will, as by a specific gift over after the termination of the annuity, it is not liable to make good arrears which the income has been insufficient to pay. And if the annuities had been confined to the scheduled properties this principle would have applied in the present case. But the fund out of which the annuities are here payable is, as I have already shewn, the general personal estate, and, as I will shew hereafter, the real estate not specifically devised in addition. Then, does the will contain any expression or implication of an intention to conserve the capital or corpus of both or either of these funds until after the death of the testator's wife? The learned counsel who supported the judgment of the court below argued that such an intention was indicated by two distinct considerations,\u2014first, he contended that the testator must be presumed to have intended that the widow should have the security of the whole real and personal estate for the payment of her annuity, and that consequently neither of these funds was to be broken in upon during her life for the payment of arrears of other annuities which the income was inadequate to pay. As the annuities to the testator's children are to cease at the death of the widow, this would of course have been tantamount to saying that the annuities should be payable out of income only. The answer to this contention is, however, very obvious. We nowhere find that the testator has said that his wife should have the security of his whole estate. He has simply given her an annuity, so given, it is true, as to be payable in priority and to the disappointment, if requisite, of all his other beneficiaries, but there is nothing to show that he intended his gift to have any other or greater effect than the ordinary gift of an annuity. The widow is therefore entitled to have a portion of the corpus of the estate, real and personal, not specifically devised or bequeathed, sufficient to produce an income equivalent to the amount of her annuity, set apart at once for that purpose[7], and invested for her benefit in such securities as, by the rules of the Supreme Court in Equity in New Brunswick, trustees are authorized to invest in. Subject to the investment of such a fund the remainder of the estate, real and personal, is available for the payment of other annuitants and legatees. It was further argued that the residue given to the executors and trustees meant the residue after what had previously been given to the same trustees, namely, the scheduled properties, and therefore included the whole estate subject only to the specific bequests, and that, there being then a gift of this residue to the testator's children, with the same limitations as those upon which the scheduled properties had been settled, the whole corpus was to be kept intact for the purpose of carrying out the trusts.\nThe fault of this argument is that it assumes the whole question in dispute. The enquiry is, what is the residue composed of? or, in other words, are the annuities to be paid out of the corpus of the estate before the residue is ascertained? and this is not met by assuming that the residue is the whole estate less the fund set aside for the widow. It is clear beyond all question, much too plain to require authority to be cited to sustain the proposition, that where a legacy, annuity, or any other bequest is first given, and is then followed by a gift of residue, the word \"residue\" ex vi termini imports what shall remain after satisfaction of the previous bequests. So in the present case the residue given to the executors means what shall remain after satisfaction of the annuities in question. The will therefore contains nothing which would warrant us in depriving the children of the testator of their prim\u00e2 facie right to have the arrears of their annuities made good out of the corpus of the estate, subject only to the prior rights of the widow and other specific legatees and devisees.\nThe direction to pay the annuities out of the general estate would not warrant us in holding that the annuities are charged on the realty. The terms of the residuary clause are, however, amply sufficient for that purpose. By it the testator has charged all his pecuniary legacies and annuities on his real estate. The introductory words of that clause are \"the rest, residue and remainder of my said estate, both real and personal, I give, devise and bequeath.\" Now it is a well established principle of construction that if a testator, after giving a pecuniary legacy without any indication of an intention to charge it on the realty so far as the language of the gift itself indicates, subsequently gives the residue of his real estate, the use of the word \"residue,\" as applied to the real estate, is sufficient to charge the legacy by implication, and this is so, even though there have been previous specific devises of real estate[8].\nFrom a vast number of authorities, the following have been selected as affording examples of the application of this rule: Bench v. Biles[9]; Francis v. Clemow[10]; Greville v. Brown[11]. There can, therefore, be no doubt of the authority of the executors and trustees to raise any arrears of the annuities from time to time by sale or mortgage of the testator's real estate not specifically devised in aid of the corpus of the general personalty.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that so much of the decree of the court below as is complained of in this appeal must be reversed; and that there must be substituted for it a declaration that the annuities given to the appellants are charged on the corpus of the real and personal estate, subject to the right of the widow to have a sufficient sum set apart to provide for her annuity; and I think that the costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, J.J., concurred. GWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe plain meaning of the testator's will, as it appears to me, is, that the property in the several schedules mentioned, subject to such alteration as should be made therein under the provisions in the will in that behalf, so as to make the parcels in each, in the opinion of the executors, &c., of the value of $50,000, should be held by the executors and trustees during the life of testator's wife upon trust to receive the rents, issues and profits thereof for the purpose that such rents, &c., should form part and parcel of what the testator calls his general estate. He then gave to his wife and to his five daughters out of this general estate (which term must plainly be construed as meaning the rents, issues and profits of the property in the schedules particularly mentioned, together with the residue of his estate not specifically appropriated), six several annuities, namely $10,000 per annum to his wife during her life and $1,600 per annum to each of his five daughters during the life of his widow; and, being desirous to place all his children on an equality, he directed that a sum of money, amounting to or exceeding $50,000, in the testator's son's hands bearing interest at 5 per cent. should be suffered to remain at interest in his hands, and that out of such interest he should be allowed $1,600 per annum during the life of testator's widow. At the death of the widow the annuities to the children are to cease, and the executors and trustees are directed to hold then the parcels in the schedules mentioned upon certain trusts in favor of the five daughters respectively, and provision is made as to the debt due by the son so as to place him on an equality with the daughters, valuing the parcels in each schedule set apart for the daughters at $50,000. Then as to all the rest, residue and remainder of the testator's estate, both real and personal, after payment thereout, during the widow's lifetime of certain premiums of insurance and other charges, he gave, devised and bequeathed the same to his executors and trustees upon trust after paying testator's brother a legacy of $4,000, to sell and dispose of the same, and to apportion the same and the proceeds thereof equally to and among his children, share and share alike, the daughters' share to be held on the same trusts as are declared in respect of the scheduled lands; and he directed that the son's share should by held by the executors, &c., upon certain trusts declared concerning it.\nThe terms of this will, as it appears to me, plainly constitute the annual payments bequeathed during the life of the testator's widow, both to herself and to the testator's five daughters, to be annuities in the ordinary sense of that term. The annuity to the widow is expressly charged upon the general estate, which estate is constituted as above mentioned, and it is out of the same general estate that the gifts to the daughters, during the widow's life, are made payable also. There is nothing in the will expressing or indicating an intention that the gifts to the daughters during the widow's life shall be made good out of the income only of such general estate, they are, on the contrary, expressly made payable out of the general estate itself, which estate is constituted as above stated. The rule therefore is that the daughters are entitled to have their annuities made good, not only out of the income, but out of the capital of such general estate, so only, however, as not to prejudice the right of the widow to receive first her annuity in full\nThe principle of Gee v. Mahood[12], reported in appeal as Carmichael v. Gee[13], is, in my judgment, sufficient for the determination of this case.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: G. G.

Act, secs. 91, 92, 102 and 109.\nOn an information filed by the Attorney General of Ontario, for the purpose of obtaining possession of land in the city of Toronto, which was the property of one Andrew Mercer, who died intestate and without leaving any heirs or next of kin, on the ground that it had escheated to the crown for the benefit of the Province, and to which information A.M. the appellant, demurred for want of equity, the Court of Chancery held, overruling the demurrer, that the Escheat Act, c. 94 R.S.O., was not ultra vires, and that the escheated property in question accrued to the benefit of the Province of Ontario. From this decision A.F. appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that court affirmed the order overruling the said demurrer and dismissed the appeal with costs. On an appeal to the Supreme Court the parties agreed that the appeal should be limited to the broad question, as to whether the government of Canada or the Province is entitled to estates escheated to the crown for want of heirs.\nHeld,\u2014[Sir W.J. Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, J., dissenting,] that the Province of Ontario does not represent her Majesty in matters of escheat in said Province, and therefore the Attorney General for Ontario could not appropriate the property escheated to the crown in this case for the purposes of the Province, and that the Escheat Act, c. 94 R.S.O., was ultra vires.\nPer Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\u2014That any revenue derived from escheats is by sec. 102 of the B.N.A. Act placed under the control of the Parliament of Canada as part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, and no other part of the act exempts it from that disposition. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario affirming the judgment of Proudfoot, V.C., on an appeal of the appellant to the said Court of Appeal, from the decision of the said Vice-Chancellor, over-ruling the demurrer of the appellant to the information of the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nAn information was filed in the Court of Chancery on the 28th September, 1878, by the Attorney-General of Ontario against Bridget O\u2019Reilly, Andrew F. Mercer and Catharine Smith, stating that Andrew Mercer, late of the city of Toronto, died on the 13th day or June, 1871, intestate, and without leaving any heir or next of kin, whereby the estate of the said Andrew Mercer in Ontario became escheated to the Crown for the benefit of the province; that he died seized of certain specified real estate; that immediately upon his death the defendants entered into possession of it without permission or assent of her Majesty, and have continued in possession, and refused to give up possession to her Majesty; that possession was demanded on 21st Sept., 1878, but the defendants refuse to deliver up possession; and praying that the defendants be ordered to deliver, up possession of the said land, &c. The defendant Andrew F. Mercer, demurred to the said information for want of equity, and the demurrer was argued before Proudfoot, V.C. On the 7th January, 1879, the learned judge made an order overruling the said demurrer.\nFrom this decision, the defendant, Andrew F. Mercer, appealed to the Court of Appeal lor Ontario, and that court held that the Provincial Governments are entitled, under the British North America Act, to recover and appropriate escheats, and affirmed the order overruling the said demurrer and dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAgainst this judgment and order of the Court of Appeal, the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court, and the parties agreed that the appeal should be limited to the broad question as to whether the Grovernment of Canada or of the Province is entitled to estates escheated to the crown for want of heirs.\nThe Minister of Justice for the Dominion of Canada, concurring in the view of appellant\u2019s counsel, that the hereditary revenues of the crown belong to the Dominion, intervened, and the case was argued before the full court in March, 1881\u2014Mr. Lash, Q.C., for the Dominion Government, opened the case.\nMr. Lash, Q.C.:\u2014\nThe Dominion Government have intervened in this case in order to have the question determined whether the government of the Dominion of Canada or the government of the Province of Ontario have the right to deal with the escheated property It is admitted that the land in question here did escheat, and the only question is to which government the land now belongs.\nAndrew Mercer died 18th June, 1871; the crown patent for the land in question issued before confederation. It is, I think, necessary to decide what is the reason why land escheats. There are but two reasons given\u20141st. that the crown is the last heir (ultimus h\u00e6res) and takes by royal prerogative; 2nd. that in socage tenure of lands an estate remains in the crown, which, when the heirs of the tenant in fee simple fail, draws to it the fee simple, thus making the crown the owner.\nOpinions differ as to which is the true reason. The case must therefore be argued in both views. That the crown is the last heir is the opinion of Lord Mansfield in Burgess v. Wheate[1]. This view is also supported by the provisions of the act of Edward II, concerning the prerogatives of the king[2], and also by Proudfoot, V.C., in his judgment in this case. That escheat is a consequence of the free and common socage tenure, see Blackstone Comm.[3]; Burgess v. Wheate and Middleton v. Spicer[4], and the judgment of Patterson J., in this case. By 31 Geo. 3, c. 31, Imp. stat., the lands in the province of Ontario are held in free and common socage. Now the effect of this Imperial statute, which is still in force, is that the allodial estate remains in the crown and, in the old province of Upper Canada, from 1791 to confederation, neither the provincial executive nor legislature had control over that tenure. Assuming then that escheat took place in either of the ways mentioned it was a royal revenue, and prior to the union act, 3 and 4 Vic., c. 35, sec. 54, belonged to the Crown and did not go to the consolidated revenue of the province. By that statute the territorial and other revenues of the Crown were surrendered to the provinces, not absolutely or unconditionally, but to the account of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada during the life of Her Majesty and for five years after the demise of Her Majesty. This section 54 is repealed by Imperial act 10 and 11 Vic., c. 71, and new provision of a similar kind is substituted by the Canadian act, 9 Vic., c. 114. Now if the word \u201crevenue\u201d as used in the Imperial statutes, included revenues from escheats, I contend the word revenue in sec. 102, B.N.A. Act, 1867, includes revenues from escheats and that such revenue passed to the control of the Dominion parliament. This section excepts only \u201csuch portions thereof as are by this act reserved to the respective legislatures of the province.\u201d The question therefore arises whether the power of appropriation over revenues derived from escheats was by the B.N.A. Act \u201creserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces.\u201d Assuming first that escheat is a royal prerogative, I contend that the B.N.A. Act gives no power over it to the provincial legislatures. In the recital of the act, we do not find a word said about the provinces to be created out of the Dominion and there is not a word about provincial constitutions till sec. 58. Section 5 merely relates to the territorial division of Canada. Section 9 continues the executive government of Canada in the Queen. I cannot find anywhere in the act provision for the appointment of a Governor General. This power exists in the Queen by common law. The first 57 sections and a few others respecting legislative authority would have been a sufficient constitution for Canada and would have entitled the Governor General, as representing the Queen, to do every thing which before the union the other governors could have done.\nWe now come to the provisions respecting the provincial constitutions. They are specific; the others are general. The effect, therefore, was to create each province a body politic\u2014a quasi corporation, as distinct from her Majesty\u2014so that whatever rights she held individually if now vested in the provinces must have been taken away from her Majesty and given to the provinces.\nWhat rights possessed by the Queen have been taken away from her and handed over to the provinces? The Queen can come to Canada and rule in person, under the advice of her Canadian Privy Councillors. She can appoint a governor-general, but she cannot rule in the provinces with the advice of the provincial executive council. The lieutenant-governor must do that, and therefore she does not form part of the provincial legislature, as she does of the Dominion Parliament. The Queen, not being allowed to act either in the government or in the legislature of the province, the pro- vinces must be regarded as having a separate existence from and any rights possessed by them which the Queen previously possessed must have been taken out of the Queen and vested in them by the B.N.A Act. If the right of escheat, therefore, be a prerogative right where is it taken out of the Queen and vested in the province? Not by sec. 92, not by secs. 109 or 117, as this prerogative right is not lands or property.\nThe estate which, is granted, is the freehold and not the allodial estate, which must remain in her Majesty, represented by the Governor-General There is nothing in sec. 92 of the B.N.A. Act taking away this prerogative right. Section 109 did not change the tenure of the lands, for it expressly says: \u201csubject to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\u201d This allodial estate certainly did not belong to the province at the union, for the land had been granted and, under the imperial statute, it was in the Queen.\nThe only other section is sec. 129, which gives the right to alter and change existing laws, but laws existing in virtue of the Imperial statute, 1791, could not be altered by the legislatures in so far as the allodial estate of her Majesty is concerned. What was surrendered was the revenues, when they might arise, but not the prerogative right, which remains in her Majesty.\nIf this view is correct, then lands in the province of Ontario which escheat to the crown in right of the royal prerogative, whether as last heir or by reason of the socage tenure, are within the meaning of section 102 of the B.N.A. Act and belong to the Dominion, and the Attorney General of the Dominion, and not the Attorney General of the province, is the proper officer to represent her Majesty and to take proceedings in her name for the collection of these revenues. The following statutes and authorities were also cited by counsel in the course of his argument.\nImperial Statutes: 1 Will IV, c. 25; 1 and 2 Vic., c. 2, sec. 12; 31 Geo.

The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, from which we have appealed to this court, after expressing doubts as to some of the technical questions relating to procedure which were raised in that appeal, maintained the jurisdiction of the provincial authorities in all cases where lands escheat in this country for want of heirs.\nI will first ask your lordships to consider the position of the crown in respect to \u201cwaste lands\u201d in Canada\u2014and indeed in all the North American provinces\u2014prior to the Union Act of 1840. But, before I enter upon that enquiry, I desire to explain my client\u2019s position as between the two governments. His interest in this contest, is not, in my view, entirely a question of jurisdiction. It is a direct pecuniary interest, for if the local government administers this property he will get very little; if the Dominion government is entitled to represent her Majesty in the matter of escheats, he and his children will fare much better, because it has been the uniform practice in England, for a long period, for the crown to quit claim, or transfer escheated property, to the natural relatives of the deceased owner, where such relatives exist[7]. This has also been the practice in Canada and the other provinces; therefore, I say my client\u2019s interest is not only a moral, but a legal interest, for in such matters custom makes the law. Even the Ontario Government admits that he is the natural son of the deceased Mercer, and if we succeed in proving that the jurisdiction is in the Dominion, I shall expect to receive from her Majesty\u2019s representative in this country the same liberal treatment for my client that he would have received before Confederation.\nPrior to 1837, the control of the waste lands of the crown, or, as they were called, \u201cthe casual and territorial revenues,\u201d was a subject of discussion and dispute between the crown officials and the local assemblies in all the provinces. These revenues were not administered or appropriated by the local legislatures, but by the governor and his appointees. As settlement went on these revenues increased, and it was found that the executive government could be maintained at the expense of the crown without assistance from the legislatures, and that the people through their representatives could not obtain those reforms which they desired, nor exercise that influence which is now deemed essential to good government over officials who were practically independent of them. This was one of the subjects of dispute which culminated in the outbreak of 1837. The result was favorable to the popular demand, for Lord Sydenham was authorized to consent on behalf of her Majesty to a transfer or surrender of the casual and territorial revenues of the crown for a time, and on certain specific terms and conditions. In his speech to the Upper Canada Legislature, which will be found in the journals of the legislative council for 1839, he said: \u201cI am commanded again to submit to you the surrender of the casual and territorial revenues of the crown in exchange for a civil list, and I shall take an early opportunity of explaining the grounds on which her Majesty\u2019s government felt precluded from assenting to the settlement which you lately proposed.\u201d\nIt appears that the Upper Canada assembly had proposed a transfer, without conditions which would have secured the salaries of the governor, the judges, and other high officials against the hostile action of a possibly disloyal or domineering majority in the popular branch of the legislature. I find that in the session of 1837-38 the assembly addressed the governor for a copy of an act which had been agreed to between the home authorities and the legislature of New Brunswick, regulating the collection and disbursement of the casual and territorial revenues in that province. Your lordships will find this act, or a copy of it, in the appendix to the Assembly journals of Upper Canada for 1837-38, p. 391. It is to be found also in the revised statutes of New Brunswick, but much abbreviated, though in substance the same. I call your lordships\u2019 attention to the preamble, and especially to the 6th section of this act. It is a rule in the construction of statutes that they are to be interpreted by reference to former acts in pari materi\u00e2, \u201cfor it is presumed,\u201d says Maxwell[8], \u201cthat the legislature uses the same language in the same sense when dealing at different times with the same subject.\u201d\n[The learned counsel then read several passages to show: 1. That the waste lands of the crown in New Brunswick, and the hereditary revenues, including escheats, were not previously subject to the control of the provincial legislature. 2. That the transfer was conditional and for a limited time. 3. That the prerogative right of the sovereign to deal with escheats, to compromise, grant to relatives, or otherwise dispose of them, was expressly reserved. 4. That by the use of the words \u201clands, mines, minerals and royalties,\u201d as distinct from hereditary revenues such as escheats, it is seen that the construction put upon the word \u201croyalties\u201d by the Quebec Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in the case of Fraser v. Atty. Gen.[9], is a mistake, for this New Brunswick act was, no doubt, prepared by the law officers of the crown in England.\nA bill, founded on the New Brunswick precedent, was passed, but containing, as I believe it did, stipulations that would have infringed on the prerogative rights of the crown, it was not assented to. I have not been able to find a copy of the bill, but I think I have suggested the true explanation of the language used by Lord Sydenham. As regards Upper Canada, therefore, it is evident that prior to the Union Act of 1840, both the casual and the territorial revenues of the crown in that province were under the absolute control of the direct representative of her Majesty in Canada, and that her title to the waste lands jure coron\u0153 and to the hereditary revenues from whatever source had not been, and constitutionally could not be, affected by any act of the provincial legislature without her Majesty\u2019s consent, under the authority of an act of the Imperial parliament. We start then with the Union Act of 1840, to ascertain the nature and extent of local legislative authority over crown lands and crown revenues in Canada, before Confederation. The first point to be observed is the extreme care taken by the Imperial parliament to secure a permanent civil list, especially in respect to the salaries of the governor and judges, as fixed by schedule A of the act. The governor (sec. 53) might abolish any of the political offices, and vary the slims payable for then services, mentioned in schedule B, but the permanent offices could only be touched by an act of the legislature, which of course required the assent of the crown. But as regards the waste lands of the crown, we find this significant restraint on the power of legislation in the 42nd section:\u2014\n\u201cWhenever any bill or bills shall be passed containing any provisions which shall in any manner relate to or affect her Majesty\u2019s prerogative touching the granting of waste lands of the crown within the said Province, every such bill or bills shall, previously to any declaration or signification of her Majesty\u2019s assent thereto, be laid before both houses of parliament,\u201d for thirty days, and, if either house should think proper to address her Majesty asking her to withhold her assent, it would not thereafter be lawful for her to give it. Other formalities were required to prevent any covert legislation Which, if neglected, rendered such legislation ipso facto void. It will be seen that under these restrictions, in connection with those of the 57th section, preventing the legislature from passing any vote to appropriate any part of the surplus of the consolidated revenue fund, without \u201ca message\u201d from the governor, and in the 59th section, which requires the governor to exercise all his powers and authorities in conformity with instructions from her Majesty, any law divesting the crown of any of its prerogative rights, and vesting them in the provincial legislature, must emanate from, or be express- ly confirmed by, the Imperial parliament. Now, it will be for my learned friends to produce such a law prior to July 1867, if they can. I have failed to discover it. By the Imperial Act of 1791 the tenure of free and common socage was declared to be the tenure of lands in Upper Canada, when granted by the crown, but the fee, estate, or title of the sovereign in the ungranted lands, has never been divested or transferred to any other power, Imperial or local. I contend that the power of the Canadian Parliament before 1867, and the power of the local legislatures since, in respect to the public lands was and is simply a power of administration. I admit that an act of the old Canadian Parliament, sanctioned and approved by her Majesty, as required by the Union Act of 1840, might have transferred to the Canadian Government the absolute proprietorship, the prerogative right, of her Majesty in the public lands, as well as the power to manage and sell, and collect and account for, the proceeds, but no such act is to be found, and therefore the prerogative right remains as before. Such then is the general conclusion at which we arrive as to the legal and constitutional position and power of the Canadian Government prior to 1867, in respect to the prerogative rights of her Majesty in the casual and territorial revenues and waste lands of the crown. In addition to the sections I have cited from the Union Act of 1840, I refer your lordships to Forsyth\u2019s cases and opinions[10], for the opinion of the law officers of the crown, that escheats, in the colonies, cannot be granted before they accrue; and the English Civil List Act 1 and 2 Vic, c. 2, and the Imperial Act, 15 and 16 Vic., c. 39, were passed to remove doubts as to whether hereditary revenues in the colonies had not been surrendered to the Imperial Consolidated Fund. From all these acts and authorities I contend it is clear that the jurisdiction of the Canadian Government, even when these lands and revenues were under the control of a governor who was a direct representative of the crown, was limited, conditional, fiduciary, and temporary; and that the power reserved by the 6th section of the New Brunswick Civil List. Act, and by the 12th section of the Imperial Civil List Act (which are almost identical in terms) was reserved in the case of Canada, and that her Majesty has never parted with her right to dispose of escheats by and through her representative, the Governor General. The 1st and 2nd Vic., c. 2, in terms extends to the colonies and foreign possessions of the crown, and the 15th and 16th Vic., c. 39, to remove doubts, confirms my contention, because it leaves the 1st and 2nd Vic. to its operation in the colonies, except as \u201cto moneys arising from the sale of crown lands which might have been lawfully disposed of\u201d if the Civil List Acts of William IV., c. 25 and 1st and 2ndvic.c. 2, had not been passed, and expressly provides that the surplus not applied to public purposes in the colonies \u201cshall be carried to, and form part of, the said consolidated fund\u201d[11]. The doubt\u2011removing act is limited to the revenue from the sale of crown lands; it leaves the hereditary revenues from other sources, and the prerogative powers of the crown, in the same position as before, in all the colonies. When in 1847 the Canadian Parliament desired to make some changes in the restrictive provisions of the Union Act, and passed an act for the purpose, what happened? It was reserved, and as it was expedient to pass it\u2014the object not being contrary to the spirit of the compact between the Imperial and Colonial Governments\u2014the law officers of the crown found that it would be necessary to repeal certain clauses of the Union Act before the Canadian Act could become law. This was done, and the Canadian Act was appended as a schedule, and became, therefore, an Imperial enactment, unalterable by colonial legislation.\nIn the case of William IV, and in the case of her Majesty (and those acts are still in force in Great Britain, and as far as they apply are in force in the colonies of Great Britain) we find that parliament expressly reserved to the sovereign, or in other words to the crown, the right as against parliament and the government of the day, in respect of these revenues, to grant escheats of this description to relatives of the deceased\u2014to those who were not, under strict construction of law, entitled to enforce their rights as legitimate heirs. That right to evince the benevolent disposition of the crown towards the natural relatives of a deceased person who may have left his property subject to escheat, is reserved in express terms, and, in order to prevent any possibility of misconstruction, it is reiterated ex majori cautel\u00e2 that the reservation is made to the intent and for the purpose of enabling the crown independently of those acts, and of the disposition that was apparently made of all the hereditary revenues, to deal with this particular class of revenues as it should please the Royal will. The same discretion and power must be held to remain in her Majesty in respect to these revenues in the colonies, for that act, 1st and 2nd Vic., c. 2, relates to the colonies and foreign possessions of the crown, as well as to Great Britain and Ireland.\nI now come to the British North America Act of 1867 The relative rights and powers of the Federal and Provincial Governments and Legislatures, and the qualified, conditional and temporary assignment or loan of the hereditary revenues\u2014not prerogative rights, or even \u201clands\u201d\u2014but \u201crevenues,\u201d the \u201cnet produce\u201d of which was to be \u201cpaid over\u201d after all proper deductions (3 and 4 Vic. c. 35, sec. 54) to the consolidated fund of old Canada, have to be ascertained and considered in construing the Union Act of 1867. We must determine the effect and meaning of the provisions of the act of July, 1867, by ascertaining the legal and constitutional position of the subject-matter immediately before the passing of that act.\nIt is to be observed, in the first place, that the new legislative authority for the dominion is declared to be a \u201cParliament\u201d\u2014it was only a \u201cLegislative Council and Assembly\u201d before\u2014and the \u201cQueen\u201d is eo nomine declared to be a part of that Parliament. It \u201cconsists\u201d of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Commons. But she is not a part of any other corporation or legislative body under that act. The great powers of government are given to the Parliament of Canada, and only limited, enumerated, and definite powers of legislation, on local and municipal subjects, are given to the local assemblies.\nThe Lieutenant Governor is not the representative of the prerogatives of the crown in this country, except in a very limited sense. The Lieutenant Governor is appointed by the Governor General as other officers are appointed by him. He is a high official; he has important functions unquestionably, but among them is not included the power of representing the prerogative rights of her Majesty in respect to her hereditary revenues. As Lord Carnarvon stated in his despatch of January 7th, 1875, written under the advice of the law officers of the crown in England, he is a \u201cpart of the colonial administrative staff.\u201d He is, therefore, subject to the direction of the Governor General, who is advised, in respect of questions of dominion import, by the responsible ministers of the crown in this country. He is appointed by the Governor General, not by the Queen; he is commissioned by the Governor General, not by the Queen; he is instructed by the Governor General, not by the Queen; he is subject, to dismissal, under certain circumstances, by the Governor General; he is not subject to dismissal by the Queen. And, if I am permitted to refer for the purpose of my argument and in illustration of my case to a recent political event, he is subject to dismissal in consequence of a vote of censure by the Parliament of Canada, even against the opinion, so far as it could be ascertained, of the Governor General himself. The correspondence in that case and the action that followed clearly prove that my construction of the act in regard to the office of the Lieutenant Governor, is the true one. We have not had a judicial decision upon the point, but, so far as executive action and official opinion are concerned, that case proves that the Lieutenant Governor is regarded as a local officer appointed by the Governor General, and in no manner subject to direction, approval, or disapproval by the Imperial authorities. He is to all intents and purposes a local colonial officer and nothing more. If that be so, it is absurd to suppose that he can, by virtue of his office, in any manner undertake to represent or exercise Imperial functions, or dispose of the revenues resulting from the exercise of the prerogative rights of the crown. If you could find in this act language which showed a clear intention on the part of the Imperial Parliament for convenience, or for any reason of state, to clothe this officer, appointed by the Governor General, with authority to deal with this particular property or revenue, I would in that case admit, as the power of the Imperial Parliament is supreme, that he was properly exercising the functions of his office in collecting and disposing of the revenues resulting from the enforcement of the hereditary right of the crown in the case of escheats. From the evidence of intention which we find in the act itself, from the judicial commentaries and expositions it has received, from the action of the Imperial Government through the Secretary of State, from the action of the Governor General in this country, from the action of our own Parliament\u2014from all these, I contend, it is established that the Lieutenant Governor is a local and not an Imperial officer, and can in no way intervene in proceedings for the recovery of escheats.\nBy sec. 102, \u201call duties and revenues\u201d over which the previous provincial legislatures had power of appropriation (except what is otherwise disposed of by the act) are to constitute a consolidated fund for the public service of Canada.\nBut for the exception in this clause there would be no doubt, I apprehend, as to the present position of the hereditary revenues of the crown in Canada. It would be clear\u2014beyond question\u2014that these \u201crevenues\u201d as well as the \u201cduties\u201d arising under existing laws from various sources, were transferred to, and intended to form part of the consolidated fund of the dominion, for the purposes of the dominion, and that conclusion would be all the more evident from a consideration of the special object for which this transference was made. It was made in order that the new government should have the means from the same sources as before, and in pursuance of an existing contract, of providing for certain services, for certain salaries, and for certain public establishments. That duty is transferred to the dominion. The Imperial act having cast upon the dominion the burden of these services, it would be only reasonable and natural to suppose that the framers of this act would provide the dominion with the means, from the same sources as had previously furnished them with funds to meet those charges. But the excepting clause, according to some authorities, raises the question involved in this case: \u201cExcept such portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces.\u201d I call your lordships\u2019 attention to the peculiar language of that clause. The act does not say that any revenues are reserved for appropriation by, or subject to, the control of the provinces or their local governments, but a portion is reserved to the \u201clegislatures\u201d of the provinces. The legislatures are the only power, newly constituted, to which this reservation is made; therefore, it is a legislative power. Their power of disposition or control is derived exclusively from their functions as a legislature. They must pass a law; they must dispose of whatever is under their control by an act of legislation. It is to them in their corporate, legislative capacity, that this power of control is given by the Imperial Act. When we look at the section of the act which assigns to them their legislative powers, we do not find, I contend, any sufficient words to convey to them the power to intermeddle with, or dispose of the hereditary revenues of the crown.\nNow, I cannot understand the reasoning of the learned judges who say that by the word \u201cland,\u201d in the 109th section, the absolute estate and prerogative right of the crown\u2014always theretofore reserved\u2014in the waste lands of the crown have been granted to and vested in the provincial legislatures. It is clear, from the qualifying expression \u201cbelonging\u201d to the provinces \u201cat the Union,\u201d that nothing more was intended to be given to the new, than had already been given to the old, provinces. Therefore, we come back to the proposition I have endeavored to establish, viz, that under the Union Act of 1840 the Queen\u2019s prerogative right remained intact, and that neither the 109th nor any other section of the act of 1867 has infringed upon or divested it. If we look at the 92nd section, which enumerates and limits the legislative powers of the province, we find these significant words: \u201cThe management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province, and of the timber and wood thereon.\u201d If it had been intended to extinguish the estate or title of the crown, and to vest in the legislature the absolute dominion over, and fee simple in, the public lands, why specify \u201cthe timber and wood thereon?\u201d In this grant of legislative power every word suggests agency, trusteeship, and limitation; not absolute ownership or undivided authority.\nAs this is a question of interpretation and intention, and as we sometimes derive great advantage from the light which is thrown upon doubtful words and phrases in acts of parliament\u2014though I see nothing obscure or doubtful here\u2014by ascertaining the views, opinions, and intentions of the framers of those acts, and as the estate or title which \u201cbelonged\u201d to the Province of Canada \u201cat the Union\u201d of 1867 is the estate or title which belongs to Ontario now with certain qualifications, I direct your lordships\u2019 attention on this point to the explanations of Lord John Russell, who introduced and carried through parliament the Union Act of 1840. You will find the report in the Mirror of Parliament for 1840[12]. Lord Stanley, who had previously held the office of Colonial Secretary, though at the time in opposition, approved generally of Lord John Russell\u2019s Union Bill.\nWe find there a commentary upon the land and revenue clauses of the act of 1840, by those who framed them, and explained their meaning to parliament. It supports my contention that, as Lord Stanley puts it, \u201cit is not the crown lands themselves, but the revenue arising from them\u201d that was transferred to the Canadian Legislature. It results from this view of the reservation of the prerogative right of the crown in the waste lands of the crown, under the Act of 1840, that the same right subsists, and was not intended to be granted to the local legislatures by the act of 1867. The judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the province of Quebec, in the Fraser escheat case[13], to which I have before referred, and on which the respondents also rely as a decision in their favor, is based on the assumption that the word \u201croyalties\u201d in the 109th section of the British North America Act transfers to the provinces the hereditary revenues accruing from escheats. I admit that these revenues did belong to the old province of Canada, subject to the right of her Majesty to quit claim to or release them in favour of relatives, as I have already pointed out. But the \u201cnet produce\u201d of these revenues was all that was granted by the act of 1840, and the 102nd section of the act of 1867, gives these revenues to the consolidated fund of the dominion, in express terms. The word \u201croyalties\u201d has no reference to these casual revenues, but to the rents or dues reserved for mining rights in the Maritime Provinces. \u201cIt is usual for the crown to reserve a royalty on minerals raised from waste lands in the colonies\u201d[14]. Not only is this clear from the associate words, but the next sentence shows that such a construction was never contemplated by the framers of the act, \u201cand all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties shall belong to\u201d the provinces. What \u201csums\u201d could possibly be then due or payable \u201cfor\u201d the prerogative right to inherit, as ultimus h\u0153res, the property of persons dying intestate and without heirs? Are the jura regalia of the crown things, commodities, that can be sold in the market place, and for which \u201csums\u201d of money may be \u201cdue or payable\u201d by private persons? Surely not; yet, my lords, the respondents quote the case of Dyke vs. Walford[15] to Support that proposition, for they say royalties here means the same thing as jura regalia there.\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal, though arriving at the same conclusion as to the jurisdiction, would not base their judgment on the word \u201croyalties,\u201d as the Quebec Court had done, but discovered an intention to transfer\u2014I will not say, to sell\u2014the prerogative to the local legislature, in the words \u201call lands.\u201d But they overlook, or do not attempt to construe, the proviso at the end of section 109. The grant of \u201call lands,\u201d etc., is subject expressly to \u201cany trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest\u201d\u2014that of the sovereign, by virtue of her prerogative, as well as any\u2014\u201cother than that of the province in the same.\u201d This proviso qualifies the whole section. Private as well as public rights had to be considered in handing over the administration of the public lands to local legislatures. Sales had been made and rights acquired, which it became necessary to protect against unjust treatment by an arbitrary majority in legislatures which did not then exist. That proviso was intended to give a legal remedy against these new powers if they attempted to take away, or affect injuriously, the existing rights of any of her Majesty\u2019s subjects in the old provinces. I trust this court will not ignore the proviso.\nThe next point urged by the respondent, and recognized by the Ontario Court as a correct inference in law, from the word \u201clands,\u201d is, 1st, that the estate, or interest of the crown in escheats in Canada, is a \u201creversion,\u201d and, 2nd, that a grant of lands without more, in an act of parliament, conveys this reversion. I have tried in vain to find any authority for this doctrine as applied to lands in a colony. The respondent, in his reasons against appeal, mentions no cases. Remembering the commendation of my legal preceptor in favor of an old book, which he said was the great storehouse of cases on the law of real property in England, especially concerning tenures, I resorted to Touchstone, and this is what I find there:\u2014\n\u201cGrant of an estate in being by the king must recite the previous estate or else the grant of the new estate will be void[16].\u201d\n\u201cMisrecital of previous estate in a deed may pass the reversion in the case of a private person, but will be void in case of grant by the king[17].\u201d\n\u201cBy grant of land in possession reversion may pass, but by grant of reversion land in possession will not pass.\u201d But this applies to private persons[18].\nIn Cruise\u2019s digest[19] I find it laid down that \u201cwhere a reversion is vested in the crown it could not be barred by common recovery, which barred reversions and estates tail,\u201d and again, \u201cthe crown could not be deprived of any part of its property by ordinary conveyances which would divest subjects. An act of parliament expressly declaring that the reversion shall be divested out of the crown is necessary.\u201d It is clear from all the authorities that nothing will be inferred or implied against the rights of the crown. The reigning sovereign cannot even abandon a prerogative unless authorized by statute to do so[20]. In the case of Mines[21] it was laid down, and has been followed as good law ever since, that if the king granted \u201clands and mines therein contained\u201d it passes only certain mines, and not mines of gold and silver. The grantee will not take anything not expressly mentioned[22]. And as it is an equally well established rule that no act of parliament can affect or take away the crown\u2019s prerogatives, unless by clear and express words, I do not see any justification in law or logic for the claim of the respondent in this case that the words \u201call lands\u201d in the 109th section of the B.N.A. Act, even if they were not explained and limited by the succeeding words, include and were intended to grant away forever the prerogative right of the crown, whether you call it a royalty, a reversion, or a caducary succession.\nThe construction that is suggested respecting the Union Act of 1867, would utterly destroy the object and purpose of that reservation of authority in her Majesty with respect to escheats in Canada. It would place that kind of property which is expressly reserved by the crown in England, under the control absolutely of whom? Of the local assembly, the provincial representatives of the people. And how are they likely to exercise that control? What does this very example show of the disposition of such a body? In this case about $150,000 worth of private property belonging to the deceased, Mr. Mercer, accumulated by himself, not resulting from free grants or anything of that kind which might, perhaps, have justified a feeling in the public mind that his property ought to revert to the public for public purposes\u2014but the private earnings and accumulations of this person, are taken from the possession of his own son by the local government, by the vote of a bare majority of the local legislature, and appropriated to public uses. The local officials, with a voracity that is revolting, seize it for the purpose of gaining credit to themselves with their partizans, and, ignoring the moral, and, as I contend, the rightful claims of the admitted son and four grand-children of this deceased person, appropriate their patrimony to the use of abandoned women, to the erection of an asylum, a reformatory for prostitutes\u2014and, adding insult to injury, with cruel sarcasm, they give this reformatory the name of ANDREW MERGER! Now, my lords, I say that, looking through these Imperial statutes and the reports of transactions of this kind in Great Britain, we find that her Majesty has never acted in that spirit or in that manner in dealing with escheated property. I remember a case, and no doubt some of your lordships have met with it, which happened two or three years ago in England, where a person was killed by a railway accident. He happened to be without heirs. His estate consisted of personal property. I think he lived in the city of Bristol, and the property was taken possession of as an escheat of the crown. The money was, by order of her Majesty, appropriated for some public purpose in the town in which the man had lived. It was appropriated for the benefit of his neighbors and friends. Under the provisions of the Civil List Act, and under the influence of those moral considerations which have induced the crown to act leniently and unselfishly in matters of this kind, the money was given in that case, not to relatives, because the man had none, but it was devoted to public purposes in the town in which he had accumulated his property. It was not permitted to reach the public treasury. I refer to that case as showing the spirit which prevails, and the policy which directs in the disposition of such properties in England, and that the representatives of her Majesty in this country will, presumably, exercise this mild and generous prerogative power in dealing with properties of this kind which legally come to the crown in Canada. The argument of convenience and inconvenience is, I perceive, made use of by the respondents in this case, as if some weight ought to be given to it in a court of law. I think, therefore, I am justified in directing your attention to the public policy which is involved in this question, in view of the uniform practice of the Imperial authorities. At all events, it will operate to this extent\u2014that it will cause your lordships to look into the matter with great care to discover the meaning and purpose intended, and the conditions imposed, in the transfer of these revenues to old Canada in 1840, and will sustain my contention that they were transferred to the jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament by the act of 1867, under the same conditions. Now, I will call your lordships1 attention, at this stage, to a case decided in this court, which involved the question of authority to exercise the prerogative right of the crown under our present constitution: I refer to the case of Lenoir vs. Ritchie[23], and, although it bears upon another branch of the prerogative, yet the doctrines propounded, and cases cited by some of the learned judges who delivered judgments in that case are, I think, doctrines and authorities which are applicable to the question which is now under your consideration.\nSee also Chilty on prerogatives[24]. In looking over the cases bearing upon this question, I have met with a judgment pronounced by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Theberge vs. Landry[25], in which that doctrine is reaffirmed, although the court in that case distinguished as to the subject-matter, and refused to advise the exercise of her Majesty\u2019s prerogative right to hear appeals. As it is the latest decision on the point, by the highest court in the empire, I ask your lordships to make a note of it.\nThis is a judgment upon the British North America Act, and supports my contention that when I have shown that the prerogative as to escheats existed in this country prior to 1867, precise words must be found in the Union Act of 1840 and in the Confederation Act of 1867 to take away that prerogative. Now, my lords, there are no such words in either of these acts. There is another point with reference to the Act of 1867: The 91st section of the B.N.A. Act declares that:\u2014 \u201cIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters,\u201d\u2014no more comprehensive language could be used than this, but there is one exception\u2014\u201cto all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d\nNow, my lords, it is the plain meaning of the language used by the Imperial Parliament in this section, that the Dominion Parliament should have, full, complete, and, so far as a subordinate legislature can have, absolute authority to deal with every matter of legislation in Canada, except those special matters that are assigned to these local bodies. The whole field of legislation, the whole scope of legislative power, is placed in the hands of the Dominion Parliament, and may be exercised over the lives, liberties and property of the people of this dominion, except in those special cases in which this subordinate sectional legislative power is conceded to the local legislatures. And to impress still more strongly and clearly on those who are to read this act, and the courts which are to interpret it, that they are not to question this general exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament to legislate upon every matter concerning the people under its jurisdiction, except in those special cases in which certain questions are expressly assigned to provincial authorities, it is provided:\u2014\n\u201cAnd for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that, notwithstanding anything in this act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\u201d\nAnd certain subjects are then enumerated for the pur- pose of explanation and suggestion to people about to be placed under a new constitutional system. It might have been inferred from the enumeration of excepted matters, if this first enumeration had been omitted from the act, that the powers of the general parliament would after all be largely limited; but with this enumeration they would see at a glance the great multiplicity of matters upon which the Dominion Parliament have unquestionably a right to legislate. And for fear that the specification of particular powers might, according to a well known rule, operate as a restriction of the Dominion Parliament, the following is added:\u2014\n\u201cAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects\u201d\u2014not the particular subjects, but the \u201cclasses\u201d of subjects\u2014\u201cenumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature, comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d Although in the enumeration of local powers it might seem that some of those assigned to parliament were included, you are not to include them. The very first subject over which the Dominion Parliament is given exclusive authority is \u201cthe public debt, and,\u201d as I interpolate, the public \u201cproperty.\u201d \u201cThe public debt and property\u201d must be read as if the word \u201cpublic\u201d had been inserted before \u201cproperty,\u201d because no other property can be intended. That is the power with which the Dominion Parliament is endowed. It includes the \u201cpublic property\u201d of every kind which is not expressly assigned to the provinces. The 102nd section, as I have pointed out, covers everything so far as duties and \u201crevenues\u201d are concerned. The power to manage and sell the waste lands which were under provincial jurisdiction at the union, and collect the moneys or \u201csums\u201d in respect of previous sales which were then uncollected, were under the 109th section, given to the provinces. So there is no difficulty about that. Now, that power of legislation conferred upon the Dominion Parliament by the 1st sub-section, taken in connection with the general authorization in the 91st section, and taken in connection with the 102nd section relating to \u201call duties and revenues\u201d seems to me, my lords, to give to the Dominion Parliament, beyond any question whatever, the right to deal with the subject-matter involved in this case, unless it is found to have been conveyed or transferred to the local legislatures by some other section. With reference to that contention, I shall have to examine with some detail the judgments, in the first place, of the Queen\u2019s Bench of Lower Canada, where this point was first decided. In the Fraser case to which I refer, it appears that in the first instance the question came before the learned judge who now so worthily fills his place upon this Supreme Court Bench Hon Justice Taschereau. The judgment given by him in that case affirmed the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and the Dominion Government in matters of escheat. That was appealed against, and the case came before the Court of Appeal of Lower Canada. As I pointed out, the learned chief justice of that court admitted that he found nowhere in the B.N.A. Act of 1867, any direct and express transfer of lands or revenues escheating to the crown in Canada to the local legislatures.\n[The learned counsel then reviewed the arguments and positions taken by Chief Justice Dorion in the Fraser case, and of the judges of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the present case.]\nJurisdiction over every possible subject of legislation is, in general words, assigned to the Dominion Parliament, and the exception, so far as it extends, is something taken or carved out of that power, and is all that is given to the local legislatures. The entire legislative authority, as it existed in the various provinces before confederation, was dealt with by the Imperial Parliament. No one can doubt the power of the Imperial Parliament to have deprived Canada (so far as an Act of Parliament could do it) of representative government altogether. It might have converted, or reconverted, our provinces into crown colonies, with some new experimental system of colonial government. Probably it would not have been well received. They might have found Boers in Canada, as well as in South Africa; but, as a matter of law\u2014as a matter of argument before a court of law\u2014I contend that the whole subject was completely within the control of the Imperial Parliament. They could assign such powers of legislation for the future as they thought fit without respect to the \u201crights\u201d of the past. There were no rights in the question which a court of law can recognize. The people of the four provinces, united together in the new form, were endowed with even greater rights and larger powers than before, but the legislative control and direction of affairs were placed under two distinct legislative bodies. The greater power was that of the Dominion. The full and complete exercise of that power was vested in the Parliament of the Dominion, but certain geographical distinctions were retained, and the provinces were allowed, under the machinery provided in the act, to legislate upon certain specified local subjects as a matter of convenience. Now, I cannot understand what the learned judge (Burton) means when he speaks of political rights which remained in, or belonged to the Province of Ontario. What rights could Ontario have had? There was no such political entity or corporation; there was no such province in a legal sense. It was a geographical expression. It is true you will find that our statutes from 1840 down, were applicable, some to Lower, and some to Upper Canada. The old distinction was kept up to limit the operation of certain statutes in consequence of local laws that had previously existed in the provinces. So far as the people of Lower Canada are concerned, I admit that from the peculiar circumstances under which the French inhabitants of Quebec were dealt with after what the English call the \u201cconquest,\u201d and they call the \u201ccession,\u201d certain privileges and rights were reserved or secured to them by a so-called treaty. But those rights were not secured to Quebec according to her present limitary lines. They were conceded to the French population who were scattered at that time over the whole northern part of this continent. The cession was not restricted to the Province of Quebec as bounded at present. These boundaries were established under English jurisdiction; the French never bounded their province on the north; therefore, when rights were reserved to the French inhabitants of this colony, they extended to the people, and not to any geographical or territorial circumscription or boundary. So, the pretence that there ever was any grant or reservation of particular rights to British immigrants who came to Canada since the cession, and are now living within territory formerly part of the Province of Quebec, is altogether unwarranted in the history or reason of the case.\nIs escheat a reversion? The doctrine that it is a reversion in the ordinary sense, seems to be relied on both by Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Patterson, and it is also stated in the reasons against appeal, by the learned gentlemen who prepared the case, that they rely upon that doctrine of reversion. I am not going to occupy the attention of your lordships with a discussion upon tenures, because it seems to me the feudal relation is not involved in the argument here. I did go into that question at some length before the Court of Appeal. I had carefully examined the authorities, because it was a matter of some historical as well as legal interest. The origin of feudal tenure, the mode in which property was transferred under that tenure, the relation of lord and tenant, the rights of tenants, and the successive changes made by parliament as to these rights; first, their right to sell; secondly, their right to devise by will, destroying thereby the right to escheat in the lord to a great extent; and, lastly, the right of the crown in the absence of a mesne lord: all these questions were and are very interesting as a historical study, but it seems to me they have very little weight in this discussion, because in Canada we have a tenure, the character, incidents and bearings of which are well understood even by laymen, from the frequent discussions and expositions in the courts\u2014I mean free and common socage. This was established in Upper Canada in 1791\u2014and we have to deal with this question in the light of doctrines applicable to the tenure of free and common socage. I contend, as a matter of plain, elementary law, that it is neither in accordance with modern decisions nor the reason of the thing, to say that when the crown grants waste lands in a colony to private persons, or authorizes a colonial legislature to grant them, the rights of the crown as ullimus h\u0153res, or, if you please, the reversionary right of the crown arising from escheats, is granted at the same time. That sovereign right is not granted; that is the \u201cseigniory\u201d which is always reserved. Let us suppose it to have been granted once in a particular case, and that a subsequent owner happen to die intestate and without heirs, what becomes of that seigniory? The crown having granted the reversion cannot resume it. It has ceased to exist. Therefore, the reversion here is not that kind of reversion which lies in grant. Lord Mansfield said, in the case of Burgess vs. Wheate[26], that it was a caducary succession, a \u201csort of reversion,\u201d that is to say, it reverted, it came back to the lord or king, but in contemplation of law it was not the reversion which is granted, or may be granted by the owner of a prior estate, if he uses language to show that he intends to grant the reversion. It is not a part of the inheritance, it is something which springs into existence by accident, and is no part of the original estate or fee, which is always vested in some person, and may descend successively through unending generations. Therefore, I contend that the judges of the lower courts treating it as a part of the inheritance known as a reversion, have entirely mistaken the fundamental principle on which the doctrine of reversion is based. In the colonies that now form part of the United States, as well as these provinces, and also in India, the crown has always been treated as the ultimate heir, to whom property descends or passes that is vested in no one else, and it is by virtue of that doctrine that this property fell to, and is now vested in her Majesty. It is not vested under any doctrine of reversion found in the old books with reference to feudal tenure. Perhaps it will be as well at this point to give your lordships the authority on which I rely, and which, in my judgment, is conclusive. See Cruise\u2019s Digest[27].\nThat expresses very clearly the doctrine with respect to title by escheat since the abolition of military tenures. In New Brunswick it was held, on the authority of the law officers of the crown, that the wild lands of that province belonged to the King, jure coron\u00e6, and were disposable by the representative of the crown, and not by the provincial legislature[28]. I hold that the waste lands in Canada are still crown lands in the same sense, and that only the revenue has been granted to the provinces, and only \u201cthe management and sale\u201d entrusted to their legislatures. The pretence that this land, which has come to the crown by the accident of escheat, was included or contemplated in the word \u201clands,\u201d as used in the 109th section, cannot be sustained as a matter of law, in my humble opinion, for a single moment. That it was not conveyed or transferred under the word \u201croyalties\u201d I hope I have succeeded in convincing your lordships. The learned judges of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench were misled by Brown\u2019s Law Dictionary. Their attention was not directed to the use of this word in the provincial statutes. Upon this point I would direct your lordships to an opinion expressed in another place by a distinguished lawyer and politician. I refer to the Premier of this Dominion, who was one of the framers of the B.N.A. Act. It will be found in the House of Commons debates for 1880, page 1185.\nThe opinion of a distinguished statesman, and one who has been conversant with legislation and political affairs in this country for a great many years; who was chairman of the convention which planned, elaborated, and finally succeeded, with the co-operation of the Imperial Government, in carrying through the Imperial Parliament the Confederation Act\u2014that is an opinion which I venture to say is entitled to great weight even in a court of law. My learned friend who, as Minister of Justice, acquiesced in the decision of the Quebec Court, will contend, I presume, that their interpretation of the word \u201croyalty\u201d is according to the intention of this act, or that because the word happens to be found there, your lordships may by a large construction make it cover the royal prerogative of escheats. I submit that even if the word is capable of that meaning it cannot be held to include the hereditary revenue from escheats. It refers to the rents or charges for mines in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. There were none reserved in Ontario and Quebec. Those who are familiar with the preliminary stages of the bill, are aware that the word \u201croyalties\u201d was inserted after the first draft, at the suggestion of gentlemen from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, lest these rents or sums payable to the crown under the name of \u201croyalties\u201d should be held not to be included; and thus the word was added. By the well known maxim noscitur a sociis, you are to interpret words of this kind by reference to those with which they are associated; and according to the doctrine also that the prerogative rights of the Crown, cannot be conveyed or granted unless by express words, you must be satisfied that it was undoubtedly the intention of the Imperial Parliament to grant them in this case. Unless that is clear, you must give a limited signification to the word \u201croyalty.\u201d The court in Quebec based their judgment principally on that word. The court in Ontario founded their judgment upon the doctrine of reversion, being of opinion, as we must assume, that it was the intention of the Imperial Parliament to convey to the provinces by the use of the word \u201cland\u201d this so-called reversion. That construction, I submit, is in direct conflict with the old, and heretofore, unquestioned doctrine with respect to the prerogative rights of the crown in England and in the colonies. In Theberge vs. Landry, the doctrine that her Majesty\u2019s prerogative in her colonies must not be infringed, must not, in any manner be affected by any Act of Parliament, except by precise words, is reaffirmed by the highest court in the empire. I contend that even her Majesty, without the express sanction of parliament, cannot grant away the hereditary revenues of the crown from her successor. In all the acts relating to that subject since parliament was established, there is evidence of extreme care when dealing with hereditary revenues of the crown, and prerogative rights of the crown, to preserve them intact for the successor; otherwise the crown would not be worth fighting for.\nNo subordinate power can touch the prerogative. If the Parliament of Great Britain should choose to turn the sovereign out and convert the country into a republic, as once happened, I suppose parliament could do it, but not without the consent of the sovereign. With that assent parliament is supreme. But, I apprehend, even my learned friends will agree that such an act must contain words which clearly evidence the intention of transferring her Majesty\u2019s prerogative to the legislatures of the provinces. My lords, there is nothing to evidence that intention here. It is only an inference at best, and that inference is contradicted by all the expressed objects of the act.\nSurely it is a trifling thing to allow the Queen\u2019s representative in this country, as a matter of authority, as a proof of the existence of that authority, to dispose of any properties which may, by the death of the existing owners, be escheated. It is a light burden, and my learned friends wish to deprive us, not only of the fact, but even of the sentiment, which is inspired by the existence of the fact, and to cut the last\u2014almost the last\u2014link which binds Canada to the Mother Country. I say it would be a most fatal result if it should turn out that the Imperial Parliament meant to extinguish the sentiment of loyalty, where it has hitherto inspired to noble deeds, by removing forever from the eyes of our youth this sign, this badge of the royal authority. Certainly it is not the expressed meaning of Parliament. I am satisfied it was not the intention. My lords, if such an intention had been avowed, that act would never have passed the Parliament of Canada, much less the Parliament. of the Empire. My learned friends must go that far. They must admit that the surrender is for all time; that this act is perpetual; that it has no limitation; that it is a complete and final transfer to the subject, of the power of asserting the prerogative rights of the crown in Canada. They must say that the crown of England is no longer entitled to claim any rights whatever in the casual or territorial revenues which previously did accrue and belong to that crown, in Canada. I deny that there is a word in the act to support that construction. I leave the case there. It is an important one. Its importance is not by any means to be measured by the amount of money involved, or the private interests directly concerned. it is a question whose decision will settle the relative powers and rights of these two legislative systems in this country. It is the first case, so far as I have observed in looking through the judgments of this high court, in which the question of prerogative jurisdiction has been squarely presented. Though I am here representing private parties only, I have felt it my duty to draw your lordship\u2019s attention\u2014perhaps to a greater extent than would be warranted in an ordinary case\u2014to the public interests involved in this case,\nMr. Blake, Q.C., for respondent:\nWhile entirely agreeing with the learned counsel on the other side that the importance of the case far outweighs the amount involved, I am unable to agree with them when they claim that upon the decision of this case rests the ultimate fate of the scheme of Confederation. I fail to perceive how the connection of this country with the empire could depend upon the question, whether the property of an inhabitant of Ontario or Canada who died without heirs was to be disposed of by the Dominion Government or by the Provincial Government. If the connection depended upon that, it is hardly worth retaining.\nI will first refer to the position of the provinces before the union. This right of escheat, which is improperly called a prerogative right, is an incident of tenure in socage\u2014a species of reversion. This right of escheat fell to the lord; and not to the crown, unless the crown happened to be also the lord of whom the land was held.\nThis view is confirmed by 2 Cruise\u2019s Digest[29].\nSee also in Attorney-General vs. Sands[30].\nIf a lord to whom the land reverted might be himself a subject, an escheat could not be called a prerogative right.\nThis was the old law.\nIn 1791, by the Imperial Act, 31 Geo. III., c. 31, the legislature of the province of Upper Canada was empowered to make laws for the \u201cpeace, welfare and good government\u201d of Upper Canada; but there was a limitation as to the general power of making laws in any manner relating to or affecting \u201chis Majesty\u2019s prerogative touching the granting of waste lands\u201d of the province, with regard to which no laws were to be made except with the sanction of the Imperial parliament. This limitation is to be found in section 42, and it is clear that if this proviso had not been inserted, the legislative body could have made a law affecting the prerogative of the king touching the granting of the waste lands of the province. By the 43rd section, the most pertinent to this question, all lands in Upper Canada were to be held in free and common socage, and legislative power was given to make \u201calterations with respect to the nature and consequences of such tenure of free and common socage.\u201d Now, though this tenure involved the right of the crown as ultimate heir, it is as clear as day that the legislature could have altered that tenure, and such legislation would necessarily have interfered with the crown\u2019s right in respect of escheat. Such legislation would, no doubt, have been subject to disallowance by the crown, but in this respect only were provincial rights curtailed. The provincial legislature could not, without the sanction of the Imperial parliament, have interfered with the prerogative with regard to \u201cwaste lands,\u201d but they could deal with the subject of escheat in regard to all other lands. The act of union, 1840, 3 & 4 Vic., c. 35, gave the same powers and had the same reservations, and re-enacted section 42 of Geo III., c. 31.\nBy the act of 1854, 17 & 18 Vic, c. 118, \u201cAn act to empower the legislature of Canada to alter the constitution of the legislative council for that province, and for other purposes,\u201d section 42 of the act of 1840, 3 & 4 Vic., c 35, was repealed; so that so far back as 1854 the only remaining prerogative of \u201cgranting waste lands\u201d was abolished, and full power was given to the provincial legislature to deal with this] prerogative of granting waste lands, and with it power over escheat as respects such lands.\nIf it is found that by the acts of 1791 and 1854 absolute legislative power was given to the local legislature to deal with this subject matter, we approach without difficulty the distribution of legislative powers under the B.N.A. Act. But before considering the B.N.A. Act it is necessary to refer to the act of 1852, 15 & 16 Vic., c. 39, relied on by the other side. That act was passed \u201cto remove doubts as to the lands and casual revenues of the crown in the colonies and foreign possessions of her Majesty,\u201d and allowed those revenues and lands to be lawfully appropriated for the benefit of the colonies in which they existed. By the first section of the act it was declared, that \u201cthe provisions of the said recited acts in relation to the hereditary casual revenues of the crown shall not extend or be deemed to have extended to the moneys arising from the sale or other disposition of the lands of the crown in any of her Majesty\u2019s colonies.\u201d The phrase \u201chereditary casual revenues of the crown\u201d is a general expression, used in connection with the words \u201csale or other disposition of the lands of the crown,\u201d and would include all lands, whether waste lands or lands falling to the crown by escheat.\nThen in a distinct phrase the act speaks of the moneys arising from the sale of the land. Here again is a clear legislative declaration that the subject-matter of the lands should hereafter be left under the exclusive control of the local power. And surely it was never intended, in the ever widening and deepening current of liberty of the colonies, that the management of these lands should continue to be under the control of the Imperial parliament.\nThen again escheat is not a revenue, but a casual profit. What is revenue is the fruits of the escheat. Nor were escheats ever looked upon as revenues in the sense argued, for a custom had grown up to hand over the property to the connections of the person who had died; and the complaint here is that the Local Government have dealt differently with the fund, and that the whole was not given to the natural son of the deceased. If that be so, how much force is there in the argument that this fund was considered as a fund for paying salaries of the judges, or that Canada must depend on these revenues to pay the civil list?\nIt is also contended that these sums fell into the consolidated revenue fund; but on the 1st July, 1867, that fund terminated, for, as the learned counsel for the appellant had to admit, the legislative power over all lands was by the B.N.A. Act vested in the local legis- lature,not conditionally but absolutely, just as legislative powers were given to Canada over other subject-matters, not for the life of the sovereign and five years after, but for ever.\nThe principal point, the proper construction of the B.N.A. Act, remains for consideration. There can be no doubt that the act should be construed with due consideration to the condition of the different parties who entered into the compact of confederation.\nHere when it is intended to grapple with the conjunction of four provinces and the establishment of separate legislative powers, and when it has been attempted to deal with all these subject-matters in a few printed pages, it would be a fatal error to stick to the letter of the act. It is the duty of this court to look around in order to get at the proper construction to be put on the different paragraphs of the act. The rule of general intent and the rule of public convenience are of vital consequence in dealing with this act.\nThere are some points which seem tolerably well admitted.\n1. We need to know what were the rights of the different provinces before the union, because it is necessary to apprehend where these rights have gone If it is found that a subject-matter was before confederation a proprietary right of the provinces, it must be found existing in one of the identities which were created. There was no intention to surrender what had been granted by England to the provinces before confederation, and all proprietary rights existing before confederation must after confederation exist in the government either of Canada or the provinces.\n2. It was the intention that each of the provinces should stand upon the same footing as to constitutional as well as proprietary rights, and what was done for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick was to be done for Quebec and Ontario. It is only because Ontario and Quebec had to be born, so to speak, that there are these different sets of powers. If that leading principle of construction is applied, all these sections can be made to harmonize in such a way as to give no more to Ontario and Quebec than to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Of course, it is not meant that provincial tenures were to be assimilated, but what is meant is that the power to deal with them was intended to be the same in each of the provinces.\nIf confederation is so regarded, the construction of the B.N.A. Act involves the question: What is the real nature of the union? One, section cannot be taken by itself, but all must be read together in order that, by a broad, liberal and quasi-political interpretation, the true meaning may be gathered. The preamble recites the desire for federal union, etc. Then there are some curious provisions. By the third section the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are to be one dominion under the name of Canada; and then they are divided into four provinces. Then the twelfth section provides that \u201call powers, authorities and functions which, under any act of the parliament of Great Britain, or of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or of the legislature of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, are at the union vested in or exercisable by the respective governors or lieutenant-governors of those provinces, with the advice, or with the advice and consent of the respective executive councils thereof, or in conjunction with those councils, or with any number of members thereof, or by those governors or lieutenant\u2011governors individually, shall, as far as the same continue in existence and capable of being exercised after the union in relation to the government of Canada, be vested in and exercisable by the Governor-General, with the advice, or with the advice and consent of, or in conjunction with, the Queen\u2019s Privy Council for Canada, or by the Governor-General individually, as the case requires, subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as exist under acts of the parliament of Great Britain or of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be abolished or altered by the parliament of Canada.\u201d The sixty-fifth section vests the same powers in the Lieutenant\u2011Governors of Ontario and Quebec, as far as the same are capable of being exercised after the union.\nIt is clear, then, that whatever might have been done by any governor fell to the Governor\u2011General of Canada if the subject-matter related to the Dominion of Canada, and fell to the lieutenant-governor if the subject-matter related to the province. There is nothing said of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, because the 64th section deals with them. The constitution of Nova Scotia and the constitution of New Brunswick were already created, and were simply continued. Sections 64 and 65 should be read together, for if Ontario and Quebec had been existing, section 65 would not have been inserted, and we would have found the lieutenant-governors having the right to exercise all the statutory powers they might have had. If the powers of the lieutenant-governors are interpreted by section 65 alone, see how narrow the words are. The constitution of the executive authority of each province is implied from the fact of its existence before the union. All the provinces are placed upon the same footing, and in Ontario and Quebec, as well as in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the power of dealing with all subjects which Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had prior to the union was continued, subject to the alterations made by the act. The consequence is that all the powers existing in the old provinces, except such as are taken away, are grafted upon the new-born provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nThen there is the distribution of the legislative bodies. It is quite true one is called a parliament and the other a legislature, but to both are given legislative powers. There is a general legislative power in the parliament of Canada, but the old province of Canada had larger powers than the parliament of Canada have now, because the power of the Dominion parliament is limited. In section 91 a general phrase is used excluding certain subject-matters: 1st, The public debt and property. The \u201cpublic debt\u201d is defined shortly afterwards. \u201cPropperty,\u201d also, is sufficiently defined in the act, for all that is given to Canada must be found in the act. Thus Indian lands, Sable Island and particular properties are the properties over which legislative authority is given to the parliament of Canada. True, it is provided that the particulars of 91 shall over-ride the particulars of section 92, but it is nowhere provided that if the two conflict the latter shall be superseded. This section has been wrongly interpreted, for it is not said matters enumerated in section 91 shall exclude matters enumerated in 92.\nThere is another mode of construing these sections; it is to interpret them as you would an ordinary grant. It is admitted that there is a general provision in favour of Canada and in all matters not granted to the province, and relating to the peace, order and good government of Canada, the power is there, yet it is not a power more paramount than the local power is over subject-matters granted to it. Within its range each has an exclusive power. Local authority is legislative in its character and exclusive within its bounds. Among the branches of subject\u2011matters granted to the provincial legislatures is the sale and management of public lands. It is said that this is a limited power, but it is to be remembered that we are dealing with a legislative power, and it does not seem that anything has been left out or excepted. The intention of the legislature clearly was to give the local authority most ample power.\nThen there is also the jurisdiction over \u201cproperty and civil rights,\u201d (which give their chief dignity to the functions of the local legislatures), and \u201call matters of a local or private nature.\u201d\nIn section 95 there is a concurrent power over emigration. This is the only subject-matter over which there is a concurrent power, and therefore it is the only case in which a law within the jurisdiction of the local legislature can be over-ridden by the parliament of Canada.\nNow, it is clear, looking at the whole act, that there are words large enough to shew what are the legislative powers of the provinces and of Canada respectively over lands. To Canada belongs property consisting of Indian lands, Sable Island, etc., and to the provinces all public lands and the timber and the wood thereon.\nTaking up the act in its order we come next to section 102, which declares that \u201call revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, before and at the union, had and have power of appropriation, except such portions thereof as are by this act reserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces, or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this act, shall form one consolidated revenue fund, to be appropriated for the public service of Canada in the manner and subject to the charges in this act provided.\u201d\nReliance is placed by the other side on this section 102, and it is said here is a revenue over which the local legislature had a right of appropriation, and not being reserved to them in the act, they have now no control over it. If this argument is correct, it would equally embrace the proceeds of sale of all the lands, for they are not reserved\u2014and can it be said they are to go to the consolidated revenue fund of Canada? Then, how can it be argued that the subject-matters shall belong to the local legislatures and the proceeds of the same belong to Canada? Surely it was not necessary when the subject-matter was appropriated to the province to add \u201cand the proceedst hereof, if disposed of by the local legislatures.\u201d Therefore, if it should be held that the land itself is under the control of the local legislature, the revenue derived therefrom cannot be said to come within section 102. If the argument is good, then the court will hold that all revenues of all lands belong to the consolidated revenue fund.\nSection 107 assigns particular assets. Section 108 gives Canada a proprietary interest in certain properties as well as in the public works. So that time and again, when dealing with lands under control of Canada. they are dealt with specifically. Now, section 108 is in itself enough. There the particular properties which go to Canada are found, and the court is asked to hold that property not then given to Canada remained with the province, for that is the irresistible inference, But the act does not leave the matter to rest on inference, for all lands, mines, minerals, royalties and other public property belonging to each province are, by the 109th and 117th sections of the B.N.A. Act, declared to continue to belong to such province, to be used and administered by the provincial authorities for the use and advantages of the provinces.\nTherefore, reading these different sections together, it is manifest that Canada got such property as was expressly given to her and the provinces kept what was not given to Canada. How will the provinces get a revenue from these lands, if not by sale, licenses, etc.? The power to deal with them is full, ample and com- plete, and the scope, sense and spirit of the confederation act is plain and obvious, viz.: That all lands situate within a province in respect of which her Majesty had any sort of right or interest continued to belong to the province, with the exception of certain lands given to Canada.\nIt would be absurd to suppose that authority over the whole question of granting and transferring property was given to the local legislatures, and yet one of the smallest and least significant matters incident to it, that of escheats, should be withheld. Can it be said such a little, thwarting, vexatious question, serving no high political interest, was not given to the provinces, and that they were not to decide whether there should be an escheat or not? If fit to deal with the land, then they are fit to deal with this matter.\nIt has already been said that this is not a prerogative right, for it belonged to the lord and had to be dealt with by the lord. If it is a prerogative, there are prerogatives of a higher class which have been handed over to the provincial legislatures and to which this right is but an incident.\nSuppose the land had been granted after 1867 and there is an escheat, to whom does it belong? Is it to Canada? The right to alter tenure, the power to legislate over the subject\u2011matter, belongs to the provinces, and yet it is contended escheat would belong to Canada. This is said to be a petitio principii; but if we find in the provinces before confederation power to deal with the subject and this power is continued, there is an end of the matter.\nThe question is not one of any personal prerogative, but it is simply whether the attorney\u2011general for Canada, who is responsible to parliament, shall advise as to the mode in which the escheat shall be applied, or whether the attorney-general for Ontario, who is responsible to the people of Ontario, shall advise as to what shall be done with the escheat. To hold the former view involves a clashing of functions and of jurisdiction, which is abhorrent to those who desire the welfare and peace of the confederation.\nThe question to be decided is: What executive authority shall control this subject-matter? Public convenience is in favour of escheated property being dealt with by the province and becoming the property of the province, and the proper way is to leave it to that authority which is responsible to the people who are interested in the proper administration of the lands of the province.\nMr. Bethune, QC., followed on behalf of respondent:\nThe first question is, What is escheat? In addition to the authorities cited by the other side I refer to Cruise\u2019s Digest[31], where it is thus defined by Lord Mansfield, in his judgment in Burgess v. Wheate, there cited: \u201cIt has been truly said that on the first introduction of the feudal law, this right was a strict reversion\u2014when the grant determined by failure of heirs, the land returned as it did on the expiration of any smaller interest. It was not a trust, but an extinction of a tenure; as Mr. Justice Wright said, it was the fee returned.\u201d The same learned judge further on, referring to the liberty of alienation, which was given to tenants, says: \u201cAs soon as the liberty of alienation was allowed without the lord\u2019s consent, this right became a caducary succession, and the lord took as ultimus h\u00e6res.\u201d\nIn Ontario and in the former province of Upper Canada, all lands were holden directly of the crown in free and common socage. It is quite clear that escheat applied to lands held in socage. At page 401 of the same volume of Cruise, it is said \u201cAll lands and tene- ments held in socage, whether of king or subject, are liable to escheat.\u201d\nThere seems no doubt upon all the old authorities that the right of the crown to escheat was strictly a species of reversion. My learned friends upon the other side have spoken of an estate in fee simple in land as if that were the land itself. An estate in fee simple is the largest estate which can be granted, but the lord, who in Canada is the crown, notwithstanding a grant in fee simple, still retains a reversion which is called an escheat. Once an escheat took place, it operated to extinguish the title of the grantee, the tenure of the grantee came to an end.\nAssuming that so far I am correct as to the nature and effect of an escheat, let me apply it to the matter in question; and first let me apply it to a case of escheat upon lands granted by Letters Patent of the province of Ontario since confederation. We assume that on the 1st day of July, 1867, the crown was possessed, for the province of Ontario and its use, of a lot of land which had passed to that province under section 109, of the B.N.A. Act, which is in the words following: \u201cAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties, shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\u201d Before confederation that land was vested in her Majesty; she held it for the use of the former province of Canada; after confederation she held it, but for the use of the province of Ontario. Nothing in the act had divested her Majesty of the title to these lands. The same B.N.A Act continued certain laws in force, under which her Majesty, through the instrumentality of the commissioner of crown lands, was enabled to make a grant of this land. The grant is made under the Great Seal of the Province of Ontario. We assume a grant in fee simple. After this grant there would remain in her Majesty her reversionary right in this estate. This reversionary right her Majesty would hold for the benefit of the province of Ontario. It could not be that, while the land before being granted was held by her Majesty for the use of the province of Ontario, yet upon or after the grant in fee simple the reversionary estate would be held by her Majesty for the use of the Dominion of Canada; nothing in the act would warrant an inference that that reversionary interest should thus be disposed of. That being so, it would appear that, in the event of the failure of the title of the grantee, in such a case as I have put, and in the event of his dying intestate, her Majesty in behalf of Ontario, would become entitled to the land, for the use of Ontario.\nThe next question that arises is, whether there is any difference between a case in which a grant has been made by the crown in the former province of Canada before confederation, and a grant made by Ontario since confederation, in reference to the right of Ontario to the escheat? I submit that there is nothing in the B.N.A. Act which indicates the slightest difference between these two cases. Under section 109, all lands, mines, minerals and royalties which belonged to Canada passed to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The term land would include, I apprehend, any interest in land which the crown might have had. The reversionary right, called escheat, is certainly an interest in land. It is only a question of degree between that kind of reversionary interest, and the reversionary interest which the crown possesses expectant upon the determination of a term for years. Where the crown had, as in many instances it had, made grants for terms of years, it might as well be argued that the reversion of the crown would not pass to the province of Ontario because it could not be said that that province had the land; it had only the reversionary interest in the land, expectant upon the determination of the term.\nAnother reason why I submit this escheat passes to the crown is, that it is a matter appertaining to the title. It is quite clear that under the terms \u201cproperty and civil rights,\u201d in section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, section 18, a provincial legislature might by an act abolish escheat as an incident of tenure; it might provide that the whole land should be granted, and that the crown should never under any circumstances assert title to the property which it had once granted; and such a law, if not disallowed, would be valid. It is argued on the other side, that under section 102 of the B.N.A. Act, this escheat passes as one of the \u201crevenues\u201d over which the legislature of Canada had power of appropriation before confederation. I submit, hovever, that the nature of the revenue must be taken into account in determining what is meant by the term \u201crevenue,\u201d in section 102. Before confederation the crown lands were sources of revenue; and it is quite clear that under that term, in section 102, the crown lands did not pass.\nTo remove any doubt upon this point, section 117, says:\u2014\u201cThe several provinces shall retain all their respective public property not otherwise disposed of in this act, subject to the right of Canada to assume any lands or public property required for fortifications or for the defence of the country.\u201d\nFrom the two sections 109 and 117, it seems reasonably clear that it ought to be presumed that this prop- erty belongs to the province, unless it comes clearly within that assigned to the Dominion.\nThe true solution of this question is, that there was a division of the assets between the Dominion and the provinces, and (having reference to the general terms employed) your lordships ought to hold that escheated property falls on the provincial side of the division. If you look at the power which was given to deal with \u201cproperty and civil rights,\u201d and to deal with lands, it is more in accordance with the spirit of the act to hold that escheats were intended to pass to the provinces than that they should remain with the Dominion. All the lands and interests in land which are reserved to the Dominion are described in section 108. When you look at the term \u201crevenues,\u201d as employed in that act, as descriptive of what should belong to the Dominion, none of the revenues intended seem to include revenues from lands (except those derived from public works.)\nThe other side argue that this is a prerogative right, and that none of the prerogatives of her Majesty belong to the provinces. I submit that the prerogatives of the crown, so far as necessary to carry out matters to be executed by the provincial authorities, have passed under the B.N. A Act to the province, and are to be executed by the lieutenant-governor as the propar representative of her Majesty.\nIt has been assumed by the other side that the executive authority of the Queen does not extend to provincial matters, but that a new kind of executive has been created, which is not part of the executive power of her Majesty, but is a statutory right which has been created and vested in the lieutenant-governor. This view, I submit, is erroneous. Turning to the 9th section of the B.N.A. Act you will find it declared that \u201cthe executive government of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.\u201d The argu- ment of the other side must narrow that section to mean over Canada as a body politic or as a subject of federal government; so that while the executive authority of the Queen qu\u00e2 Dominion matters extends over the whole of the Canadian territories, as to provincial matters it is not anywhere to be found in any of the provinces. It would certainly require very strong words to abolish the prerogative right of her Majesty as to any matter in respect of which it existed before confederation. I submit that the true construction is that the executive authority of the Queen continues, and was to be carried out, in every part of Canada after confederation, by the Governor-General in respect of Dominion matters and by the lieutenant\u2011governors as her representatives in provincial matters, precisely as such executive authority existed before confederation. I call attention to the words \u201cof and over Canada.\u201d The words \u201cof and over\u201d would be quite unnecessary if the section meant merely that the executive power of Canada, as the subject of Dominion government, should continue in the Queen; the words \u201cover Canada\u201d would have no meaning if they did not apply to Canada territorially, and thus include within Canada the provinces and their executive. I think that under the preceding sections this is reasonably plain. Looking at section 3, it is quite clear that one dominion was to be formed under the name of Canada; and by section 4, Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this act unless it is otherwise expressed or implied. By section 5, Canada is divided into four provinces; but that division into provinces is quite consistent with the continued existence of the prerogative over these provinces, to be executed in matters as to which the new provincial governments were to be agents.\nI suppose We may look to the headings which precede the various sections; and looking at these, it is quite clear that the words \u201cexecutive power,\u201d which precede section 9, are describing the same kind of thing which the words \u201cexecutive power\u201d that precede section 58 (as to lieutenant-governors) describe. When you come to provincial constitutions, beginning at section 58, you find these words: \u201cProvincial constitutions,\u201d \u201cExecutive power.\u201d Then you find by section 58, that there is to be an officer called a lieutenant-governor appointed by the Governor-General of Canada, by instrument under the great seal of Canada, and that lieutenant-governor is to hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General, subject to removal for cause. It is not said whose \u201cofficer\u201d he is. The appointment is made by the Governor-General under the great seal of Canada and, I assume, in her Majesty\u2019s name. This officer is to exercise the executive power necessary to carry out that part of the government committed to the province. It is, I submit, a part of the same executive power which, under section 9, is declared to continue and be vested in the Queen. None of the sections which deal with the executive of the provinces contains a line that shews it was intended to transfer, in provincial matters, that power which had formerly existed in her Majesty as a matter of prerogative, to the Governor-General. It cannot be argued that it was intended to transfer it to the Governor-General, for he has no duties in connection with the provinces, except the consideration of the question of allowance or disallowance of laws. The other side are driven to argue that this part of the prerogative has been extinguished. Why should that be assumed? All these prerogative rights existed for the benefit of government, and because they were thought necessary to such government. If necessary to the proper carrying on of government in the old provinces, why should it now be thought unnecessary?\nUnder section 65, all the statutory powers and func- tions which were formerly possessed by the lieutenant-governors of Upper and Lower Canada under Canadian or Imperial statutes, are declared to be exercisable by the lieutenant-governors of Ontario and Quebec. I submit that there can be no doubt that under the Upper Canada and Lower Canada constitutions, which preceded the union of 1840, the lieutenant-governors were the proper depositories of the \u201cprerogative,\u201d so far as it appertained to the Government of the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada; and these are still to be exercised after confederation by the lieutenant-governors of these two provinces, in the same way as they had been exercised by former lieutenant-governors.\nThen under section 64, the constitution of the executive authority in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick was to continue as it existed at the union, until altered by the authority of the B.N.A. Act. It cannot be doubted that before confederation the lieutenant-governors of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively possessed the right as representatives of her Majesty to execute the prerogatives necessary to colonial government. If this be so, then it would follow, under section 64, that these prerogative rights continued in these two lieutenant\u2011governors; and the whole scope of the B.N.A. Act shews that there was not intended to be any difference in the powers of the lieutenant-governors of the various provinces.\nThe reason why the B.N.A. Act is silent about the exercise of these prerogatives by the lieutenant governors is very obvious. It is quite clear that the Governor-General is under the act made the deputy of the Queen, and that the Governor-General is enabled to appoint a further deputy of the Queen for certain provincial purposes. That deputy is called a lieutenant\u2011governor. He is appointed by an instrument in the name of her Majesty, and, consistently with the law as to the execution of powers, it seems quite plain that if the Governor-General is an officer of her Majesty, his deputy is also an officer of her Majesty as to the prerogative of her Majesty in convoking the House of Assembly and in other matters. By section 82 it is said that the lieutenant-governors of Ontario and Quebec shall from time to time, in the Queen\u2019s name, by instrument under the great seal of the province, summon and call together the legislative assembly of the province. By section 72 the legislative council of Quebec is to be constituted of persons to be appointed by the lieutenant-governor, in the Queen\u2019s name, by instrument under the great seal of Quebec. By section 75, so often as a vacancy shall occur the lieutenant-governor, in the Queen\u2019s name, is to fill it.\nIt is said on the other side that section 82 found its way into the act by inadvertence. This assumption, I apprehend, cannot for a moment be entertained. Those who make it must also account for sections 72 and 75 having found their way into the act in the same way. But it is quite plain why these sections are there. By section 88, the constitution of the legislature of each of the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick was declared to be continued as it existed at the time of the union until altered; and the House of Assembly of New Brunswick was to continue undissolved. The reason why the House of Assembly and legislative councils of old Canada could not be continued was because of the division of Canada into the two provinces, Ontario and Quebec; and it became therefore necessary to provide for the creation of Houses of Assembly for these two provinces; but it is impossible for a moment to contend that the constitutions of the four provinces were intended te be in any respect different. If they were the same, it follows that the prerogatives proper for the execution of provincial government are to be exercised by the lieutenant-governors.\nTake another prerogative, namely, the prerogative of justice. It is quite clear that the administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts both of criminal and civil justice, is committed to the provinces. Courts of criminal as well as civil jurisdiction have been created in Ontario by the provincial legislature. Are not these courts her Majesty\u2019s courts? Does not the process of these courts run in the name of her Majesty? If the prerogative of justice is not to be invoked in aid of the provincial courts, what authority is there for the administration of justice in her Majesty\u2019s name? Was it not intended by the framers of this act that her Majesty\u2019s prerogative of justice should continue in the courts established by the provincial legislatures, just as if these courts had been established by the Imperial parliament?\nFor these reasons I submit that the judgment appealed against should be affirmed.\nHon. Mr. Loranger Q.C., followed on the same side, on behalf of the province of Quebec:\nThe right in question is a common law right which ought to be governed by local laws. This right is called by different names; sometimes it is called an escheat, sometimes a reversion, and sometimes a droit de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence, It is nothing else than a fiscal right engrafted upon the law of succession. Society being originally proprietor of all lands, they revert to society if the owner dies without heirs. The sovereign chosen by society holds the land in trust for the people, as a fidei commissum. The civil law theory of vacant property is this: If a man gave up property with the intention that some one should take, that person was entitled to it, while if he abandoned it for the sake and with the intention of abandoning it, then the first one who took possession would be entitled to retain it; but if the abandonment is without his will, then it goes to his heirs; and if he leaves no heirs, or they are unwilling to accept, then it goes to the people at large, and under the Roman law it went to the Roman Republic. That right was exercised by a public sale of the property.\nIn France as well as in England, and in fact throughout all feudal and monarchical Europe, the right of escheat or droit de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence never ceased to be looked upon as a right of descent, whether exercised by a king or a seigneur, and always formed part of the law of succession. Did the king exercise that right in his capacity of sovereign; in other words, as a royal prerogative? No; but as representing the people, and he had to demand it, and certain forms had to be followed. He took as successor: see Ferri\u00e8re, Coutume, Tit. VIII., sur Art. 187.\nIt was so well considered as an incident of the law of descent that it was legislated upon by the French Parliament. It is a maxim that they could curtail only the civil law, still we find them legislating upon this right. In Quebec it will go to the wife in default of heirs, or to the donor, if the property came from an ascendant.\nAt the time of the French revolution the feudal system was abolished, and with it the droit de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence. How was it dealt with since? The civil code was prepared, and Napoleon did not say it should go to the sovereign or chief magistrate, but by Arts. 768 and 767, he says it shall belong to the state, not as a prerogative right belonging to the head of the nation, but as coming from the law of descent.\nHow was this right to be exercised after Canada was ceded to England? Chitty on Prerogatives[32] distinctly says it must be settled by local laws. Then it was, and is, perfectly competent in this country for our local legislatures to deal with this subject-matter. There was the droit d\u2019aubaine, which formerly went to the king, but this has been done away with by legislation.\nI contend that if the Dominion Parliament have no legislative authority over the subject-matter, it must go to the provinces. It also falls under their control under the words \u201cproperty and civil rights.\u201d And I say, that as a maxim of international law the right of legislation over a subject belongs to the government under whose control the subject-matter happens to be.\nLex rei sit\u00e6 must prevail, even if the Confederation Act did not say so in so many words. And this principle, viz., that escheat should be regulated by the laws relating to property, is not peculiar to the law of Canada, for both Blackstone and Chitty treat this subject-matter under the heading of \u201cthe laws relating to the transmission of property.\u201d\nIf the local legislature has legislative powers over property, escheated property must belong to the local and not to the federal government. A great part of the argument on the other side was for the purpose of shewing that the crown had not parted with its prerogative, yet it must be admitted that the sovereign is no longer in the personal enjoyment of this right, and that it belongs now either to the federal government or the local government.\nI contend that it belongs to the local government, because it is a subject-matter over which the province has legislative powers, otherwise you would have to conclude that the federal government could own property within the provinces which the local legislatures by legislation could take away. It having been established that the right of escheat being governed by the law of property, namely, by the law of succession, must, of necessity, fall under the control of the provinces, vested, by the 13th paragraph of the 92nd section of the B.N.A. Act, with the power of legislation over \u201cproperty and civil rights,\u201d it follows that as a consequence all public property, which at the time of confederation belonged to these provinces and which became subject to provincial legislation, must equally belong to them.\nIf the Confederation Act had been silent upon this power, escheated property would have gone to the local government on the ground, as I contend, that a true interpretation of the federal compact is, that all powers not specially conferred by it have devolved upon the provinces.\nIn entering into the federal compact, the provinces did not resign any of their respective constitutions, powers, property and revenues to the federal authority in such a way as to vest it with them to their entire exclusion; in a word, they never intended to renounce, and in fact never did renounce, their distinct and separate existence as provinces, when becoming part of the confederation; this separate existence, their autonomy, constitution, revenues, property, rights, powers and prerogatives, they expressly preserved for all that concerns their internal government; and by forming themselves into a federal association under political and legislative aspects, they formed a central government for inter-provincial objects only. Far from the federal authority having created the provincial powers, it is from these provincial powers that has arisen the federal government to which the provinces ceded a portion of their rights, property and revenues.\nAt the time of confederation, all legislative and executive power, legal attributes, public property and revenues that are now the appanage of the central government and of the provinces, belonged incontestably to the latter. The federal compact did not create a single new power. The part now belonging to the federal government was taken from the provinces to be conferred upon this former power.\nThe powers, in particular, that are granted by section 91 to the Dominion parliament, had theretofore formed part of the powers of the provinces, in common with those mentioned in section 92, which remain within the jurisdiction of the provinces. These powers have been divided. Those conferred upon the federal parliament were given to it, and those left to the provincial legislatures they merely retained. Then, all that has not been vested in the federal government, remains with the provinces; and again, in the distribution of powers made by these two sections, whatever be their wording, the general rule is the provincial jurisdiction, and the exception the federal.\nThe same rule applies to the distribution of the property; all belonged to the provinces at the time of confederation, and the federal government has no share, except what has been given to it. There again, the general rule is in favour of the provinces, and the exception is in favour of the federal government.\nThe authority of the lieutenant-governors, within the limits of their jurisdiction, is on an equality with the authority of the Governor-General. Both are, within their respective spheres, representatives of the Queen, the former in the provincial, the latter in the federal sphere. It is true that the lieutenant-governor is appointed by the Governor-General, but it is in the name of the Queen that he is so appointed, and as her agent or representative. In his official acts, it is the Queen whom he represents and in her name that he acts. The relations between the provinces and the Imperial Government remain, after the union, what they were before. The Queen forms part of the legislature of each province, by the intermediary of the lieutenant-governor; it is in her name that the houses are called and prorogued and that the laws are assented to. The sole change, in this respect, consists in the disallowance and disapproval of provincial acts, which is made by the Governor-General, but this is not a legislative act.\nThe executive government resides in the person of the lieutenant-governor, as the first magistrate of the province, and here again he acts as the representative of the Sovereign.\nIt is the same with the concession of the revenue to the federal government as with legislative jurisdiction and public property; here again, the public treasury belonging to the provinces was divided to make a budget for the federal government, the remainder was left with the provinces.\nThe consequences to result from the solution of this conflict between the provincial and federal claims are of great importance to the provinces, and particularly to the province of Quebec. In fact, if the federal pretensions prevail, and the principle of the inferiority of the provinces and the subordination of their legislatures to the federal power is well founded, less than fifty years will see their absorption. in the central government; and, the annihilation of local governments having done away with the necessity of their existence, the federal government will give place to that legislative union which is so justly dreaded by the province of Quebec, whom I represent. Although having no material and direct interest in the suit, the consequences of an unfavourable result might so prejudicially affect its political condition th it thought it proper to join with the province of Ontario in asserting their common claim to the present right of escheat or droit de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence.\nTo thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the powers and limits of the jurisdiction of the federal parliament and of the local legislatures, a precise knowledge of their political situation at the time of confederation and of the powers of their legislatures, is necessary. Integral portions of the British Empire for upwards of a century, United Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, to which at first was limited the federal compact, each possessed, under the guarantee of England, whose power was felt rather in protecting than in coercing them, an independent and almost sovereign constitution.\nThis constitution, modelled on the British constitution, left them the absolute government of the internal affairs of the province, the control of their public funds, the enjoyment of their property, and the disposal of their revenues of all kinds; even the territorial revenues which had been exchanged for a civil list. Within the sphere of their powers, their legislatures or provincial parliaments, under the aegis of the principles of responsible government, worked freely; and their internal action was not under the control of any foreign power.\nThese provinces, each of which was clothed with the totality of the powers now possessed separately by the federal and local government, were therefore in the enjoyment of their complete political and legislative autonomy.\nThese constitutions, rights, and powers, and this autonomy, were guaranteed to them by treaties, and Imperial laws which, in the relations between the British Government and the colonies, have the force of treaties. The constitution of the united provinces of Upper and Lower Canada (to speak only of these two provinces) had been granted to them by the Union Act of 1840; and the constitutions which each had enjoyed for three-quarters of a century (with the suspension of a few years in the case of Lower Canada) had come to them by the Constitutional Act of 1791, not repealed by the Union Act of 1840, but simply modified to make it harmonize with the union of the provinces and the new system.\nIt is therefore to the Constitutional Act of 1791 that we must look for the origin of the powers of the legislatures of the provinces of Canada, which were in force at the time of confederation, modified as has just been stated. These powers, with the reserve of Imperial interests, were unlimited, and extended to every species of legislation, whether public or private, necessary for the good government and welfare of the country. Thus, as already stated, it extended to all the objects of legislation now divided between the federal parliament and the local legislatures.\nA right or a power is not taken away from a nation or an individual, except by a law which revokes it, or by a voluntary abandonment. Is there, in the resolutions of the conference of the colonial delegates, held in Quebec, in October, 1864, or in the federal act itself, one word which repeals their powers or explicitly derogates therefrom? Certainly not. Does any one of these resolutions, or any section of this law, or the whole of either, imply an implicit repeal of such rights? Article 29 of the resolutions says, with respect to the federal parliament: \u201cThe general parliament shall have power to make laws for the peace, welfare and good government of the federal provinces (saving the sovereignty of England) and specially laws respecting the following subjects.\u201d The B.N.A. Act, section 91, enacts: \u201cIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d\nSec. 92.\u2014\u201cIn each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects, next hereinafter enumerated.\u201d\nWere these powers of the provinces revoked by the federal compact which became the B.N.A. Act? On the contrary the old provinces preserved their corporate identity under confederation. A distinction must here be made between the former province of Canada and the other provinces, as those of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which entered into the federal compact under their old corporate names. Under the old constitutional act of 1791, Upper and Lower Canada each formed a province separately constituted, under the names of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Reunited by the union act of 1840, they formed only one province, under the name of the province of Canada. Under the B.N.A. Act of Union, they were again disunited and made into two separate provinces, called the provinces of Ontario and of Quebec; but did they again become in reality as each was under the act of 1791, although having different names? Has this difference in name and in territorial boundaries effected a difference in their identity, and can it be said that they have become new corporations? Have they not rather remained as they were, as well as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick? The maxim of law Nilfacit error nominis, cum de corpore constat, a maxim of universal application in all legal matters, and which declares that the name does not affect the thing, so long as its identity is apparent, seems to settle the question. The only difference in the result is, that, in place of entering the confederation under only one name and as a single member of the union, the two provinces entered it under two different names and as two members of the union. They are, moreover, each clothed with the same powers as before, and as the other confederated provinces, each having one and the same constitution. I do not see, either in the resolutions of the conference. or in the federal act, any provision which would give a pretext to the pretension that, in entering confederation, the provinces lost their former identity to acquire a new one.\nAny such inference is rejected by the preamble of the act, which states: \u201cWhereas the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one dominion under the crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom;\u201d and by section 3, which declares: \u201cIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of her Majesty\u2019s most honourable Privy Council, to declare by proclamation that, on and after a day therein appointed, not being more than six months after the passing of this act, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be one dominion under the name of Canada; and on and after that day those three provinces shall form and be one dominion under that name accordingly;\u201d and section 5, which enacts: \u201cCanada shall be divided into four provinces, named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,\u201d makes the contrary decision absolute.\nIt was the identical old provinces which united to form a new government and to constitute a federal dominion, without losing their identity; and without ceasing to be what they had been, distinct governments. It is not then from the Dominion that the provinces arose, but it was the provinces that created the Dominion and were transformed into a new political body, without ceasing to exist in their former condition.\nWere they endowed under the new system with their former constitution? Is the constitution given to them by the federal compact their old constitution, modified to suit the new order of things, or is it a new constitution?\nIt is necessary, first, to know what were the organic characteristics of the old constitution. Let us confine ourselves to the constitution of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and to that of the province of Canada, These constitutions were formed upon the model of the British constitution. The executive power resided in the person of the sovereign, represented by the Governor-General or a lieutenant-governor. The legislative power resided in a legislature sometimes known as the provincial parliament, composed of three branches; the governor or lieutenant-governor representing the sovereign, the legislative council, appointed by the governor, and a legislative assembly or house of assembly, elected by the people. The parliament was convened by the governor in the name of the sovereign, it was prorogued in the same manner, and the laws were assented to in the same name by the same officer. Let us see what are, on the same subjects, the provisions of the federal compact in the constitution of the provinces.\nThe learned counsel referred to secs. 58, 71, 82, 90, 55 of the B.N.A. Act.\nIt is objected to the analogy, which we find between the executive and legislative powers conferred upon lieutenant-governors and the provinces of the confederation, and the same powers conferred upon the former governors and lieutenant governors and the old provinces, that under the new system the sovereign does not exercise the executive power as under the old, through the governor who represents him, and by whom he was directly appointed; that under the new system the lieutenant-governor is appointed by the Governor\u2011General, of whom, and not of the sovereign, he is the representative. Secondly, that the sovereign is not a branch of the legislature of the provinces, because the lieutenant\u2011governor, clothed with secondary powers as just stated, does not represent the sovereign as the first branch of the legislative authority.\nThe answer to these objections is based upon the fundamental principles of the British Constitution, upon which depends the Imperial Sovereignty itself, and the constitutional existence of the colonies, which are: That the. executive power of the nation resides in the person of the sovereign, as the chief magistrate of the realm, and the legislative power in the parliament, composed of the sovereign himself, and the other two branches of the nation, the House of Lords and the Commons. That it is from the sovereign and the parliament thus composed that is derived the source, principle and end of all power, \u201cfons principiunt et finis omnis potestatis\u201d\nAccording to the constitutional doctrine, all legislative and executive power granted by England to her colonies is a delegated power, the legislative power being delegated by the parliament, of which the sovereign is the first branch, and the executive power by the sovereign alone, of whom the colonial governors are the representatives in the executive government as well as in the legislatures. The authority of the governors appointed by the sovereign is in no sense personal; it is in the name of the sovereign that they exercise it, in virtue of a commission, which might be assimilated to what is, in the civil law, an ordinary mandate. In political as in civil law, in the absence of any provision specially applicable to the subject, recourse must be had to the common law, to ascertain the relations between the government and the governed. This rule is admitted in England, where, for instance, the publicists hold that the hereditary right to the crown is governed by the law of ordinary successions. It was thus that on the death of Edward VI without children, the crown, like the large baronies, devolved, in default of other heirs male of the late king Henry VIII, to his two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, but the former excluded the latter, to avoid a plurality of sovereigns.\nApplied to the powers of lieutenant-governors, the rules of mandate, which, being drawn from the civil law, and founded upon natural reason, are common to all civilized nations and are the same in England as in Canada, clearly show how the federalists are in error, when they hold that the lieutenant-governors do not represent the sovereign. One of the fundamental principles in matters of mandate is that the persons commissioned by the mandatary, with the consent or by order of the mandator, to execute the mandate, are responsible to the mandator, and represent him for all the purposes of the mandate. Here, the Governor\u2011General, appointed by the sovereign under the Federal Act, appoints the lieutenant\u2011governors to fulfil certain functions created by the same act. Can it be doubted that the Governor-General having made the appointment in the name of the Queen, and made it for her, the lieutenant-governor is not his servant, but became, as the Governor-General himself, one of her Majesty\u2019s officer\u2019s, and that, in the performance of the duties conferred upon him, he represents the sovereign?\nWhat are his functions? The executive power resides in, his person, by section 58, as we have seen. He is assisted by an executive council (sec. 63), and he can exer- cise all powers and functions declared to be exercisable by the lieutenant-governors formerly.\nNow, by the Union Act of 1840, which in these respects was in force at the time of confederation and which confirmed the provisions of the Constitutional Act of 1791, the governor of the province of Canada convened the parliament in the name of her Majesty (sec. 4) as he still does under art. 81 of the Federal Union Act; prorogued it in the same name (sec. 30); in the name of her Majesty, gave assent to or refused to sanction bills (sec. 37); and, a very remarkable fact, by section 59, it was enacted that the exercise of the functions of governor should be subject to her Majesty\u2019s orders; a provision which is not repealed by the Confederation Act, but is still in force under section 65 of that act hereinbefore recited. If that law intended to subordinate the exercise of the functions of lieutenant-governor to the control of the Governor-General, as his officer, would it not have modified the provisions of section 59 of the Union Act of 1840 in order to apply it to the Governor-General, instead of simply keeping it in force and leaving the exercise of the functions of lieutenant-governor to be subject to the orders of her Majesty. It is equally to be noticed that the powers of the governor, created by the Constitutional Act of 1791, are not only not repealed, but, on the contrary, are re-enacted in the Union Act of 1840; and for further security, the latter law has a special provision that the powers conferred upon the governors by the old constitution are continued by the new.\nLet me, however, continue the enumeration of the powers of a lieutenant-governor under the federal constitution. He forms, as we have already seen, the first branch of the legislature (sec. 71). In Quebec he appoints by instrument under the great seal the legislative councillors, in the name of the Queen, and not in that of the Governor-General (a provision re-enacted from the preceding constitutions of 1791 and 1840. If a vacancy in the legislative council of Quebec should occur, by resignation or otherwise, the lieutenant-governor, in the name of her Majesty, fills the vacancy, by appointing a new legislative councillor (sec. 75). He appoints the speaker of the legislative council of Quebec (sec. 77). It is not here stated that it is in the name of her Majesty, but was not that omitted to avoid a pleonasm? He fixes the time for the elections and causes the writs to be issued (secs. 84 and 89). No appropriation of the public revenues or taxes can be made by the legislature, unless previously recommended by the lieutenant-governor (secs. 54 and 90.)\nAre not these functions of the lieutenant-governors royal functions, which the sovereign, as chief executive magistrate of the nation, as the first branch of parliament, exercises in England, and which none other than her representative can exercise in a colony? These functions are numerous, as we have just seen, but were they only to include two of the powers explicitly granted by the Federal Union Act, the appointment of legislative councillors in the name of the Queen (sec. 72), and the convening of the legislature in the same name (sec. 82), this double prerogative affords, beyond doubt, the proof that he is the mandatary of the sovereign. In fact, he acts directly in the name of the Queen in the exercise of these two powers, and not in that of the Governor-General: the choice of councillors no more rests with the Governor-General than that of any other provincial appointment, and to the Queen alone belongs the power of convening any legislature in her empire, from the Imperial Parliament to the legislative body of the humblest colony, since this convening is a prerogative of the executive, residing solely in the sovereign and in the colonies exercised through the governors. It is evident that, both from the legislative and executive point of view, the royal prerogatives\u2014which in England are not the personal appanage of the sovereign, but are the property of the people, and which the sovereign holds in trust to exercise them in the interests of the British nation\u2014are equally exercised in the provinces by the Queen, not more however to her personal profit than in the mother country, but for the people of the provinces, with respect to whom these prerogatives have not lost their character of a trust; and that not being able to exercise them herself she has delegated their exercise to the lieutenant-governors who are her mandataries.\nI now come to the objection that the legislatures are not called parliaments.\nWhat is a parliament? \u00c0 parliament is \u201ca meeting or assembly of persons for conference or deliberation.\u201d In its judicial sense the word has only the value given it by the custom of different countries, and it has no accepted determined meaning, to signify the powers belonging to one or more legislative assemblies.\nIn the old provinces which now form the Canadian confederation, the provincial legislatures were indifferently called parliaments or legislatures. It was held that they were mutatis mutandis clothed with the same power as the British parliament, and (until the Union Act of 1840, which conferred upon the legislative assembly the absolute right of electing the speaker) when the latter claimed from the governor or lieutenant-governor the confirmation of his election, he claimed the parliamentary privileges which are recognized in the English parliament.\nThe name of \u201cparliament\u201d was given to the legislatures of the old provinces in a host of official, parliamentary and legislative documents; even in acts of the British parliament itself. The word \u201cparliament,\u201d as a synonym of \u201clegislature,\u201d was so familiar under the old system, that the resolutions of the Quebec conference make use of both terms jointly to signify the legislative body of the confederation. \u201cThere shall be a general legislature or parliament for the federated provinces, composed of a legislative council and a house of commons,\u201d says the 6th of these resolutions. The 41st says: \u201cThe local government and legislature of each province shall be constructed in such manner as the existing legislature of each shall think fit.\u201d\nThe control which England, in theory, possesses over the colonies, exercised in legislating for them or in repealing their legislation, is an act of legislative power, that is to say, of parliament, whilst the veto or disallowance of the laws is an act of executive power, that is to say, of the soverign acting with the advice of his council; and it is the same with the disallowance by the Governor-General of provincial laws. This disallowance, which is only a prohibition from carrying into execution a colonial law, that might trench upon Imperial prerogatives or give rise to serious conflict between the rights of the empire and those of the colonies, has always been and still is considered in England, not as an act of legislation, but of executive authority.\nFor the same reason, of avoiding encroachment by local legislation upon imperial interests and federal legislation, and conflicts between both legislations, and to facilitate this double supervision, which is better exercised upon the spot than in England, the federal Union Act placed this right of veto in the hands of the Governor-General; but it is not as a branch of the parliament and as administering legislative authority that he exercises such right, but as representing the executive authority of the confederation; and in the exercise of this authority he acts upon the advice of his council, who are responsible for such, as for all other advice. Nothing in the federal union act rebuts the assertion that the confederated provinces are identically the old provinces, with the exception, however, of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, divided into two as they were before the union act of 1840, under the constitutional act of 1791.\nI will now shew that this Union Act itself, in ex press terms, establishes this proposition. The preamble states: \u201cWhereas the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one dominion, (section 3) it shall be lawful for the Queen\u2026to declare\u2026that\u2026the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, shall form and be one dominion under the name of Canada. (Section 5.) Canada shall be divided into four provinces, named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\u201d\nAnd the act continues thus to speak of the provinces, whose existence, as old provinces, it recognizes, without saying a word of the creation of new provinces. We have just seen that the legislatures are composed of the Queen, represented by the lieutenant-governor, and, for Quebec, of the legislative council and legislative assembly; that the executive power resides in the person of the lieutenant-governor, as representing the sovereign, and that the organization of powers is the old provincial organization, notwithstanding the dis. allowance of the bills of the legislature by the Governor-General and the appointment and removal of lieutenant-governors by that officer. This organization of powers would alone be sufficient to shew that the constitution of the provinces remained identically the same, but the constitutional act goes further and completes this proof, by declaring (section 88) that \u201cthe constitution of the legislature of each of the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall continue as it exists at the union.\u201d The Union Act further contains provisions respecting the constitution of Quebec and Ontario, only because of the dis-union and the inequality of the provincial representation of these provinces.\nThe third paragraph of the preamble of the union act, which states: \u201cIt is expedient, not only that the constitution of the legislative authority in the dominion be provided for, but also that the nature of the executive government therein be declared,\u201d and which does not extend this provision to the provinces corroborates this assertion. It was decided at the Quebec conference (Art 41) that: \u201cThe local government and legislature of each province shall be constructed in such manner as the existing legislature of each such province shall provide.\u201d\nI have stated that the powers of the provinces could not be taken from them, except by the constitution or by the abandonment made by them. It is one of the points of the doctrine hostile to local powers, that in entering into confederation, the provinces returned to the Imperial government all the rights theretofore possessed by them, as well as all their property, so that a new distribution thereof might be made between them and the federal government.\nThis doctrine is contrary to all the political events, which preceded, accompanied and followed confederation; it is altogether improbable and we must say is regugnant to common sense. Why should the province of Quebec, for example, have, abandoned its rights, the most sacred, guaranteed by treaties and preserved by secular contests, and sacrificed its language, its institutions and its laws, to enter into an insane union, which, contracted under these conditions, would have been the cause of its national and political annihilation? And why should the other provinces, any more than Quebec, have consented to lose their national existence and consummate this political suicide?\nThis principle, that the provinces retained their old powers when they entered confederation, and have, under confederation, continued to be governed by their former constitution, was judicially consecrated by the court of appeal in the Tanneries case. At least the majority of the court decided in that sense, and especially the opinions of Chief Justice Dorion and of Judge Sanborn.\nThe general government can have only those powers which are conferred upon it by the confederated provinces. This government is essentially the creation of those provinces, as an ordinary partnership is the work of the partners. In the absence of contrary provisions, the particular governments are managed by the organic rules which constituted them before forming the confederation, and preserve all the powers which belonged to them, if they do not delegate a part to the central government. In the case of the Canadian confederation, the provinces did not attribute to the federal government powers of a different nature from those that each before possessed. They delegated to it a portion only of their local powers to form a central power, that is to say, they allowed it the management of their affairs of a general character, but retained their own government for their local affairs. It was a concession of existing powers that was made to it and not a distribution of new powers. The powers of the central government came from the provinces, as those of an ordinary partnership come from the partners; to invert the order and state that the powers of the provinces come from the central government, would be to reverse the natural order of things, place the effect where the cause should be, and have the cause governed by the effect.\nI have said that if there is relative inferiority and superiority between the federal government and the provincial governments, such inferiority is to be found with the federal government, and the superiority with the governments of the provinces. But it is not necessary to make this comparison in order to establish their respective competence; let us rather say that there is equality between them, or rather a similarity of powers, and that each of the two powers is sovereign within its respective sphere. Blackstone says: \u201cby sovereign power is meant the making of laws, for wheresoever that power resides all others must conform to and be directed by it, whatever appearance the outward form and administration of the government may put on.\u201d According to this principle, whatever may be the respective importance of the powers conferred upon each of the governments in the exercise of their powers, each having an independent authority is equal in authority.\nIn the United States the central power is subordinate to the government of the states; it is from the states that congress draws its authority, and all powers not conferred by the constitution upon congress, belong to the states. Canadian federalists wish to lay down this principle of the constitution of the United States as special and exceptional, contrary to the principles of all other confederations and notably to that of the Canadian confederation. We maintain, on the contrary, that this superiority of the states over congress is a general principle, and is derived from the nature of confederations themselves; that the same principle prevails in the Helvetian and Germanic confederation, and in all other possible confederations; that it is of the essence of the federal system; that the central government has only those powers which are conferred on it by the states, and the latter retain the remainder, for the very simple reason that the central government is the creation of the several governments that have given it the form and the totality of powers which they deemed suitable, and no more.\nBut, once more, this does not give rise to relative authority, since each of the governments remains absolute master and independent of the other within its sphere of authority. It is legislative equality for the Canadian confederation.\nStarting from the preconceived idea that the provinces are subordinate to the federal parliament, an application of this principle has been sought in the distribution of powers, made by sections 91 and 92 of the Confederation Act, in the text of these articles.\nThe dominant idea of these two sections is to attribute the power of legislating upon matters of general interest to the parliament of Canada, and the power over matters of local interest to the provinces. It is only when two countries join together and submit to a general government, while preserving their local government, that the powers attributed to the central government become general, and those reserved to the individual governments remain local.\nOutside of this granting or concession, altogether arbitrary or conventional, there cannot be a general rule to establish the line of demarcation between these general and local powers. Thus in stating that all matters of a general character, not reserved for the provinces, belong to parliament, and those of a local nature, not assigned to parliament, should belong to the legislatures, the draft of the Confederation Act stated nothing, or only repeated that which had been declared in the distribution of the special subjects assigned to each of the legislatures by the remainder of article 29 and by article 43. As these articles, dealing with particular powers, might have omitted a large number, and as the working of the governments might be impeded by these omissions, the authors of the federal Union Act, who gave the finishing touch to the draft in England, felt that, to remedy this serious inconvenience, it was necessary to establish another line of demarcation and another rule of competence, by means of which they remedied this omission by having those omitted cases entered in one or the other category of powers; and, to attain this end, they amended the draft in the manner shown by sections 91 and 92.\nLet us consider the effect of these amendments. Section 91 of the federal Union Act states: that it shall be lawful for parliament to make laws in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned to the legislatures. These subjects being those specially enumerated in section 92, and followed by a distribution of all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province, it follows that this limitation of their local or private matters, was taken for the general line of demarcation between the powers, that their local or private matters, including those specially enumerated in section 92, remained within the competence of the local powers; and the rest of the powers necessary for the peace, order and good government of Canada, with those specially set forth in section 91, were attributed to the powers of parliament, and must have been considered as general powers.\nBut, as these latter powers specially assigned to parliament by section 91, were powers withdrawn from the provinces, and before confederation were local powers, to remove doubts upon the conventional nature of these powers declared to be general, section 91 adds: \u201cand for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section\u201d [that is to say, to prevent those omitted powers from being considered otherwise than as powers of the federal parliament] \u201cit is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this act) the exclusive authority pf the parlia- ment of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects,\u201d etc.\nThe rule of distribution of federal powers then is, that all which is not local and, as such, does not belong to the government of the provinces, belongs (including the powers enumerated in section 91, which will always be considered as general powers) to parliament.\nSections 91 and 92 might, perhaps, as well have been couched in the following terms: \u201cThe competence with respect to matters of a local or private nature, including the powers specially enumerated in section 92, which shall always be considered as local powers, shall belong to the legislatures, and the remainder of the legislative powers necessary for the peace, order and good government of Canada, including the special powers enumerated in section 91, shall be considered as general powers and shall belong to parliament.\u201d\nIt was also to avoid confusion and doubt as to the concession to parliament of competence in these matters, that section 91 added: \u201cAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature, comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d\nI cannot overlook the difficulties in interpretation occasioned by a phraseology so intricate and so confused, and in order to understand it better, we might again further alter the wording of these articles, which might be summed up as follows: \u201cWith the exception of the matters enumerated in section 92 and of all which are of a local or private nature, which shall be within the competence of the provinces, parliament shall have power to make laws necessary for the good government of Canada, upon all other matters, including those enumerated in section 91.\u201d\nIn taking this rule for a guide, let us see what would be the natural and logical process to practically establish the line of demarcation between the two powers.\nIf the 16th paragraph of section 92, granting to the provinces legislative power over matters of a local and private nature, had not been joined to the fifteen other paragraphs, a. rule of easy application would have presented itself. The competence of the provinces would be limited to particular matters or to a particular class of laws, the remainder would belong to the federal parliament, and it might, in that case, have been truly said, that all powers not delegated to the legislatures belong to parliament. The competence of the provinces would have been special, and that of parliament general. But it was not so, and the law has granted to the provinces power over all local matters, in addition to those specially enumerated in the paragraphs preceding paragraph 16. It follows that the concession to the provinces was general, for the aggregate of local and private laws constitutes a generality.\nI have stated that each of the provinces was clothed with all the powers conferred upon the two legislatures, the powers conferred upon parliament were withdrawn from the provinces. All the powers of the provinces, I also stated, were powers of a local order, that which remained retained its nature and that which was withdrawn to be attributed to parliament was only by a fiction called general, being in reality a particular competence. As a general rule, then, all powers belong to the provinces and the powers of parliament belong to it only as an exception; the powers of parliament come from the provinces, which are the source of all legislative authority in the confederation, and the legislative power of parliament is only a residue of the provincial legislative power. In this order of ideas, it should be said that all power which is not federal has remained provincial. To ascertain the nature of any power whatever, it is necessary, then, to examine all classes of local subjects, and it is only when this power does not enter into one of these classes and when it interests all the provinces, that this power is a federal power. If it interests only one or more of the provinces, without interesting all, it remains within the provincial sphere.\nAgain, the provincial competence constitutes the rule, the federal the exception.\nThis conclusion is in accordance with the spirit of legislation, and with the practical end which the authors of confederation had in view.\nAt the outset of confederation no person had any idea of forming a political association; it was rather a commercial league of the nature of the Hanseatic league or the German Zollverein, than a confederation of the nature of the Germanic or Helvetian confederation, which the provinces wished to form between themselves. This view results from historical documents and the debates in the provincial legislatures upon the subject of the resolutions of the conference. It was only gradually and later on that the basis of their association was enlarged and the circle of their common interests extended to form a general government.\nWhatever may have originally been the importance more or less great of their general relations, the idea that prevailed was to have the interests common to all the provinces managed by the general government and to leave the provinces in possession of their particular government for the internal management of their private interests.\nStarting from this idea, upon any given point, the object of any inquiry as to the competence of either power must be to ascertain whether the subject upon which legislation is sought affects only one or more of the provinces or all of them. If this object comes directly and specifically within the sphere of one of the two powers, as marked out by sections 91 and 92, there is no doubt that it must be attributed to the power which was specifically clothed with such competence. Thus, for example, if the object has anything to do with the postal service or the defence of the country, it would be federal; if with the civil law or the administration of justice, it would be provincial; but if it does not fall within the special attributes of any of these powers, that is to say, within any of the 29 paragraphs of section 91 and the 15 paragraphs of section 92 or what may be inferred from them, then under the general provisions of paragraph 16, it must first be ascertained whether it is local, and for this the subject matter of the two sections and the general spirit of legislation must be inquired into. If this subject affects only one or more provinces, as has been stated, it must be left to be disposed of by the legislatures; if it affects all the provinces, it is within the competence of parliament, and in doubtful cases, as that only which is federal belongs to parliament, and the rest should belong to the provinces which must have originally controlled and now control all which is not federal, such subject would be treated as local. In a word, in cases of doubt the doubt is decided in favour of the provinces, which are the source of all the powers.\nIt does not always happen, however, that legislation takes such a decisive character; there are hosts of subjects which affect both general interests and the particular interests of the provinces, and it is upon this frequent division of interests, that the federalists have based their argument in favour of the federal parliament. They say, in cases of doubt, only those matters that are purely local, and within the terms of paragraph 16 of section 92 are of provincial competence and the rest is federal. But this reasoning is evidently based upon false conceptions of legislative principles; for, in legislation all the powers are divisible in the same way as the subject upon which they are exercised. If a law, clearly federal, affects a local interest, this interest is withdrawn from the jurisdiction of parliament, however unimportant such interest may be, as compared to the general object of the law, and vice versa for the province. For instance, let us suppose a commercial law; if this law affects solely the interprovincial interests of commerce, it belongs to parliament, in the same manner as if it affected only the civil interests arising from commercial relations, it would belong to the provinces, but if it affected both the interprovincial interests and private relations, giving rise to civil interests between traders, it would belong, for its interprovincial portion, to parliament, and for its local portion to the provinces. To ignore this distinction and say, that in cases omitted, or in the cases provided for, only matters of a purely local nature are within the competence of the provinces, and that all mixed legislation belongs to parliament, is to set up a principle contrary to daily legislative experience, for there is not in legislation any subject purely general or purely local and private. This would be to invade the rights of the provinces. Paragraph 16, in qualifying as merely local the matters reserved to the provinces, made use of a word that was void of meaning and altogether inapplicable. The end of section 91 had first simply called these same subjects local and private; this corroborates the argument that the adverb merely which precedes them in paragraph 16 of section 92 has no value.\nI have spoken of subjects that might be within the competence of both powers, on account of their double nature, general and local, in connection with the omitted cases in sections 91 and 92. In addition, there exists, for some of the subjects enumerated in those sections, a concurrent jurisdiction growing out of the very attribution of power which gave rise to them.\nThus, paragraph 3 of section 91 gives as within federal jurisdiction \u201cany mode of taxation,\u201d and paragraph 2 of section 92, leaves to the provinces \u201cdirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\u201d Respecting direct taxation allowed to both powers, and in all cases in which their competence is manifest by the law, there is no necessity for interpretation and consequently no doubt, the benefit whereof should be accorded to the provinces against the federal power.\nSection 95 again gives to the provinces and to the parliament concurrent power to make laws in relation to agriculture and immigration, to the former in each province, and to the latter for all the provinces; but it is enacted that the law of the province shall, in case of repugnance to the federal law, yield to that law and have no effect. Here again it is evident that interpretation is not required, the superiority of the federal law being declared.\nLet us pass now to the powers of the provinces respecting public property.\nAccording to the organic principles of confederation, there is a connection between the legislative powers and the right of property. The provinces entered into the federal compact with the entirety of their public property, as they entered into it with the entirety of their political rights and legislative powers. All public property, which was not granted to the federal government, remained with the provinces. In addition to the property, which is disposed of between the federal government and the local government by the act itself, section 117 states, \u201cthe several provinces shall retain all their respective public property, not otherwise disposed of in this act,\u201d a provision that shews, that the provinces, in entering the union, had not abandoned their rights of property any more than they had abandoned their legislative powers; but that they had retained all that they had not resigned to the federal government. They also each have their separate budget, and section 126 enacts that the duties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada \u201chad before the union, power of appropriation, as are by this act reserved to the respective governments or legislatures of the provinces, and all duties and revenues raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred upon them by this act, shall in each province form one consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the public service of the province,\u201d and section 109 in addition to these provisions adds, \u201call lands, mines, minerals and royalties, belonging to the several provnces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise.\u201d\nIt is objected, that the provinces have not, as the federal power, a civil list, but this is an error. Out of the consolidated fund, established by section 126, a certain sum is set apart to defray the civil expenditure of the province, and if it is objected that the province has no civil list, as was done by a judge in the question of an escheat mooted between the federal attorney\u2011general and the attorney-general of Quebec, that the civil list is granted to the sovereign in England for her personal expenses and that ours does not contain a similar grant, inasmuch as the province does not defray the salary of the representative of royalty, we would answer that if we do not give a grant to the sovereign, we pay the officers of the civil government, and that it is from this application of the public funds that the civil list gets its name. Some French writers even think anomalous the English practice, which calls the civil list the grant to a sovereign who does not pay the civil expenses of his government, expenses that are paid by the state. As with finances so with respect to legislation and government, the provinces then are, with the exception of the cases provided for, and which we have enumerated above, independent of the federal government and in the sphere of their property, rights and powers, they are on an equality with it: If it were not that the Imperial sovereignty over-rides all our public organization we would say that they are sovereign in this sphere, as it is in its sphere.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is an action brought by the Attorney General for the province of Ontario to recover from the defendants the possession of a certain parcel or tract of land in the city of Toronto and county of York, in the province of Ontario, being part of the real estate of one Andrew Mercer, late of the said city of Toronto, issuer of marriage licenses, who died intestate, and without leaving any heirs or next of kin, on the thirteenth June, 1871, and whose real estate, it is alleged, escheated to the Crown for the benefit of the province of Ontario. The said Andrew Mercer, at the time of his death, was seized in fee simple in possession of the parcel of land in question.\nThe action was commenced in the Court of Chancery for Ontario by the filing of an information on the 28th day of September, A.D. 1878.\nThe defendant, Andrew F. Mercer, demurred to the said information for want of equity. On the 7th day of January, 1879, the Vice-Chancellor made an order overruling the said demurrer.\nFrom this decision the said defendant, Andrew F. Mercer, appealed to the Court of Appeal and the appeal was argued on the 23rd day of May, A.D. 1879; and on the 27th day of March, 1880, the said Court of Appeal affirmed the order overruling the demurrer and dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAgainst this last mentioned judgment and order of the Court of Appeal the defendant, Andrew F. Mercer, now appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada. The parties agree that the appeal shall be limited to the broad question as to whether the government of Canada or of the province is entitled to estates escheated to the Crown for want of heirs.\nWe have therefore nothing whatever to do with any other question than simply to determine to which government escheated estates belong.\nThe determination of this question depends upon the construction of the B.N.A. Act.\nBefore, however, referring to that Act, to enable us the better to understand its provisions and to arrive at a correct conclusion as to the intention of the Parliament of Great Britain in reference to this matter, it may be well to see what the state of the law was in regard to escheated estates, and how such estates were dealt with in the provinces at the time this Act passed.\nWith respect, then, to the law of escheat, the doctrine is unquestionably founded on the principles of the feudal system, and is not to be confounded with forfeitures of land to the Crown, from which it essentially differs. Mr. Chitty, in his prerogatives of the Crown[33], observing on this difference, says:\nFor forfeitures were used and inflicted as punishments by the old Saxon law without the least relation to the feudal system, and they differ in other material respects. And therefore, he says:\nEscheats revert * * * to the lord of the fee who is almost universally the king. In the cases of attainder of high treason, the superior law of forfeiture intervenes and renders the doctrine of escheat irrelevant, for by such attainder lands of inheritance, though holden of another lord, are forfeited to the Crown.\nAnd Chancellor Kent says of Title by forfeiture:\nThe English writers carefully distinguish between escheat to the Chief Lord of the fee and forfeiture to the Crown. The one was a consequence of the feudal connection, the other was anterior to it, and inflicted upon a principle of public policy.\nIt is clear that the law of escheat is an incident of tenure by which for failure of heirs the feud falls back into the lord\u2019s hand by a termination of the tenure, and therefore it is said that all lands and tenements held in socage, whether of the king or of a subject, are liable to the law of escheat, and no species of property which does not lie in tenure is subject to escheat, and so Mr. Chitty[34] says:\nHis Majesty\u2019s right of escheat stands on the same ground as every other legal right, it arises out of the seizen, and is, in general, governed by the same rules as govern escheats to the subject.\nAnd Chancellor Kent thus speaks of title by escheat[35]:\nThis title, in the English law, was one of the fruits and consequences of feudal tenure. When the blood of the last person seized became extinct and the title of the tenant in fee failed for want of heirs or by some other means, the land resulted back or reverted to the original grantor or lord of the fee, from whom it proceeded, or to his descendants or successors. All escheats under the English law are declared to be strictly feudal and to import the extinction of tenure.\nAnd so it is said:\nThe lord on the escheat takes the estate by a title paramount to the tenant since he is in of an estate out of which the tenant\u2019s interest was originally derived or carved, and it is said to be \u201ca mixed title being neither a pure purchase nor a pure descent, but in some measure compounded of both,\u201d and that it differs from a forfeiture in that the latter is for a crime personal to the offender of which the crown is entitled to take advantage by virtue of its prerogative; while an escheat results from the tenure only, \u201cand arises from an obstruction in the course of descent.\u201d It originated in feudalism and respects the intestate\u2019s succession.\nAnd Mr. Adams, says:\nEscheat is merely an incident of tenure arising out of the feudal system whereby the escheated estate on the death without heirs of the person last seized escheats to the lord as reverting to the original grantor, there being no longer a tenant to perform the services incidental to the tenure. It is therefore inapplicable to estates which do not lie in tenure.\nAnd this right of escheat is treated of as a reversion. In Cruise\u2019s Digest it is said:\nEscheat is a casual profit which happens to the lord by chance, and unlooked for; an escheat is therefore in fact a species of reversion, and is so called and treated by Bracton; and when a general liberty of alienation was allowed, without the consent of the lord, this right became a sort of caducary succession, the lord taking as ultimus h\u00e6res.\nAnd in Burgess v. Wheat[36], it is said:\nAn escheat was in its nature feudal, and in default of heirs the land, strictly speaking, revested, and the legal right of escheat with us arises from the law of enfeofment to the tenant and his heirs, and then it returned to the lord if the tenant died without heirs. * * *\nAnd again:\nIt reverts by operation of law on extinguishment of an estate that was a fee simple incapable of any further limitations. * * * The right comes as a reversion failing heirs.\nAnd in a note to Middleton v. Spencer[37], by Mr. Eden, he says:\nIn Burgess v. Wheat it was a question of tenure, the claim of the Crown having been admitted on all sides to be seignorial and not prerogatival.\nIf, then, this is a reversionary interest, we all know that reversion is defined by Lord Coke to be the returning of the land to the grantor or his heirs after the grant is determined. In another place Lord Coke describes a reversion to be:\u2014\nWhere the residue of the estate always continues in him who made the particular estate.\nThe idea of a reversion is founded on the principle that where a person has not parted with his whole estate and interest in a piece of land, all that which he has not given away remains in him, and the possession of it reverts or returns to him upon the determination of the preceding estate.\nHence Lord Coke says:\u2014\nThe law termeth a reversion to be expectant on the particular estate, because the donor or lessor, or their heirs, after every determination of any particular estate doth expect or look for to enjoy the lands or tenements again.\nAnd Chancellor Kent thus defines a reversion:\u2014\nA reversion is the return of land to the grantor and his heirs after the grant is over, or according to the formal definition in the New York Revised Statutes, it is the residue of an estate left in the grantor or his heirs, or in the heirs of a testator, commencing in possession on the determination of a particular estate granted or devised. It necessarily assumes that the original owner has not parted with his whole estate or interest in the land. * * * The usual incidents to the reversion under the English law are fealty and rent.\nIn Bunter v. Coke[38] before the passing of the statute making wills speak from the death of the party, it was held that \u201ca devise of lands is not good if the testator had nothing in them at the time of the making his will, for a man cannot give that which he has not, and the statute only empowers men having lands to devise them, so that if the devisor has not the lands, he is out of the statute\u201d; citing Co. Lit. 392. It was admitted \u201cthat, if one has a manor and devises it and after a tenancy escheat, that shall pass by the devise as being part of the manor.\u201d This being the doctrine and law of escheat, the Crown before confederation surrendered to the respective provinces the management, control, and disposal of the Crown estate, and the casual and territorial revenues of the Crown deriveable therefrom; in other words, the Crown surrendered its rights in the public domain and practically placed the provinces in the same position in reference thereto that the Crown itself held.\nOur attention has been called, by the learned counsel in his contention for the claims of the Dominion, to the law passed in the province of New Brunswick, as illustrative of what the Crown intended to part with in reference to all the provinces. This Act, as I stated on the argument, was prepared in England. It was transmitted by Lord Glenelg, the then Colonial Secretary, in a despatch dated 31st October, 1836, to the Lieut. Governor Sir A. Campbell, in which he says:\u2014\nSIR,\u2014In my despatch of the l0th September, I apprised you that 1 was engaged in correspondence with Messrs. Crane and Wilmot, [then delegates from the H. of As., of N.B.,] on the provisions of the Act for securing the Civil List which it is proposed to grant to His Majesty in New Brunswick.\nI now enclose for your information, a copy of that bill, which has been prepared in concurrence with the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty\u2019s treasury. It is compiled from the corresponding Acts of Parliament which apply to the grant of the Civil List in this country, with no other changes than such as unavoidably grow out of the different circumstances of the two cases.\nThis Act was subsequently made perpetual, and is to be found in the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, 1877, Title 3, ch. 5, and by which it is enacted that\u2014\nSection 1. The proceeds of all Her Majesty\u2019s hereditary, territorial and casual revenues, and of all sales and leases of Crown lands, woods, mines and royalties, now and hereafter to be collected, having been surrendered by the Crown, shall, with the exceptions hereinafter provided, be payable and paid to the provincial treasurer for the use of the province. Section 2. Provides for the payment to Her Majesty of the clear yearly sum of \u00a314,500 out of the above and other revenues of the province, with preference to all other charges or payments.\nSection 3. All monies paid to the treasurer under this chapter, except the said fourteen thousand five hundred pounds, shall form part of the general revenues, and be appropriated as such.\nSection 4. The Governor in Council may expend out of such revenues such sums of money necessary for the collection, &c., thereof.\nSection 5. The Governor shall within 14 days from the opening of every session of the legislature lay before the assembly a detailed account for the previous year of the income and expenditure relating to the said revenue, &c.\nSection 6. All grants, leases, &c., by this chapter declared to be under the control of the legislature, unless made upon sale or lease to the highest bidder at public auction after due notice in the Royal Gazette, and the consideration thereof made payable to Her Majesty.\nSection 7. Nothing in this chapter shall impair or affect any powers of control, management or direction, which have been or may be exercised by the crown, or by other lawful warrant, relative to any proceedings for the recovery of any such revenues, or to compensation made or to be made on account of any of the same, or to any emission, mitigation or pardon of any penalties, fines or forfeitures, incurred or to be incurred, or to any other lawful act, matter or thing which has been or may be done touching the said revenues, or to disable Her Majesty from making any grant or restitution of any estate, or of the produce thereof, to which Her Majesty hath or shall become entitled by escheat for want of heirs, or by reason of any forfeiture, or of the same having been purchased by or for the use of an alien, or to make any grant or distribution of any personal property devolved on the Crown for the want of next of kin or personal representatives of any deceased person; but such rights and powers shall continue to be exercised and enjoyed in as ample a manner as if this chapter had not been made, and as the same have or might have been heretofore enjoyed by the Crown; but the moneys arising from the full exercise and enjoyment of the rights and powers aforesaid, shall be a part of the joint revenues at the disposal of the General Assembly, subject to the restrictions hereinafter provided.\nSection 8. Nothing in this Act: shall annul or prejudice any sale, or purchase, so made before the 17th July, 1837, but the same shall remain good and valid.\nThis Act, cited with so much confidence by Mr. Mc- Dougall as supporting the claims of the Dominion, very clearly establishes that the lands and casual and territorial revenues surrendered to the province were to be sold by auction, and that escheated lands might be granted or the proceeds distributed by the Crown, that is by the executive government of the province representing the crown without the interference of the local legislature; and in the province of New Brunswick anterior to confederation (and I have been at a loss to discover that it was different in the other provinces) the exercise of that right, prerogative, or seignorial, as you may choose to call it, was exercised there up to and at the time of confederation by the provincial executive. I may cite the case of the estate of John E. Woolford, who died in 1866 and on whose estate for want of heirs administration was granted to a nominee of the crown, and which estate, real and personal, has been dealt with by the Governor in Council; and prior to 1866 I may mention the case of the estate of one Nichols, which was dealt with by order of the Governor in Council in New Brunswick; for as Mr. May, in his constitutional history of England[39], says, in reference to the concession of responsible government to the colonies:\u2014\nAt last she (England) gave freedom and found national sympathy and contentment. * * * Patronage has been surrendered, the disposal of public lands waived by the Crown, and political dominion virtually renounced. In short their dependence has become little more than nominal except for purposes of military defence.\nThis transfer and surrender, as is well known, was much opposed in New Brunswick by the then Lieut. Governor and his Council; and though the House of Assembly and Legislative Council passed the bill when first presented to it, the Lieut. Governor refused his assent, whereupon he was recalled, or resigned, and another Governor was sent with instructions to imme- diately call the Assembly together that the bill might be again submitted to the local legislature, which was done and the bill passed. Extracts from Lord Glenelg\u2019s despatch dated 6th April, 1837, will show how this Act was viewed by the Imperial authorities at the time.\nExtract from despatch dated 6th April, 1837, from Lord Glenelg to Major Gen. Sir John Harvey:\u2014\nFourthly. A further question of great importance having been noticed in Mr. Street\u2019s[40] letter of the 23rd March must not be passed over in silence. That gentleman suggests that it is not competent to the King, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Assembly of New Brunswick, to alienate the hereditary revenues of the Crown in such a manner as to bind His Majesty\u2019s royal successors. On this topic I limit myself to a general statement, declining as unnecessary, and therefore as unadvisable, the discussion of the wide constitutional principles involved in this inquiry. On careful reflection I am convinced that Mr. Street\u2019s opinion is not well founded. I do not think that the cession which during the last century it has been customary to make to Parliament of the hereditary revenue of the Crown for the life of the reigning sovereign only is to be understood as an affirmation of the maxim that the king, lords and commons of Great Britain and Ireland are incompetent to conclude a permanent settlement of the question. That the existing practice is founded on the highest grounds of expediency is indeed indisputable, but I do not perceive that the motives which so urgently forbid a permanent alienation of the hereditary revenues of the Crown in this kingdom apply to the case of a British province on the North American continent. That such a cession may be rendered valid by an Act of the General Assembly, assented to by His Majesty, and that the enactment of such a colonial law may under some circumstances be judicious and expedient might readily be shown from a reference to our colonial history. I allude especially to the case of the Island of Jamaica. The objection, if well founded, would of course apply to a settlement for ten years, as distinctly as if it should be made in perpetuity. Understanding that Messrs. Crane and Wilmot [delegates from the House of Assembly] and Mr. Street concur in thinking that it would be expedient that the civil list should be permanently settled, I have His Majesty\u2019s commands to acquaint you that, if. such should be the opinion of the House of Assembly, you are at liberty to assent to the Civil list Bill with that, alteration.\nThe whole history of this bill and the controversies in connection therewith will be found in the despatches, addresses and the proceedings in the journals of the local legislature of New Brunswick.\nBefore this surrender, though the title to the public domain was in the sovereign, and though the revenues derivable therefrom unquestionably formed a part of the territorial revenues of the Crown, there can, I think, be no doubt the practical constitutional principle acted on was, that these lands and the proceeds and revenues thereof, though beyond the control of the local legislature, were held and disposed of by the Crown for the benefit of the provinces in which they were situate; and all grants in connection therewith were issued by the Colonial executive in the name of the Crown, under the great seal of the provinces, and thus in New Brunswick at the time of the surrender there was, as will appear from the documents I have referred to, a surplus of \u00a3171,224 unexpended which was, also surrendered, and in this connection in the same despatch Lord Glenelg says:\u2014\nSixthly. Mr. Street has objected that any surplus funds which at the expiration of the term of ten years may remain in the public treasury, may at that period be claimed by the Assembly, although they would have placed at their disposal all the surplus which has been at present accumulated. I do not perceive the force of this objection. The existing accumulations are surrendered to the House cheerfully; not merely with contentment but with satisfaction. His Majesty can have no other interest in the matter, than that the funds should be expended, in whatever manner may best advance the welfare of the province; and on that, question His Majesty conceives that reliance may, with far greater safety be placed on the judgment of the representatives of the people than on any other advice. The cession of the existing fund is, therefore, not regarded by the king in the. light of a sacrifice, but rather in that of a direct advantage. If during the, next ten years (supposing the civil list limited to that, time) any new accumulation should take place, it will constitute a saving effected by the frugality of the House of Assembly, to the benefit of which they will have the clearest title.\nAnd to show how absolutely Crown rights were intended to be subjected to provincial control, we need only refer to Lord Glenelg\u2019s despatch of 29th April, 1837, in which he says \u201cthe cession is co-extensive with the powers of the Crown.\u201d\nAs this was the spirit and intention with respect to New Brunswick, it is not disputed that the Crown substantially dealt in a like liberal manner with the other provinces.\nThus we see, that at the time of the union the entire control, management, and disposition of the crown lands, and the proceeds of the provincial public domain and casual revenues, were confided to the executive administration of the provincial government as representing the Crown, and to the legislative action of the provincial legislatures, so that the crown lands, though standing in the name of the Queen, were with their accessories and incidents, to all intents and purposes the public property of the respective provinces in which they were situate, and therefore when property escheated it became re-invested in the Crown for the use and benefit of the province, and was treated and dealt with by the executive government and legislatures of the provinces as part of the public property of the province, and grantable by the Lieutenant Governor under the great seal of the province when the same should be disposed of by the provincial authorities in the interest of the province. Has then the B.N.A. Act altered this and deprived the provinces of the right to public property, which since confederation may escheat propter defectum sanguinis, and vested the same in the Dominion to form part of the consolidated fund of Canada? In considering the bearing of the B.N.A. Act on this question, it is, in my opinion, necessary to examine and compare several of the provisions of the Act with a considerable degree of critical minuteness.\nBy section 9: The executive government and authority of and over Canada is declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.\nBy section 12:\nAll powers, authorities and functions which under any act of the parliament of Great Britain, or of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or of the legislature of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, are at the union vested in or exercisable by the respective Governors or Lieutenant Governors of those provinces, with the advice, or with the advice and consent of the respective executive councils thereof, or in conjunction with those councils, or with any number of members thereof, or by those Governors or Lieutenant Governors individually, shall as far as the same continue in existence and capable of being exercised after the union in relation to the Government of Canada, be vested in and exercisable by the Governor General, with the advice, or with the advice and consent of, or in conjunction with, the Queen\u2019s Privy Council for Canada, or any members thereof, or by the Governor General individually, as the case requires, subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as exist under Acts of the parliament of Great Britain or of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be abolished or altered by the parliament of Canada.\nSection 63\u2014Provides for the appointment of executive officers for Ontario and Quebec, necessitated no doubt by reason of the union of Ontario and Quebec, severed by the British North America Act, rendering a section similar to that relating to the executive government of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick inapplicable, viz.: section 64, which provides that \u201cThe constitution of the executive authority in each of the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, continue as it exists at the union until altered under the authority of this Act,\u201d and this is again repeated in section 88. And for the same reason it was necessary to declare the powers to be exercised by Lieutenant Governors of Ontario and Quebec, which is done by section 65, which is as follows:\nAll powers, authorities and functions which under any Act of the parliament of Great Britain or of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or of the legislature of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, or Canada, were or are before or at the Union vested in or exercisable by the respective Governors or Lieutenant Governors of those provinces, with the advice or with the advice and consent of the respective executive councils thereof, or in conjunction with those councils or with any number of members thereof, or by those Governors or Lieutenant Governors individually, shall, as far as the same are capable of being exercised after the union in relation to the Government of Ontario and Quebec respectively, be vested in, and shall, or may be, exercised by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and Quebec respectively, with the advice, or with the advice and consent of or in conjunction with the respective executive councils or any members thereof, or by the Lieutenant Governor individually, as the case requires, subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as exist under Acts of the parliament of Great Britain or of the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), to be abolished or altered by the respective legislatures of Ontario and Quebec.\nAnd as to the provisions for the appointment of executive officers for Ontario and Quebec and declaring the powers and duties of such officers, and as to issuing proclamations before and after the union, we find by sec. 134 until the legislatures of Ontario and Quebec shall otherwise provide the Lieut Governor of Ontario and Quebec may each appoint under the great seal of the province the following officers to hold office during pleasure, inter alia: the Attorney General, and in the case of Quebec the Attorney and Solicitor General; and by section 135 it is provided that\u2014\nUntil the legislature of Ontario or Quebec otherwise provides, all rights, powers, duties, functions, responsibilities or authorities at the passing of this Act vested in or imposed on the Attorney General, Solicitor General [and other officers named] by any law, statute, or ordinance of Upper Canada, Lower Canada or Canada, and not repugnant to this Act, shall be vested in or imposed on any officer to be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor for the discharge of the same, or any of them.\nBy sec. 136:\nUntil altered by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, the great seals of Ontario and Quebec respectively shall be the same, or of the same design, as those used in the provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada respectively, before their union as the province of Canada.\nBy sec. 139:\nAny proclamation under the great seal of the province of Canada issued before the union to take effect at a time which is subsequent, to the union, whether relating to that province or to Upper Canada or to Lower Canada, and the several matters and things therein proclaimed, shall be and continue of like force and effect as if the union had not been made.\nAnd by sec. 140.:\nAny proclamation which is authorized by any act of the Legislature of the province of Canada to be issued under the great seal of the province of Canada, whether relating to that province or to Upper Canada or to Lowers Canada, and which is not issued before the union, may be issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario or of Quebec, as its subject-matter requires, under the great seal thereof; and from and after the issue of such proclamation, the same and the several matters and things therein proclaimed, shall be and continue of the like force and effect in Ontario or Quebec as if the union had not been made.\nAs the executive governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were continued these provisions were not necessary as to those provides, but these various enactments and the continuance of the executive governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick very clearly show that the provincial executive power and authority was to be precisely the same after as before confederation. That whatever executive powers could be exercised or administrative act done in relation to the (Government of the provinces respectively by the Lieutenant Governor of a province before confederation can be exercised or done by Lieutenant Governors since confederation, subject, of course, to the provisions of the Act, as is said, in reference to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and is expressed in reference to Ontario and Quebec \u201cas far as the same are capable of being exercised after the Union.\u201d That is to say, that the executive government of the provinces, as exercised by the Lieutenant Governors and Executive Councils, until altered by the respective legislatures, continue as before confederation, except so far as the executive powers of the Governor General over the Dominion of Canada may interfere.\nTherefore, when it is claimed that a Lieutenant Governor and Council are not competent to deal with a matter or do an executive administrative act that was within their competency before confederation, the burthen is cast on those putting forward such a claim to show clearly from the B.N.A. Act that by express language or by necessary implication the Local Governments have been denuded of that authority and the power has been placed in the executive authority of the Dominion. Special pains appear to me to have been taken to preserve the autonomy of the provinces, so far as it could be consistently with a federal union.\nTo say then that the Lieutenant Governors, because appointed by the Governor General, do not in any sense represent the Queen in the government of their provinces is, in my opinion, a fallacy; they represent the Queen as Lieutenant Governors did before confederation, in the performance of all executive or administrative acts now left to be performed by Lieutenant Governors in the provinces in the name of the Queen; and this is notably made apparent in section 82, which enacts that \u201cthe Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and Quebec shall from time to time, in the Queen\u2019s name, by instrument under the Great Seal of the province, summon and call together the Legislative Assembly of the province,\u201d\u2014and with reference to which matter, nothing is said in respect to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the reason for which is obvious, the executive authority at confederation continuing to exist, the Lieutenant Governors of those provinces were clothed with authority to represent the Queen, and in Her name call together the legislatures\u2014and also in the section retaining the use of the Great Seals, for the Great Seal is never attached to a document except to authenticate an act done in the Queen\u2019s name, such as proclamations summoning the legislatures, commissions appointing the high executive officers of the province, grants of the public lands, which grants are always issued in the name of the Queen, under the provincial Great Seals.\nThese being the direct enactments in the matter of the executive powers of the Dominion and the provinces respectively, it is well to look at the distribution of legislative powers; and as to all matters coming within the classes of subjects enumerated over which the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of Canada is declared to extend, there is not to be found one word expressing or implying the right to interfere with provincial executive authority or property or its incidents, whereas, in the enumeration of the matters coming within the classes of subjects in relation to which the provincial legislatures may exclusively make laws, we find No. 1. \u201cThe amendment from time to time, notwithstanding anything in this act, of the constitution of the province, except as regards the office of Lieutenant Governor,\u201d\u2014and from this, I think a fair inference may be drawn, that as the Lieutenant Governor under certain circumstances and in certain matters having reference to provincial administration represents the Crown, the provincial legislatures are not permitted to interfere with this office,\u2014No. 5. \u201cThe management and sale of public lands belonging to the province, and of the timber and wood thereon,\u2014No. 13. Property and civil rights in the province,\u201d and No. 16. \u201cGenerally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province.\u201d When we come to the clauses relating to \u201cRevenue, debts, assets, taxation,\u201d we find, sec. 102, creation of a Consolidated Revenue fund:\u2014\nAll duties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, before and at the union, had and have power of appropriation except such portions thereof as are by this act reserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this act, shall form one consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated to the public service of Canada in the manner and subject to the charges in this act provided.\nAnd as I understand the argument, the words \u201call duties and revenues\u201d in this section are mainly, if not entirely, relied on as vesting in the Dominion the right to escheated estates.\nIn reading section 102 one cannot, in view of the argument which has been so strongly pressed upon us, but be struck with the clear indication that the words \u201call duties and revenues\u201d are to be read in a limited sense and are not to apply to all revenues of every nature and description, because in the first place the words are confined to those \u201cover which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, before and at the time of the union had and have power of appropriation\u201d and are expressly restricted by the exception of \u201csuch portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces, or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this Act.\u201d This establishes, to my mind, in the most unequivocal manner, not only that the duties and revenues referred to were to be confined to those over which the legislatures had power of appro- priation, but that with equal clearness the parliament thereby recognized the existence of revenues other than those over which the legislature had the power of appropriation to which the words were not to apply, and also that of those revenues over which the provincial legislatures had power of appropriation there were reserved portions thereof to the respective legislatures of the provinces, and which by the express terms of the section are expressly excepted in like manner, as are those to be raised by the local legislature in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by the Act, and all doubt on this point is set at rest by the provision for the Provincial Consolidated Revenue Funds. In that section this excepted portion is thus dealt with:\nSection 126. Such portions of the duties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had before the union power of appropriation, as are by this Act reserved to the respective governments or legislatures of the provinces, and all duties and revenues raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred upon them by this Act, shall in each province form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to be appropriated for the public service of the province.\nHere we see that while by sec. 102 the duties and revenues are confined to those over which the respective local legislatures had power of appropriation subject to the exception therein contained, this section 126 recognizes as having been reserved, not only duties and revenues to the legislatures of the provinces, but expressly speaks of duties and revenues reserved to the respective governments as well as legislatures of the provinces; and especially in view of the very strongly urged argument by Mr. McDougall that the revenues should be at the disposal of the Dominion Executive to be granted by the representative of the Crown to those having moral claims on the intestate, (in this case his illegitimate son) the last words of section 102 would seem to show that the revenues therein referred to are not revenues that had been or were to be disposed of, because the language is \u201cshall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the public service of Canada in the manner and subject to the charges in this Act provided;\u201d and as to the appropriation of this Dominion Consolidated Fund, after, by sections 103, 104 and 105, charging the same with the costs, &c., of collection, &c., the interests of the provincial public debts, &c., the salary of the Governor General, the appropriation from time to time is, by section 106, thus provided for, \u201cSubject to the several payments by this Act charged on the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, the same shall be appropriated by the Parliament of Canada for the Public Service,\u201d thereby ignoring any right in the Executive to deal with this fund in the manner the Crown dealt with the hereditary revenues of the Crown, or in any manner other than through the instrumentality of parliament, and therefore the provision would work in a manner the exact opposite of that for which Mr. McDougall contends; for if escheated estates are held to continue to form part of the provincial Public Property and to be dealt with after confederation as it was before, as the provincial Executives before confederation granted such estates like all other Public Lands without the intervention of the legislatures, they would still be in a position to do so and so to deal with equitable and moral claims as section 3 of the New Brunswick Act contemplates the Crown as represented by the provincial executive should do; but if these estates pass under the words duties and revenues, and are to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada, they are withdrawn from executive control and must be appropriated, as it is enacted the Consolidated Fund of Canada shall be by the parliament of Canada, for the public service of Canada. In looking through the Act we look in vain for any provincial revenues granted to the Domi- nion but those from which the revenues intended to be reserved to the provinces are expressly exempted, and tho\u2019 there are no duties or revenues in express specific terms reserved to the legislatures of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, nor to the provinces individually, if we exempt the lumber dues in New Brunswick, as by this Act it is clearly expressed that there were revenues intended to be and that are reserved to the provinces, the irresistible inference is that there must be revenues which arise from or are incident to or growing out of the property reserved to the provinces. If we refer to the provisions with reference to the distribution of provincial property, we find that as to the Dominion, by section 107, \u201call stocks, cash, banker\u2019s balances and securities for money belonging to each province at the time of the Union, except as in this Act mentioned, shall be the property of Canada, and shall be taken in reduction of the amount of the respective debts of the provinces at the Union,\u201d and by section 108 \u201cThe Public works and property of each province enumerated in the third schedule to this Act shall be the property of Canada.\u201d\nTHE THIRD SCHEDULE.\nProvincial Public Works and Property to be the Property of Canada.\n1. Canals, with Lands and Water Power connected therewith. 2. Public Harbors.\n3. Lighthouses and Piers and Sable Island.\n4. Steamboats, Dredges and Public Vessels.\n5. Rivers and Lake Improvements.\n6. Railways and Railway Stocks, Mortgages and other debts due by Railway Companies.\n7. Military Roads.\n8. Custom Houses, Post Offices, and all other Public Buildings, except such as the Government of Canada appropriate for the use of the Provincial Legislatures and Governments.\n9. Property transferred by the Imperial Government and known as Ordnance Property.\n10. Armouries, Drill Sheds, Military Clothing and Munitions of War, and lands set apart for general public purposes. These are all the provisions to be found in reference to the vesting of provincial property in the Dominion. With respect to the provinces, section 117 provides that \u201cThe several provinces shall retain all their respective public property not otherwise disposed of in this Act, subject to the right of Canada to assume any lands or public property required for fortifications or for the defence of the country.\u201d Section 109 provides that:\nAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Province in the same.\nThe executive and legislative powers of the Dominion are large, and so of necessity should be, and while it behoves all courts in the Dominion to recognize and give full force and effect to all executive and legislative acts within the scope of such powers, it is at the same time equally the duty of all courts, especially this appellate tribunal, to recognize and preserve to the executive governments and local legislatures of the provinces their just rights, whether political or proprietary, and not to permit the provinces to be deprived of their local and territorial rights on the plea that Lieutenant-Governors in no sense represent the crown, and therefore all seignorial or prerogative rights, or rights enforceable as seignorial or prerogative rights, of necessity belong to the Dominion.\nWhile I do not think it can be for a moment contended that the Lieutenant-Governors under confederation represent the crown as the Lieutenant-Governors before confederation did, I think it must be conceded, that Lieutenant-Governors, since confederation, do represent the crown, though doubtless in a modified manner.\nIn my opinion it was not intended by the British North America Act to deprive the provinces of the executive and legislative control over the public property of the province, or the incidents of such property, or other matters of a purely local nature, except such as are specifically taken from them, and that within the scope of the executive and legislative powers confided to the Dominion and provinces respectively they are separate and independent, neither having any right to interfere with or intrude on those of the other; and while I find a clear expressed intention of parliament to continue to the provinces all proprietary and territorial rights in all \u201ctheir respective public properties\u201d not specifically disposed of by the act which belonged to them at confederation, and which the term \u201cpublic property,\u201d as used in the 117th section in connection with the other sections of the act to which I have referred, I think may be read as covering all proprietary rights and incidents of property of every nature and description, I can find no such clear indication of the intention of parliament to denude the provinces of those incidents in the nature of reversions pertaining to their proprietary rights in the public property, such as are escheats, and to transfer them to the Dominion government to be disposed of as part of the consolidated revenue of the Dominion by the parliament of the Dominion.\nI cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that it was intended that the lands and their accessories or incidents should be separated and the lands should belong to the provinces and the reversionary or accessory interest to the Dominion; that though the Crown has surrendered all its rights in the property and the revenues derivable therefrom to the provinces, when the land es- cheats for want of heirs, and the property reverts to the original grantor, it is not to revert to be held as it was at the time of the grant made for the benefit of the province, but for the benefit of the Dominion which never had any interest in the lands whatever; that while the provinces are to retain their public property and have the management and sale of the lands and of the timber and wood thereon, the public property and lands, reinvesting by reason of the want of heirs, should become the property of the Dominion, and so there should be, growing out of and resulting from the tenure of the public lands belonging to the provinces, public lands belonging to the Dominion and subject to its legislation.\nI do not think, from a most careful consideration of the British North America Act, that it could have been the intention of parliament that while the public properties, and the revenues and proceeds from the disposition thereof, should be retained by the province, and they so continue to retain the position occupied by the surrender to them of the Crown rights, that on escheat, the escheated lands should not revert to the province, but instead thereof should belong to the Dominion, and so the management, control and disposition of what are commonly called the Crown Lands or Public Domain in the provinces consequently be divided, by the withdrawal of the escheated lands from the control of the government and legislation of the provinces and vested in the parliament of the Dominion. I find no expressions in the British North America Act that the Dominion were to be proprietors by virtue of the Act of any Crown lands in the provinces or any legislative power granted them to deal with any such lands, excepting always the properties specially named, such as beacons, lighthouses and Sable Island, lands reserved for the Indians and public works and property specifically enumerated in the third schedule, together with such other provincial lands and public property as the Dominion may require and assume for fortifications or for the defence of the country.\nThe Crown having surrendered to the provinces the Crown lands and all casual and territorial revenues incident thereto, or growing thereout, the provinces, so far as the original ownership and beneficial interest in the lands and the incidents thereof is concerned, have by such surrender been placed in the position of the Crown, and therefore when lands granted cease to have any owner propter defectum sanguinis, or propter delictum tenentis, they revert to the Crown, the original grantor, but to be held as the property and for the benefit of the provinces.\nThis was so at confederation, the B.N.A. Act in no way changed the tenure by which these lands were held; on the contrary, it was enacted the several provinces should retain their public property, and as a necessary consequence their incidents and reversionary interest therein. If the Crown has then surrendered the land and its reversionary interest therein to the provinces, as no interest in the land has been vested in the Dominion, it is difficult to understand how they could have a reversion in such lands; in fact, it is a contradiction in terms to say that the lands never owned by the Dominion could revert to it by reason of a failure of heirs, or propter delictum tenentis, and surely nothing but the most unequivocal words could prevent the land from reverting to the original grantor to be held for the benefit of the province to whom the rights of the Crown, the original grantor, had been surrendered, in other words, to be placed in the same position and held by the Crown for the benefit of the province as if they never had been granted. When then the property reverts to the crown, I can discover nothing in this to change the purposes for which, under the surrender by the Crown to the provinces, it was to be held by the Crown as represented by the Lieutenant Governor and the executive of the provinces respectively.\nI think the terms \u201call duties and revenues\u201d in the 102 section, under which it is claimed these escheated estates pass to the Dominion, refer to the ordinary duties and revenues such as customs, impost and excise, and the like, which were at the sole disposal of and subject to direct appropriation by the legislature, and not lands, which, by accident, fall to the lord, or those representing the lord, as is said by Coke[41], \u201cthe word \u2018escheat\u2019 id est cadere, excidere or accidere properly signifieth,\u201d in other words, not casual, accidental or extraordinary revenues which come in the shape of land, and which lands are managed and granted and disposed of by the executive without the intervention of the legislature, and under certain circumstances without even the proceeds being subject to legislative action, as in the case of lands donated to those who may by reason of connection with the deceased or other reasons have a special claim on the clemency and favor of the Crown represented by the provincial executive.\nVery strong observations were made as to the manner in which the government of Ontario had dealt with a portion of this estate and would probably deal with that in controversy, if it was now decided that the disposition of the estate belonged to the provincial government. With considerations of this kind, we have clearly nothing to do. Though very pointedly and earnestly put forward by Mr. McDougall in his very able and ingenious address that those connected with the estate and who had therefore a moral or equitable claim to consideration would be seriously aggrieved and injured by holding that the disposition of an escheated estate belonged to the provincial and not to the Dominion authorities, this proposition has not commended itself to my mind in the way it appears to have so forcibly impressed Mr. McDougall, because I can see no reason whatever why in a case such as this, the provincial executive should be guided or should act on any different principle whatever in regard to the disposal of escheated estates from those that would govern the Dominion executive; on the contrary, it seems to me that precisely the same principles and considerations that should influence and govern the one should guide and determine the action of the other; and it must be borne in mind that there may be many escheats where no circumstances exist calling for any special action, and therefore in the older books we find it stated \u201cthat it is the ordinary course for the Crown upon petition to give a lease or grant to the party discovering an escheat with a view to encourage discovery\u201d[42].\nFor these reasons I think the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeal of Ontario is correct, and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIE, J.:\u2014\nLa question soulev\u00e9e en cette cause est de savoir lequel du gouvernement d\u2019Ontario ou du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a droit sous la constitution actuelle de profiter des biens tombant en d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence.\nTout le monde est d\u2019accord pour reconna\u00eetre que la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence est une pr\u00e9rogative royale qui ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e que par la Reine elle-m\u00eame, ou par ceux auxquels elle a sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 ses pouvoirs \u00e0 cet effet.\nQuelle que soit l\u2019origine et la nature de la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence, il faut admettre que dans la province d\u2019Ontario o\u00f9 le syst\u00e8me f\u00e9odal n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9, elle est moins un inci- dent de la tenure des terres qu\u2019une pr\u00e9rogative fiscale accord\u00e9e au souverain, par la constitution anglaise, comme source de revenus.

Stats. N.B. Tit. 3, ch. 5, dont les dispositions sont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s celles de la Ire Guil. 4, ch. 25. Des dispositions du m\u00eame genre furent ensuite introduites dans l\u2019acte d\u2019union du Haut et du Bas Canada en 1840. Elles furent plus tard modifi\u00e9es par des statuts subs\u00e9quents cit\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail dans l\u2019argument du savant conseil de l\u2019appelant. Il r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration que les revenus provenant de la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence appartenaient, lors de la passation de l\u2019acte de l\u2019A B.N., au Canada Uni. Cette proposition admise de toute part, m\u00eame par le savant conseil de l\u2019appelant, il ne reste donc plus qu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019assurer si l\u2019acte de l\u2019A.B.N. n\u2019en a pas dispos\u00e9, comme des autres revenus des provinces, en faveur du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nPour moi la solution de la question qui nous occupe se trouve enti\u00e8rement dans la sec. 102, ainsi con\u00e7ue:\nTous les droits et revenus que les l\u00e9gislatures respectives du Canada, de la Nouvelle\u2011Ecosse et du Nouveau-Brunswick, avant et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019union, avaient le pouvoir d\u2019approprier, sauf ceux donn\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9sent acte aux l\u00e9gislatures respectives des provinces, ou qui seront per\u00e7us par elles conform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux qui leur sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sent acte, formeront un fonds consolid\u00e9 de revenu pour \u00eatre appropri\u00e9e au service public du Canada, de la mani\u00e8re et soumis aux charges pr\u00e9vues par le pr\u00e9sent acte.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s cette section, tous les droits et revenus des l\u00e9gislatures doivent former le fonds consolid\u00e9 de revenu du Canada, sauf les deux exceptions y mentionn\u00e9es.\nLes biens provenant de la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence forment \u00e0 n\u2019en pas douter une source de revenus publics depuis que la Couronne en a fait l\u2019ali\u00e9nation en vertu des lois concernant la liste civile; ce revenu doit \u00eatre compris dans la cession qui est faite en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de tous les droits et revenus des provinces, \u00e0 la Puissance. Il n\u2019y a \u00e0 cette disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que l\u2019exception en faveur des provinces, des revenus qui leur sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s par l\u2019acte constitutionnel et qu\u2019elles peuvent percevoir en vertu des pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux qui leur sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s. La section 126 qui cr\u00e9e le fond consolid\u00e9 des provinces d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il sera compos\u00e9 des droits et revenus qu\u2019elles avaient, avant l\u2019Union, le pouvoir d\u2019approprier, et qui sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux gouvernements ou l\u00e9gislatures. Ces deux sections s\u2019accordent \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que tous les revenus des provinces, except\u00e9 ceux qui leur sont sp\u00e9cialement r\u00e9serv\u00e9s par l\u2019acte constitutionnel, appartiendront au fond consolid\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Pour main- tenir que le revenu provenant de la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence appartient aux provinces, il faudrait donc trouver dans l\u2019acte constitutionnel une r\u00e9serve \u00e0 cet effet. Il n\u2019y en a certainement pas. Les sources de revenus des provinces sont indiqu\u00e9es dans les sous-sections 2, 3 et 9 de la section 92, et dans la section 118, accordant une subvention \u00e0 chaque province,\u2014mais aucune de ces sections ne contient de r\u00e9serve sp\u00e9ciale qui soit susceptible de comprendre le revenu provenant de la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence. La seule r\u00e9serve sp\u00e9ciale que l\u2019on trouve est celle contenue dans la section 124, conservant au Nouveau-Brunswick son privil\u00e8ge de pr\u00e9lever sur les bois de construction les droits \u00e9tablis par une de ses lois pass\u00e9es avant l\u2019Union. Cette exception n\u2019a pas d\u2019autre effet que celui de confirmer le principe gen\u00e9ral de la section 102.\nPour appuyer sa r\u00e9clamation au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque encore un autre moyen tir\u00e9 de certaines dispositions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord. Il pr\u00e9tend que les sec. 109 et 116 ont op\u00e9r\u00e9 en faveur des provinces un transport l\u00e9gislatif de cette pr\u00e9rogative.\nPar la sec. 109 \u201ctoutes les terres, mines, min\u00e9raux et r\u00e9serves royales (royalties) appartenant aux diff\u00e9rentes provinces du Canada, etc., lors de l\u2019Union, et toutes les sommes d\u2019argent alors dues ou payables pour ces terres, mines, min\u00e9raux, et r\u00e9serves royales (royalties), appartiendront aux diff\u00e9rentes provinces d\u2019Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, la Nouvelle-Ecosse et le Nouveau-Brunswick, dans lesquels ils sont sis et situ\u00e9s, ou exigibles, restant toujours soumis aux charges dont ils sont grev\u00e9s, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 tous int\u00e9r\u00eats autres que ceux que peut y avoir la province.\u201d\nPar la d\u00e9claration, contenue dans cette section, que toutes les terres et r\u00e9serves royales appartenant aux diff\u00e9rentes provinces lors de l\u2019Union continueront de leur appartenir, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 en conclut que le. domaine direct de la Couronne sur toutes les terres publiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 aux provinces, et qu\u2019une des cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9sultant de ce transport c\u2019est que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s tombant en d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence doivent faire retour aux provinces. Mais le transport n\u2019est pas aussi g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et aussi absolu que le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019Intim\u00e9. Il est restreint et qualifi\u00e9 par les expressions \u201cterres, etc., appartenant, etc, lors de l\u2019Union.\u201d Ces termes ne comportent \u00e9videmment qu\u2019une confirmation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e des terres publiques, telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait alors\u2014le pouvoir des provinces sur ces terres n\u2019est nullement augment\u00e9\u2014aucun pouvoir nouveau n\u2019est ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019elles avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0-aucune pr\u00e9rogative nouvelle ne leur est conc\u00e9d\u00e9e. 11 est rest\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait auparavant, ainsi que le comporte la sous-sec. 5 de la sec. 92, restreint \u00e0 l\u2019administration et \u00e0 la vente des terres publiques appartenant \u00e0 la province, et des bois et for\u00eats qui s\u2019y trouvent.\nLeur pouvoir sur les terres est donc actuellement ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration et rien de plus. Pour savoir quel est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent ce pouvoir, il faut n\u00e9cessairement se reporter \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation ant\u00e9rieure, tant imp\u00e9riale que provinciale, sur ce sujet. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen que j\u2019ai fait de cette l\u00e9gislation, dont l\u2019honorable juge Gwynne a fait un expos\u00e9 si complet qu\u2019il serait inutile de revenir sur ce sujet, je suis forc\u00e9 d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que le pouvoir des provinces sur les terres publiques n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9 par la sec. 109. Il est comme avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration un pouvoir d\u2019administration, la Couronne ne s\u2019\u00e9tant jamais d\u00e9parti par aucun acte imp\u00e9rial ou provincial en faveur de qui que ce soit, du domaine direct lui appartenant dans les terres publiques. Dans ce cas, c\u2019est \u00e0 la Reine comme ayant encore le domaine directe des terres que les biens tombant en d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence devraient faire retour, si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re cette facult\u00e9 plus comme un incident de la tenure des terres que comme une pr\u00e9rogative du souverain.\nMais la province d\u2019Ontario n\u2019ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 sou- mise nu r\u00e9gime f\u00e9odal, ce n\u2019est pas au souverain, comme seigneur (Lord of the Manor), mais \u00e0 titre de souverainet\u00e9 que le droit de retour doit lui appartenir, en vertu du principe qui le fait pr\u00e9sumer comme le dit Blackstone, propri\u00e9taire de toutes les terres du royaume. C\u2019est sans doute pour cette raison que sous la constitution actuelle, les concessions de terres publiques se font encore au nom de la Reine. Dans tous les cas l\u2019argument de reversion fond\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me f\u00e9odal, s\u2019il \u00e9tait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la province d\u2019Ontario, ne pourrait affecter que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res. Que deviennent dans ce cas les biens mobiliers de la succession; \u00e0 qui feront-ils retour? La pr\u00e9rogative va-t-elle se diviser suivant la nature des biens,\u2014les immeubles appartiendront-ils aux provinces et les biens mobiliers \u00e0 la Puissance? Cette question suffit pour faire voir le vice de l\u2019argument uniquement fond\u00e9 sur le droit de retour comme incident de l\u00e0 tenure f\u00e9odale. Il est plus logique de reconna\u00eetre que c\u2019est en vertu de la pr\u00e9rogative royale que le souverain a droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de toute esp\u00e8ce de biens tombant en d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence.\nAu surplus, lors m\u00eame que le transport des terres serait absolu, je ne comprends gu\u00e8re comment il pourrait par lui-m\u00eame comporter une ali\u00e9nation d\u2019une pr\u00e9rogative attach\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne du souverain. Il est de principe que toute l\u00e9gislation affectant les pr\u00e9rogatives royales doit \u00eatre formelle et expresse, ou r\u00e9sulter du moins des dispositions qui impliquent n\u00e9cessairement que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu les modifier. Ce principe, si souvent proclam\u00e9 par les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux en Angleterre a \u00e9t\u00e9 encore assez r\u00e9cemment r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Landry v. Th\u00e9berge.\nIl n\u2019y a certainement dans la clause 109 aucune expression concernant la pr\u00e9rogative, et ses dispositions ne sont pas non plus de nature \u00e0 faire n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9e. L\u2019argument fond\u00e9 sur les expressions \u201cr\u00e9serves royales\u201d dans la m\u00eame sec. 109 (royalties) que l\u2019on a fait valoir dans la cause de Church vs. Blake[44] semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 par le savant conseil de l\u2019Intim\u00e9. En effet, le terme royalties n\u2019est pas employ\u00e9 l\u00e0 pour signifier les pouvoirs ou les attributions de la royaut\u00e9. L\u2019explication qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par le savant conseil des appelants est la seule correcte. 11 est \u00e9vident que cette expression se rapporte seulement aux droits de percentage ou de commission que la Couronne percevait avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration dans les provinces de la Nouvelle-Ecosse et du Nouveau-Brunswick sur les concessions de mines. Pour ces raisons la sec. 109 ne me para\u00eet aucunement affecter la pr\u00e9rogative en question.\nUn autre argument que l\u2019on a aussi fait valoir dans cette cause, et qui ne me semble pas plus concluant que celui fond\u00e9 sur la section 109, est celui tir\u00e9 du pouvoir des l\u00e9gislatures sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils.\nLa d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence \u00e9tant une interruption de la succession, et le souverain ne prenant les biens que comme ultimus h\u0153res, les l\u00e9gislatures peuvent, dit-on, changer cet ordre de succession. Mais la d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence est une mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9rogative et non pas une question de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de droit civil. D\u2019ailleurs l\u2019ordre actuel des successions admettant cette pr\u00e9rogative en faveur de la souveraine, il faudrait d\u00e9montrer que le pouvoir de l\u00e9gislater sur les pr\u00e9rogatives royales appartient aux l\u00e9gislatures Ce serait retomber dans la question de savoir \u00e0 qui appartient l\u2019autorit\u00e9 souveraine sous la constitution actuelle, sur les sujets de l\u00e9gislation non sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, question sur laquelle j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu occasion de me prononcer. Je ne crois pas devoir y revenir, car je crois que la sec. 102 suffit pour r\u00e9soudre la question soumise.\nAyant pris communication de l\u2019opinion si savam- ment \u00e9labor\u00e9e de l\u2019honorable juge Gwynne, je me suis content\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer bri\u00e8vement les motifs de mon concours dans les conclusions qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9es, En cons\u00e9quence je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nHaving fully considered the interesting and highly-important interests involved in the discussion and decision of this case, I shall now briefly state the conclusions at which I have arrived.\nOn the part of the respondent it is claimed that on the failure of heirs of Andrew Mercer, who died intestate, the province of Ontario became entitled to his estate\u2014both real and personal\u2014as legislative assignee of the Crown.\nOn the part of the appellants it is contended that no such assignment was made, but that by the British North America Act the assignment, if any, was to the Dominion.\nIf therefore the claim of the respondent he not sustained our judgment must be for the appellants, whether or not the Dominion, by the act in question, became entitled to the position claimed for Ontario,\nIf the majority of the court should be of the opinion that the respondent\u2019s claim cannot be allowed, it will be unnecessary, in my opinion, to consider the proposition advanced by the appellants, that the assignment was to the Dominion. It has been contended in other cases that plenary legislative powers were given by the act mentioned over all subjects and for all objects, either, to the parliament of Canada or to the several legislatures. I have, in at least one of my judgments, refused to admit the correctness of that proposition; and have held that we must look to the act and trace to it the right to legislate in regard to every matter arising for decision. If we always keep in view the consideration that the whole legislative power is given by it, and by it alone\u2014a position requiring no argument to sustain\u2014and determine from that the existence of any legislative power claimed, the solution will, to that extent, be easier; and the decision more likely to be correct. There are, no doubt, many subjects given fully, either to the Dominion or to the local legislatures, or in part to each, wherein it is manifest the one or the two, each of the part allotted to it, should have legislative power to deal with the whole of such subjects; but although that may be properly said to be the general rule, I maintain the existence of cases that should be declared exceptions.\nIt is not necessary, as I have before said and for the reasons given, to be shown, that the right claimed by the respondent should appertain to the Dominion. It may be that the latter has no such right; but that conclusion, in my opinion, should have little weight in the present case. To recover in this action, the exclusive right must be shown in Ontario. The appellants are entitled to our judgment unless the respondent shows a valid legislative transfer of the prerogative right in question to the province; and such a transfer as would deprive the sovereign of the right to its future exercise. I am induced to make these suggestions as many of the reasons for arriving at the conclusion that there was no such transfer to the several provinces composing the Dominion apply with equal force to show there was none to the Dominion.\nI have said that we must seek from the British North America Act, and from that alone, for the sustainment of the respondent\u2019s claim.\nOur attention was directed at the argument to the position of Canada immediately preceding the passage of the act as regards Crown or waste lands, and also to that of Upper Canada before the union with Lower Canada. Holding, however, the views I do as to the result of the union of the four provinces in 1867, I am unable to feel that much, if any, weight should be given to an argument founded on the position, as touching the question under consideration, which the provinces or any of them occupied at any time before confederation, except so far as the act specially refers to such position. The Imperial Act was not one forced upon the provinces by an arbitrary proceeding of an overruling legislative body, depriving them, or any of them, of legislative power. In such a case it might be contended that the extent of the deprivation must be ascertained from the act; and as regards any subject or matter not embraced in it, the power would still remain. Here, however, the case is far different. The act was passed, as it recites, on the application of the provinces to give legislative sanction and authority to an agreement entered into on the part of the provinces for their federal union. The implied, if not expressed, principle acted on was that all rights and privileges, including legislative as well as others, of each of the provinces, should be surrendered; and that each should, if the union were consummated, depend subsequently for the exercise of their rights and privileges upon the Imperial Act to be passed, to give effect to the agreement for union entered into. This is patent in the act itself and in the resolutions of the delegates upon which it was founded and passed. I could give many reasons, and show many facts, to prove the correctness of this proposition; but it appears to me only necessary to suggest that if it were intended to be otherwise, we would reasonably expect to find provision made for intended exceptions. The absence of any such is strong presumptive evidence that none were desired.\nSection 102 of the act gives to the Dominion the appropriation of All duties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, beforehand at the union, had and have power of appropriation, except such portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the legislatures of the provinces, or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this Act,\nto form one consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the public service of Canada.\nBy the terms and provisions of that section all the duties and revenues controlled before the union by the legislatures of the provinces, with the exception of the portions reserved by the act to the provinces, were clearly given to the Dominion. If, then, before the union, the right claimed by the respondent was vested in the provinces, it was transferred to the Dominion by this section, unless we find it reserved in the act to the provinces. I think therefore that the decision of this case should not be affected by the position of the provinces, or by their legislation, before the union, with the exception I have before mentioned. If the portions of the revenues reserved to the provinces cannot be construed to include the right in question, it matters not that it can be satisfactorily and undoubtedly shown that Ontario possessed it before the union.\nThe reservation to which I have just referred we find, on reference to the act, to be \u201clands, mines, minerals and royalties, belonging to the several provinces at the union.\u201d \u201cLands\u201d and \u201croyalties\u201d need only to be referred to in this connection. As to the first it is contended, that by the mere transfer from the Crown to the provinces, the prerogative right to an escheat, on the failure of heirs, is transferred. The first inquiry naturally is had the province of Canada, before the union, that right? If it had not, then it could not be a part of the reservation. It was the duty of the respondent to have pointed out some legislation of the Imperial Parliament abolishing or transferring the prerogative right of the Crown by escheat over lands in the provinces held in free and common socage, previous to the accession of his Majesty William IV.; or to some such statute repealing the statute passed in the first year of his reign, ch. 25, by which his Majesty surrendered to parliament, to form part of the consolidated fund of the kingdom, his Majesty\u2019s interest in the hereditary revenues of the Crown, and in the funds \u201cwhich might be derived from any droits of the Crown or admiralty,\u201d from any casual revenues either in his Majesty\u2019s foreign possessions or in the United Kingdom; and providing that, after his decease, all the said hereditary revenues should be payable and paid to his heirs and successors; to which was added a proviso, that nothing in the act should extend, or be construed to extend, in any wise to impair, affect or prejudice any rights or powers of control, management or direction which had been or might be exercised by authority of the Crown relative (amongst other things) \u201cto the granting or disposing of any freehold or copyhold property, or the produce of or any part of the produce or amount or value of any freehold or copy hold to which his Majesty, or any of his royal predecessors, had or hath, or shall be entitled to, either by escheat for want of heirs, or by reason of any forfeiture, or to the granting or distributing of any personal property to which the Crown would become entitled by reason of the want of next of kin or personal representatives, of any deceased person,\u201d but that the same should be enjoyed in as full and effectual manner as if that act had not been passed; the act declaring that the said rights and powers should not be abridged, restrained, affected or prejudiced in any manner whatever; but only, that the monies accruing to the Crown, after the full and free exercise of the enjoyment of the said rights and powers, subject as aforesaid, should, during his Majesty\u2019s life, be carried to and made part of the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom. The act of the province of New Brunswick for the transfer of the hereditary, casual and territorial revenues, and of the lands, woods, mines and royalties, contains similar provisions0 as to the reservation of the rights of the Crown, to make any grant or restitution of any estate, or of the produce thereof, to to which it might become entitled by escheat for want of heirs, &c., or to make any grant or distribution of any personal property devolved to the Crown for want of next of kin, &c., and declaring that it was only the monies arising, after the full and free exercise and enjoyment of the rights reserved, should be carried to and form part of the consolidated revenue of New Brunswick. That act has been re-enacted, and is still in force.\nIt could not therefore be successfully contended that in New Brunswick the local legislature could legislate upon the subject, as that province could not claim the right under the provisions of the British North America Act; not having enjoyed or exercised any such right previously, but, on the contrary, expressly legislated against it. Having been specially exempted from the operation of the New Brunswick Act, it may be contended that, inasmuch as the Confederation Act contains no such reservation, it was intended to pass the right claimed; but it will be seen that the terms of the latter are not general, and do not apply at all to the hereditary Crown revenues as such, but specifically refer to lands, mines, minerals and royalties. The argument might be applicable to the grant to the Dominion in its comprehensive terms, if the provinces had previously such right, but is not applicable to the specific reservation to the provinces.\nUp to the time of the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1840, it cannot be claimed that either had any claim to control the appropriations of the casual or territorial revenues of the Crown. By the Imperial Act passed to consummate that union, it was provided that before any act of the united provinces relating to, or affecting her Majesty\u2019s prerogative touching the granting of waste lands of the Crown, could receive the royal assent, it was required to be laid before both houses of the British Parliament for thirty days; and that if either house, during that period, should pass an address asking her Majesty to withhold her assent, it would not thereafter be lawful for her to give it. And also that any law divesting the Crown of any of its prerogative rights, and vesting them in the provincial legislature, must emanate from, or be expressly confirmed by the Imperial Parliament. The latter provision, I take, governed the province of Canada up to the Confederation Act, and when on one occasion a provincial act was assented to\u2014as I presume inadvertently\u2014without the act having been laid before both houses of parliament as required, a ratifying act of the Imperial Parliament was passed as necessary to validate it. I can find no legislation of the Imperial Parliament since to change that position of the matter.\nIt is contended that, inasmuch as the management and sale of crown lands is vested in the local legislatures, it is more reasonable to assume it to have been intended to include the right to acquire a title again by escheat, rather than that the Dominion should take it. That was however a matter more for those who procured the passage of the act, and for the parliament that passed it, than for us. We are not to say what the provision should have been, but what it is. If I were satisfied that the prerogative right in question was in reality transferred by the confederation act, I should be much more inclined to conclude that it was to the Dominion, by force of the general terms of the grant to it, than to the provinces by the restrictive terms of the grant to them. By section 102 it will how- ever be seen that the grant to the Dominion is limited to the \u201cduties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick had and have power of appropriation.\u201d If therefore the legislatures of those provinces had not, before or at the union, the right to deal with the subject-matter now in question, it cannot be contended that it passed to the Dominion by virtue of that section. If such should be found to be the case it will, I have no doubt, be found to make no practical difference, as we have every reason to assume the right will be exercised by the sovereign as recommended and suggested by her representative in the Dominion.\nThe Imperial Parliament has never, as far as I have been able to discover, attempted to deal with the peculiar prerogatives of the Crown until previously voluntarily surrendered by the sovereign; and with that now under consideration the British parliament has not in any way interfered. If the province of Ontario should be found right in dealing with it, a position will be attained by it which, as far as I can discover, has not been reached in any other part of her Majesty\u2019s Dominions.\nIt is admitted that up to 1840 the prerogative right to escheat in cases like the present vested in Her Majesty the Queen. If previous to that an estate was left without heirs, the Queen would take the title. She would not, however, take it merely as a source of revenue, for such was seldom appropriated for that purpose. Up to that time the title and control of all public or waste lands was in the Queen. The province had no title thereto, and the patents were from the Queen. Under what rule or upon what principle could the province claim, through an escheat, an estate it never before owned. Escheat is by law defined to be \u201can obstruction of the course of descent and a conse- quent determination of the tenure by some unforeseen contingency, in which case the land naturally results back, by a kind of reversion, to the original grantor or lord of the fee.\u201d If that definition be correct, and I cannot think it will be doubted, than in respect of all lands granted, or patented, previous to 1840, the province could, by no possibility that I can discover, claim as the original grantor, or lord of the fee. If, indeed, the patent had been shown to have issued since 1867, when the Confederation Act was passed, it might be more interesting to consider and apply to it the doctrine of escheat than under existing circumstances, and to decide whether or not the act transferred the right claimed. If, however, we were expected to decide that question it should have been submitted to us by evidence showing the patent to have issued since the Confederation Act came into operation. That is not the case before us, and I need not speak positively as to it, but will content myself by saying that for other reasons given, I am of opinion that, even in that case, the respondent would fail in sustaining his claims.\nIt was contended on the part of the respondent that it could not be, that while the land, before being granted, was held by her Majesty for the use of the province of Ontario, yet upon, or after, the grant in fee simple, the reversionary estate would be held by her Majesty for the use of the Dominion of Canada. The answer to that proposition is, that after the grant her Majesty had no substantial interest, such as a reversion on the expiration of a lease. The whole estate was transferred without any reserve, or any provision for a reversion. Her Majesty held not the smallest estate known to the law in it. By the unforeseen accident of the failure of heirs, or by a forfeiture, she again becomes entitled; but in the meantime is neither the owner nor the trustee of any other in regard to it. She takes it in her own right as the original grantor, having had before the forfeiture or failure of heirs no title whatever. By English law and practice she can dispose of that title when accrued as she pleases, independent of parliamentary control. In the large majority of cases, however, as others lose by the accident which gives her title, she refuses the personal benefit caused by it, and restores, or rather grants, the subject-matter to those who, but for the accident, would most probably have succeeded to it. The power to remedy the injurious result of such an accident in many cases that happen, must be highly prized by any right feeling sovereign; and it is one not yet controlled by Imperial legislation. It must, therefore, have been considered wise and proper that such should continue to be exercised.\nOn the part of the respondent it was presented to us simply as a matter of revenue, as between the Dominion and the provinces. I view it very differently; and think myself bound to uphold a prerogative right, the exercise of which is more likely to be less exacting than if otherwise held\u2014and which has been so long enjoyed with apparent satisfaction in the United Kingdom\u2014until it is made satisfactorily to appear that it no longer exists.\nI think such transfer should not be adjudged by a speculative construction of a doubtful statute, but by a most clear and positive enactment. Besides, it is a well known rule that the sovereign is bound by no statute unless specially named therein, and that any statute affecting adversely the prerogative rights of the sovereign does not bind him unless there are express words indicative of that object. If that rule of law be not violated, the grant of the lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the provinces at the Union in 1867 cannot be adjudged to affect in any way the royal prerogative through which lands, by escheat for want of heirs, become vested in the sovereign. That doctrine was acted upon and declared in force by the Privy Council in a comparatively late case[45], and cited by the counsel of the appellants at the argument.\nAgain it is claimed that the right in question is given to the provinces through the transfer by the act of the subject-matter termed \u201croyalties.\u201d The objections last urged will apply with equal force to that subject. The term \u201croyalties\u201d is of very general import and very comprehensive; but it cannot be contended in this case that it includes the transfer of all that might come under that designation. \u201cRoyalties\u201d as to mines is well understood in England to be the sums paid to the sovereign for the right to work the royal mines of gold and silver; and to the owner of private lands, for the right to work mines of the inferior metals, coal, &c. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, if not in the other provinces, mines and minerals were at the time of the Union being worked; and, in Nova Scotia, a revenue therefrom was derived by the government and which, in the acts of that province, were called \u201croyalties.\u201d That the income thus derived should be continued to that province, it was necessary that provision therefor should be made; and the use of the term was apparently intended for that purpose, and, at the same time, to give to the other provinces the continuance of the same right, where such was previously enjoyed. The provision of the act had therefore sufficient in the fact I have stated to furnish a subject-matter to which it could be referable, and upon which it could operate without giving it any additional or more extended application. The object was to secure to the provinces someting at once available tor revenue to be appropriated by them in their legislatures, and by their several governments, for public purposes. It does not, however, follow that the words used in the provision should be adjudged to include the prerogative right of the sovereign in respect of any title she might obtain by the accident of a person dying intestate without heirs. Such an assumption as the latter is quite unnecessary to give operation to the provision; and for the many reasons I have given, I think it does not include what is claimed; nor can I arrive at the conclusion that such was intended. These views are in accordance in many respects with those I expressed in the case of Lenoir v. Ritchie[46]. I may add, that in that case they were not alone my views, but those of all my learned brethren who heard and decided it; and I have heard nothing since tending to change or weaken them. After giving my views, as I have done, in reference to the right in question, I need hardly say that I consider the act of the province of Ontario in relation thereto ultra vires. I must, therefore, in accordance with those views decide that the respondent has not established the position upon which his right to recover in the suit is based; that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that our judgment should be for the appellant, with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThough I have not failed to give the able argumentation of the learned counsel heard before us on the part of the respondent in this cause the consideration it deserved, I have been unable to alter my views on the question submitted as I expressed them in the Fraser case[47], where the same question was before me in the Superior Court of Kamarouska, and I am still of opinion that under the British North America Act the right to escheats propter defectum sanguinis belongs exclusively to the federal power. As this last case is fully reported, I have not written down at full length the reasons upon which I have come to a conclusion in the present case. This however would, under the circumstances, have been useless. I concur entirely with what my brother Gwynne says on the construction to be given to the word royalties, and to the word lands in section 109 of the British North America Act, as well as with what he says on the doctrine of reversion relied upon by the respondent. I may remark that this doctrine of reversion and the reasons given in the present case by the Ontario Court of Appeal applicable to real estate, do not support the Quebec Court of Appeal in the Fraser case, where the question as submitted related to personal as well as real estate. To say, as has been said, that as escheats fall within the words \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province,\u201d they belong to the local power, is a petitio principii. It is taking for granted that they do not belong to the Crown, to the federal power; for, if they belong to the federal, they, of course, do not fall under the words \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province,\u201d and they cannot in any shape whatsoever be legislated upon by the local power. Section 117 of the British North America Act, relied upon by some of the judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal, has nothing to do with the question, and was not relied upon by the respondent before this court. As to the word royalties, to be found in section 109 of the British North America Act, which word, according to some of the judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal, in the Fraser case, transfers and reserves escheats to the provincial governments, the respondent has, rightly, in my opinion, been unwilling to base his case upon it in his argument before us. To my mind section 102 of the British North America Act is conclusive. The legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, before and at the union, had power of appropriation over the revenues arising from escheats. Such revenues have not by the British North America Act been reserved to the provincial legislatures. Neither can these revenues be said to be raised by the provincial legislatures, in accordance with the special powers conferred upon them by the said British North America Act. Then, they form part of the consolidated revenue fund of the Dominion, according to this section 102. This is so for real as well as for personal property, as I read the Act. The argument of the respondent, based upon the doctrine of reversion, seems to me defective in that it leaves the personal property of a person deceased intestate without heirs to the federal government, whilst it gives his real property to the local government.\nAny argument which leaves Mercer\u2019s personal estate, which is very large, to the federal government, whilst it gives his real estate to the local government must, as I view it, be wrong, and contrary to a sound interpretation of the British North America Act. The Imperial authority cannot have intended such a division of the revenues from escheats. I may also remark that in the province of Quebec the laws relating to escheats under art. 637 of the Civil Code are not derived from the feudal system, and are anterior to the feudal ages, so that this doctrine of reversion could not apply there. It seems to me that any argument which under the British North America Act does not and cannot apply equally to all the provinces must be contrary to the spirit and intent of the British North America Act. This doctrine of reversion seems to me also defective in that it cannot apply to lands which did not belong to the provinces at the time of the union. Lands which did not form part of the public domain at the union were not given to the provinces by section 109 of the Act. Lands of persons dying intestate without heirs in any one of the provinces before confederation did not re-vest in the province, but escheated to the sovereign, and belonged to him. He alone had the title to them. The provinces had been given by the sovereign and possessed at the union power of appropriation over the revenues arising from this right of escheat (the revenues only, not the prerogative right itself, which always remained and remains in the person of the sovereign), and these revenues by section 102 of the Act have been given to the Dominion Government. All duties and revenues over which the provinces had, before confederation, power of appropriation are by said section 102 given to the Dominion Government, save and except only such portions of said duties and revenues which are by the Act reserved to the provinces. Section 126 distinctly enacts that the provinces shall have for the future such portions only of said duties and revenues which are by the Act reserved to them. This is clear. For the Dominion, all duties and revenues, except those expressly reserved to the provinces. For the provinces, none of said duties and revenues but such, portions thereof as are express reserved to them. The provinces have consequently to establish that the Act reserved to them the revenues from escheats. The onus probandi is on them. I fail to see that in any part of the Act these revenues have been so reserved to them.\nAs to the argument, that as section 102 enacts that the duties and revenues therein mentioned shall form part of the consolidated revenue fund of the Dominion, it would be impossible for the Crown to relinquish its rights to revenues from escheats in favor of illegitimate children of the deceased or otherwise, it may be remarked that this argument, if good, would apply equally to the statute ch. 10 C.S.C. sec. 5, in which it was also enacted that the duties and revenues, including escheats, would form part of the consolidated revenue of the province of Canada as constituted before confederation. Yet, under the said Act, it has never been doubted that the Crown could relinquish its rights to escheats when it wished so to do.\nThe question submitted to us by one of the learned counsel for the respondent as to whether the Queen forms part of the local legislatures seems to me to have no practical bearing on this case. That, when anything which, according to the principles of the British Constitution, must be done in her Majesty\u2019s name, has to be done by the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces, under the British North America Act, they are authorized to do it in her Majesty\u2019s name, and are deemed then to act for her Majesty, has not, that I remember, been denied by the appellant. But they are not her Majesty\u2019s direct representatives, as the Governor General is. They have never been considered as such by the Imperial authorities.\n\u201cThe Lieutenant Governors of the provinces of the Dominion, however important locally their functions may be, are a part of the colonial administrative staff, and are more immediately responsible to the Governor General in Council. They do not hold commissions from the Crown, and neither in power nor privilege resemble those Governors, or even Lieutenant Governors of colonies, to whom, after special consideration of their personal fitness, the Queen, under the great seal and her own hand and signet, delegates portions of her prerogatives and issues her own instructions,\u201d says the Earl of Carnarvon in a despatch to Lord Dufferin, dated January 7th, 1875[48].\nThat the Lieutenant Governors are considered by the Imperial authorities as officers of the Dominion Govern- ment seems also clear by the proceedings in the Letellier affair, and the despatch of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach to the Marquis of Lome on the subject, dated July 3rd, 1879[49].\nThe following despatch of the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos to Lord Monck, is written in the same view of the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s position.\nDOWNING STREET, 19th October, 1868,\nMY LORD,\u2014I have under my consideration your Lordship\u2019s despatch; No. 170, of the 9th September, submitting the question whether the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces within the Dominion of Canada are entitled to salutes from H.M. ships and fortifications within their respective provinces.\nI have the honour to acquaint you that under the circumstances of the case, the Lieutenat Governors of the provinces holding their commissions from the Governor General, will not be entitled to salutes.\nI have the honor to be,\n&c., &c., &c.,\n(Signed,)BUCKINGHAM & CHANDOS.\nThe Viscount Monck.\nAnother despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 7th November, 1872, though it recognizes the Lieutenant Governors should be deemed to be acting directly on behalf of Her Majesty on certain occasions, treats them on ordinary occasions as representing the Dominion Government.\n* * * And with reference to the question asked by Sir Hastings Doyle, and submitted by Lord Lisgar for my decision, namely, \u201cwhether the Lieutenant Governors are supposed to be acting on behalf of the Queen,\u201d I have to observe that, while from the nature of their appointment they represent on ordinary occasions the Dominion Government, there are, nevertheless, occasions (such as the opening or closing of a session of the provincial legislature, the celebration of Her Majesty\u2019s birthday, the holding of a levee, &c., &c.,) on which they should be deemed to be acting directly on behalf of Her Majesty, and the first part of the National Anthem should be played in their presence. * * *\n(Signed,)KIMBERLEY. A reference to the order of precedence established for Canada by Her Majesty shows that the Lieutenant Governors do not take rank and precedence immediately after the Governor General, but only after the general commanding Her Majesty\u2019s troops, and alter the admiral commanding Her Majesty\u2019s naval forces on the British North America station,\nI do not cite these documents as conclusive evidence for a court of justice, but as worthy of consideration, and to show that the Imperial authorities and her Majesty herself consider the Lieutenant Governors as not generally representing the sovereign.\nHowever, as I have already stated, though the question has been raised and argued at some length before us, I do not think it can, in any manner, affect this case as I view it. As I have said, I fail to see that the British North America Act reserved or gave to the provinces the revenues arising from escheats. They consequently must belong to the federal power, and upon this ground, I am of opinion to allow this appeal with costs.\nI am glad to understand that it was agreed between the parties that whatever should be the judgment of this court on this question, the case would be carried to the Privy Council. Though these revenues from escheats must amount in fact to a trifle in each of the provinces, I think it but right for obvious reasons that the final and authoritative determination of controversies on the construction of the British North America Act, which is an Imperial statute, should emanate from an Imperial judicial authority.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThis case was argued before us as one raising a question of the respective rights of the dominion and provincial authorities, and as such we have had the advan- tage of hearing a learned counsel who appeared before us in the interest of the province of Quebec, as well as two learned counsel who appeared in the interest of the province of Ontario on the one side, and, upon the other side, learned counsel who appeared before us in the interest of the dominion.\nThe particular question is, whether lands in the province of Ontario escheating to the Crown propter defectum sanguinis come under the management, control and enjoyment of the dominion or of the provincial authorities? This question, however, involves the consideration of all property both freehold and personal in the several provinces of the dominion which escheats to the crown, and whether such escheat accrues propter defectum sanguinis or propter delictum tenentis,and the conclusion in both cases must be the same.\nThe learned counsel who appeared before us in the interest of the province of Quebec addressed to us an argument replete with ability and research for the purpose of establishing a position which he took, namely, that the title which the crown has to property by escheat is not derived from the feudal tenure, but from a much more ancient law, namely, the old Roman law; but from whatever source derived matters not, for, whatever may be its origin, the learned counsel admitted, as indeed he could not do otherwise, that whether escheat in lands be or be not a species of reversion, whether the title accrues as a sort of caducary succession, the Sovereign taking as ultimus h\u0153res, whether it is of the nature of a title by purchase, or by descent, or partakes of both, whether it accrues propter defectum sanguinis or propter delictum tenentis, whether in short the escheated property accrues as an incident to tenure or in virtue of the prerogative royal, and whether it be real or personal property which escheats, all property escheating to the Sovereign does so jure coron\u0153. The question with which we have to deal is one simply of the construction of the British North America Act, namely, what disposition has that Act, (which is the sole charter by which the rights claimed by the dominion and the provinces respectively, can be determined,) made of property escheating to the Crown? and has it made any distinction between property escheating propter defectum sanguinis and tha which escheats propter delictum tenentis? In construing this Act, however, it will be convenient to consider in what manner, and under what designation or form of expression, property of the description in question had been dealt with in prior Acts of parliament, and what was the precise condition in which that particular species of property was regarded to be, and was, at the time of the passing of the British North America Act. By so doing we shall obtain light to assist us in construing the latter Act.\nIn 1st Anne, stat. 1, c. 7, s. 5, property of this description is spoken of as lands, tenements and heredita ments which may hereafter escheat to her Majesty, her heirs and successors, and to the end that the land revenues of the Crown might be preserved, improved and increased for the best advantage thereof, it was enacted that no grant should be made of any manors, lands, tenements, tithes, woods or other hereditaments within the Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales or Town of Berwick-on-Tweed then belonging or thereafter to belong to her Majesty, her heirs or successors, whether the same should be in right of the Crown of England or as part of the Principality of Wales or of the Duchy or County Palatine of Lancaster, or otherwise howsoever, unless for 31 years or 3 lives, &c., &c., &c.\nSec. 6, made special provision as to buildings which, as they might require reparation, were allowed to be granted for 50 years or 3 lives.\nSec. 7, made all other grants which should be made contrary to the provisions of the Act to be void without any inquisition or scire facias. Provided always that \u201cthe Act or any thing therein contained should not extend to disable her Majesty, her heirs or successors to make any grant or restitution of any estate or estates thereafter to be forfeited for any treason or felony whatsoever.\u201d\nThe 39 and 40 Geo. 3, c. 88, was an Act passed to remove doubts whether real estate purchased by his Majesty out of his privy purse was subject to the provisions of the above stat. of 1st Anne, and it declared that such lands so purchased, or any other lands which might accrue to his Majesty, his heirs or successors, by gift, or devise, or by descent, or otherwise, from any of his ancestors, or any other person not being a King or Queen of Great Britain, were not affected by the above Act, and it provided for the free disposition of all such lands by his Majesty, his heirs and successors.\nBy the 12th sec. of that Act it was enacted as follows:\nAnd whereas divers lands, tenements and hereditaments have become and may hereafter become vested in his Majesty, his heirs and successors by escheat or otherwise in right of the Crown which in the hands of his Majesty\u2019s subjects would be chargeable with certain trusts or applicable to certain purposes, and his Majesty, his heirs or successors might be desirous that the same should be applied accordingly, notwithstanding any right which he or they may have to hold the same discharged from such trusts, or without applying the same to such purposes, but by reason of the provisions contained in the said Acts of the first year of her said late Majesty Queen Anne and the thirty-fourth year of his Majesty\u2019s reign, doubts may be raised whether his Majesty, his heirs or successors, can direct such application thereof; and whereas divers lands, tenements and hereditaments as well freehold as copyhold have escheated and may escheat to his Majesty, his heirs or successors, for want of heirs of the persons last seized thereof or entitled thereto, or by reason of some forfeiture or otherwise, although not forfeited for treason or felony, and it is expedient to enable his Majesty to direct the execution of any such trust or purposes as aforesaid, to make any grants of any such manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments as aforesaid notwithstanding the provisions contained in the said recited Acts\u2014Be it enacted that it shall be lawful for his Majesty, his heirs and successors, by warrant under his or their sign manual to direct the execution of any trusts or purposes to which any manors, messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments which have escheated or shall escheat to his Majesty, his heirs or successors shall have been liable at the time the same so escheated respectively or would have been liable in the hands of any of his Majesty\u2019s subjects, and to make any grants of such manors, lands, tenements and hereditaments respectively to any trustee or trustees or otherwise for the execution of such trusts, and to make any grants of any lands, tenements or hereditaments which have escheated or shall escheat as aforesaid to any person or persons, either for the purpose of restoring the same to any of the family of the person or persons whose estates the same had been, or of rewarding any persons or person making discovery of any such escheat, as to His Majesty, his heirs or successors respectively shall seem fit; anything in the said Acts or any of them to the contrary notwithstanding.\nBy 47 Geo. 3, c. 24, which was passed to explain and amend 39 and 40 Geo. 3, c. 88, and to remove doubts which had been raised whether the 12th section of that Act applied to the Duchy of Lancaster (the title of the kings of England to which is separate from the Crown of England[50], and grants of lands in which were, by a statute of Henry 5th, valid only when executed under the Seal of the Duchy[51],) it was enacted that in all cases in which his Majesty, his heirs or successors hath or shall in right of his Crown or of his Duchy of Lancaster become entitled to any freehold or copyhold manors, messuages, lands, tenements or hereditaments, either by escheat for want of heirs, or by reason of any forfeiture, or by reason that the same had been purchased by or for the use of or in trust for any alien, it should be lawful for his Majesty, his heirs and successors, by warrant under his or their sign manual, or under the seal of the Duchy or County Palatine of Lancaster according to the title of such manors, messuages, lands, &c., &c., to make grants thereof (as in 12th sec. of 39 and 40 Geo. 3rd, c. 88), anything in 1st Anne and 34 Geo. 3, c. 75, or any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding.\nBy 59 Geo. 3, c. 94, which was passed to explain and amend 39 and 40 Geo. 3, c. 88, and 47 Geo. 3, c. 24, and to remove doubts which had arisen in certain cases of grants by his Majesty under the said recited Acts, it was enacted that in all cases in which his Majesty hath, or shall in right of his Crown, or of his Duchy of Lancaster, become entitled to any freehold or copyhold, manors, &c., &c., either by escheat for want of heirs, or by reason of any forfeiture or by reason that the same had been or shall be purchased by or for the use of or in trust for any alien, it shall be lawful for his Majesty, his heirs and successors (as in the former acts) to make grants of such manors, &c., &c., or of any rents and profits then due and in arrear to his Majesty in respect thereof respectively, to any trustee, for the execution of any trusts, or for the purpose of restoring the same to any of the family of the person whose estate the same had been, or for carrying into effect any intended grant, or for rewarding discoverers, or to the families of aliens or other persons unconditionally, or in consideration of money, or to a trustee to sell, and that the rents and purchase monies to arise by any sale should be applied in payment of any costs, charges and expenses incident to any commission for finding the title of his Majesty, and to the making of any such grant, and for carrying the same and the trusts thereof into execution, or in rewarding any person, or the family of any person making discovery of any such escheat, forfeiture, or purchase by an alien or of his Majesty\u2019s right and title thereto, or in discharging the whole or any part of the debts due from an alien or any person whose estate or property, any such manors, messuages, &c., &c., have been; or for the use or benefit in whole or in part of any such alien or of his family, or of any person adopted by such alien or considered as part of his family, or of any person whose estate or property any such manors, &c., &c., have been, or his family; or of any person adopted or considered by such person as part of his family, or for all or any of the purposes aforesaid as to his Majesty, his heirs and successors shall seem fit; and all previous grants which would be good under the provisions of this Act, are made good and effectual to all intents and purposes as if made under this Act, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any previous Act.\nBy the 3rd section it was enacted, that in every case where any surplus should remain of any monies which should arise from any such sale or sales, or which should be paid under the authority of the Act by any person, after satisfying all such purposes as shall have been ordered and directed by his Majesty, his heirs or successors, under the provisions of this Act, shall be paid to the commissioners of his Majesty\u2019s land revenue for the time being to be applied by them in the same way and manner as the monies arising from the sale of any manors, messuages, lands, tenements or heretaments of or belonging to his Majesty by the several Acts now in force for the management and improvement of the land revenue of the Crown or any of them, directed to be applied and disposed of.\nBy the 14th sec. of 1st Geo. 4, c. 1, it was enacted, that an annual account of all monies which shall or may. hereafter arise and be received for or in respect of any droits of Admiralty or droits of the Crown, &c., &c., &c., and from all surplus revenues of Gibrallar, or any other possessions of his Majesty out of the United Kingdom, and from all casual revenue or revenues, whether arising in or from any foreign possessions, or in the United Kingdom, and of the application and disposition of all such monies or revenues, shall be laid before parliament on or before the 26th day of March in each year, if parliament shall be then sitting, or, if parliament shall not be then sitting, then within 30 days after the then next meeting of parliament.\nBy 6 Geo, 4, c. 17, the provisions of 59 Geo. 3, c. 94, were extended to Leasehold lands, &c., &c., &c.\nIn 1829, 10 Geo. 4, c. 50, was passed. This was an Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the management of the land revenue of the crown within England and Ireland, and by the 126th sec. of that Act it was enacted that nothing in the Act should extend or be deemed, or construed to extend, to repeal, interfere with or in any manner affect, any of the powers and provisions of 39 and 40 Geo. 3, c. 88, or of 47 Geo. 3, c. 24, or of 59 Geo. 3, c. 94, or of 6 Geo. 4, c. 17.\nAnd by the 128th. sec. it was enacted, that nothing in the act should extend, or be construed to extend in any wise to impair or affect any rights, or powers of control, management or direction, which have been or may be exercised by authority of the Crown, or other lawful warrant relative to any leases, grants, or assurances of any of the small branches of his Majesty\u2019s hereditary revenue, or to any suits or proceedings for recovery of the same, or to compositions made or to be made on account of any of the said small branches, or to fines taken, or to be taken, or to rents, boons and services reserved or to be reserved upon such grants, leases and assurances, or to the mitigation or remission of the same, or to any other lawful act, matter or thing which has been or may be done touching the said branches, but that the said rights and powers shall continue to be used, exercised and enjoyed in as full, free, ample and effectual manner to all intents and purposes as if this Act had not been made, and as the same had been or might have been enjoyed by his Majesty up to the time of passing of this Act.\nFrom this last section it appears to be clear that lands which should escheat to the crown whether propter defectum sanguinis or propter delictum tenentis, or which should become forfeited as purchased to the use of or in trust for an alien were not, and were not regarded as being, part of what were known as \u201cthe small branches of his Majesty\u2019s hereditary revenue\u201d and that in parliamentary, that is to say in statutory phraseology, this latter term did not comprehend revenue derived from such escheated or forfeited lands\nThe law affecting lands accruing to the Crown by escheat and forfeiture remained as appearing in the above recited acts until the accession of his Majesty King Wm. 4th to the throne in 1831. It will be observed that the above Acts do not profess to affect any personal chattel property escheating to the Crown which continued to be at the absolute disposal of the Sovereign. It will be observed also, that the above recited Acts of 39 and 40 Geo. 3, 17 Geo. 3, 59 Geo. 3, and 6 Geo. 4, were not passed for the purpose of vesting in the Crown, rights in respect of lands accruing by escheat or forfeiture which the Crown never had before had, but for the purpose of removing the restraint which the provisions of 1st Anne had imposed, or might be supposed to have imposed, upon the power of the Crown over such lands which, but for that statute would have been absolute. The effect of the recited Acts was to cause to be paid over to the commissioners of his Majesty\u2019s land revenues the surplus only of the revenue which might be derived or arise from the sale of any such escheated or forfeited lands, after the full and free exercise by the Crown of its prerogative right of disposing at pleasure and ex speciali grati\u00e2 of the whole of such lands, or of the proceeds of the sale thereof to all or any of the purposes mentioned in the recited Acts; they were, in fact, Acts passed for the purpose of maintaining the prerogative right of the Crown of graciously restoring such lands to persons who were, or who were considered as being of, or adopted into, the family of the person whose estate the property had been; that gracious exercise of the Sovereign\u2019s prerogative right those statutes maintained and preserved.\nWhether the language of 30 & 40 Geo. 3, and of the subsequent Acts in amendment thereof, extending as it did to \u201call cases in which his Majesty, his heirs or successors, hath or shall in right of his Crown become entitled by escheat, &c.,\u201d was sufficient to include lands in the colonies escheating to the Sovereign for the time being in right of the Crown, is of no importance at the present day, nor is it necessary for the purpose of this case to enquire and determine, for, from what I have already said, it follows, that if those Acts did not apply to lands escheating to the Crown in the colonies the prerogative right of the Crown over such lands to dispose of them at pleasure, and consequently to the gracious purposes indicated in the above recited Acts remained absolute and unaffected by any Act of parliament at the time of the accession of his Majesty King Wm. 4 to the throne, for the statute 1st Anne was confined expressly in terms to England and Wales and the town of Berwick-on-Tweed, and no similar Act affecting the property belonging or accruing in the colonies to the Sovereign jure coron\u0153 had been passed.\nI have named above the accession of his late Majesty King Wm. 4th to the throne as being the period when first any revenue derived from the casual source of property, whether real or personal, escheating to the Grown either propter defectum sanguinis or propter delictum tenentis, was surrendered by the Crown and was incorporated into and made part of the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom.\nBy 1st Wm. 4th, c. 25, after reciting among other things that his Majesty had been graciously pleased to signify to his Majesty\u2019s faithful Commons in parliament assembled, that his Majesty placed without reserve at their disposal his Majesty\u2019s interest in the hereditary revenues of the Crown and in those funds which may be derived from any droits of the Crown or admiralty\u2014from the West India duties, or from any casual revenues either in his Majesty s foreign possessions or in the United Kingdom, it was enacted that the produce of all the said hereditary duties, payments and revenues in England and Ireland respectively, &c., &c., &c., and also the small branches of the hereditary revenue, and the produce of the hereditary casual revenues arising from any droits of admiralty or droits of the Crown, &c., and from all surplus revenues of Gibraltar, or any other possession of His Majesty out of the United Kingdom, and from all other casual revenues arising either in the foreign possessions of his Majesty or in the United Kingdom, which have accrued since the decease of his said late Majesty, and which shall not have been applied and distributed in the payment of any charge thereupon respectively, or which shall accrue during the life of his present Majesty, shall be carried to and made part of the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and from and after the decease of his present Majesty, all the said hereditary revenues, shall be payable and paid to his heirs and successors; and by the 12th clause it was enacted, that nothing in this Act contained should extend, or be construed to extend, in any wise to impair, affect or prejudice any rights or powers of control, management or direction which have been or may be exercised by authority of the Crown, or other lawful warrant, relative to any leases, grants or assurances of any of the said small branches of his Majesty\u2019s revenue, or to any suits or proceedings for the recovery of the same, or to any other lawful matter or thing which has been, or may be, done touching the said branches, or to the granting of any droits of admiralty or any droits of the Crown or any part or portion of any such droits respectively, as reward or remuneration to any officer, or other person, giving any information relating thereto, or to the granting or disposing of any freehold or copyhold property, or the produce of, or any part of the produce, or amount or value of, any freehold or copyhold to which his Majesty, or any of his royal predecessors, have, or hath, or shall become entitled, either by escheat for want of heirs, or by reason of any forfeiture, &c., &c., or to the granting or distributing of any personal property devolved to the Crown by reason of the want of next of kin or personal representative of any deceased person, but that the same rights and powers shall continue to be used and enjoyed in as full and effectual manner as if this Act had not been made and as the same might have been enjoyed by his late Majesty King George the 4th at the time of his decease, subject nevertheless to all such regulations as were in force by virtue of any Act or Acts of parliament in relation thereto at the time of the decease of his said late Majesty, it being the true intent and meaning of this Act that the said rights and powers shall not in any degree be abridged, restrained, affected, or prejudiced in any manner whatsoever, but only that the monies accruing to the Crown, after the full and free exercise of the enjoyment of the said rights and powers, subject q,s qforesaid, shall, during his Majesty\u2019s life be carried to and made part of the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom.\nNow it will be observed that from the passing of the above statute of Anne until the passing of this Act of 1st Wm. 4, that branch of the revenues of the Crown which arose from escheated or forfeited lands is never spoken of in any Act of parliament under any other designation or description than as the proceeds of lands \u201cwhich may hereafter escheat\u201d or of lands \u201cwherein his Majesty hath or hereafter shall become entitled in right of his Crown by escheat or forfeiture.\u201d Never in any Act is such property spoken of or dealt with under the bald description of \u201cLands belonging to his Majesty.\u201d A distinction also was in statutory phraseology drawn between property known under the name of \u201cthe small branches of his Majesty\u2019s revenue\u201d and lands accruing to his Majesty by escheat or forfeiture. In 1st Wm. 4, c. 25, the revenues arising from all lands and personal property devolving upon the Sovereign in right of the Crown by escheat or forfeiture, as well as all revenues arising from \u201cthe small branches of his crown revenue\u201d are dealt with under the name and designation \u201ccasual\u201d revenues of the Crown, and henceforth under this term \u201ccasual revenue,\u201d the proceeds of all property, whether real or personal, devolving upon the Crown by escheat is dealt with by parliament.\nThe language of this Act 1st Wm. 4, appears to be abundantly ample to comprehend under its operation the territorial and casual revenues accruing to the Crown in the colonies, and in the conflict which arose between the colonial and Imperial authorities, for the purposes of obtaining for the colonies control over those revenues, certain of the Imperial authorities from time to time questioned the competency of the Crown to assent to any bill passed by the colonial assemblies affecting to deal with those revenues. In April 1837 as appears by Mr. Forsyth\u2019s work intituled \u201cCases and Opinions on Constitutional Law,\u201d p. 156, the then law officers of the Crown in England, Sir John Campbell, afterwards Lord Campbell, and Sir R.M. Rolfe, afterwards Lord Cranworth, in answer to a question submitted to them by Lord Glenelg, then Colonial Minister: \u201cWhether it is in point of law competent for his Majesty, with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Assembly of New Brunswick, to render the tracts of wildland in the colony which belong to his Majesty jure corona subject to the appropriation of the legislature of the province for a fixed period or in perpetuity in return for a civil list to be settled on the Crown for a similar term, or in perpetuity as may be thought best?\u201d gave it as their opinion that it was competent for his Majesty to make such appropriation of his hereditary revenues in the colony of New Brunswick.\nThe colony of New Brunswick possessed a constitution, not created by Act of the Imperial Parliament, as that of Lower and Upper Canada was, but created from time to time by the Kings of England in the exercise of their royal prerogative, the legislative authority in which, as in the Imperial Parliament, consisted of the Sovereign, acting with the advice and consent of a Legislative Council and Assembly, the limits of jurisdiction of such legislature not being prescribed by any written charter. Accordingly, in pursuance of this opinion and in the month of July, 1837, an Act framed upon the model of the Imperial Act, 1st Wm. 4th and prepared in England was passed by the legislature of New Brunswick, 8 Wm. 4th, c. 1, whereby after reciting that \u201chis most gracious Majesty had been pleased to signify to his faithful Commons of New Brunswick, that his Majesty would surrender up to their control and disposal, the proceeds of all his Majesty\u2019s hereditary, territorial and casual revenues, and of all his Majesty\u2019s woods, mines and royalties, now in hand, or which may hereafter during the continuance of this Act be collected in this province, on a sufficient sum being secured to his Majesty, his heirs and successors for the support of the Civil Government, in the province,\u201d\u2014it was enacted that the proceeds of all and every the said hereditary, territorial and casual revenues, and the proceeds of all sales and leases of Crown lands, woods, mines and royalties, which have been collected and are now in hand, or which shall be collected hereafter, during the continuance of this Act, except the monies which shall be expended in the collection and protection thereof, as specially provided for by the 4th sec. of this Act, shall immediately be payable and paid to the Provincial Treasurer, who is hereby authorized to receive the same for the use of the province; and from and after the expiration of this Act the proceeds of all the said hereditary, territorial and casual revenues, and of the said lands, woods, mines and royalties, shall revert to and be payable and paid to his said Majesty, his heirs and successors. The Act then granted a civil list of \u00a31,400, per annum, for 10 years, from 31st December 1836, when the Act should expire.\nThe 4th section above referred to provided for the payment of the expenses of management out of the gross revenues, and by the 6th sec. it was among other things enacted that nothing in the Act contained should extend or be construed to extend in any wise to disable his Majesty, his heirs or successors, to make any grant or restitution of any estate or estates, or of the produce thereof, to which his Majesty hath or shall become entitled by escheat for want of heirs, or by reason of any forfeiture, or by reason of the same having been purchased by or for the use of any alien, or to make any grant or distribution of any personal property devolved to the Crown by reason of the want of next of kin or personal representatives of any deceased person, and that the said rights and powers shall continue to be used, exercised and enjoyed in as full, free, ample and effectual manner to all intents and purposes as if this Act had not been made, and as the same had or might have been heretofore enjoyed by the Crown, it being the true intent and meaning of this Act that the said rights and powers shall not be in any degree abridged, or restrained or affected in any manner whatsoever, but only that the monies arising from the full and free exercise and enjoyment of them shall be carried to and made part of the joint revenues at the disposal of the General assembly of the province,\nThe provisions of this Act were re-enacted and made perpetual by Revised Statutes of N.B., title 3, ch. 5, sec. 7.\nThe connection in which the words \u201cCrown lands, woods, mines and royalties\u201d are used in this Act plainly shews that under these words is meant to be designated wholly different property from any accruing to the Crown by reason of escheat or forfeiture, and that the word \u201croyalties\u201d is intended to describe and cover merely monies, or part of the produce of mines, arising from lease or other disposition of mines. Upon the accession of her present Majesty the Act 1 and 2 Vic., c. 7, was passed which is identical in its terms with 1st Wm. 4, c. 25.\nThat the Imperial Parliament at the time of the reunion of the provinces of Lower and Upper Canada was determined not to vest in the Legislature of United Canada the same power and control over the Crown revenues in the province as the law officers of the Crown had in April, 1837, pronounced to be vested in the Legislature of New Brunswick appears from the Constitutional Act S & 4 Vic., c. 35. For the Imperial Parliament by that Act itself constituted a consolidated fund and a civil list for the province of United Canada and made a special disposition of the revenues at the disposal of the Crown, and restrained the Crown from assenting to any bill passed by the Legislative Council and Assembly, which should in any manner relate to or affect her Majesty\u2019s prerogative touching the granting of waste lands of the Crown within the province, until 30 days after the same should have been laid before both Houses of the Imperial Parliament, or in case either of the said Houses of Parliament should within the said 30 days address her Majesty to withhold her assent from any such bill. The clauses providing for a civil list, namely, the 52nd and 54th, enacted that out of the consolidated revenue fund there should be payable permanently to his Majesty, his heirs and successors \u00a345,000 for defraying the salaries of the Governor, Lieut-Governor, and of the Judges, and Attorney and Solicitor General, and the expense of the administration of justice, and during the life of her Majesty and for 5 years after the demise of her Majesty a further sum of \u00a330,000 for defraying the expenses of the civil government, and that during the time for which the said several sums were payable the same should be accepted and taken by her Majesty by way of civil list instead of all territorial and other revenues now at the disposal of the Crown arising in either of the said provinces of Upper Canada or Lower Canada, or in the province of Canada, and that three-fifths of the net produce of the said territorial and other revenues now at the disposal of the Crown within the province of Canada should be paid over to the account of the said consolidated revenue fund, and also during the life of her Majesty and for five years after the demise of her Majesty the remaining two-fifths of the net produce of the said territorial and other revenues should also be paid over in like manner to the account of the same fund.\nThe Legislative Assembly of the province persisted still in endeavouring to procure the recognition of the principle for which they contended, namely, that the colonial legislature should exercise the like control over the territorial and casual revenues of the Crown arising in the province as was exercised by the Imperial Parliament over the like revenues arising within the United Kingdom. Accordingly, in 1846, a bill passed the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of the province which, as coming within the provision of the Act of Union, was transmitted to England for the purpose of being laid, and was laid, upon the table of both Houses of the Imperial Parliament.\nBy this bill it was recited among other things as follows:\u2014\nWhereas your Majesty has been most graciously pleased to declare to your faithful Canadian Commons, in provincial parliament assembled, your Majesty\u2019s gracious desire to owe to the spontaneous liberality of your Canadian people, such grant by way of civil list as shall be sufficient to give stability and security to the great civil institutions of the province, and to provide for the adequate remuneration of able and efficient officers, in the executive, judicial and other departments of your Majesty\u2019s public provincial service, the granting of which civil list constitutionally belongs only to your Majesty\u2019s faithful Canadian people in their provincial parliament.\nThe bill provided for the establishment of a consolidated revenue fund for the province of Canada, in the same terms as had been provided by the 50th sec. of 3 & 4 Vic., c. 35. It then charged upon that consolidated fund permanently a sum not exceeding \u00a334,638 15s. 4d. cy, in lieu of the \u00ab\u00a345,000, by the 52nd sec. of 3 & 4 Vic., provided, and during the life of her Majesty and for 5 years after the demise of her Majesty, a sum, not exceeding \u00a339,245 16s. cy, in lieu of the \u00a330,000, by the same 54th section provided; and after making provision for alteration in the salaries to be attached to certain offices, it enacted that:\u2014\nDuring the time for which the said several sums mentioned in the said schedules, are severally payable, the same shall be accepted and taken by her Majesty, by way of civil list instead of all territorial and other revenues now at the disposal of the Crown, arising in this province, and that three fifths of the net produce of the said territorial and other revenues, now at the disposal of the Crown, within this Province, shall be paid over to the account of the said consolidated revenue fund; and also that during the life of her Majesty, and for five years after the demise of her Majesty, the remaining two fifths of the net produce of the said territorial and other revenues now at the disposal of the Crown within this province, shall also be paid over in like manner to account of the said consolidated revenue fund.\nBy the Imperial Act, 10 and 11 Vic., c. 71, her Majesty was authorized, with the assent of her Privy Council, to assent to the above bill, and it was enacted that if her Majesty, with the advice of her Privy Council, should assent thereto then the clauses numbered respectively from 50 to 57, both inclusive, of 3 and 4 Vic., c, 35, should be repealed upon and from the day on which the said reserved bill (being first so assented to by her Majesty in Council) should take effect in the province. The bill was subsequently assented to and became an Act 9 Vic., c. 114, of the provincial legislature.\nThe object of the provincial authorities in procuring the passage of this bill and the royal assent thereto as an Act of the provincial legislature, was to obtain the recognition of the principle so long contended for and which is set out in the above extract from the preamble, namely, that the Crown should owe the provincial civil list to the provincial Commons, and that in return therefor the Crown should surrender to the provincial legislature the same control and management of the territorial and casual revenues accruing to the Crown within the province as was exercised and enjoyed by the Imperial Parliament over the like revenues arising within the United Kingdom. To have greater control was never contended for. We can therefore, I think, affirm with great confidence that by the passing of the bill into an act the local legislature never contemplated obtaining, nor, by authorizing the Royal assent to be given to it, did the Imperial Parliament contemplate conferring, on the provincial legislature, any greater control over, or interest in, the revenues arising from property devolving upon the Grown by escheat or forfeiture, than was exercised and enjoyed in England by the Imperial Parliament over the like revenues there, under the 12th section of 1st Wm. 4, c. 25, and 1 and 2 Vic., c. 2, by which the jurisdiction was limited to the surplus or \u201cnet proceeds\u201d as they are called in the Canadian Act, and in 3 & 4 Vic., c. 85, of those revenues, after the full and free exercise by her Majesty of her royal prerogative of grace and bounty, as expressed in those sections; and yet it is certainly true that no section similar to the 12th section of the above Imperial Acts is inserted in 3 & 4 Vic., c. 35, or in the Canadian Act. This latter Act, however (if the question of her Majesty\u2019s right to have exercised in Canada such her royal prerogative of grace and bounty after the passing of that act and at the time of the passing of the British North America Act should be material to the determination of the question now before us) will have to be read in the light of three Imperial statutes subsequently passed, viz.; 15 & 16 Vic., c. 39, 17 &18 Vic., c. 118 and 28 & 29 Vic., c. 63. The same observation may be applied to the act of the legislature of Nova Scotia, passed in the year 1849, by which the territorial and casual revenues of the Crown arising in that province were surrendered to the provincial legislature. That Act, which appears to have been drafted by a draftsman of a peculiarly and indeed of an excessively cautious cast of mind, after providing for the surrender of all monies arising from the Crown lands, mines, minerals or royalties, of her Majesty within the province, proceeds to enact, so as to make assurance doubly sure, that \u201cso soon as the Act should come into operation all the right and title of her Majesty, whether in reversion or otherwise, of, in, to and out of all and singular the mines of gold, silver, coal, iron, ironstone, limestone, slate-stone, slate rock, tin, copper, lead and. all other mines and minerals and ores within the province, which by Indenture of lease, dated 25th August, 1826, were granted, demised, etc., by his late Majesty King Geo. 4 to the Duke of York for 60 years, at and under certain rents and renders therein contained, and also all rents and arrears of rent and returns due or to become due by virtue of the said lease, with all powers, rights and authorities, whether of entry for forfeitures, or breach of conditioner otherwise, in the said lease reserved or contained, and also all the estate, right and title of her Majesty, reversionary or otherwise of, in and to all such coal mines in the Island of Cape Breton, and to all such reserved mines at Plctou as were agreed to be demised by his said late Majesty at \u00a33,000 per annum to a company called the General Mining Association; and also the said \u00a33,000 and all other rents and reservations by the said agreement reserved or payable; and also all mines of gold, silver, iron, coal, iron stone, lime stone, slate stone, slate rock, copper, lead and all other mines, minerals and ores within this province, including the Island of Cape Breton of which the title is now in his Majesty, shall be, and the said several enumerated premises are hereby respectively assigned, transferred and surrendered to the disposal of the General Assembly of this province to and for such public uses and purposes as in and by any Act of the General Assembly for the time being shall be ordered and directed.\nFor the purpose of giving effect to this Act, two Acts were subsequently passed by the General Assembly of the province, the one to be found in the second series of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, chapter 27, intituled \u201cof The Coal Mines,\u201d and the other in the third series of the Revised Statutes, chap. 25, intituled \u201cof Mines and Minerals,\u201d in both of which the Legislature of Nova Scotia shews its understanding of the term \u201cRoyalties\u201d to be that which is ordinarily attached to it. By the 23rd section of the former Act it is enacted that \u201cthe royalties reserved under any lease granted in pursuance of this chapter shall not be less than those now paid by any party holding a lease under the Crown of any mines or minerals in this province, and by the 47 section of the latter Act it is enacted that on all leases of gold mines and prospecting licenses to search for gold there shall be reserved a royalty of three per cent. upon the gross amount of gold mined, by the 55 section that each licensed mill-owner shall separate from the yield or produce of gold of each lot or parcel of quartz as crushed, three parts out of every hundred parts of such yield as the portion thereof belonging and payable to her Majesty as royalty.\u201d\nBy sec. 69, \u201cThe lessee of each mine shall be liable for royalty, upon all gold obtained from his mine in any other way than from quartz crushed at licensed mills, but he shall be exempted from any claim in respect of gold obtained from quartz so crushed, the liability of the mill-owner for such royalty, being hereby substituted, instead of that of the lessee,\u201d and by sec, 102\u2014\u201cAll licenses and leases of mines and minerals, other than gold mines shall be subject to the following royalties to the Crown, to the use of the province on the produce thereof, after it has been brought into marketable condition, payable yearly from the period of their respective dates, that is to say\u2014of five per cent. on all such ores and minerals except gold, iron and coal\u2014of eight cents on every ton of iron and of ten cents on every ton of 2,240 lbs. of coal, which said royalties shall be paid to such person or persons at such times and in such places, as the licenses or leases shall respectively stipulate, or as the Governor in Council may from time to time direct.\u201d\nBy the Imperial Act, 15 and 16 Vic., c. 39, after reciting 1st Wm. 4th, c. 25, sec. 2, and 1st Vic., c. 2, sec. 2, and that from the time of the passing of the said Act of 1st Wm. 4th, the lands of the Crown in the colonies (save where special provision has been made in relation thereto by other Acts of parliament) have been granted and disposed of, and the monies arising from the same whether on sale or otherwise, have been appropriated by or under the authority of the Crown and by and under the authority of the legislatures of the several colonies as if the Acts 1st Wm. 4th, and 1st Vic., had not been passed, and whereas doubts have arisen whether the monies arising as aforesaid in the said colonies may not be considered hereditary casual revenues \u201cwithin the meaning of the said Acts, and whether all or any part of other revenues arising within the said colonies and being hereditary casual revenues within the meaning of the said Acts may be lawfully appropriated to public purposes for the benefit of the colonies within which they may have respectively arisen,\u201d and to remove such doubts it was enacted that,\u2014\n1st. The provisions of the said recited Acts in relation to the hereditary casual revenues of the Crown shall not extend or be deemed to have extended to the monies arising from the gale or other disposition of the lands of the Crown in any of Her Majesty\u2019s colonies or foreign possessions, nor in any wise invalidate or affect any sale or other disposition already made or hereafter to be made of such lands or any appropriation of the monies arising from any such sale\u2014or other dispositions which might have been lawfully made if such Acts or either of them had not been passed,\n2nd. Nothing in the said recited Acts contained shall extend or be deemed to have extended to prevent any appropriation which if the said Acts had not been passed might have been lawfully made by or with the assent of the crown of any casual revenues arising within the colonies or foreign possessions of the Crown (other than droits of the Crown and droits of Admiralty) for or towards any public purposes within the colonies or possessions in which the same respectively may have arisen, provided always that the surplus not applied to such public purposes of such hereditary casual revenues shall be carried to and form part of the said consolidated fund.\nFrom the debate which took place in parliament at the time of the passing of this Act, its object appears to have been to authorize the appropriation to colonial purposes of the Crown revenues in the colonies arising from waste lands or from mineral treasures, which the Acts of 1st Wm. 4 and 1st Vic. were regarded as appropriating to the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom, and to confirm the appropriations which had then already been made of those revenues by Acts of the colonial legislatures, and to make the above named Imperial Acts apply only to directing the appropriation to the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom of any surplus remaining after the application of whatever might be necessary for the advantage of the colony. What surplus there was expected to be after the appropriation by the colonial legislatures of what they should by Act of parliament assented to by the Crown declare to be necessary to be expended for the benefit of the colony, it is difficult to understand, but the Act expressly declares that such monies arising from such revenues as shall not be applied to the public purposes of the colony shall be carried to and form part of the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom. The Acts of 1st Wm. 4 and 1st Vic., being by this Act held to apply so far to such surplus monies arising from the surrendered Crown revenues within the colonies, it would seem but reasonable to hold that the proviso in the 12th section of those Acts which saves to the Crown the exercise of its prerogative royal of grace and bounty should apply also if the question was whether the Crown did or did not possess that prerogative right in Canada immediately before the passing of the British North America Act. There are moreover two colonial Acts of those referred to in the preamble of 15 & 16 Vic., c. 39, as disposing of the lands of the Crown in the colonies notwithstanding 1st Wm. 4 & 1st Vic., which it will be proper to refer to in this connection, namely, 4 & 5 Vic., c. 100, and 12 Vic., c. 31 of the Acts of the legislature of Canada. By the former of these Acts entituled \u201cAn Act for the disposal of Public Lands,\u201d after reciting that it was \u201cexpedient to provide by a law applicable to all parts of this province for the disposal of public lands therein,\u201d it was in the 2nd section enacted that except as thereinafter provided \u201cno free grant of public land shall be made to any person or person whomsoever,\u201d and by the latter, after reciting that it was expedient to amend and extend the provisions of the former Act as well as to remove certain doubts which had arisen as to the intention and meaning of some of the provisions of the said Act; and whereas by the 2nd section of the said Act it is enacted with certain exceptions hereinafter provided. \u201cno free grant of public land shall be made to any person or persons whomsoever; and whereas doubts have been entertained whether the same does not preclude her Majesty from the exercise of her royal grace in the relinquishment of her rights to escheats and forfeitures in favor of those near of kin or otherwise connected with the parties last seized thereof, and it is expedient to remove all such doubts,\u201d it was \u201cdeclared and enacted that the 2nd section of the said Act extends and shall be deemed to have at all times extended to such lands only as no patent deed had ever been issued for, and not to such as having been once granted by letters patent had subsequently become vested in her Majesty either by act of the party or by operation of law.\u201d\nWe have here a plain definition of the term \u201cpublic lands\u201d of the province as understood by the legislature, a term which has ever since been used and understood in the same sense, and from the preamble to this Act we can gather that the same legislature which recited as a reason for passing it, that it was desirable to remove doubts which had been entertained whether the 2nd sec. of 4 & 5 Vic. c., 100, did not preclude her Majesty from the exercise of her royal grace in the relinquishment of her rights to escheats and forfeitures in favour of those near of kin or otherwise connected with the parties last seised could never have intended by the Act of 9 Vic. c. 114 to preclude her Majesty from the like exercise of her royal grace; this Act in fact seems to involve a recognition of the right of her Majesty to exercise such right in the case of lands become escheated or forfeited in Canada, By the 6th sec. of 17 and 18 Vic., c. 118, which was an Act passed to empower the legislature of Canada to alter the constitution of the Legislative Council of that province, the restraint imposed upon the legislature of Canada by the 42nd sec. of 34 Vic., c. 35, was removed, that section was repealed, and it was enacted, notwithstanding anything in 3 and 4 Vic., c. 35 or in any other Act of Parliament contained, it should be lawful for the Governor to declare that he assents to any bill of the legislature of Canada or for her Majesty to assent to any such bill if reserved for the signification of her Majesty\u2019s pleasure thereon, although such bill shall not have been laid before the said Houses of Parliament, and no Act heretofore passed or to be passed by the legislature of Canada shall be held invalid or ineffectual by reason of its not having been laid before the said Houses or by reason of the Legislative Council and Assembly not having presented to the Governor such address as by the said Act of Parliament is required.\nBy 28 and 29 Vic., c. 63, sec. 2, intituled \u201cAn Act to remove doubts as to the validity of Colonial Laws,\u201d it was enacted that,\u2014\n\u201cAny colonial law which is or shall be in any respect repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament extending to the colony to which such law may relate, or repugnant to any order or regulation made under authority of such Act of Parliament, or having in the colony the force and effect of such Act, shall be read subject to such Act, order or regulation, and shall to the extent of such repugnancy, but not otherwise, be and remain absolutely void and inoperative.\u201d\nWe find then, that immediately preceding the passing of the British North America Act, all Acts of Parliament dealing with this subject, from 1st Wm. 4, dealt with it as forming part of the hereditary casual revenues of the Crown within the colonies which had been surrendered by the Crown provisionally in return for a civil list, in which revenues the Crown retained a reversionary interest, after the times named during which the civil lists contracted for were granted. We find also that the statute of the legislature of New Brunswick, which had dealt with the subject, specially reserved to the Crown the prerogative right of exercising the royal grace and bounty by making any grant or restitution of any property, real or personal, or the produce thereof to which the Crown should become entitled by escheat for want of heirs or next of kin, or by reason of any forfeiture as 1st Wm. 4 and 1st Vic. had done in England., and the first position taken by Mr. McDougall in his very able, argument as I understood it, was\u2014that the effect of that Act, as well as of several of the Imperial Acts above cited, was to maintain inviolate to the Crown the same exercise of the royal grace and bounty in respect of property devolving upon the Crown by escheat and forfeiture in Canada and Nova Scotia; the conclusion drawn being that the power of appropriation of the legislatures of the old provinces prior to confederation is to be regarded as affecting only so much, if any, of such revenues as should remain after the full and free exercise by the Crown of its prerogative right of making grant and restitution of all escheated or forfeited property or of the produce thereof (after deducting the expenses attending finding the property of the Crown) to any person having claims upon the person whose estate the escheated or forfeited property was, and that since confederation the exercise of such prerogative right cannot be interfered with by any provincial authority, or by provincial legislation. But the question, as it appears to me, is not whether before the passing of the B.N.A. Act, the Crown did or did not retain the royal prerogative right within the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but had the several legislatures of those provinces power of appropriation over escheated and forfeited property within these respective provinces\u2014that is to say, in other words, could the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Councils and Houses of Assembly of those respective provinces, have made any appropriation of those revenues as should seem fit to them, although different from what appropriation had already been made by legislation over such revenues accruing within those provinces respectively? And I think that in view of the long contention maintained by the Legislative Assembly of Canada upon the subject, which is so emphatically asserted in the preamble of the Canada statute 9 Vic., c. 114, which had been assented to by her Majesty upon the authority of the Act of the Imperial Parliament specially passed for that purpose, the position asserted in the preamble of the Canada statute must be taken to be admitted by the Imperial Act passed to give it effect, and in view of the provisions of 17 and 18 Vic., c. 118; and in view also of the practice which had become engrafted upon the colonial constitutions with the sanction of the Imperial Parliament, it cannot, I think, now be questioned, that the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, that is to say, her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Councils and Houses of Assembly of those respective provinces, had before the passing of the British North America Act power of appropriation over all the territorial and casual revenues of the Crown accruing within those respective provinces, whatever may have been contemplated by the equivocal reservation of the very contingent surplus which the Imperial statute, 15 and 16 Vic., c. 39, intended to appropriate to, and make part of, the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom.\nNow, that the British North America Act places under the absolute sovereign control of the Dominion Parliament all matters of every description not by the Act in precise terms exclusively assigned to the legislatures of the provinces, which by the 5th section of the Act are carved out of and subordinated to the Dominion, cannot, in my judgment, admit of a doubt. It was admitted by the learned counsel who represented the provinces in the argument before us, that this was true with respect to all matters of legislation, but it was contended that when the Act deals with \u201cproperty\u201d the rule was inverted and that the provinces take \u201call property\u201d not by the Act in precise terms given to the Dominion.\nThe sole foundation for this contention appears to me to be based upon an assumption which in my judgment is altogether erroneous, namely, that the British North America Act, transfers as it were the legal estate in the Crown property from the Crown and vests it in the Dominion and the provinces respectively as corporations capable of holding property, real and personal, to them, their successors and assigns for ever; but the Act contemplates no such thing; its design as to \u201cproperties,\u201d as to every thing else which is appropriated to the use of the provinces and therefore placed under the legislative control of the provincial legislatures, is to specify those properties which being still, as before, vested in the Crown shall be under the exclusive control of the provincial legislatures. And so likewise with respect to the properties assigned for the purposes of the Dominion\u2014control and management over property vested in the Crown for public purposes is what the Act deals with, not with the legal estate in such properties, divesting the Crown thereof and transferring the legal estate in some to the provinces and in some to the Dominion as corporations, and indeed what we are called upon to adjudicate upon, is a question directly affecting the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, namely, is or is not the Act of the legislature of Ontario, which professes to deal with the property in question which is admitted to have devolved upon her Majesty, jure coron\u0153 by escheat, ultra vires of the provincial legislature?\nNeither can it admit of a doubt, as it appears to me, that the jurisdiction which is expressly given to the provinces by the 12th item of sec. 92 of the Act over \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province\u201d can have no bearing whatever upon the question before us for, 1st, the property with which we have to deal is, unless the British North America Act by clear enactment makes it otherwise, property accruing to her Majesty jure coron\u0153, it therefore cannot be taken from the Crown except by express enactment. These words therefore \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province\u201d cannot affect the property of her Majesty. We must seek therefore in some other clause of the Act for authority to affect this property; and secondly, these words have no effect whatever to restrain the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament over property and civil rights in all the provinces, in so far as any of the matters comprised in the enumeration of subjects in sec. 91 of the Act requires control over \u201cproperty and civil rights in the provinces.\u201d Those words therefore must be construed as conferring upon the provinces jurisdiction only over the residuum of property and civil rights in the provinces, not absorbed by the jurisdiction over that matter involved in the complete and supreme control over the matters specially placed under the control of the Dominion Parliament. Now, among the items so placed we find \u201cthe public debt and property\u201d specially mentioned in the first item of sec. 91, and for payment of the public debt it is to be observed that the consolidated fund of the respective old provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (created by the British North America Act the Dominion of Canada) had been formed, and in this fund and as part thereof, as the \u201cpublic property\u201d appropriated to meet the public debt, was comprehended, as we have seen, the casual revenues of the Crown accruing within the respective provinces, in which casual revenues, as we have also seen, was comprised all property real and personal devolving upon her Majesty jure coron\u00e6 within the provinces, whether propter defectum sanguinis or propter delictum tenentis. Now, of this property so forming part of the revenues constituting the consolidated fund of the old provinces, which was the fund upon which the debts of those provinces were charged, we find a most plain and unequivocal appropriation made by the 102nd sec. of the Act, namely: \u201cAll duties and revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick before and at the Union had and have power of appropriation, except such portions thereof as are by this Act reserved to the respective Legislatures of the provinces or are raised by them in accordance with the special powers conferred on them by this Act shall form one consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the public service of Canada in the manner and subject to the charges in this Act provided,\u201d and among those charges in section 104 we find the general interest of the public debts of the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union.\nWe have here then, expressed in precise and unambiguous language, appropriation made of everything which formed part of the consolidated funds of the several provinces before confederation, (except what by the Acts is particularly and expressly excepted thereout and placed under the control of the legislatures of the provinces created thereby) for the formation of the consolidated fund of the Dominion of Canada, in return. for the assumption by the Dominion, (which the old provinces were erected into and created) of the public debts of those old provinces. The question is therefore simply reduced to this: does any other, and if any, What other part of the Act which constitutes the sole charter alike of the Dominion and of the provinces, except any, and, if any, what part of such consolidated fund of the Dominion of Canada from that fund, and place such excepted part under the control of the legislatures of the provinces. It is worthy of note here, in connection with what I have already said in relation to the argument as to the appropriation of property as distinct from \u201clegislative functions,\u201d that the excepted part, whatever it be and in whatever clause of the Act it is found, is spoken of as being \u201creserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces\u201d that is as matter placed under the legislative control of and not as estate vested in the provinces.\nNow, the only clause of the Act which can be contended to involve the exception referred to in the 102nd section is the 109th, namely:\u2014\nAll lands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the union, and all sums then due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals, or royalties shall belong to the several provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same.\nWe cannot, as I have already observed, read these words \u201clands, mines, minerals and royalties belonging to the several provinces of &c., &c., at the Union\u201d as meaning that the estate and property in those subjects shall be divested out of the Crown and be transferred to and vested in the provinces as corporations, but, inasmuch as this clause is to be read as expressing the exception out of the consolidated fund referred to the 102nd section, that these sources of revenue, constituting portions of the territorial and casual revenues of the Crown forming the consolidated fund of the Dominion of Canada, shall be excepted from the general appropriation of all revenues in that fund, and shall be regarded as the excepted parts which are by the 102nd section said to be \u201creserved to the respective legislatures of the provinces\u201d and placed under their control.\nNow, what lands, mines, minerals and royalties can with propriety, having regard to the manner in which those words have been used in other legislative language above quoted, be said to have belonged to the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union? None at all, it is plain, in any other sense than that the revenues arising from such properties belonging to the Crown had been made part of the consolidated funds of the old provinces now constituting the Dominion of Canada, for the public uses of these provinces. \u201cLands\u201d which had been already granted by the Crown and were at the time of the Union vested in the grantees thereof, or in their heirs or assigns, cannot with any degree of propriety be said to have been lands \u201cbelonging to the several provinces of, &c., &c., at the Union,\u201d and it is only such lands granted which could devolve upon her Majesty jure coron\u0153 by escheat and forfeiture, and for this reason it was that the legislature of Canada, which was the chief of the parties to the framing of the British North America Act and to the petition to the Imperial Parliament to pass it, and within the limits of which province the property now in question is situate, declared by 12 Vic., c. 31, that the term \u201cpublic lands\u201d in the province, which is but an equivalent expression to \u201clands belonging to the provinces at the Union\u201d did not comprehend lands accruing to the Crown by escheat or forfeiture, and that they did comprehend only the ungranted lands of the Crown in the province, in which sense they have ever since been understood.\nThese waste ungranted lands of the Crown, the revenues derived from which constituted part of the consolidated funds of the provinces before the Union, were, as we know, appropriated to the public uses of the provinces; but the lands so appropriated did not constitute all the ungranted lands of the Crown in the provinces. There were other lands of the Crown, the monies arising from the sale or other disposition of which did not form part of such consolidated funds; these lands were set apart and appropriated for the actual residence thereon and occupation thereof by certain Indian tribes by whom they were surrendered to and became vested in the Crown, and others were surrendered by the Indians to and vested in the Crown for the purpose of being granted by the Crown and that the monies arising therefrom should be applied for the benefit of the Indians. These lands are by item 24 of sec. 91, placed under the control of the Dominion Parliament. The custom in the grants by the Crown of these lands was the same as in the grants of all other Crown lands, namely, to reserve all mines and minerals, but the reservation thereof would accrue, as was provided with respect to the monies arising from the sale of the lands, to the benefit of the Indians for whose benefit the lands were set apart; such mines and minerals, or the royalties accruing from the disposition thereof, could not have been appropriated to the public uses of the provinces, the \u201clands\u201d therefore which are referred to in sec. 109 of the British North America Act can only be construed to mean those ungranted or public lands belonging to the Crown within the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the revenues derived from which before and at the Union effected by the British North America Act had been surrendered by the Crown and made part of the consolidated funds of the provinces; and the words \u201cmines, minerals and royalties\u201d being in the same 109th sec. added to the word \u201clands,\u201d this latter word must there be construed in a limited sense, that is to say, as exclusive of the \u201cmines and minerals\u201d therein, which, if those words had not been added, the word \u201clands\u201d might have been sufficient to comprehend, but the section \u201dreserves for the legislatures of the provinces,\u201d not only the mines and minerals, and royalties in or arising out of such lands but also \u201call mines and minerals, and royalties\u201d belonging to the several provinces of &c., at the Union\u2014that is to say, not only all mines and minerals in the ungranted lands of the Crown in the several provinces the revenue derived from which had been surrendered to and made part of the consolidated funds of the provinces for the respective uses of the provinces, but also all mines and minerals in the granted lands and which by the grants had been reserved by the Crown, the revenues derived from which had been also made part of the said consolidated funds: the intention, however, of the 109th sec., was to \u201creserve for the legislatures of the provinces,\u201d created by the British North America Act, not only the \u201clands, mines and minerals\u201d as above described, but also the monies accruing to the Crown by way of royalties in mines already being worked under leases or licenses from the Crown, (which monies had also been appropriated to and formed part of such consolidated funds,) of which there were many in Nova Scotia, to regulate which, as we have seen, Acts had been passed by the legislature of that province: the word \u201croyalties\u201d therefore was added\u2014the whole thus comprising all \u201clands\u201d being the ungranted lands of the Crown as they were accustomed to be granted, the revenue derived from the sale of which had been made part of the said consolidated funds, and \u201call mines and minerals,\u201d as well those in such lands as also in all lands already granted, the revenues from which mines and minerals had been appropriated in like manner, and \u201cthe royalties\u201d derived from such mines and minerals, or (to which may be added) from timber cut upon public lands, under licenses for that purpose, which had also been in like manner appropriated, and all monies then, that is, at the Union, due and payable for any of such lands, mines, minerals and royalties, these words mines, minerals and royalties being used all in their natural and ordinary sense, and in the sense in which they were used in the above quoted statutes of the province of Nova Scotia relating to \u201cmines and minerals.\u201d We have thus a plain, simple, rational and natural construction put upon the clause in which these words, constituting the exception referred to in sec. 102, are found, and which accords with the provisions of all of the above quoted Acts relating to the same subject, and with the sense in which the same words are used in some of those Acts.\nBy giving to the words in the 109th section their plain, natural and ordinary construction, we need not resort to the construction pressed upon us by the learned counsel for the provinces, which I must say appears to me to be strained and unnatural and to have been put forward as expressing what, in the opinion of those learned counsel, should have been the disposition made in the British North America Act by the framers thereof, rather than what has been made, of property accruing to the Crown by escheat or forfeiture. It is with this latter point alone that we have to deal. In view, however, of the disposition attempted to have been made of the property in question by the legislature of the province of Ontario, in derogation of the claims of the woman who had lived for so many years with the deceased as his wife, and of the young man their son who, though illegitimate, had been brought up by the deceased as, and with the expectations of, a son and under the name of the deceased, and in derogation also of the right of her Majesty to exercise her prerogative of grace and bounty to repair the wrong done to those injured persons, who to all seeming, though not in law, filled the places of wife and son of the deceased (a prerogative which in like cases had never been known to fail), we may be permitted to venture the opinion, that those may be excused who doubt whether the placing the claims of such persons under the control of the local legislatures would have been more prudent in any sense, or more calculated to promote the interests of justice and humanity, and to procure redress of the wrongs of the parties already cruelly injured by perhaps the unintentional accident of the deceased having died without a will, or best adapted to advance the real good of the public, than to leave the matter still to be dealt with by her Majesty as it had always hitherto been for the protection of the injured, controlled only by the legislative authority vested in her Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Parliament of the Dominion. For the reason, however, already given I entertain no doubt that control over all property in the several provinces of the Dominion becoming escheated or forfeited to the Crown is placed under the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament by the 102nd section of the British North America Act, and that no other clause or part of the Act exempts such property from such disposition,\u2014the Act therefore of the province of Ontario, 40 Vic., c. 3, which affects to deal with such property is ultra vires and void, and the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs.\nAs it did not appear to me to be necessary for the determination of the question before us, I have not followed the learned counsel in all their adverse criticism of the frame of, and of the expressions used in, the British North America Act. I may, however, say that it is not, in my opinion, justly chargeable with the defects imputed to it, or open to the construction put upon it by the learned counsel who represented the provinces. In my judgment it expresses in sufficiently clear language the plain intent of the framers of that Act to have been, that the plan designed by them of federally uniting the old provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, was, to confer upon the Dominion so formed a quasi national existence\u2014to sow in its constitution the seeds of national power\u2014to give to it a national Parliament constituted after the pattern of the Imperial Parliament, her Majesty herself constituting one of the branches thereof, and to constitute within that national power so constituted and called the \u201cDominion of Canada,\u201d certain subordinate bodies called provinces having jurisdiction exclusive though not \u201cSovereign\u201d over matters specially assigned to them of a purely local, municipal and private character, to which provinces, by reason of this juridiction being so limited, were given constitutions of an almost purely democratic character, of whose legislatures her Majesty does not, as she does of the Dominion, and as she did of the old provinces, constitute a component part, and to the validity of whose Acts, the Act which constitutes their charter does not even contemplate the assent of her Majesty as necessary. The jurisdiction conferred on these bodies being purely of a local, municipal, private and domestic character, no such intervention of the Sovereign consent was deemed necessary or appropriate, so likewise the power of disallowing Acts of the provincial legislatures is no longer, as it was under the old constitution of the provinces, vested in her Majesty, but in the Governor General of the Dominion in Council, and this is for the purpose of enabling the authorities of the Dominion to exercise that branch of sovereign power formerly exercised by her Majesty in right of her prerogative royal, but to be exercised no longer as a branch of the prerogative, but as a power by statute vested in the Dominion authorities (the royal prerogative being for that purpose extinguished) and to enable the Dominion authorities to prevent the legislatures of the provinces, carved out of and subordinated to the Dominion, from encroaching upon the subjects placed under the control of the National Parliament by assuming to legislate upon those subjects which are not within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures.\nThe Appeal must be allowed with costs, the order overruling the appellants demurrer to the information filed by the Attorney General of the province of Ontario in the Court of Chancery of that province discharged, the demurrer allowed and the said information dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McDougalls and Gordon.\nSolicitors for respondent: Edgar, Ritchie and Malone.\n[1] 1 W.

While plaintiff was a prisoner at the police station, the defendant went to plaintiffs boarding house and saw his wife, read to her a telegram and demanded and obtained from her money she had in her possession, telling her that it belonged to the bank and that her husband was in custody.\nIn an action for assault and false imprisonment and for money had and received, the defendant pleaded, inter alia, that the money had been fraudulently stolen by the plaintiff at the city of New York, from the bank, and was not the money of the plaintiff; that defendant as agent of the bank, received the money to and for the use of the bank, and paid it over to them. Several witnesses were examined, and the plaintiff being examined as a witness on his own behalf did not, on cross-examination, answer certain questions, relying, as he said, upon his counsel to advise him, and on being interrogated as to his belief that his doing so would tend to criminate him, he remained silent, and on being pressed he refused to answer whether he apprehended serious consequences if he answered the question proposed. The learned judge then told the jury that there was no identification of the money, and directed them that, if they should be of opinion that the money was obtained by force or duress from plaintiff's wife, they should find for the plaintiff. Held (Henry, J., dissenting), that the defendant was entitled to the oath of the party that he objected to answer because he believed his answering would tend to criminate him.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], sustaining a verdict given in favor of the respondent, who was plaintiff below.\nThe following was the case settled for appeal to the Supreme Court:\u2014\nDECLARATION.\u2014Thomas Ellis, by Charles W. Weldon, his attorney, sues Nicholas Power for money payable by the defendant to the plaintiff, for money received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff, and for money payable by the defendant to the plaintiff; for interest upon money due from the defendant to the plaintiff and forborne at interest by the plaintiff to the defendant, and at his request.\nAnd the said plaintiff, by leave of a judge for this purpose first had and obtained, also sues the said defendant for that the said defendant assaulted the said plaintiff and compelled him to go to a police station, and there imprisoned and kept him in prison for a long time, whereby the plaintiff suffered great pain of body and mind, and incurred expense in obtaining his liberation from the said imprisonment; and the said plaintiff claims ten thousand dollars.\nPLEAS.\u2014\"The defendant, by S. R. Thomson, his attorney, as to the first and second counts of the declaration, says that he never was indebted as in these counts alleged.\n\"And for a second plea, as to the first count of the declaration, the defendant says that he received the money in that count mentioned as the agent of the National Park Bank of New York, and for the said National Park Bank of New York, and not otherwise, whereof the plaintiff then and there had notice; and that after having so received the said money, and before the commencement of this action, he, the said defendant, paid the same over to the said National Park Bank of New York, and that ever since such payment, the defendant has had and now has no possession or control of the said money in the said first count of the said declaration mentioned, or of any part thereof. \"And for a third plea, as to the said first count of the declaration, the defendant says that the money in that count mentioned had been feloniously stolen by the plaintiff at the city of New York from the National Park Bank of New York, and in fact was the money of the said bank and not the money of the plaintiff, and thereupon the defendant, as the agent of and acting for the said bank, received the said money to and for the use of the said bank and not otherwise, and afterwards and before the commencement of this action, he, the said defendant, paid the said money over to the said National Park Bank of New York, and that since such payment the said defendant has never had any possession, use or control of the said money in the said first count mentioned, or of any part thereof.\n\"And the defendant, as to the third count of the said declaration, says that he is not guilty.\n\"And for a second plea, to the said third count of the declaration, the defendant says that the plaintiff, before the alleged trespass and imprisonment in that count mentioned, at the city of New York, United States of America, had feloniously stolen and carried away a certain large sum of money, to-wit, the sum of $30,000 from a certain banking corporation, doing business in the city of New York aforesaid, and called the National Park Bank of New York; and that the plaintiff, after having so feloniously stolen the said money, immediately thereafter fled from the United States, and came with the said identical money so by him feloniously stolen as aforesaid still being in his possession, into the city of St. John, in the Dominion of Canada, and then actually had in his possession at the city of St. John aforesaid, the said money so stolen, or a large part thereof, contrary to the provisions of the Act of the, parliament of Canada in such case made and provided. Whereupon the defendant, then knowing the premises, and by reason thereof having reasonable and probable cause for suspecting and suspecting that the plaintiff was the person who had so feloniously stolen the said money at the city of New York as aforesaid, and that he the said plaintiff, feloniously and contrary to the provisions of the said Act, had then, in the city of St. John or elsewhere in Canada, the said money so feloniously stolen as aforesaid, or a part thereof, took the plaintiff into custody and brought him to the police station in the said city of St. John, and there delivered him into the custody of the police magistrate (who had jurisdiction over the said offence) and of the policemen there, to be dealt with according to law in respect of the premises; and that after having so caused the said plaintiff to be imprisoned in the said station house, he, the said defendant, had nothing more to do with him the said plaintiff; which are the alleged trespasses and imprisonments in the said third count mentioned, and not otherwise.\"\nJOINDER\u2014\"The plaintiff joins issue on the defendant's first, second, third, fourth and fifth pleas.\"\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff, and damages assessed on the first count $5572, and on the second count $200.\nA rule nisi for a new trial having been granted was subsequently discharged and the postea delivered to the plaintiff. The present appeal was from this decision.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the head note, and the judgments hereinafter given. RITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nOne of the grounds urged for a new trial was that the judge on the trial allowed the plaintiff to refuse to answer certain questions on cross-examination, on the ground that the plaintiff was privileged and not bound to answer the questions put. This is what took place:\u2014\n\"Thomas Ellis\u2014I am the plaintiff. In November, 1876, I gave to my wife $4,500\u2014$100 greenback notes, $300 in Canadian money, in the boarding house at Mrs. Thompson's; she had other Canadian money; I got the $4,500 from James W. Fisher two or three days before I left New York; I got $900; six or seven in forty-nine, $100; the $4,500 I gave to my wife, being part of the $4,900; I requested Fisher to purchase $200 in Canada money; I gave $300 American money; it was part of what my brother-in-law gave.\n\"Cross-examined by Mr. Thomson\u2014I left New York on the evening of 21st October, 1876; all questions outside of this I will answer at the proper time.\n\"Were you the paying teller of the National Park Bank on that day? Obj.\n\"(Mr. Palmer contends that the witness is not bound to answer this question.)\n\"Witness says\u2014I rely upon my counsel to advise me.\n\"Were you the paying teller of National Park Bank? Obj. On what ground do you decline to answer that question?\n\"(Judge\u2014I have to allow the witness to exercise his own discretion; if he is of opinion these questions will affect him criminally, or in any way as to the charge set up in these pleas, he is not bound to answer the questions regarding the National Park Bank, or any stealing therefrom, as charged in the plea).\n\"Will you answer? Do you believe that by answering my question that in so doing it would tend to criminate you? \"(Judge\u2014The witness need not answer, but if you are of that opinion, it will by answering tend to criminate on the charge, you need not answer, but may decline doing so.)\n\"(The witness remains silent.)\n\"I shall follow you step by step until you do answer my questions. Do you apprehend serious consequences if you answer my question? Witness\u2014I respectfully decline answering that question.\n\"(Judge\u2014I decide the witness if he believes the question if answered by him will tend to criminate him in stealing from the National Park Bank, he is not bound to answer.)\"\nIt is not necessary to discuss or decide whether the rule broadly laid down by Lord Cranworth, in the case of The King of the Two Sicilies v. Wilcox[2], that the privilege does not extend to crimes committed in a foreign country for which the witnesses may be liable to be there prosecuted, or the more limited rule as laid down by Lord Chelmsford in U. S. v. McRae[3] should prevail, because in this case the defendant was, without reference to where the crime was committed, entitled to the oath of the party that he objected to answer, because he believed his answering would tend to criminate him, more particularly as the plaintiff, having in his direct examination sworn positively that he got the money from James W. Fisher two or three days before he left New York, and Fisher swearing that the money was the proceeds of a draft drawn by the First National Bank, and which money he got from the First National Bank in New York, and this being the money handed by plaintiff to his wife, if his evidence and contention is true, this could not have been the money stolen from the National Bank of New York, and there could have been no offence in reference to this money in New Brunswick, nor indeed, so far as the evidence goes, in New York; and therefore it was all important that the court should have the witness's oath, as it would be impossible for the judge, assuming the witness and Fisher's statement to be true, to conclude that any pertinent question relating to this money in controversy could criminate the witness.\nI think, therefore, in this case the defendant was entitled to have the oath of the witness that he believed his answer would tend to criminate him. The privilege of protection belongs to the witness, he may in the discretion of the judge be cautioned, but it is for the witness to claim the protection of the court on the ground that the answer would tend to criminate himself, and if there appears reasonable ground to believe that it would do so, or rather if there are no other circumstances in the case to induce the judge to believe that the answer would not have that tendency, he is not compellable to answer.\nIn Webb v. East[4] it was held that a party to an action who objects to the production of a document for inspection, on the ground that it may tend to criminate him, must make the objection on oath.\nStephen, J., referred to Boyle v. Wiseman[5].\nCounsel:\u2014\"Admitting that the defendant may be called as a witness by the plaintiff, and obliged to state on oath his objection to produce these documents, this is an interlocutory proceeding to which no such rule applies.\"\nKelly, C. B.:\u2014\"I am clearly of opinion that there is no distinction between preliminary proceedings and those before a judge and jury, as to the position of a party to an action who objects either to the production of a document or to any other mode of obtaining evidence, directly or indirectly, on the ground that the evidence may tend to criminate him. In every such case the objection must be taken by the party himself, and supported by his oath.\"\nStephen, J., concurred.\nMr. Taylor sums up the law thus[6]: \"On the whole, as Lord Hardwicke once observed, these objections to answering should be held to very strict rules, and in some way or other the court should have the sanction of an oath for the facts on which the objection is founded.\"\nSTRONG, FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, J.J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.: \u2014\nI am sorry to differ from my colleagues on this question. The pleas to this action set up; [the learned judge read the pleas][7].\nIn this case the judge had the evidence before him, he saw whether the notes belonged to the National Bank of New York, or the plaintiff, and was in a position to know whether the answer to the question might incriminate him. Where the pleas and the opening of counsel make it clear that the question put to the witness is for the purpose of obtaining such an answer as would subject the witness to be incriminated, I do not think he is obliged to answer. I go further, and I maintain that the authorities go this far\u2014that if the answer to the question will incriminate the witness, the judge has a right to interpose and tell him, as the judge did in this case, that if he thinks the answer will incriminate him he need not answer, and the witness was right in not answering. As to the question whether the answer might incriminate him in the United States or New Brunswick, this cannot alter the position. The defence here was that the plaintiff brought the notes taken from his wife from the United States, and that they were the identical notes stolen. This, if proved, was an offence indictable in New Brunswick under the Dominion Criminal Statutes, and, if on that issue, plaintiff had been found guilty, it would be sufficient for the taking of such steps as would lead to his incarceration. I think, under all these circumstances, it was not necessary for him to answer the questions put to him. It is true, he may be guilty of larceny, but this fact alone is not sufficient to destroy all the rules of evidence in criminal matters, and, in my opinion, it is more important that they should be preserved and let a guilty person escape the punishment he might have otherwise have been subjected to.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI agree that there has been a miscarriage in this case, arising in some measure, as I think, from the fact of two very different causes of action, involving different considerations, having been tried at the same time, without the attention of the jury having been sufficiently drawn to the points involved in each. I agree also that the cross-examination of the plaintiff was prematurely interrupted, and he should have been required to pledge his oath expressly that his reason for declining to answer questions put to him on cross-examination was that he believed that his answers, if given, would tend to convict him of the felony charged. That appears to me to be the rule as established by the recent decisions[8]. I am of opinion, however, that independently of this point there has been a miscarriage, by reason of misdirection in the manner in which the case was left to the jury. The learned judge told the jury that there was no evidence whatever of identification of the money, and he directed them that if they should be of opinion that the money was obtained from Mrs. Ellis by force or duress they should find for the plaintiff. No distinction is drawn in this charge between the two different species of action. Now, as to the action of assault and false imprisonment, the manner in which the money was gotten from Mrs. Ellis had nothing whatever to do, and as to the action for money had and received, as well as to the action for false imprisonment, there was undoubtedly much evidence given on the part of the defence as to identification of the money with money feloniously taken, which should have been left to the jury to express their opinion upon. The circumstances of the case were indeed of such a nature as peculiarly to have called for a submission of the case to the jury in such a manner as to leave them at full liberty to draw their own inferences and to form their own opinion as to the degree of credibility to be attached to the evidence of all the witnesses.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for appellant: S.

Because the defendant was charged with four distinct offences of obtaining money by false pretences, which could not be joined in the same indictment;\n\"2ndBecause the indictment had been preferred, without any of the preliminary formalities required by sec. 28 of the Act 32 and 33 Vic, c. 29, respecting procedure in criminal matters having been observed, and namely that it had not been preferred by the direction of the Attorney General or Solicitor General of the province of Quebec, or of a judge of this court, or of any judge of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, having jurisdiction, and without any preliminary investigation before a magistrate, and without the prosecutor having been bound by recognizance to prosecute the defendant or give evidence against him, and without the defendant having been committed to stand his trial upon the said charge, or detained in custody, or bound over on recognizance to answer the said indictment.\n\"This motion was supported by affidavit; I rejected it, intimating at the time that as I had some doubts, principally on the second objection urged, I would reserve the case should the defendant be convicted.\n\"The defendant was tried on the 26th of October last, and acquitted on the first and second counts, but found guilty on the third and fourth counts, laid in the indictment.\n\"The evidence adduced at the trial, was that on the 25th of September last, the defendant sold to Thomas Preddy and James Heaton, two persons recently arrived , in the country, a pass issued by The Gran1 Trunk Railway Company in favor of A. Carey, and one, entitling the said A. Carey and another to travel on The Gran1 Trunk Railway from Montreal to Port Huron, up to the 30th September now last past, and another pass issued by The Chicago 8c Grand Trunk Railway Company in favor of A. Carey, and one entitling the said A. Carey and another to travel on The Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway from Port Huron to Chicago from date to 27th August, 1S80, which last pass was then out of date by effluxion of the time for which it had been issued he the defendant, representing to the said Freddy and Heaton, that these passes were valid and would entitle them to be conveyed from Montreal to Chicago, by the Grand Trunk Railway and by the Chicago &r Grand Trunk Railway respectively, while it was proved that these passes were of no value to the said Freddy and Heaton, as the first pass, which was not transferable, could only be used by A. Carey and another person travelling with him, and the time for Using the second pass had already expired. The price paid for the two passes was twenty dollars, of which ten dollars were of the moneys of Thomas Preddy, and ten dollars of the monies of fames Heaton, the whole amount however being paid through Freddy.\n\"The passes were not shown to Heaton and Freddy until after they had paid the money, and they were then informed that one of them would have to pass by the name of A. Carey, to which no objection was taken; both Preddy and Heaton swore that they did not understand what this meant, until they read the condition that the passes were not transferable, after leaving defendant's store.\n\"I reserved the sentence and the defendant is now on bail to appear before the Court of Queen's Bench on the appeal side, and also at the criminal term on the 24th of March next.\n\"I now beg to submit, for the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench, the following questions :\n\"1st. Whether the Atorney-Greneral could delegate his authority, to direct that the indictment in this case be laid before the grand jury and whether the direction as given on the indictment, was sufficient to authorize the grand jury to enquire into the charges and report a true bill.\n\"2nd.

A. Dorion,\n\"Chief Justice.\"\nThe Court of Queen's Bench held that the conviction on the indictment was good, and from this judgment the accused Levi Abrahams appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Doutre, Q.C., appeared on behalf of the appellant, and Mr. C. P. Davidson, Q. C. on behalf of the respondent.\nThe points and authorities relied on by counsel fully appear in the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench ([1]), and in the judgments of the Supreme Court hereinafter given\nRITCHIE, C. J. (alter reading the reserved case):\u2014\nIn acting under this statute the Attorney or Solicitor- General or Judge as the case may be exercises what is in the nature of a judicial function, he is judicially to decide whether the indictment is proper to be presented to or found by the grand jury, so that, while on the one hand the rights of the public are to be guarded, individuals are to be protected from (as Cockburn, C. J., in Queen v. Bray ([2]) says) \u201cthe abuse of the right of prosecution, by proceedings instituted either vexatiously or from corrupt or sinister motives;\u201d and the duty of exercising this judicial discretion when the prosecutor or other person presenting an indictment has not been bound by recognizance to prosecute or give evidence, or where the person accused has not been committed to or detained in custody, or has not been bound by recognizance to appear to answer an indictment to be preferred against him, is vested in the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General or Judge to be by them personally exercised; \u201cthe circumstances,\u201d as Cockburn,C. J., in the same case, says, \u201cunder which the direction shall be given, having been left entirely within the discretion of one or other of these officers; and with the exercise of which the court will not interfere.\u201d The Queeu v. Heane ([3]), shows that where an indictment has been preferred without either of the three conditions mentioned having been performed, the matter may be brought before the court on affidavit after plea pleaded, and the indictment may in the discretion of the court be quashed, or the party on doubtful case be left to his writ of error.\nI think therefore, this being a special statutory power it must be strictly pursued; the propriety of sending a bill before the grand jury having been confided to the judgment and discretion of the Attorney-General he cannot extend the provisions of the act and delegate to the judgment and discretion of another the power which the legislature has authorized him personally to exercise, no power of substitution having been conferred. In the present case it is admitted that the Attorney-General gave no directions with reference to this indictment; that the gentlemen who put the indorsement on the indictment did do so merely because they were representing the crown at the criminal term of the Queen's Bench in Montreal under a general authority to conduct the crown business at such term, but without any special authority over or any directions from the Attorney General in reference to this particular indictment. Under these circumstances the indictment in this case, having been presented to and found by the grand jury without any compliance with the provisions of the statute, must be quashed.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER AND TASCHEREAU, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe prosecution in this case rests entirely upon a statute, and the legislature have thought it proper to declare that an indictment for obtaining money by false pretences, can only be laid before the grand jury by direction of the Attorney General or Solicitor-General, or upon the authority of a magistrate after a preliminary investigation, or some other person having a judicial function to perform. It is clear that there is no authority in the statute authorizing the Attorney-General to delegate this power to another. In this case there is no evidence of any directions whatever, except the simple fact that the Attorney-General authorized these gentlemen to represent the Crown in criminal prosecutions during the then following term, and on this they pre-pared this indictment and submitted it to the grand jury. It has been considered that in a certain number of these cases individuals should not be annoyed by the abuse of the right of prosecution, and for that reason the legislature has thought proper to allow the Attorney-Greneral, Solicitor-General, or Judge, as the case may be to judicially decide whether the indictment should be laid before the grand jury. The words of the statute are clear, and I concur with the Chief Justice in holding that the conviction should be set aside:\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nI entertain no doubt that the true construction of the words in the 28th sec. of 32 and 83 Vic. ch. 29, namely: \" Or unless the indictment for such offence is preferred by the direction of the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General for the province,\" is precisely what the words literally express, namely, that the direction shall be in the particular case made by one of those officers of the government and not by another person, who may be appointed to conduct, for the time being, criminal prosecutions upon the part of the Crown. The intention, I am of opinion, was that cases of the description mentioned in the section should be first enquired into before a magistrate, except in cases of emergency, when the discretion of the Attorney-General, or of the Solicitor-Greneral, as officers responsible to the public, might be substituted. One of the offences mentioned is that of conspiracy, which might be to commit a state offence, and which might require the exercise of much discretion and secrecy of investigation to ensure a conviction, and in such case the public interests might require that the responsible law officers of the Crown should be given a discretion as to preferring or not preferring an indictment. But whether the offence charged be one of this nature or any other of the misdemeanors mentioned in the section, the intention of the legislature, I have no doubt, was that no indictment for any of those offences should be preferred to or entertained by a grand jury, unless upon the authority of a magistrate, after a preliminary investigation, or upon the authority and express direction of one of the responsible, law officers of the Crown, whose responsibility could not be delegated to another, or upon the authority of a judge of a court having jurisdiction to try the offence.\nNow, in this case, a motion was made to quash the indictment upon the ground of its having been found without any of the prescribed authorities (having been presented to the grand jury upon the authority of the Queen's Counsel prosecuting at the court on behalf of the Crown). The indictment ought to have been quashed for the cause assigned, and the court having reserved for the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench, whether it should or not be quashed, that court should have given judgment to quash it, and the appeal therefore must be allowed.\nAppeal allowed.\nAttorneys for appellant: Doutre & Joseph.\nAttorney for respondent: L.

J., and Strong, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nSlander\u2014Public Officer\u2014Privileged Communication.\nThe appellant, D., having been appointed Chief Post Office Inspector for Canada, was engaged, under directions from the Postmaster General, in making enquiries into certain irregularities which had been discovered at the St. John Post Office. After making inquiries, he had a conversation with the respondent, W., alone in a room in the post office, charging him with abstracting missing letters, which respondent strongly denied. Thereupon the assistant-postmaster was called in, and the appellant said: \"I have charged Mr. W. with abstracting the letters. I have charged Mr. W. with the abstractions that have occurred from those money letters, and I have concluded to suspend him.\" The respondent having brought an action for slander, was allowed to give evidence of the conversation between himself and appellant. There was no other evidence of malice. The jury found that appellant was not actuated by ill-feeling toward the respondent in making the observation to him, but found that he was so actuated in the communication he made to the assistant postmaster.\nHeld, on appeal, 1st. That the appellant was in the due discharge of his duty and acting in accordance with his instructions, and that the words addressed to the assistant postmaster were privileged.\n2. That the onus lay upon respondent to prove that the appellant acted under the influence of malicious feelings, and as the jury found that the appellant had not been actuated by ill-feeling, the respondent was not entitled to retain his verdict, and the rule for a non-suit should be made absolute.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick discharging a rule nisi for a non-suit or verdict for appellant, pursuant to leave, reserved or for a new trial.\nThe action was for slander. The plaintiff (respondent) was a clerk in the post office at St. John. The defendant (appellant) was connected with the Post Office Department at Ottawa and had been sent to St. John to make' enquiries about some letters missing at the St. John post office. The declaration contained several counts. The first count contained a conversation between the plaintiff and defendant, the latter charging the plaintiff with the missing letters, and the plaintiff strenuously denying it. The other count contains the words: \"The defendant addressing Mr. Woodrow, the assistant postmaster at St. John, said, 'I have charged Mr. Waterbury with abstracting the letters.' 'Mr. Woodrow, I have charged Mr. Waterbury with the abstractions that have occurred from those money letters, and I have concluded to suspend him'.\"\nThe defendant pleaded \"not guilty\" and a special plea setting up that the words used were used by the defendant in the course of his duty as Chief Post Office Inspector, &c.\nTo this plea the plaintiff demurred and joined issue, the demurrer was first argued, judgment was given and the plea held bad, on the ground that under the Post Office Act the Governor General had no power to appoint a chief inspector, and that the defendant could not therefore legally act as such.\nThe issues of fact under the plea of \"not guilty,\" were afterwards tried before Weldon, J.\nThe evidence was to the following effect: \"After making enquiries, &c., defendant felt satisfied in his own mind that the plaintiff was the guilty party, and on the 19th July, 1875, he called the plaintiff into a room by himself and then charged him with having abstracted the letters, using substantially the words charged in the third count of the declaration. No one was present at the time but the plaintiff and defendant, and the door was shut. The plaintiff denied the charge. The defendant opened the door and called in Mr. Woodrow, the assistant-postmaster at St. John (the postmaster himself being absent) and spoke to Mr. Woodrow the words charged in the first and second counts of the declaration. The door was open and clerks were in the next room, but there was no evidence that any one heard.\"\nIt was agreed at the trial that the court should reserve leave to enter a non-suit, or verdict for defendant on any grounds on the whole case subject to this reservation.\nThe judge charged the jury to find for the plaintiff, and assess the damages, but to answer the following questions:\n\"1. Do you find the words charged in the first count of the declaration, spoken in the presence of Mr. Waterbury, addressed to Mr. Woodrow, heard by any other person?\n\"2. Was the defendant, Dewe, actuated by ill-feeling towards Mr. Waterbury in making the observations he did to him, and also in the communication he made to the assistant-postmaster, Mr. Woodrow?\n\"Supposing the words used and charged in the declaration were privileged, did the defendant believe he had reason for using the language to the plaintiff which he did, or did he use the language from a wrong motive and not from a sense of duty?\"\nTo the first question the jury answered, \"That they find no evidence presented that any other person heard the words spoken by Mr. Dewe in making the communication to Mr. Woodrow, but that Mr. Dewe used no precautions to prevent the words being heard by other persons, the door being left open to the general room.\"\n\"2. The jury find the defendant was not actuated by ill feeling towards Mr. Waterbury in making the observation to him, but find he was in the communication he made to Mr. Woodrow.\"\nThe jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff with $6,000 damages.\nThe defendant during the next term moved for a non-suit or verdict for defendant, or a new trial. (1.) Upon the points reserved at the trial. (2.) Misdirection of the learned judge: 1. In not directing the jury that the alleged slander was a privileged communication and there was no evidence of malice. 2. Not directing the jury that the alleged slander was a privileged communication made by the defendant in course of his duty, and that even if malice proved, defendant was not liable. (3.) Improper admission of evidence. Admission of conversation between plaintiff and defendant. (4.) Verdict against evidence. (5.) Excessive damages.\nThe rale nisi was granted, subsequently argued, and discharged by Wetmore and Fisher, J. J., Weldon, J., dissenting.\nThis appeal was from the judgment discharging this rule and from the judgment on demurrer to the defendant's special plea.\nMr. Lash, Q. C., for appellant:\nAppellant's authority to make the investigation and do what is complained of was fully proven. The authority of the Crown to appoint servants exists, I contend, independently of any statute, and the evidence shows that Mr. Dewe was appointed as chief inspector by Order in Council, 25th May, 1870. Then, again, it is in evidence that Mr. Dewe was acting under the special instructions given him for this particular case, and not even under 31st Vic., c. 10, can this authority be questioned, for by the 15th sec. certain powers are given to the deputy head, which, being ministerial powers, could be delegated to his officers under that act. The point, therefore, to be decided must be, not whether Mr. Dewe had authority, nor even a question of the propriety of what he has done, but whether he acted bon\u00e2 fide: Tench v. Great WesternRwy. Co.[1].\nNow, the jury have found that Mr. Dewe did not act with malice when he suspended the respondent, If so, how can it be said he acted with malice by communicating his decision to the assistant postmaster, to whom it was his duty to communicate such decision. The question of privilege is one of law, and not for the jury. See Dawkins v. Lord Paulet[2]. This being the case, the onus was thrown on plaintiff to show there was malice. McIntyre v. McBean et al[3]. There was no publication of the words charged in the second count, they having been addressed to the defendant only with no one else present, and I submit they were privileged communications.\nAs to the demurrer to the second plea, the judgment of the court below is entirely based upon the ground that there was no power in the statute to appoint post office inspectors to hold inquiry into missing money letters, and that his duties and powers were allegations of law which were not supported. I submit the allegation of duty is a question of fact and not of law at all. If it is admitted that Dewe's appointment is valid, then the plea must be held good, but if the court is prepared to say Mr. Dewe's appointment is not valid, then the demurrer is good. See also Clark v. Molyneux[4].\nMr. Tuck, Q. C., for respondent:\nAs to the question of demurrer, it is too late, the judgment has not been entered up, and it seems to me to be quite immaterial.\nThe first important point is whether Mr. Dewe had authority to act. There can be no pretence that he was an officer under the 14th section of 31st Vic., c. 10, for another man held that office at St. John. Then there were no instructions according to the Act, no duty shewn for post office inspectors to make charges, or rather to slander; but it is contended that Mr. Dewe was an officer of the Post Office Department, with instructions, and that he was acting in accordance with his instructions. Surely the learned counsel cannot mean the defendant had instructions to enter into the agreement he proposed to make with plaintiff to compound the supposed felony, or to falsely proclaim he had positive proof of the plaintiff's guilt, and that he would prosecute him. Nor can he mean the defendant had instructions to publish of the plaintiff, on any occasion he chose, that the plaintiff had stolen money; if the learned counsel meant that, he is mistaken, for the fact is as the jury have found.\nThen as to malice:\n1. The defendant did not shew the slighest reasonable evidence of the plaintiff's guilt, and therefore, as a question of law, he failed to show any reasonable or probable cause for his charge, and the want of reasonable and probable cause is always evidence of malice.\n2. The statements he made were not only untrue but untrue to his own knowledge; when he stated to Waterbury and McMillan \"that he had positive proof of the plaintiff's guilt, and that if he did not confess he would prosecute,\" he was stating what he must have known was a deliberate falsehood, and this is sufficient evidence of malice for the jury. Defendant's offer to compound the felony, which offer he had the effrontery to swear on the stand he intended to carry out if the plaintiff confessed, is of itself not only strong evidence of malice, but, if true, is in law a malicious motive.\nThe law as laid down is, that if a party makes a charge of felony with any other object than the prosecution of the felony, this is malice.\nThen there being a case for the jury, was there any misdirection?\nIn Stevens v. Sampson[5], Lord Coleridge says: \"To establish that a communication is privileged two elements must exist; not only must the occasion create the privilege, but the occasion must be made use of bon\u00e2 fide and without malice. If either of these are absent the privilege does not attach.\"\nThe plaintiff contends in the present case that both these elements are absent, for bona fides is wanting and malice exists, and there is no occasion shewn for speaking the words.\nMr. Lash, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, G. J.-:\u2014\nIt is admitted no action can be sustained for the matters alleged in the third count of the declaration, because no one was present at the time in the room when the alleged slanderous words were uttered, and 'the door was shut, and there was therefore no publication. The first and second counts are as follows:\u2014\n(1.) David H. Waterbury, by Acalus L. Palmer, his Attorney, sues John Dewe. For that before and at the time of the committing of the grievances hereinafter mentioned, the plaintiff was clerk and employee in the Civil Service of Canada, and as such employed in the post office in the city of Saint John, and was in receipt of a large salary from his said office; and the defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of the plaintiff in relation to his said office and the plaintiff's employment therein, and the doing his duty and conducting himself therein, the words following, that is to say: \"I have charged Mr. Waterbury (meaning the plaintiff) with abstracting the letters meaning thereby that the plaintiff had feloniously abstracted and stolen letters out of the said post office, whereby the plaintiff was injured in his credit and lost his said office, and his character and reputation was injured.\n(2.) And also for that the said defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of the plaintiff, of and concerning the matters aforesaid, the words following, that is to say: \"Mr. Woodrow, I have charged Mr. Waterbury (meaning the plaintiff) with the abstractions that have occurred from those letters, and I have concluded to suspend him,\" thereby meaning that the plaintiff had been guilty of abstracting and feloniously stealing money from letters, whereby the plaintiff lost his office and suffered in his character and reputation.\nTo this declaration defendant pleaded the general issue, and a special plea setting up substantially that the words were used by the defendant in the course of his duty as chief post office inspector. To this plea plaintiff demurred and joined issue. The demurrer was argued, and the court held the plea bad.\nThe issue of fact under the plea of \"not guilty,\" (under which the whole defence was open) was afterwards tried before Weldon, J., and a jury, and a verdict found for plaintiff for $6,000. It was agreed at the trial that the court should reserve leave to enter a nonsuit or verdict for defendant on any grounds on the whole case subject to this reservation. The defendant moved to enter a non-suit or verdict for defendant. A rule nisi was granted and subsequently discharged by Judges Wetmore and Fisher, Weldon, J., dissenting.\nThe plaintiff was a clerk in the post office in St. John, New Brunswick. Money had been abstracted from letters passing through New Brunswick to Nova Scotia. Plaintiff was chief post office inspector for the Dominion, appointed by Order in Council, 25th May, 1870, and in October assumed the duties, and thenceforth continued to act and was acting as such at the time of the trial, and had, he says, general and special duties all over the Dominion, instructions being given him by the deputy postmaster general, and he had instructions from him regarding missing letters, and was directed by him, when he visited St. John in the course of his duty, to make inquiries respecting them, having been made aware money had been abstracted from letters passing through the post office in New Brunswick. When he visited St. John he was recognized by both the postmaster and the inspector, and in fact by plaintiff himself, as the general inspector for the Dominion, and as clothed with authority from the post office department to inquire into all matters connected with these missing letters, and letters from which money had been abstracted. He, together with the inspector for New Brunswick, made a minute investigation in reference thereto, and the result appears to have been, to lead his mind to the conclusion that the plaintiff was the person implicated in the abstraction, and having arrived at that conclusion, he had an interview with plaintiff alone, in which he appears to have endeavored to extract from him a confession of his guilt.\nDefendant gives this account of it:\nI was aware money had been abstracted from letters through the post office. What words I used to Mr. Woodrow had reference to that fact. I had, in my own mind, positive proof\u2014I don't say legal proof. Whether you thought you had positive proof? I thought I had; but not legal proof. I may have said to Mr. Waterbury I had positive proof; I won't be certain. I put it pretty strongly to him. As I told you, I had not legal proof, but I was satisfied in my own mind. I might not be able to prove it. I did believe I had proof, but not legal proof. I told him I should prosecute the matter to the end, and would make every possible exertion as far as possible. I told him if he would confess I would not prosecute, and I intended not to do so. I thought it was better to clear the matter up; I did not want to establish my own reputation. I will take what convinces me.\nAs to this interview, the jury have found that defendant was not actuated by ill-feeling towards Waterbury in making the observations to him at that time. Not obtaining any confession from plaintiff, the assistant postmaster was called in and the defendant addressed to him the words complained of, and directed the deputy postmaster to take charge of the stamps and money in plaintiff's office, and put another clerk in charge of them. The inspector at St. John recognized the defendant's authority, and Mr. Dewe as his superior officer, and he says:\nJohn McMillan:\u2014I reside in St. John; am post office inspector for the district; was so in 1875. My attention was called for abstracting money from letters. I enquired into it. It was dealing with letters passing through New Brunswick to Nova Scotia; only three cases to New Brunswick; these came to my notice in 1874 and 1875 in the registration office, three clerks, Potter, Rankin and Waterbury; the full enquiry was made by me. The monthly return is made to the department; I sent it very shortly after the end of the month. When Mr. Dewe came down here I informed him fully all that had occurred. I consulted with him on this time, and we acted in concert. Mr. Dewe and I went over the different cases of registered letters. We went over the ground of every letter had. The three clerks were those I have named. I removed Mr. Rankin from the room while this enquiry was going on. We had a conversation, and Mr. Dewe was to see Mr. Waterbury alone. I can't say he used the words as they were communicated to me. Mr. Waterbury was suspended. I knew the suspension took place. I state that Mr. Dewe is my superior officer, and I was aware of the supension.\nCross-examined by Mr. Palmer:\nQuestion. Did you know that Waterbury was suspended at the time he was suspended?\nAnswer. When he was first suspended I was not there.\nQuestion. Did Mr. Dewe do this without reference to you?\nAnswer. I did not control him, he is my superior officer. I consider him so. Mr. Dewe controlled me; I. did not control him. I was not present. I was in concert in the investigation and knew he was to have an interview with Mr. Waterbury. I did not control him, we consulted together in the matter. I knew Mr. Dewe suspended Waterbury, and my information was from him. I have no recollection of Mr. Dewe communicating to me what he was going to do, or the language he used. I have no recollection of Mr. Dewe telling what he would do. Upon the investigation we made up our minds that the plaintiff had abstracted the money. I was there soon after he was suspended.\nRe examined:\nIn all the matters Mr. Dewe consulted me. I was at the post office soon after the suspension; the conversation, when I went in, was about the stamps. Waterbury, Dewe and Woodrow were in Mr. Howe's room, and his suspension was done with my approval.\nJames Woodrow, the assistant postmaster, like McMillan, recognized Dewe's authority and acted on his orders. He says:\u2014\nI was in the post office department in 1875, as assistant postmaster. John Howe was postmaster, when absent I had charge. In July, 1875, Waterbury was clerk, he was one of the clerks in the registry office department. The records of the post office were burnt. Mr. Dewe came in and asked for Mr. Howe. I told him he was not in. After talking with me he directed me to call Mr. Waterbury in. I made arrangements about his department, and told Mr. Waterbury he was wanted by Mr. Dewe. They went in my room, and I went out and walked about, I heard voices, but could not hear what was said. I was re-called after a while. When I came to the door Mr. Dewe said: \"I have charged Mr. Waterbury with abstracting money from registered letters.\" This is the man, and said something about suspending; he said: \"You will suspend him.\" I did suspend him and put a person in charge.\nHere, then, we have this officer acting, I think, within the scope of the duties of his office as inspector, and under special instructions from the post office department, making inquiries into the matter of the abstraction of money from letters. Can it be possible that the Crown and the department are so utterly helpless that they can employ no person but the Inspector of the district to inquire into matters of this kind? Surely, when a felony has been committed in a particular office, it is the duty of the department to cause investigation to be made; and persons engaged in such investigation, when acting within the scope of the authority with which they are clothed and without malice, are privileged in the communications with post office officials who are subordinate to them and bound to obey their instructions, as the inspector and deputy postmaster did. The suspension in this case, though communicated to the officer who was to see it carried out by the defendant, was with the approval of the local inspectors, and therefore may be considered as much his act as that of the general inspector.\nI think the law is very clear on this subject. It is for the judge to rule whether the occasion creates privilege. It is clear that defendant was de facto, and I think de jure, in the discharge of a public duty, and the words were spoken while in the discharge of that duty and in reference thereto, to a subordinate officer having a corresponding duty, and therefore were privileged; that being so, it is equally clear that the burthen of proof was on the plaintiff to shew actual malice.\nThere was no evidence in this case whatever that the defendant was actuated by motives of personal spite or ill will; and the occasion and surrounding circumstances repel the presumption of malice. Therefore, I think the evidence in this case clearly establishes that the occasion created the privilege, and that the occasion was used bon\u00e2 fide and without malice.\nThe plaintiff having therefore given no evidence of malice, it was the duty of the judge to say that there was no question for the jury, and to direct a non-suit or a verdict for the defendant.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI have no difficulty in determining that the defendant was a duly authorized officer of the post office department, under section 14 of the Act 31 Vic., c. 10. By that section, it is enacted that\nThe Governor may, from time to time, appoint fit and proper persons to be and to be called post office inspectors, and to be stationed at such places, and to exercise their powers and perform their duties and functions within such limits, respectively, as he may, from time to time, appoint.\nI find nothing in this provision to interfere with the power of the Governor General to appoint an inspector with authority to act anywhere within the Dominion, that is to say, with powers co-extensive with the limits of the Dominion. There is nothing in the language of this clause making it obligatory to restrict the office to any particular portion of the Dominion; the language is permissive, not imperative. Therefore, in my opinion, the Order in Council of the 25th May, 1870, constituted a valid appointment of the defendant as chief inspector for the Dominion. By section 15 of the same act provision is made for the appointment of a deputy postmaster general who, it is enacted, Shall have the oversight and direction of the other officers, clerks, messengers or servants, and of all persons employed in the postal service, and shall have, under the postmaster general, the general management of the business of the department, and his directions shall be obeyed in like manner as the directions of the postmaster general would be, subject however to the control of the latter in all matters whatsoever.\nThe defendant acted under express directions from the deputy postmaster general in what he did in reference to the investigation at St. John, which resulted in the dismissal of the plaintiff, for the reasons given in the words which are complained of by the plaintiff as defamatory. The deputy postmaster general, a ministerial officer, could legally delegate his functions derived under the large statutory powers conferred by the 15th section of the Act referred to, and, therefore, in this view of the case, irrespective altogether of the 14th section and the appointment under the Order in Council, the defendant was an authorized officer of the department and acted de jure in the communication he made to Mr. Woodrow, on the occasion of the dismissal of the defendant.\nAgain the statute 31 Vic., c. 10, organizing the post office department, is not a disabling, but rather an enabling statute. It authorizes the Governor General to appoint officers, and may be considered as implying an undertaking by parliament to provide salaries for officers appointed in accordance with its terms. But it contains nothing taking away from the Governor General the authority which the Crown can always exercise without parliamentary sanction, subject only to a provision for the payment of salaries by parliament, of appointing any officers it may deem necessary for the administrative service of the Dominion, and of defining and regulating their duties. So that at common law, irrespective of and apart from the statute altogether, the defendant was an officer of the Crown, having authority to act as he did in making the charge complained of and in dismissing the plaintiff from the public service, The consequence is that the communication made by the defendant to Mr. Woodrow the deputy postmaster at St John, which is complained of by the defendant as defamatory, was made by a public officer within the scope of whose authority it was to make it to another public officer, to whom it was material the reasons for the dismissal of one of his subordinate officers should be made known, and on a proper occasion, viz.: at the time of the subordinate's suspension from duty, and as the ground for that suspension. We have here, then, all the essentials of a privileged communication.\nThen the decided cases, the latest and most authoritative of which is that of Clark vs. Molyneux[6], clearly establish that it is the duty of the judge at the trial, upon the privileged character of the communication being established, to nonsuit the plaintiff, or to direct a verdict for the defendant, unless the plaintiff gives evidence of actual malice. The Chief Justice has already pointed out that in the present case there was an entire absence of evidence of express malice. There was therefore, in my opinion, nothing to leave to the jury, and the learned judge who presided at the trial should have non-suited the plaintiff or directed a verdict for the defendant, as he doubtless would have done had he not been bound to adopt the course which he followed by the previous decision of the court in banco on the demurrer.\nIt is true that the jury have found, in answer to a specific question left to them by the judge, that the defendant did not act bon\u00e2 fide in making the charge against the defendant. This, however, cannot affect the case, for in the view which Clark vs. Molyneux requires us to take that question was erroneously left to the jury. In Clark vs. Molyneux[7], the privileged character of the defendant and of the occasion on which he had written the letter alleged to be a libel having been established, Baron Huddleston, after directing the jury that the occasion was privileged, left this question to them:\nDid the Defendant write the letter and make the statement bon\u00e2 fide, and in the honest belief that what he wrote and said with reference to the plaintiff was true, or was he actuated by feelings of malice towards the plaintiff?\nThe Court of Appeal composed of Bramwell, Brett and Cotton, Lds. J.J., unanimously held that there had been misdirection. They say in effect that it was for the judge to say if the statement complained of was within the scope of the defendant's duty, and whether the person to whom it was made had an interest in having the communication made to him; and these conditions being established, good faith, belief in the truth of the imputed misconduct, and honest motive on the part of the defendant, ought to have been presumed, and the burden of proof rested on the plaintiff to show mala fides or express malice, and they held the direction wrong as casting the onus on the plaintiff to establish bona fides. That case, which is the latest exposition of the law on this subject, is directly in point, and entirely supports the judgment of Mr. Justice Weldon on the argument of the rule to enter a non-suit, which ought, in accordance with the view which that learned judge propounded, to have been made absolute.\nAs regards the cause of action set up in the third count, which relates to what passed at the private interview between the plaintiff and defendant, there was clearly no publication.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and judgment entered for the plaintiff on the demurrer, and that the rule nisi in the court below should be made absolute to enter a non-suit as regards the issues on the first and second counts.\nHENRY, J.\nI do not only concur in the view taken by my learned brothers as to the legality of the appointment of Mr. Dewe as post office inspector, but I go further, and say it was not absolutely necessary in this case to prove the appointment.\nThe action for slander is based on malice. Now, in this case the appellant proved that in making the investigation, he was acting with the authority of the government, and that was sufficient to show he was acting, in the first place, at all events, without malice. Under the instructions he had received, it was his duty to make enquiries as to the missing letters, and it was his duty, also, to suspend any person in the employment of the post office he bon\u00e2 fide suspected of being the guilty party. The course the post officer pursued in this case, I admit, was harsh, for the respondent, although admitted to have been innocent, has lost his situation, but under the law applicable to slander, I regret it is quite out of the power of this court to give him any redress. The law as laid down by the Chief Justice and my brother Strong is very clear. It makes such communications privileged, and if the appellant acted bon\u00e2 fide, and thought he was doing right, he is protected. Under such circumstances, it was for the plaintiff to show actual malice, and that he did not do.\nIn the case of Clark v. Molyneux[8], the law is laid down in these words:\nIn an action for libel, where the occasion is privileged, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the statements complained of were made from an indirect motive, such as anger, or with the knowledge that they were untrue, or without caring whether they were true or false, and not for the reason which would otherwise render them privileged, and if the defendant made the statements, believing them to be true, he will not lose the protection arising from the privileged occasion, although he had no reasonable grounds for his belief.\nThat is the law. I consider it, therefore, insufficient in this case that the evidence raises in our minds a probability of malice. In the absence of evidence of express malice, directly or circumstantially shown, no action will lie.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nGWYNNE J.:\u2014\nFrom the report of the learned judge who tried this case, it is apparent that, in submission to the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick upon the demurrer to the plea, the case was submitted to the jury as one in which it was concluded, as matter of law, that the defendant was not entitled to be regarded as having uttered the words complained of upon a privileged occasion; and having regard to the agreement made at nisi prius, and to the circumstances attending the making of that agreement, the rule in the court below should be made absolute for entering a non-suit, if the plaintiff has not proved such a case as entitles him to retain the verdict which has been rendered in his favor, assuming the case to be one in which the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the defence which was relied upon, namely, that the words complained of were uttered only upon a privileged occasion.\nThe learned judge says:\nI told the jury that, as the court held the Post Office Act did not authorize the appointment of a chief inspector, I must make my charge conform to that judgment, and the defendant was acting without authority. Had he been chief inspector, he would have been privileged, and as the plaintiff had consented that a non-suit should be entered if he had not made out a case, I should direct them to find a verdict for the plaintiff, and ask them to answer certain questions.\nWhen at the close of the plaintiff's case, the learned counsel for the defendant moved a non-suit upon the ground, among others, that the only evidence of the slander which was offered related to a privileged occasion, it appears by the learned judge's notes that the plaintiff's counsel objected that no such attempt to set aside the judgment of the court upon the demurrer to the plea should be entertained, and thereupon the agreement was made that the defendant should have the privilege of entering a non-suit upon all grounds moved or any other, and the case was left to the jury as above. Now, the grounds of non-suit urged were firstly, that there was no sufficient evidence of any publication of the words complained of; secondly, that if there was, the occasion was privileged; and thirdly, that there was no evidence of malice.\nThe question arises upon the first and second counts of the declaration, for, as to the third count, it is admitted that no action lies in respect of the matters alleged in that count, for that what is there set out took place wholly in a private interview between the plaintiff and the defendant. To the charges in the first and second counts, which are substantially the same, and as follows: that the defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff in relation to his office as a clerk in the post office department, these words: \"I have charged Mr. Waterbury with the abstractions which have occurred from those letters, and I have concluded to suspend him,\" thereby meaning &c., &c., the defendant pleaded, firstly, the general issue of not guilty, and, secondly, a plea, the gist and substance of which is that the words complained of were spoken on a privileged occasion in the bon\u00e2 fide belief by the defendant that he was acting in the discharge of a public duty\u2014it is to be observed that the matter alleged in this plea was matter which was equally available to the defendant under the plea of not guilty, so that there was no necessity for raising the defence specially by a formal plea. The plaintiff, besides replying to this plea that \"the words were spoken not in discharge of any duty, but of actual malice, and with full knowledge that the words so spoken were false,\" matter which he could give in evidence upon a joinder in issue to the plea of not guilty to displace the defence of privileged communication, also demurred. Upon this demurrer the court held the plea to be bad, for the reason that, in the judgment of the court,\nThe Post Office Act 31 Vic., ch. 10 did not mention such an office as \"Chief Inspector of the Post Office Department,\" and that therefore the plea did not state facts necessary to enable the court to say that the defendant spoke the words complained of, in discharge of his duty, but that, on the contrary, the plea showed that the defendant was not the officer whose duty it was, under instructions from the Postmaster General, to make the enquiry mentioned in the plea.\nIn support of this judgment, the court relied upon the judgment in Brown v. Mallet[9], which decides that where a declaration states certain facts, and alleges that thereupon it became the duty of the defendant to do certain acts, such allegation is to be taken merely as an averment that the duty resulted from the facts previously alleged, and not as an averment of the existence of the duty as a matter of fact, irrespective of the facts previously alleged. In applying that case as the governing case upon the demurrer, the court, as it seems to me, misconceived the gist and substance of the plea, which does not profess to set up any duty as resulting in law from previously alleged facts, but which alleges as matter of fact, that the defendant was acting as an officer of the post office department (whether the name given to his office, of \"chief inspector,\" was or not the proper name to be attached to it was wholly immaterial), and that, upon the occasion of speaking the words complained of, he was, as matter of fact, acting and used the words in the bon\u00e2 fide discharge of what was, or what he believed to be, his duty\u2014all this was matter of fact averred, not matter of law to be adjudicated upon as such by the court\u2014although, as it seems to me, it was irrelevant whether the name attributed by the defendant in his plea, to his office, namely \"chief inspector,\" was or not a proper name to be attributed to the defendant's employment in the department of the post office, still, I confess I cannot see any objection to His Excellency the Governor General, under the 14th section of the Act 31 Vic., c. 10, attributing duties to one of the post office inspectors named in that section which would place him above all other inspectors, as chief inspector, or to the postmaster general assigning to any post office inspector the duty of making the enquiries which the defendant in his plea alleges he was making as to the loss of valuable letters upon the occasion of his using the language complained of. The judgment of the court therefore, upon the demurrer to the plea, was, in my judgment, erroneous; but as the same defence and reply thereto was open under the joinder in issue upon the plea of not guilty, as was involved in the special plea and in the issue joined upon the replication in fact thereto, the question of privilege remained as open upon the trial of the general issue as if there had been no special plea or judgment upon the demurrer thereto. The judge at the trial acted in deference to the judgment of the court upon the demurrer contrary to his own opinion. The agreement, however, made at nisi prius enabled the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in term, to render the judgment which, under the circumstances appearing at the trial, ought to have been rendered there, and the like course is open to this court upon this appeal. Upon the question of privileged occasion, I have nothing to add to the judgment of Mr. Justice Weldon, which appears to me to be sufficiently exhaustive upon that point, and where the occasion is privileged the established rule is that the onus lies upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendant, in doing what is complained of, was actuated by an improper motive; that he acted, not from a sense of duty, but under the influence of malicious feelings, that in fact he cloaked his malice under the pretence of acting under a sense of duty; and if there be no such evidence there -is nothing to submit to a jury. I can see nothing in the evidence to warrant the submission to the jury in this case, of any question as to the absence of a bon\u00e2 fide belief by the defendant that he was acting in the discharge of a public duty, or which would justify a finding of actual malice concealed under the cover of a pretence of duty. The jury, in answer to one of the questions submitted to them by the learned judge, have found that the defendant was not actuated by any ill-feeling towards the plaintiff in what passed between them in the private interview, of which evidence was given by the plaintiff himself, although it was in the course of that conversation that the proposition was made, which was relied upon as indicating actual malice under the cover of a pretence of duty, namely, the proposition that, if the plaintiff would admit the truth of the charge, there should be no further action taken in the matter. If there was no ill feeling towards the plaintiff in what passed at this interview, the communicating the result at which the defendant had arrived to the superior officer of the plaintiff in the office in which the plaintiff was employed, which was clearly a privileged communication, and indeed a duty, could not give a cause of action. In the presence of the finding of the jury, to the effect that in what passed at the interview in the course of which that proposition was made, the defendant was not actuated by ill feeling towards the plaintiff, the sole ostensible ground upon which the action could be attempted to be sustained is removed; and as the agreement at the trial was to the effect that, if the plaintiff was not entitled to retain his verdict upon the evidence given, a non-suit might be entered, the rule should be made absolute in the court below for a non-suit in accordance with that agreement, and a rule also should be issued, for judgment for the defendant on the demurrer to the plea.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant: Harrison & Burbidge.\nAttorney for respondent: C.

S. died, leaving the respondent his executor, who proved the will before the note matured. The note fell due on the 8th May, 1879, and was protested for non-payment, and the bank, being unaware of the death of S., addressed notice of protest to S. at Toronto, where the note was dated, under 37 Vic., c. 47, sec. 1 (D)[1]. The appellants, who knew of S\u2019s death before maturity of the note, subsequently took up the note from the bank, and, relying upon the notice of dishonor given by the bank, sued the defendant.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the holders of the note sued upon when it matured, not knowing of S\u2019s death, and having sent him a notice in pursuance of sec. 1, c. 47, 37 Vic., gave a good and sufficient notice to bind the defendant, and that the notice so given enured to the benefit of the appellants.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The action was commenced by the appellants against the respondent on the 10th of April, 1879, to recover the sum of $500, due by the respondent as the executor of James Stewart, endorser of a promissory note, made by one Margaret Purdy to the appellants.\nThere was but one count in the appellants\u2019 declaration, viz.: The statutory count against the endorsers.\nThe respondent pleaded among other pleas, that there had not been due notice of the dishonor of the note.\nThe case was tried at Toronto by Mr. Justice Cameron, without a jury, and a verdict entered for the defendant on this plea. This verdict was sustained by the majority of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the judges were equally divided for and against the ap- pellants, and so the judgment of the majority of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was allowed to stand.\nThe note was made and dated at Toronto, November 5th, 1878, payable four months after date, and was therefore due on the 8th of March, 1879. On this latter date it was protested for non-payment by the notary of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Toronto, and notices duly mailed to Mrs. Margaret Purdy (the maker), Toronto; Mr. James Stewart (endorser), Toronto; Messrs. Cosgrave & Sons (appellants), Toronto.\nJames Stewart died on the 5th of December, 1878, one month after the note was made, and three months before it fell due, and the respondent is the executor of James Stewart.\nStewart did not designate under his signature on the note his Post Office address, which appears to have been Lansing, a village near Toronto.\nNeither the Bank of Commerce nor their notary knew of the death of Stewart when the note matured, and the notice of protest was on the 8th of March, 1879, addressed to Stewart at Toronto, pursuant to 37 Vic. c. 47, sec. 1.\nMr. O\u2019Sullivan for appellants:\nThe sole contention in this case is in reference to the third plea: had the respondent due notice of dishonor of the note in question? It is admitted that neither the bank, who were the holders of the note for value, nor the notary, knew that the indorser was dead when the note fell due on the 8th of March, 1879. They gave a sufficient notice to bind the indorser and his representatives, and such notice enures for the benefit of all parties[2].\nThe appellants purchased the note for value from the bank, and they are entitled to all the remedies which the bank could claim. The American case relied on by the court below of Beale v. Parrish[3], I think, is quite distinguishable from this case. The plaintiffs in that case misled the owners of the note. Of course, if the bank had inquired from the appellants and they had misled them, it would be a different case. But this was not the case, and I submit no authority can be found which will show that it was the duty of appellants to go and inform the bank that the endorser was dead.\nThe learned counsel relied on Bigelow on Bills[4]: Ex parte Baker in re Bellman[5]; Merchants\u2019 Bank v. Birch[6]; Beats v. Peck[7].\nBy the Civil Code of Lower Canada, art. 2328 notice of protest sent to the residence, or usual place of business of a deceased endorser, is good, and this taken in conjunction with the provisions of 37 Vic., c. 47, sec. 1, would render the notice sent in the present case good, wherever the code is in force. In the absence of direct English or Upper Canadian authority, this is an argument in favour of their contention.\nDr. McMichael, Q.C., respondent:\nThe question for the consideration of the court is, whether the notice addressed to Mr. James Stewart, Toronto, after the death of James Stewart (Toronto never having been his place of residence and not being his last place of abode, and not being the post-office nearest to his last place of abode), was sufficient to charge his executor. Previous to the Act of 1874, cap. 47, sec. 1, it would not have been sufficient. That statute altered the law in this respect.\nHad Stewart been alive at the time the notice was sent, the notice would have been sufficient by virtue of the statute, because it would have been addressed to the party to the note entitled to the notice, to the place where the note was dated. But it cannot be said that a deceased man was the man entitled to such notice, and there being at the time such notice was given an executor, he was the party entitled to the notice and it should have been addressed to him. If the statute was not complied with, then the usual principles as to notice must prevail.\nThe appellants had knowledge of the death of the party, and it was their duty to let the bank know or send notice themselves and not rely on the statute, which could not avail them. The appellants, who were subsequent endorsers, had knowledge, and not giving it to the holder, they cannot avail themselves of a notice given by the bank. For when the bank was paid, the contract with the bank was at an end, and the whole thing is transferred to the other endorser, who must rely on his rights; and the common law provides that notice must be sent to the executor unless the party is ignorant of his death.\nThe argument may be summed up thus:\nThe statute does not repeal or displace the rules of the common law. It declares that the taking certain steps shall be regarded as compliance with it. These steps have not been taken, and therefore the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and liabilities are under the common law. When notified of the dishonour of the note the burden was cast upon them, if they wished to hold the next endorser liable, to do what the law required to make him liable. No one was bound to do it for them. If they chose to rely upon another, and he neglected, they must take the consequence.\nThey could have complied with the law, but neither they, nor any one for them, have done so. Chapman v. Keane[8]; Harrison v. Ruscoe[9]; Willis v. Bank of England[10]; and Parsons on Notes and Bills[11].\nMr. O\u2019Sullivan in reply.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\n[After stating the facts of the case and reading the 1st sect. of c. 47, 37 Vic., D., proceeded as follows]:\u2014\nI think the holder, the Canadian Bank of Commerce, fulfilled its duty when it sent notice to the place at which the note was dated, being the place which the law has fixed as the place at which the indorser, or whoever should be a party to the note, was to be found for the purpose of receiving notice. The law may be said to have domiciled the bill there so as to entitle the holder to treat that as the place to which a notice of dishonor should or might be sent to whomsoever should be or become a party to the note, whether such party should be an indorser or a representative of an indorser, who, by reason of the death of the indorser, became, as his representative, a party to the note. The statute was passed, in my opinion, to relieve holders from the difficulties and risks so likely to arise from the necessity of observing the very strict technical rules in regard to notices of dishonor, and instead of requiring such notices to be sent to the residence or place of business of drawers or indorsers of negotiable instruments, and imposing on holders the burthen of discovering the proper addresses to which notices should be sent, substituted, in lieu of the implied contract in respect thereto, a statutory contract by which the holder was relieved from all difficulty and risk, by enacting that all notices should be sufficient, if addressed in due time to the party upon whom liability was to be fixed, at the place at which the note was dated, unless another place is designated. This provision, wholly irrespective of previously existing requirements as to notice, arbitrarily fixed as by agreement between the parties that notice sent to the place of the date of the instrument should be sufficient.\nThe fallacy in this case, I humbly think, was in supposing that there was omission on the part of the holders, the bank, or that they were entitled to recover by reason of their ability to show a sufficient excuse for such omission, that is want of knowledge of the indorser\u2019s death, and that the present plaintiffs, not having that excuse, are endeavoring to avail themselves of the excuse of the bank; but such is not, in my opinion, the case.\nThe bank, in my opinion, gave due notice, and might have declared against defendant, alleging that the defendant had had due notice of presentment and dishonor, without alleging an omission to give due notice and matter of excuse for such omission; and the evidence of the notice here given would, in my opinion, have sustained such an allegation of due notice, and a liability, so regularly established, I think enured to the benefit of the other indorsers.\nWhen the plaintiffs paid this note to the bank, and the bank transferred the note by delivery to the plaintiffs, they transferred their complete title and substituted the holders to their rights as against all parties so duly notified in strict accordance, in fact in literal compliance, with the provisions of the statute.\nThe right of the testator was to receive a notice of dishonor at the place of date, the right of the holder was to fix a liability by a notice addressed there. On the death of the testator, his representative had, I think, the same right his testator had, no other and no greater. If the testator could not insist on the holder addressing the notice elsewhere than to the place where the note was dated, I do not think his representative can impose a larger or more extended obligation on the holder. The indorser might have designated another place, it was optional with him, or he might, as is often done, have waived notice altogether; in either of which cases I fail to see how his representative can claim to occupy any other or better position than the original contractor. I am, therefore, not prepared to say that if the bank had known of the death of Boyle, a notice addressed as this was would not have been sufficient, but, as they did not know, the notice, in my opinion, was clearly good, and plaintiffs, now standing in the shoes of the bank, are clothed with all the rights the bank had against indorsers prior to the one so taking up the note.\nI think this conclusion is not only in the interest of trade and commerce, as simplifying the dealings with and the duty cast on holders of bills or notes, but is giving effect and carrying out the policy of the Dominion statute, in reference to which, I think, it may be said, that no lawyer who has enjoyed a large mercantile practice but must have witnessed manifold failures of justice arising from non-observance of, or difficulties in connection with, the strict technical rules relating to notices of dishonor, and must appreciate the expediency and wisdom of an enactment such as this, and, therefore, I think it is our duty to give this legislation full force and effect, certainly not to hamper or unnecessarily limit its operation.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nBy the statute of the Dominion, 37 Vic., c. 47, sec. 1, it is enacted that:\nNotice of the protest or dishonor of any bill of exchange or promissory note, payable in Canada, shall be sufficiently given, if addressed in due time to any party to such bill or note, entitled to such notice, at the place at which such bill or note is dated, unless any such party has, under his signature on such bill or note, desig- nated another place, when such notice shall be sufficiently given if addressed to him in due time at such other place; and such notices so addressed shall be sufficient, although the place of residence of such party be other than either of such before\u2011mentioned places.\nThere was no designation in the promissory note upon which this action is brought of any other place than that at which the note was dated as the residence of the endorser, the testator of the present defendant.\nI regard this enactment as creating a statutory presumption, not to be controverted, that the place of residence of an endorser is, in the absence of any designation of another place being written under the endorsement, at the place at which the bill or note is dated. This note was dated at Toronto, and we are therefore to presume that the residence of the indorser was at Toronto.\nIn the absence of any decisions upon the point in our own courts as well as in England, we may have recourse to American authorities to ascertain what constitutes sufficient notice in case of the death of an indorser at the maturity of a note, and we find it established by high authority that if the holder is, without negligence on his part, ignorant of the death of the indorser, a notice addressed to the indorser and sent to his last place of residence is sufficient.\nIn Daniel on negotiable instruments[12] the law is thus stated:\nIt is likewise sufficient, if notice be addressed to the deceased, when, without negligence, the holder is not aware of his death;\nand the cases of Barnes v. Reynolds[13], and Maspero v. Pedexlaux[14], Merchants Bank v. Birch[15], and Planters\u2019 Bank v. White[16], are decisions to that effect. In Parsons on notes and bills[17] we find the same doctrine enunciated. He says:\nIf the death is not known, and nothing appears to show that the sender ought to have known this fact, notice addressed to the deceased endorser will be sufficient.\nIn the present case the notice was sent through the post, addressed to the deceased endorser at Toronto, where the note was dated, and it is not even suggested, nor could it have been suggested, that there was any negligence on the part of the bank in not discovering the fact of death and the proof of the will. Therefore, according to these American authorities the bank did all that was requisite to charge the executor, so far as to make him liable to them.\nThe only English authority which in any way touches the question is the case of Ex parte Baker in re Bellman[18], in which it was held that notice of dishonor sent to a bankrupt after the bankruptcy was sufficient to charge the assignee, and to entitle the holder to prove against the endorser\u2019s estate for the amount of the bill. James L.J., in this case says:\u2014\nIt does not appear to me that any good reason can be suggested why the holder of a bill should give notice of dishonor to any one but the persons whose names he finds upon the bill.\nThis I regard as an authority strongly in the appellants favor, inasmuch as it shows that in this, as in all questions of commercial law, the courts will, in the absence of direct authority, be influenced by considerations of mercantile convenience. Now, in the present case, were we to say that the law requires the holders of negotiable instruments, at their peril, to ascertain the fact of an endorser\u2019s death, and the appointment of his personal representatives, we should be manifestly laying down a rule which it would be impossible for bankers and other large holders of commercial paper to comply with, and the interference of the legislature would be indispensable to make such an alteration in the law as would enable them to carry on their business with safety. I think, therefore, we may well adopt the rule of the American courts already stated, and determine that the notice given by the Bank of Commerce was sufficient to make the defendant liable to the bank.\nNext arises the question, are the plaintiff\u2019s entitled to avail themselves of the notice given by the bank? There are numerous general dicta that a notice sufficient to entitle the actual holder at the time of maturity to recover enures to the benefit of a subsequent party who may take up the paper. In Beale v. Parish[19], which is relied on in the judgment of some of the learned judges in the court below, it was said that there can be no subrogation to a right arising out of an excuse for omitting to give notice founded on an honest ignorance of the holder of the fact of death. But it may be remarked that when notice is given, under the circumstances of the present case, the liability is not put on the ground that the holder has excused himself from giving notice, but the notice is treated as sufficient. If then, where the excuse of notice is a personal privilege of the holder, the right of a subsequent indorser to be substituted does not apply; that doctrine can have no application to the present case.\nBut it appears plain on principle that if the right of action is once fixed and absolute in the holder a subsequent indorser taking up the paper is subrogated to his rights.\nIt has been shown, under the first head, that the right of action is vested in the holder so soon as he does all that the law requires him with his means of knowledge to do. Then no matter how the right of action which the holder has acquired against the prior indorser has arisen, on payment by the subsequent indorser he ought to be subrogated. The principle of subrogation always applies in favor of a surety. A party liable in that character, paying, is entitled to all securities and rights of action held by and vested in the creditor[20]. Then, every indorser is a surety for those liable before him. Next, the holder\u2019s right of action against the first indorser is distinct from that which is satisfied and extinguished by the payment made by the second indorser. The second indorser paying only satisfies the several and distinct right of action of the holder against himself, and if the holder retains the note in his possession he may, after payment by the second, sue the first indorser and recover the full amount of the note. This is established by the elaborate judgment of Lord Truro in Jones v. Broadhurst[21].\nThe holder recovering under such conditions will, however, be held to be a trustee for the second indorser, who has paid, and the latter may recover from him as for money had and received. If, however, instead of retaining the instrument he hands it over to the second indorser, the distinct right of action which the holder retained against the first indorser, so long as he held the paper, will, if the note is endorsed in blank, pass with it.\nFormerly, at common law, a title gained by subrogation could not be worked out in the case of transfers of rights of action not arising on negotiable instruments, and the aid of equity was indispensable, but where the liability was attached to a negotiable instrument, the title to which passed by delivery or endorsement, the intervention of equity was not required. From these considerations, therefore, I deduce the conclusion that the bank, after payment by the plaintiffs, still retained a right of action against the defendant, by means of which they might have enforced payment of the full amount of the note, and that this right of action passed with the note on its delivery to the plaintiffs.\nFurther, this doctrine of subrogation is now recognized by statute, and the indorser paying could insist upon all rights of action against parties liable before himself being expressly transferred, if they did not pass by the mere delivery of the note endorsed in blank. And under the procedure in the province of Ontario, established by the Administration of Justice Act, the plaintiffs are entitled to avail themselves in this action of all their equitable rights.\nWe are also to consider that the plaintiffs, by suing in the name of the bank as their trustee, could have recovered on the strength of the bank\u2019s title. To me there is nothing either illogical or inconvenient in holding that they became substituted to this same right of action when they retired the note. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that judgment should be entered in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount of the note and interest, and that the respondent must be ordered to pay the costs in this court, as well as in the Court of Appeal.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI entirely concur in the views that have been expressed in this case by the learned Chief Justice and my brother Strong. It is the holder of a note which becomes dishonored who is always expected to give all the requisite notices. When a note is dishonored it is protested, and the duty of the party protesting, or of the party for whom the protest is made out, is to give the notice to all the parties that are liable. An intermediate or immediate endorser has the right to assume that the holder of the note has given all the notices that are required The indorser of the note has the right to conclude that that being done the law has been complied with, and all that is necessary was done for the bank to recover, and therefore when he is called upon subsequently by the bank for payment, he has, according to the views which are laid down here and which are applicable to this case a right to sue for this note by subrogation when he pays the note to the bank. I have no doubt that is the law, and that such a judgment will further the commerce and trade of the country, and that a contrary judgment would have a contrary effect. I am glad to find that the law will enable this court to come to a conclusion so favorable to the trade of the country, and at the same time sufficient to protect the rights of all the parties to such bills and notes. I think the notice posted by the Bank quite sufficient in this case.\nGWYNNE J.:\u2014\nThe right of the plaintiffs to recover in this action depends upon the right which the Bank of Commerce, who were the holders of the promissory note declared on when it matured, would have had, if they had been the plaintiffs, to recover against the defendant upon issue joined to a plea traversing an averment in the declaration that the defendant had due notice of dishonor of the note by the maker. There is no express authority in the English courts upon the subject, neither is there in England an act of parliament of the nature of the act in force here\u2014viz.: 37 Vic., c. 47, s. 1. The object of that act plainly was, as it appears to me, to compel the parties to bills of exchange and promissory notes, payable in Canada, to designate under their hands, upon such bills and notes, their domicile, for the purpose of receiving notice of dishonor thereof, by making the place where such bill or note upon its face purported to be drawn or made to be the domicile for such purpose of all the parties thereto not so designating their domicile for that purpose; and the effect of the act, as it appears to me, is to make a notice of dishonor, mailed by the holder in due time to any party to such note, at the place designated, if any be designated or mailed to the address of such party at the place where the bill or note purports to have been drawn or made, if none be designated, equivalent to the delivery of such notice at the actual domicile or residence of such party. If, therefore, delivery by the Bank of Commerce of notice of dishonor in due time after maturity at the last actual domicile or place of residence of a deceased payee would have been a good notice, entitling them to recover against his personal representatives under the circumstances appearing in evidence, it will be equally good although only mailed and addressed to the payee by name at Toronto where the note purports to have been made. Now, in the absence of authority in England, we find that in Stewart\u2019s Exors vs. Eden[22], it was held in 1804 by the Supreme Court of the state of New York, that notice directed to and inserted in the key-hole of the last dwelling house which was shut up of a deceased endorser was good notice and well served, the holders having been ignorant of his death. This doctrine was re-affirmed in the same court in 1819, in the Merchants Bank vs. Birch[23], and again in 1843, in Willis vs. Green[24], and by the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania it was held, upon the authority of the above cases in Lendermen\u2019s Executors vs. Guldenchal, in appeal[25], that in the case of the death of an endorser of a promissory note before its maturity, if his decease be unknown to the holder, it is sufficient, in order to charge his estate, to direct notice of non-payment to the deceased endorser, by name, at the post office nearest his last place of residence; and these cases proceed upon the ground, that notice so given is, under the circumstances, good notice, not that the circumstances constitute a legal excuse for the omission to give good notice.\nUpon the authority of the above cases and upon the true construction of the statute, in the absence of any express authority in England to the contrary, it must, I think, be held that if the Bank of Commerce had been plaintiffs, the evidence of the mailing of the notice of dishonor to the address of the deceased payee, at Toronto, where the note upon its face purports to have been made, was a good and sufficient notice, entitling the bank to have recovered on the issue traversing the averment in the declaration of notice of dishonor; in this view, the case of Beale vs. Parish[26] has no application, and the notice having been a good and sufficient notice, given by the holders at maturity to the payee, inures to the benefit of the plaintiff, notwithstanding that he was aware of the decease of the payee; a contrary decision would defeat what I cannot but take to have been the object of the statute, namely: To relieve holders of over-due notes and bills from all anxiety and difficulty arising by reason of their being ignorant of the actual place of residence of the parties on the note or bill, or of the fact appearing here, namely, the decease of the party to whom the notice was addressed. The appeal must, therefore, be allowed with costs, and the rule in the court below be made absolute with costs for the entry of a verdict for the plaintiffs, pursuant to the leave reserved, for $409.28, with subsequent interest.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellants: O\u2019Sullivan and Perdue.\nAttorneys for respondent: McMichael, Hoskin & Ogden.\n[1] 37 Vic., c. 47, sec. 1: Notice of the protest or dishonor of any bill of exchange or promissory note payable in Canada, shall be sufficiently given, if addressed, in due time to any party to such bill or note, entitled to such notice, at the place at which such bill or note is dated, unless any such party has, under his signature, on such bill or note, designated another place, when such notice shall be sufficiently given, if addressed to him, in due time, at such other place; and such notices, so addressed, shall be sufficient, although the place of residence of such party be other than either of such before mentioned places.\n[2] 37 Vic. c. 47, sec. 1., and Cons.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (APPEAL SIDE.)\nCapias\u2014Affidavit\u2014Art. 798 C.C.P.\u2014 Want of reasonable and probable cause Damages.\nS., a debtor resident in Ontario, being on the eve of departure for a trip to Europe, passed through the city of Montreal, and while there refused to make a settlement of an overdue debt with his creditors, McK. et al, who had instituted legal proceedings in Ontario to recover their debt which proceedings were still pending. McK. et al thereupon caused him to be arrested, and 8. paid the debt. Subsequently S. claimed damages from McK. et al for the malicious issue and execution of the writ of capias.\nMcK. et al, the respondents, on appeal, relied on a plea of justification, alleging that when they arrested the appellant, they acted with reasonable and probable cause. In his affidavit, the reasons given by the deponent McK.,one of the defendants, for his belief that the appellant was about to leave the Province of Canada were as follows: \"That Mr. P., the deponent's partner, was informed last night in Toronto by one H, a broker, that the said W. J. S. was leaving immediately the Dominion of Canada, to cross over the sea for Europe or parts unknown, and deponent was himself informed, this day, by J. R., broker, of the said W. J. S's departure for Europe and other places.\" The appellant S. was carrying on business as wholesale grocer at Toronto, and was leaving with his son for the Paris Exhibition, and there was evidence that he was in the habit of crossing almost every year and that his banker and all his business friends knew he was only leaving for a trip; and there was no evidence that the deponent had been informed that appellant was leaving with intent to defraud. There was also evidence given by McK., that after the issue of the capias, but before its execution, the deponent asked plaintiff for the payment of what was due to him, and that plaintiff answered him \"that S. would not pay him, that he might get his money the best way he could.\" Held: that the affidavit was defective, there being no sufficient reasonable and probable cause stated for believing that the debtor was leaving with intent to defraud his creditors; and that the evidence showed the respondent had no reasonable and probable cause for issuing the writ of capias in question.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed.\nThe facts and pleadings of the case sufficiently appear in the head note and the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.,\nMr. McLaren for appellant:\nThe facts of the case are, that a dispute having arisen between the parties as to the date from which the four months for the payment of the teas purchased by appellant from the respondents should run, the latter took a suit in Ontario, which was contested as premature. When appellant was about to take the steamer on his way to visit the Paris exhibition, he was arrested at Montreal on a writ of capias, issued under article 798 C. C. P. Now this affidavit is plainly insufficient to justify the issuing of a capias, and all the judges have admitted that it was insufficient, and that the capias could have been quashed on the ground that Mackenzie should have specially stated in his affidavit his reasons for believing that Shaw's leaving Canada was \"with intent to defraud his creditors in general and the plaintiff in particular.\" The only reason given was that the appellant was about leaving the province.\nIt is well established in the urisprudence of Quebec that leaving the province is not of itself a presumption of an intent to defraud but that the affidavit must contain reasons sufficient to satisfy the court that the debtor is actually about to leave with a fraudulent intent ([1]). We contend that the affidavit clearly establishes that the deponent did not state at the time any probable or reasonable cause as he was bound to do, for issuing a capias and that when the trial took place, respondents showed conclusively that they had no other reason for arresting appellant but the one they had stated in their affidavit, and, therefore, they were liable in damages for the wrongful issue and execution of the capias.\nThere was some evidence of what took place between Shaw and Mackenzie after the issue of the capias, but that evidence cannot be received for two reasons first, it took place after the capias and therefore cannot be a justification; and, secondly, such evidence is inadmissible as by the law of Quebec, a party to a suit cannot make evidence for himself ([2]), and any statement made by him in his own favor goes for nothing.\nThere was nothing secret or suspicious about Sha S departure. He was making a usual trip to Ewrope, and the high standing of Shaw's firm in Toronto, as proved byseveral witnesses, was evidently well known to respondents, who gave them four months credtt for over $2,400 without question on this the first transaction they had with them ; and it was surely incumbent on them to have obtained some definite and reliable information as to some fraudulent, or, at least, suspicious act of appellant, before taking such an extraordinary step as the arrest complained of. The arrest was public, and appellant suffered very serious damage, and appellant respectfully submits that under the circumstances and proof of record he is entitled to substantial damages, and confidently asks the allowance of his present appeal.\nMr. Rose followed on behalf of the appellant and relied on the following authorities;\n1. As to the construction of the words leave Canada.\" Larchin v. Willan ([3]) decided under 1 and 2 Vic. c. 110 sec. 3, determines these words not to include a temporary absence.\n2. As to the \u201cintent\" :\u2013See remarks of James L. J.; and Jessel, M. R., Ex parte, Gutierrez ([4]); Butler v. Rosenfelt ([5]); Freer v. Ferguson ([6]); Bowers v. Flower ([7]) in which case intent to defraud was not drawn from a similar expression, as to \"getting the money, if the creditor could\"; Damer v, Bushby ([8]), is the leading practice case in Ontario, in capias actions.\nAs to \"reasonable and probable cause :\"\u2014See Hagarty vG T.R. ([9]), citingBroad v. Ham ([10]); Johnston v.Sutton ([11]); Daniels v. Fielding ([12]); Lyons v. Kelly([13]); Ruttan v. Pringle ([14]); Thome v. Mason ([15]); Tor-rance v. Jarvis ([16]).\nAs to its not being necessary to set aside tlie writ:\u2014 See Eakins v. Chrsttopher ([17]); Bishop v. Martin ([18]); Griffith v. Hall ([19]).\nAs to subsequent knowledge not availing to support allegation of reasonable and probable cause:\u2014See Crandell v. Crandell ([20]).\nMr. Doutre, Q. C., for respondents:i\nThe learned counsel stated there was a disputed debt between \"the parties * the fact is there was an overdue debt and after the conversation which took place before the arrest, it cannot be said that the respondents, who were going to lose $2000 had no reasonable and probable cause to cause the arrest. What guarantee had the respondents of the early, or even remote, return of the appellant ? He was taking his son with him ; his wife could have followed him at any time;what more was needed to justify the issue of the capias ? It was for the appellant, and he has completely failed, to show the absence of probable cause for the issue of the capias. The respondents, on the other hand, proved that the credit of the appellant was at that time very much shaken ; that he was obliged to buy for cash, and that but a few days before the issue of the capias an assignee had been instructed to collect an account from him for debt contracted in Montreal.\nThen I submit also that appellant in paying the amount, virtually assented and acquiesced in the proceeding of the respondents, to secure payment of their debt. in giving security he would have reserved the right of contesting the capias, whilst he renounced the right by the payment without reserve. The learned counsel cited Lapierre v. Gagnon ([21]); Baker v. Jones ([22]); Mcintosh v.Stevens ([23]); Lajeunesse v. O'Brien ([24]); Prentice v Harrison ([25]) ; Huard v. Dunn ([26]). Mr. McLaren in reply.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by TaschereAu, J. :\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed.\nThe plaintiff, present appellant, claims damages from the respondents for the malicious issue and execution of a capias against him, the plaintiff, at Montreal, in July, 1878.\nThe defendant's first plea to this action is that the plaintiff having, when arrested, and without protest, paid the sum demanded from him, he has thereby acquiesced in the arrest and waived all his rights to the present action. All the judges in the two courts below have dismissed this plea and I cannot see that their decision on this point can be controverted. A payment under duress can never be construed into an acquiescence or operate as a waiver. In the case of Dennis vs. Glass ([27]), a plea of this nature was put in by the defendant, but the Court of Appeal mulcted him in damages without even noticing this contention on his part. The case of Lapierre vs. Gagnon ([28]) is totally different from the present case and cannot help the respondents. The defendants' other pleas amount to the general issue and to a plea of justification, alleging that when they arrested the appellant they acted with reasonable and probable cause.\nOf course, it was incumbent upon the appellant to prove tile allegations of Jus declaration, and to give prim\u00e2 facie evidence of a negative character to a certain extent; that is, that the respondents had had no probable cause to arrest him. In my opinion, this he has done to an extent seldom possible in such actions, and in the proof of a negative nature. I think, moreover, that the respondents, in the evidence they have adduced in support of their plea, far from establishing their contentions, have, on the contrary, added largely, in my opinion, to the strength of the appellant's case. In fact, not only in this case, but also in their original case against the appellant, and by the very terms of their own affidavit, upon which they arrested the appellant, it is clear and apparent that the respondents were and are under the impression that the fact alone of the departure of their debtor from the country was a sufficient ground to arrest him. Now, that is not the law.\nUnder article 798 C.C.P., the affidavit required to obtain a writ of capias must show t that the defendant has reason to believe, and verily believes, for reasons specially stated in the affidavit, that the defendant is about immediately to leave the Province of Canada with intent to defraud his creditors in general or the plaintiff in particular.\"\nMcKenzie's affidavit, under which the capias in question here was issued, is as follows :\u2014\nThat deponent has reason to believe, and verily believes, that the said William J. Shaw, one of the defendants, who is presently in the said city of Montreal, is about to leave immediately the province of Canada, and Dominion of Canada, with intent to defraud his creditors in general and the p1aintiffs in particular, and that such departure will deprive plaintiffs of their recourse against the said William J.Shaw; that the reasons of the said deponent for stating his belief asabove, are : that Mr.Powis, the deponent's . partner, wasinformed last night inToronto, by one Howarda broker, that the said W.J.Shaw was leaving immediately the Dominion ofCanada, to cross over the sea for Europe or parts unknown, and deponent was himself informed, this day, by James Reid, broker, of the said W. J, Shaw's departure for Europe and other places ; and further deponent saith not.\nNow, where are, in this affidavit, the reasons why the deponent construes Shaw's departure for Europe as done or projected with an intent to defraud? The deponent does not even attempt to give any. The existence of the debt and the departure from the country are, for him, sufficient to constitute an intent to defraud. This affidavit shows it clearly: the evidence in the present case corroborates it. Howard and Reid, the two persons who told McKenzie that Shaw was going to Europe, and whose names he relies upon in his affidavit, both swear positively that they never said anything to McKenzie which could lead him to believe that Shaw was leaving for good, or with any attempt to defraud any one. Here is what Reid says on the subject:\nQuestion. Did you see either of the partners.\nAnswer. I saw Mr.Machenzie and I think Mr. Powis also.\nQuestion. Did you have any conversation about Mr. Shaw?\nAnswer, Yes. .\nQuestion. Will you please state what was said between you and them about Mr, Shaw on that occasion?\nAnswer. I think I mentioned to Mr. Machenzie that I had heard Mr. Shaw was on his way to Europe, that he was expected to-day, that I had a letter from Toronto to that effect, that he was passing through the city on his way to the old country.\nQuestion. Your information had come in a letter from Toronto?\nAnswer. Yes.\nQuestion, Was your information to the effect that he was leaving the country for good, or only going on a trip ?\nAnswer. Nothing to that effect.\nQuestion, Nothing to the effect that he was leaving for good ?\nAnswer. No ; O certainly not. Question. Your information then was that he was taking a summer trip to Europe ?\nAnswer. Exactly, on business or pleasure, I do not know which.\nQuestion. Did you say anything toMackenzie, Powis & Co, that would lead them to believe or give them reason to believe that Mr. Shaw was leaving the country for good?\nAnswer.I think not\nQuestion. Do you think any reasonable man could have inferred that from what you stated ?\nAnswer. No ; I think not.\nHoward does not even remember to have told to Powis that Shaw was leaving for England, but is positive that if he did he said nothing that could induce Powis to believe that anything was wrong or could be suspected, in this trip to Europe.\nShaw, at the time of the arrest was on his way to Europe to attend the Earls exhibition with his son. He was carrying on a large wholesale grocery business in Toronto, where he had left his partner in charge of the business. His wife and another child he had also left in Toronto. He was in the habit of crossing the ocean almost every year. Far from trying to leave the country on this occasion furtively or secretly, it is in evidence that he was entertained by a number of the business men of Toronto at the club ii that city before leaving; that his bankers and his business friends all knew of his intended trip;that for a month or two he had been unwell and had been advised by his friends to leave his business for some time and recruit ; that he was leaving for a couple of months for his health and recreation Moreover, it is well known that any one in Toronto wishing to leave the country to defraud his Montreal creditors could do so without coming to Montreal, stopping over there for whole day, with his name publicly registered in one of the leading hotels of the city, and informing every.one whom he meets of his leaving, as the appellant did on the occasion referred to Of course, the present case is not concluded by Shaw proving that he was not leaving with the intent to defraud. Had the respondents reasonable and probable cause to believe him to be so leaving with such intent? is the question here.\nThe respondents themselves, examined as witnesses in this case, admit, as clearly as possible, that the fact by itself of Shaw's departure was for them a departure with intent to defraud. There is not a word of evidence that any one ever informed them of any such intent in Shaw's departure. Powis, one of them, was in Toronto, the day before. He was informed that Shaw intended to leave that evening He is asked, on his examination as a witness in this case :\nQuestion, Did you have any knowledge of any of the circumstances of his going to England?\nAnswer. I did not.\nQuestion. Did you take any pains to inquire about whether he was going for good, or going on a trip, or to get information ?\nAnswer. I took this much pains, that I was standing nearly all the forenoon around the St. Lawrence Hall trying to find him until about six o'clock in the evening.\nQuestion. Had you any idea that Mr. Shaw was going to remain in England, to live there ?\nAnswer. I did not know where he was going.\nQuestion, Did you take any means to find out?\nAnswer. Nothing special.\nQuestion. When you were in. Toronto, on the 18th, and heard that he was coming down on the train that night on his way to England, did you take any means to find out whether he was leaving his business, breaking up his establishment, and going to England with a view to remaining there ?\nAnswer I did not.\nAnd McKenzie, who made the affidavit, being examined, answers as follows:\nQuestion. Did you ask your partner whether Mr. Shaw was going there on a trip or not?\nAnswer. No sir.\nQuestion. What was your idea, that Mr. Shaw was going there to live or going there on a trip? Answer. I don't know that I formed any idea of that nature at all\nThat is admitting clearly that they never took the trouble to enquire at all about it if Powis had, everyone in Toranto would have told him that Shaw was going to Europe for his health and on a pleasure trip, and that he intended to return within two or three months. Now as laid down by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Perryman v Lister ([29]), where there is a ready and obvious mode of ascertaining the truth, and the opportunity of doing so is neglected in such an action as the present, the absence of enquiry is an element in determining the question of. the presence or absence of reasonable and probable cause. This case, it is true, was reversed in the House of Lords, Lister v.Perryman ([30]), but on the ground that the plaintiff in the case, having acted upon the information of a trust worthy informant, he was not obliged to make any other enquiry about it before acting on the information he had received. Here, there is nothing of the kind. The respondents had never received any information of Shaw's intention to defraud his creditors by leaving the country to settle abroad. They have not attempted to prove any. The evidence adduced by them tends to prove that Shaw & Co. in some instances, some eight or nine years before, had not promptly met their engagements or had been refused credit. These facts have but little bearing on the case. For some of them, it is not even proved that the respondents were ware of them when they issued the capias against Shaw. It requires no authority to demonstrate that subsequent knowledge cannot support an allegation of reasonable and probable cause, that one cannot excuse, for instance, or explain, an act done in July, by facts which came to his knowledge only in August. The respondents seem to say in this case: \"Well, it may be that the reasons we gave in our affidavit to arrest Shaw were insufficient, but we had other and better reasons, which we now give in defence to his action.\" Now, they must be presumed not to have given these reasons in their affidavit either because they were not then aware of them, or because they themselves believed these reasons not sufficient to arrest Shaw. If they were not then aware of them, they cannot now mention them as their excuse for arresting Shaw ; and if they were aware of them, but did not think them sufficient to form the basis of their affidavit of intent to defraud against Shaw, they cannot expect us to consider them now sufficient to establish that they acted with reasonable and probable cause.\nOn the whole, I agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench and Mr. Justice Cross, who dissented from the majority of the court appealed from, that Shaw's arrest was entirely unjustifiable, and that it is clearly established in the present case that the respondents had no reasonable or probable cause for issuing the writ of capias in question. Mr. Justice Cross, in the court below, would have awarded $500 as damages. We think it a fair and reasonable amount, and have agreed to this sum.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : McLaren & Leet.\nSolicitors for respondents : Doutre & Joseph.\nSee Hurtubise v.

One of the pleas was that S. was not respondent\u2019s duly authorized agent, as alleged. The general managers of the company for the province of Ontario had appointed, by a letter, signed by them both, one W., as general agent for the city of L.

There was no evidence that the other general manager knew what capacity S. was acting in.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that W. had no power to delegate his functions, and that S. had no authority to bind the respondent company.\nPer Strong, J., That the general agents being joint agents could only bind the respondent company by their joint concurrent acts, the appointment of S. as agent by W\u2019t. without the concurrence of the other general manager would have been insufficient.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, confirming the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas ordering a non-suit to be entered in an action in that court wherein the now appellant was plaintiff and the respondents were defendants.\nThe action was brought by the appellant to recover a sum of $1,200, under the terms of an interim receipt purporting to have been issued on behalf of the respondents, and signed by one David Smith as agent, and insuring for one year from 22nd June, 1878, unless notice were given that the proposal was declined, $500 on a building of a grist flouring mill, and $700 on fixed and movable machinery therein.\nThe declaration alleges that the appellant and Skuse and Holmes owned the mill in question, and that the two latter persons, after the insurance and before the fire, sold their interest to the appellant, and subsequently assigned to him all their rights under the insurance contract.\nIt also sets out the interim receipt verbatim, and alleges that David Smith, who signed it, was the duly authorized agent of the respondents for that purpose, and that they became liable thereunder, and never declined the said proposal for insurance, and that the property insured was burnt on the 12th July, 1878.\nThe respondents pleaded seven pleas, but the principal defence rested on the second plea denying Smith\u2019s agency, and on the third plea, that the interim receipt and insurance contract were procured by the fraud of the appellant and others in collusion with him.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Morrison and a jury at the London assizes, and upon the answers of the jury to certain questions submitted to them, a verdict was given for the appellant with $800 damages: leave being reserved to the respondents to move for a non\u2011suit.\nThe evidence bearing on the subject of agency was as follows: There was a gentleman of the name of Williams resident in London, who was the general agent of defendants, appointed as such by the general agents of the company for the Province of Ontario, Messrs. Westmacott and Wickens, and Williams had authority to receive applications for insurance and to grant interim receipts. Smith, the person by whom the interim receipt in the present case was signed, was employed by Williams to solicit applications. Smith had no authority from, or correspondence with, the head office of the company. He says, in his evidence: \u201cI got liberty from Mr. Williams to sign interim receipts. I always informed him I had issued them, and paid over the premiums to him monthly. Mr. Williams made reports to the head office; I made none; I was sub-agent for Mr. Williams. I could not say whether the head office knew who issued the interim receipts. I had no correspondence with the head office of the company. I told Mr. Westmacott (he was one of the head officers of the company in Toronto, and is since dead) that I was in the habit of issuing receipts. There was no one present when I told Mr. Westmacott; I never told Mr. Wickens (the other head officer); I never told Mr. Williams that I told Mr. Westmacott that I was issuing interim receipts. Mr. Westmacott seemed quite agreeable that I should do so, and all my applications could go through Mr. Williams. He said I was to be considered as Mr. Williams\u2019 agent.\u201d\nOn 19th November, 1879, a rule was granted by the Court of Common Pleas to enter a non\u2011suit or for a new trial, and this rule was subsequently made absolute to enter a non-suit.\nFrom this judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that court, on 20th September, 1880, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nMr. H. Cameron, Q.C., and Mr. Bartram, for appellant:\nThe principal question seems to turn upon the evidence rather than upon the legal principles applicable to the case: whether the evidence shows David Smith to have been an authorized agent of the company to issue interim receipts. The forms of application and interim receipts were supplied to David Smith by defendants\u2019 agent, and such forms gave notice to the plaintiff that he was their agent. There is no notice on said forms qualifying his authority.\nThe evidence of Williams, the general agent of the company for London and the county of Middlesex, proves that Smith was a canvassing agent, or broker, of the defendants, working under said Williams, with the knowledge and concurrence of the general agents at Toronto; and the defendants are therefore bound by Statutory Condition 21[1], because David Smith was thereby an agent of the defendants. Leake Cont.[2]\nThe jury have found expressly, on a correct charge from the judge, fairly leaving the question to them, that David Smith was duly authorized by the local agent at London, with the knowledge of the general agents of the defendants for Ontario, to grant interim receipts. Robertson v. Pro. M. & F. Ins. Co.[3]\nThe jury saw the witnesses, the way in which they gave their evidence, and we submit that taking Smith\u2019s evidence by itself, if it is sufficient to sustain the verdict, it ought not to have been disturbed.\nThe only doubt in the case was whether the agent Williams had authority to delegate his authority. But in this case there can be no doubt the general agents at Toronto knew that Smith was acting as sub-agent, and in this very case he applied for 12 p. c. commission in order that he might get 2 p. c. as sub-agent. Moreover, from the evidence of David Smith and Byron Williams, Williams necessarily carried on his general agency for London and the county of Middlesex, with the assistance of sub-agents, David Smith, G.G. German and others, for it would have been impossible for him to conduct his business except by means of sub-agents. Story Agen., sec. 14, cited by Mr. Justice Galt, and secs. 28, 29, 31 and 58; Leake Con., 483; Campbell v. National Ins. Co.[4]; Clarke on Ins.[5]\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. W.N. Miller, for respondents:\nThere can be no doubt Smith was never directly appointed by the head office, and that the general agents at Toronto never knew that Smith had issued interim receipts, unless through what Smith told Mr. Westmacott. It is equally true that the moment Williams knew Smith had issued an interim receipt, he ordered the money to be returned. Now it seems to us the question is simply this: had Smith authority to sign? It must be by direct authority from the head office, or by the company not repudiating Smith\u2019s act. It is beyond all dispute that the company never knew that an interim receipt had been issued.\nThe business entrusted to Williams was of a strictly personal character, requiring the exercise of his own judgment and skill, and could not be delegated. Evans Pr. Agent[6]; Story Agen.[7]\nBut it is contended Williams had authority to appoint sub-agents. Even if the business entrusted to Williams was of such a character that it could be delegated in case of necessity, there was no evidence to shew that it was necessary for Williams to appoint agents to enable him to transact it.\nThe appointment of general manager of the respondents was vested in two persons, Westmacott and Wickens. A letter signed by the two was used in the appointment of Williams, and a joint appointment by Westmacott and Wickens, it is submitted, would be necessary to constitute Smith the agent of the respondents[8].\nThere is no custom that agents appointed by the general agents have authority to appoint sub-agents that bind the company. The learned counsel then argued in reference to the misrepresentations made in the application for insurance, upon which point the court did not express any opinion.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThis is an action brought on what the plaintiffs claim was an insurance interim receipt issued by David Smith, agent of the Commercial Union Insurance Co. The respondent denied Smith\u2019s agency, and also denied that the answers given in the application for insurance to certain questions which the agent Smith took from the insured were such as, under the circumstances, the plaintiff was bound to give. I have carefully read the evidence in this case, and I entirely agree with the judgments delivered by Mr. Justice Galt, in the Court of Common Pleas, and by the judges of the Court of Appeals; and I am of opinion that Smith, who was nothing more than a broker, was taking risks for the agent of the company. I have failed to find out any authority whatever from the company to him to authorize him to act as their agent and complete a contract of insurance with any party whatever; and I have failed to find any evidence of any such recognition of his agency or his acts in that character as would clothe him with implied authority from them to take risks.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, in making absolute the rule to enter a non-suit, was right, and ought to be affirmed. The execution of the agency entrusted to Williams involved the exercise of judgment and discretion in the important matters of accepting or rejecting the risks which were offered to the company, and it is a first principle of the law of agency that, when personal confidence is thus reposed in the agent, he cannot delegate his authority. The interim receipt upon which the action was brought, having been signed by David Smith, who alleges he was authorized by Williams to take risks and grant receipts, is therefore not binding upon the defendants, unless some prior authority, or subsequent ratification by the company, or their general agent at Toronto, is shown. There is no proof of ratification by a subse- quent recognition of the acts of David Smith, but his evidence is relied on to show that he had express authority to act as agent, and in that capacity to sign interim receipts for premiums. This evidence is said to be found in the direct examination of David Smith, who was a witness manifestly favorable to the plaintiff, and in what was elicited by the defendants\u2019 counsel on cross-examination. It refers to a conversation between the witness and Mr. Westmacott, one of the joint agents of the company at Toronto, which took place on the occasion of a visit which Mr. Westmacott had paid to the office of Williams, the company\u2019s agent at London, when Smith was driving Westmacott to the railway station, no one else being present. What passed is thus stated by Smith:\u2014\nI told Westmacott that I was in the habit of issuing receipts; I told him during our drive from Williams\u2019 office; it was in 1878 sometime; it was before the fire; Williams asked me to drive him down; previous to that he had spoken to me; there was no one present when I told Westmacott; I had never told it to Wickens; I had never told Williams that I had told Westmacott I was issuing interim receipts; Westmacott seemed quite agreeable that I should do so, and all my applications could go through Williams he said; I was to be considered as Williams\u2019 agent. It was then that I spoke about the commission, he said he couldn\u2019t come to any understanding about that, he would consult the head office in Toronto. I wanted him to appoint me an agent direct, and I said whatever arrangements he could make with Williams would be satisfactory to him.\nThere is nothing in this statement which amounted to evidence of authority to sign receipts proper to be left to the jury.\nIt is, of course, to be conceded, that if there had been any evidence amounting to even a mere \u201cscintilla,\u201d as it has been termed, that should have been left for the consideration of the jury, and the non-suit would in that case be wrong. But assuming that Westmacott had power to confer authority on Smith to act directly as agent of the company, there is an en- tire absence of any proof of his having exercised such a power. Smith does not say he told Westmacott he was in the habit of signing receipts or accepting risks, but merely that he issued receipts. It is true that in his evidence in chief he said he had told Mr. Westmacott he was signing interim receipts, but the cross-examination must be regarded as a correction or qualification of that statement, and the whole evidence being read together, it comes to no more than this, that the witness told Westmacott he issued receipts, which, taken in connection with his request to Westmacott to be appointed as an independent agent and Westmacott\u2019s refusal, implied in his answer that he was to be considered William\u2019s agent, shows that all that was intended to be sanctioned by Westmacott was that Smith should continue to act as the sub-agent of Williams; in other words, that his acts should be subject to the approval and control of Williams. This being the fair construction of the evidence, there was nothing to leave to the jury, and the appellant was properly non-suited.\nHad Smith, however, gone much further, and proved authority derived from Westmacott to act as agent independently of Williams and to sign and issue receipts binding the company, an authority conferring on him powers co-ordinate with those delegated to Williams by the letter of the joint agents, which is in evidence, I should still have been of opinion that the non-suit ought not to be disturbed. The general agents of the company at Toronto are Messrs. Westmacott and Wickens. It does not appear that they were members of a mercantile firm, or in any way associated as partners in any business other than that of the general agency of the respondent\u2019s company. It may well be implied that the general agents in this province of an English insurance company have, as part of their general authority, power to appoint local agents with authority to sign interim receipts in accordance with the usual course of insurance business as carried on in this country. We have, however, no evidence of the actual authority given by the company to Messrs. Westmacott and Wickens, and with the facts before us that they were joint agents, and in the appointment of Williams had acted jointly, one of them, as it appears, having considered on that occasion that he had no authority to act independently of his colleague, we cannot possibly presume that they had a several as well as a joint authority. The irresistible conclusion is therefore that, as in all cases of joint agency, they could only bind their principals by their joint and concurrent acts. Then, it is not even pretended that Mr. Wickens concurred in authorising Smith to act as an agent, or in recognising his acts as binding on the company; so that even on the assumption that Westmacott had conferred such authority, it would be wholly insufficient, for the reason that Mr. Wickens\u2019s concurrence was wanting. This last ground alone is an incontrovertible reason for sustaining the non-suit.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant urged that the evidence of a conversation which the witness William Smith states he had with Westmacott at Toronto afforded matter for the consideration of the jury. I am of opinion that this testimony was of no importance, and contained nothing which could properly have been left to the jury, and that for the same reasons already given with reference to the alleged conversation between Westmacott and David Smith. It contains nothing to show any recognition by Westmacott of David Smith in any other character than in that of a sub-agent to Williams, and even if it had it could not bind the company, who had entrusted their general business, not to the sole agency of Westmacott, but to the conjoint management of Westmacott and his colleague Wickens. Taking the view of the case which I have thus briefly stated, I do not feel called upon to enter into a detailed consideration of the other defence\u2014that of misrepresentation\u2014but I think it right to state that on this branch of the case I entirely concur with the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals, who came to the conclusion that there was a gross misrepresentation, and that in consequence the plaintiff was disentitled to recover. For that reason, had the non-suit on the point of agency not been proper, it would have been incumbent on us to have granted a new trial.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nFor the reasons given in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI concur in the judgments that have been given. I think Smith had neither direct authority, nor was his action in signing these receipts sufficiently ratified by the general agents of this company. Without one or other of these two, he could not bind the company. I think, therefore, the receipts given by him, although they were furnished by the local agent to him, did not bind the company. He was virtually soliciting business under the local agent and for him. The parties ran the risk, and they must take the consequences of dealing with a person who is not authorized to bind the company in which they are insured. There is no doubt a great injury is done where parties are induced to take policies in such a way, but as the law is, you cannot bind a company that does not bind itself. They have the right to give certain powers to their agents, and in the appointment of local agents there is no implied authority to them to authorize any other parties to act for them. I think the non-suit is right, and a case is not made out to bind the company; and therefore the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.\nGWYNNE, J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for appellant: W.H Bartram.\nAttorneys for respondents: Beatty, Miller, Biggar & Blackstock.\n[1] Cap. 153, R.S.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J. J\nON APPEAL FROM. THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (APPEAL SIDE.)\nCompany\u2014\u2014Action for calls\u2014Misrepresentation\u2014Contract\u2014Repudiation\u2014Acquiescence by receipt of dividend.\nThe Stadacona Insurance Company incorporated in 1874 employed local agents to obtain subscriptions for stock in the district of Quebec, such local agents to receive a commission on shares subscribed. At the solicitation of one of these local agents F X.C., intending to subscribe for five paid-up shares, paid $500 and signed his name to the subscription book, the columns for the amount of the subscription and the numbers of shares being at the time left in blank. These columns were afterwards, in the presence of appellant, filled in with the number of shares (50 shares) by the agent of the company, without F. X. C's consent. Having discovered his position, one of appellant's brothers, who had also subscribed in the same way, went next day to Quebec and endeavored, but ineffectually, to induce the company to relieve them from the larger liability. At the end of the year 1875, the company declared a dividend of 10 per cent. on the paid-up capital (montant vers\u00e9,) and the plaintiff received a check for $50, for which he gave a receipt. In the following year the company suffered heavy losses, and notwithstanding F. X. C's repeated endeavors to be relieved from the larger liability brought an action against him to recover the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th calls of five per cent, on fifty shares of $100 each alleged to have been subscribed by F. X. C. in the capital stock of the company\nHeld, (Sir W. J. Ritchie, C. J., dubitant\u00e9) reversing the judgment of the court below, that the evidence shewed the appellant never entered into a contract to take 50 shares, that the receipt given for a dividend. of ten per cent. on the amount actually paid. (montant vers\u00e9,) was not an admission of his liability for the larger amount, and he therefore was not estopped from showing that he was never in fact holder of fifty shares in the capital stock of the company.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for the Province of Quebec (appeal side), affirming a judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Quebec, by which the appellant was condemned to pay the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th calls of five per cent. on fifty shares of one hundred dollars each, alleged to have been subscribed by the appellant in the capital stock of the respondent company.\nThis action was instituted by the plaintiffs (respondents) against the defendant (appellant) to recover four several calls of 5 per cent, each upon fifty shares, of one hundred dollars each, amounting to five thousand dollars of the capital stock of the company, of which fifty shares it is alleged in the declaration that the defendant is the holder and that he is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of one thousand dollars for the said four calls which sum still remains due and unpaid by the defendant to the plaintiffs. The defendant, in bar of this alleged cause of action, pleaded :\nFirst that he never was a holder of more than five shares in the capital stock of the said company, which he paid for in full when he subscribed for them, and that with the exception of those five shares he never took or subscribed for or became the holder of any other share of such capital stock ; and\nSecondly, that the plaintiffs agents, when canvassing the defendant for his subscription for the shares aforesaid represented to him and assured him that his subscription was for five shares only, and that upon the payment of five hundred dollars, then made by the defendant, he should be completely discharged from any further obligation, and could not be called upon to pay any further sum ; and that upon these assurances and representations the defendant consented to sign a paper which plaintiffs' said agents then presented to him and which he only signed upon the said assurances that his said signature only pledged the defendant to the amount aforesaid and the sum aforesaid ; that the defendant so have his signature upon the assurance of the said agents, without examining the contents of the said paper, and in the belief that he only subscribed for the said five shares which he then paid in full ;that after the departure of the said agents the defendant examined divers circulaires et livrets,\" which the said agents left with him and by these appeared the manner in which ordinary subscriptions were invited by the company, and that only one or two payments were required in ready money, but eight others would become payable at future periods ; that suspecting the good faith of the said agents he immediately made complaint and protestation to the chief officers of the plaintiffs, and represented to them as above stated upon different occasions : and that the said chief officers, to this purpose authorized, acknowledged that there was a mistake in the matter and that the defendant was only bound for the shares as verbally agreed to be subscribed for by him and which he had the intention of taking, and that they sent him away saying that he need not be uneasy ; that the matter was arranged, and that he would not have to pay any further sum.\nThat in all the above the defendant has been cheated that there has been on the part of the plaintiffs fraud and bad faith and that the plaintiffs, under the pretence of procuring a subscription for the said five shares, have endeavoured to hold the defendant bound to the pay ment of fifty, although they will knew that the defendant had no means to meet such amount, and that if such a subscription had been made by him, it could only be the result of error or of false representations of the said agents of the plaintiffs. Wherefore the defendant prayed that it should be declared that the signature of the defendant was obtained by error and by the false and fraudulent representations of the plaintiffs' said agents, and that the defendant never intended to subscribe, and never did in fact subscribe for more than five shares, which he paid for in cash and that the plaintiffs' action be dismissed with costs.\nThere are two actions precisely similar as the suit of the plaintiffs, against two brothers of the defendant, the pleadings in which, and the circumstances of which are similar, but only that in one of them namely against Joseph Cot\u00e9, the amount claimed is $2,000 as four calls upon $10,000 in the capital stock of the company, alleged to be held by him, whereas his plea alleges that he subscribed only for $1000 or ten shares, which he paid in full at the time of subscription ; and in the other, namely, against Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Cot\u00e9e the claim of the plaintiffs is for $1200 as for four calls upon $6,000 in the capital stock of the company alleged to be held by him, whereas his plea alleges that he subscribed only for $600 which he paid in full at the time of the subscription.\nThe oral as well as the documentary evidence is reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Languedoc for appellant :\n[The learned counsel reviewed the evidence and contended that it had been clearly proved \" when the defendant subscribed for the shares mentioned in the pleadings in this cause he did not know the nature or extent of the responsibilities he assumed.\"]\nThis has been admitted by the judgment Of the Superior Court and that of the Court of Appeals, and yet we are condemned to carry out a contract to which it is admitted we never were parties.\n1st. Because we were paid and took a dividend.\n2nd. Because we allowed two years to elapse without \"taking legal measures to have the contract set aside.\"\nWe respectfully submit their conclusion is erroneous on both the points on which they rest.\n1st. Payment to defendants of a dividend.\nIt is quite true they received ten per cent, on the money they handed to the local agents, but it is equally true that to use this as an argument against them, it must first be shown that it was their holding a greater number of shares than they claim that entitled them to get the money. Now, the three brothers when they subscribed paid cash down $1,000, $600 and $500 respectively, being the full and entire sums they meant to invest in the enterprise. The company declaring a dividend of ten percent. on the paid-up capital entitled them to receive ten per cent. on the sums which they had actually paid. When they had received this money they simply carried out the contract as they had from the first understood it to be and their conduct and their declarations are thoroughly consistent throughout.\nIt is upon the sum paid, not the sum subscribed, that the dividend was declared, and it always is so and therefore it is impossible to say that the defendants must be held to have subscribed $21,000 because they took that to which they were entitled by the fact of having paid $2,100, as the full price of twenty-one shares\nThe defendants having allowed two years to lapse, without taking legal measures to have the contract set aside, are held to have acquiesced in a contract to which they constantly and persistently declare they never became parties. With all possible respect we submit this results from a confusion of ideas which we will endeavor to clear. Contracts are either null or void able. When they are tainted with causes of nullity they exist none the less, till such causes of nullity are revealed and made to operate rescission. In such cases, the laches of the parties may estop them from setting up such nullities, nay more, the doctrine that a party to a voidable contract is bound to take active steps to rescind it with reasonable diligence after he becomes aware of the causes of nullity, is well established. But the very foundation of the doctrine is the existence of a contract.\nThe main feature which distinguishes the present case is that the contract alleged by the company never existed at all. The doctrine of acquiescence resulting from lapse of time or laches on the part of the defend ants can therefore have no application.\nBut supposing for a moment the contract to have existed and all the essential elements to be found in it, and that it was merely voidable, has there been on the part of the defendants such conduct as to justify the assumption that they ratified it ?\nIt is in evidence that immediately upon discovering that the agents had deceived them, the defendants, through Joseph one of them, came expressly to Quebec, saw the head agent, the secretary of the company ; tried to see the president ; did what they could to have the matter cleared up, and subsequently called on several different occasions on Mr. Belleau for the same purpose.\nNow what is the law on this subject. We find it in abundance of authority, for it is the same in France and England, and of so elementary a character as to leave no room for controversy: see Dalloz' R\u00e9pertoire de Jurisprudence ([1]); Swan v. The North British Australasian Company, limited ([2]) ; in re Russian (Vyk-sounsky) Iron Works Company, Kincaid's case ([3]) ; Taite's case ([4]) ; Oakes v. Turquand ([5]) ; The Bank of Hindustan, &c., v. Alison ([6]) ; Carr v. The London and North-Western Railway ([7]) ; Sharpley v. The Louth and East Coast Company ([8]) ; Ashbury Railway, Carriage and Iron Company v. Rich\u00e9 ([9]) ; ex parte Adamson, in re Collie ([10]) ; Aetna Insurance Co. in re Shiels ([11]); The Brolch-y-Plwm Lead Mining Company v. Baynes ([12]).\nMr. B\u00e9dard for respondents :\n[The learned counsel commented at length on the evidence to show that the contract alleged by plaintiffs was satisfactorily established.]\nBesides it must be remembered that the contract in this cause is in writing, and that by law no parol evidence can be adduced to contradict or vary the terms of a written document. See Civil Code of L. C. art. 1234 Abbot's Digest, On Corporations ([13]). The appellant has ratified his contract after having found out his error; and his plea cannot be admitted, because it comes too late, and because the parties are no longer in the same position.\nTo have a contract annulled on account of an error, it is not sufficient that a party should allege or prove an error, whatever it may be.\nError says Larombi\u00e8re ([14]) must be certain : In dubio nocet error erranti. If the error is a gross one, no one will believe it. Solere succurri non stultis sed errantibus.\nThe error set forth by the appellant, if proved, does not prevent the existence of the contract which subsists till annulled.\nThe last reason of the appellant is to the effect that he understood, that his contract was but for five shares and he says that, for the amount beyond that, the contract is null, has in fact no existence, and was therefore never susceptible of ratification.\nThe law enacts that the contract will be the one implied by the terms which express the agreement, and not that which either of the parties might have understood it to be. No matter what they may have had in their minds when contracting, they will have to abide by the terms they employed, because there is no other means to know their respective intentions at the time. In a word the law of convention is made to rule not the acts of will, but, using the words of Savigny, the manifestations of will ([15]).\nThere is no article of the code to declare that consent is necessary to the existence of a contract, because contract implies consent, and it would be, to say the least, useless to enact that where there is no consent, there is no contract. The law declares only that the convention is valid when the consent is legally expressed. It looks not to the consent, but to its manifestation; from the latter it implies the existence of the consent and determines its effect.\nArt 991 enacts that error violence and fraud are causes of nullity in contracts. Art. 992 declares that error is a cause of nullity only when it occurs in the nature of the contract itself or in the substance of the contract or in the substance of the thing which is the object of the contract. And lastly, art. 1000 goes on to say that error fraud and violence are not causes of absolute nullity in contracts, and only give a right of action or exception to annul or rescind them.\nMr. Languedoc in reply. RITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI am not sorry that my learned brethren have been enabled to arrive on this evidence at the conclusion which is so satisfactory to their own minds, because I think a judgment in opposition to the conclusions which they have expressed would operate with extreme hardship on these unfortunate men. I am not prepared to differ from the conclusions at which they have arrived and I do not intend to dissent from the judgment which they have given; but I must confess that the inclination of my mind has been in the consideration of this case that those parties were aware of the number of shares that they signed for. But I also think that they did not fully appreciate the large liability they thereby incurred, and they were influenced in subscribing for this number of shares by the influence and representations of an agent whose interest it was to induce these unfortunate men to take these large amounts of shares as it has been shown that they went abroad to get subscriptions to this stock, and for every share they were able to get subscribed they were to receive a certain amount of money. Therefore, it was their interest, in dealing with these ignorant people, to induce them to put down their names for as many shares as they could, and they represented, I am inclined to think from the evidence much more strongly than they should have done that no larger amount than they had paid at the time of subscription would be required by the company ; and that the subscribers only realized the extent of the obligation they had entered into and the risk they were running, on a careful examination of the prospectus and charter of the company and on consultation with their friends on the evening on which the subscription was made. I think there was very considerable force in the observation made by Mr. Justice Ramsay on this point, in which he says the proof that Cot\u00e9 knew the figures were $10,000 for 100 shares appears clearly from this : that he found, out the difficulty and the extent of his liability without reference to the share list, simply in conversation with his friends and from the statute. Also, I was very much impressed with the fact that the appellant and his brothers, after they discovered the extent to which they would be liable, appear to have consulted counsel, and they appear to have called upon the directors, and the directors seem to have repudiated any idea of the correctness of what they then put forward, and they remained quiescent, except the writing of the letters, taking no steps whatever to have the matter set right. I think they were aware of the fact that the company held them for the fifty shares. That was clearly brought home to them. They must have been aware that they were held for the fifty shares, and that the company absolutely refused to permit them to stand as shareholders for. five paid up shares ; and it would have been at variance with the prospectus and with the act with which it is evident these parties made themselves acquainted, by their own statement, to have stood as shareholders fully paid up for five shares alone, and knowing they were registered by the company as the holders of 100 shares. Here, I must say, I cannot agree with my learned brother, who says it was necessary that there should be an allotment of shares, or that there was no proof of allotment in this case. I think, under this statute, there was no necessity for an allotment.\nWhen the company sent out their books for subscriptions, and the parties subscribed for fifty shares, they became shareholders of the company, not by any subsequent allotment, but by operation of Jaw under the statute. Therefore, when they subscribed, and when they paid their five percent, down upon that subscription, they became, by force of this act, and without any act done by the company or by the parties themselves, shareholders and subscribers, and 1iable under this act to all the obligations the statute imposed upon them. When a dividend was declared, they must have known, from the knowledge they had of the act, that the dividend was not declared upon paid-up shares, because section three does not recognize that the whole amount is to be called in at once but can only he called in and accepted by the company in a certain way, 5 per cent. in the first instance, a further call of 5 per cent., and so on. Therefore when he received the dividend, I find it difficult to believe that the appellant did not know it had been delivered by the company on the fifty shares he held and subscribed for. Having received his share of the earnings, I also find it difficult to see that he is not a shareholder, and that he did not accept his position as shareholder, as he stood on the books of the company and therefore would not be liable because it must be borne in mind that while he remained and continued a shareholder for these two years the company was doing a prosperous business. It had paid a 10 per cent dividend; and it must be borne in mind also that conflagrations more extensive almost than ever known before\u2014exceptional conflagrations\u2014took place in the city of St. John and in other portions of Quebec by which this company, from a very prosperous state of business, was reduced to insolvency. Had this company had a number of years of prosperity and yearly declared large dividends, I do not see my way very clearly to the conclusion that this man could, from time to time have been allowed to receive these dividends, and when ultimately the company may have experienced any losses, he could then repudiate and claim not to be a shareholder, and accept the gains and refuse to bear his share of the liabilities In other words to use an expression which is to be found in the books with reference to cases of this kind that he should not be allowed to play fast and loose, that having received the benefits he should be liable to the loss he sustained.\nHowever, as I said before, as the judgment of my learned brothers on the facts of this case differs from the conclusions on the facts that I have stated now and as there is a conflict of evidence in the case, I do not intend to set up my judgment on the facts against theirs and differ from the 'conclusions they have arrived at on the case and which conclusions I am very gratified, on account of these people being poor they have been enabled to arrive at with satisfaction to themselves. At the same time having these doubts On my mind, I thought it proper to give expression to them, because if it had not been for the very strong and forcible judgment delivered by my brethren, if I had been left alone I should have come to a different conclusion, but I am happy to say that on the whole I shall not dissent from their judgment.\nSTRONG, J. :\u2014\nThe first question to be determined is one of fact. What was the contract which the appellant intended to make with the agents of the company who came to him to solicit his subscription for shares ? Did he intend to take fifty shares and to pay ten per cent, on the amount of those shares or did he intend to become a subscriber for five shares only paid up in full ?\nIt appears to me that the evidence of Genest, who is the only witness called by the respondents to prove what took place at the time of the subscription, is sufficiently contradicted by the evidence of the witnesses for the defendant, his brothers, the circumstances attending the transaction, and the probabilities. All depends on the testimony of witnesses,\u2014oral evidence; the writing itself does not assist us in solving this question. When the appellant signed his name to the subscription book, the columns for the amount of the subscription and the number of shares were left in blank. These columns were afterwards filled in with the number of shares (fifty shares) and the amount of the subscription by Genest himself, in the presence of the appellant, or at least of his brother Joseph. This is a fact of considerable importance in my view of the case, for had the number of shares and the amount of subscription been written by the appellant himself, or filled up before the signature, the legal consequences might have been different. As it is, according to Genet's own evidence, it must be taken to have been done by him acting as the mandatory or agent of the appellant, and it follows therefore that, if the appellant only intended to subscribe for five shares and not for fifty, Genest had no authority to make the entry he did, and his unauthorized act can therefore in no way bind the appellant, who did not assent to it. It is therefore assuming in favor of the company the very question in dispute, to say that the appellant signed his name to a subscription for fifty shares.\nThen, I think, Genest's evidence is extremely vague and unsatisfactory; in answer to very important questions in cross-examination, he says he is unable to remember what passed. Next, the conduct of the three brothers is altogether inconsistent with the supposition that they understood they were contracting for shares to a greater amount than the sums they actually paid in cash. They appear to have discovered their true position the same evening, and the elder of them went to Quebec the next morning, and endeavored, but ineffectually, to induce the company to relieve them from the larger liability. On the whole, all the surrounding circumstances are confirmatory of the evidence of the three brothers, and I agree with Mr. Justice Tessier in the Court of Queen's Bench, in holding that the appellant never entered into the contract to take the fifty shares in respect of which he issued on this action.\nHad the courts below taken a different view of the facts, it might have been a reason why this court should have hesitated before acting on a different view of the evidence. It does not appear, however, that the judges of the court below did come to a different conclusion in this respect. The Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, in his notes of judgment, expresses himself very decidedly to the effect that there was no contract, and from the first \"considerant \" of the judgment of the court of first instance, I am led. to the conclusion that that was also the view taken by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court.\nBoth the learned Chief Justices, however, attached much importance to the subsequent receipt by the appellant and his brothers of the dividend declared upon the paid-up capital. I was much impressed with this view at the hearing of the appeal, but subsequent consideration has convinced me it ought not to affect our judgment. According to the view I have taken of the evidence, the appellant never entered into any contract to take fifty shares, such a contract never existed, there was therefore never anything susceptible of ratification. Again, even if there had been a contract, but one voidable for error. the receipt of the 10 per cent. dividend on the amounts which the appellant and his brothers had actually paid in cash to the company would not have been such an unequivocal act of recognition and confirmation as would have been requisite to ratify a contract which might have been set aside in an action brought to establish its nullity. It was quite consistent with what they had always contended viz : that they were holders of shares for an amount \u00e9quivalent to the cash they had paid, but for no more, that they should have received the 10 per cent, declared on shares actually paid up in cash. I cannot, therefore, see that their receipt was any admission of their liability, or a renunciation of the right they had always claimed to have their shares limited to the amount they had paid.\nOn both these grounds I think the company's contention that there was ratification, fails.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs to the appellant in this court and in both the courts below.\nFOURNIER, J. :\nL'appelant, F.

Celui-ci \u00e0 son tour d\u00e9l\u00e9gua ses pouvoirs \u00e0 deux sous-agents, Genest et Delisle, pour recueillir des souscriptions dans Y Isle l'Isle Orl\u00e9ans qui faisait partie de la circonscription dans laquelle l'asgent principal, Belleau, \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 agir pour la compagnie. Le 29 octobre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e Genest et Delisle se pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent au moulin de Joseph Cot\u00e9, \u00e0 St. Pierre, Isle d' Orl\u00e9ans, pour remplir leur mission. L'entrevue qu'ils eurent avec l'appelant et ses fr\u00e8res, qui sont comme lui poursuivis pour quartre versements sur le montant des parts qu'ils auraient ainsi souscrites dans cette circonstance, est racont\u00e9e comme suit par Joseph Cot\u00e9 :\nDans la nuit du vingt-neuf octobre, mil huit cent soixante-quatorze, les deux agents que je viens de mentionner, sont venus au moulin me trouver, accompagn\u00e9s de deux do mes fr\u00e8res, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e et Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier, les deux autres d\u00e9fendeurs.\nIls m'ont demand\u00e9 de souscrire au fonda social do la compagnie Siadacona et demandant dix pour cent.\nJ'ai refuse, no voulant pas souscrire los dix pour cent ; et j'ai pass\u00e9 dans un autre appartement ; alors ils sont venus me trouver l\u00e0 et m'ont dit\nObjecte \u00e0 cette preuve.\nObjection r\u00e9serv\u00e9e.\nEn bien ! souscrivez mille piastres votre fr\u00e8re Am\u00e9d\u00e9e six cents piastres, et votre fr\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier cinq cents piastres, et cela sera tout ce que vous aurez \u00e0 payer et vous aurez dix pour cent de dividende sur ces montants-l\u00e0.\nAm\u00e9d\u00e9e Cot\u00e9 l'un des fr\u00e8res pr\u00e9sents dans cette occasion, donne la version suivante de ce qui s'y est pass\u00e9 :\nR.\u2014Ils sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la maison chez moi et m'ont fait des propositions tr\u00e8s-avantageuses \u00e0 propos de la souscription \u00e0 la Stadacona ; ils m'ont demand\u00e9 de prendre des parts, quo c'\u00e9tait un grand avantage L\u00e0-dessus je n'ai rien voulu faire sans voir mes fr\u00e8res qui \u00e9taient au moulin \u00e0 farine\nR. La ils ont racont\u00e9 \u00e0 mes fr\u00e8res la m\u00eame histoire qu'ils m'avaient cont\u00e9e \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame ils l'ont cont\u00e9e devant moi et mes fr\u00e8res qu'on a trouv\u00e9s l\u00e0 au moulin, disant quo c'\u00e9tait tr\u00e8s avantageux do prendre des parts,\nQ. Votre fr\u00e8re Joseph a-til dit quelque chose ?\u2014R. Il dit quo tant que pour payer dix pour cent il comprenait quo \u00e7a ne pouvait se faire, qu'il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait prendre un montant qui no donnerait aucun trouble, aucune responsabilit\u00e9 par la suite.\nQ. Votre fr\u00e9re Joseph a-t-il consenti \u00e0 souscrire dix pour cent ?\u2014 R. Eh non, quand its nous ont parl\u00e9 do dix pour cent, ii (Joseph) nous a laiss\u00e9, disant qu'il no voulait pas do \u00e7a. Les agents ne nous ont pas laiss\u00e9s et nous les avons conduits dans le bateau o\u00f9 mon fr\u00e8re Joseph \u00e9tait, et l\u00e0 ils ont dit a mon fr\u00e8re qu'il pouvait prendre un montant comme \u00e7a. puisqu'il ne voulait pas souscrire dix pour cent seulement; qu'ils feraient comme \u00e7a puisqu'il ne voulait pas souscrire autrement.\nQ. Les agents ont-ils dit qu'ils prendraient les souscriptions de vos fr\u00e8res et la v\u00f4tre dans les m\u00e9mes conditions ?\u2014 R. Oui.\nQ, Ensuite ?\u2014\u2014'R.

Etes-vous positif l\u00e0-dessus?\u2014R.Oui, mon fr\u00e8re Joseph mille piastres ($1000) et mon fr\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois Xavier, cinq cents piastres ($500).\nLes trois fr\u00e8res mirent leur signature sur 1\u00a9 livre de stock, sans specifier ni le nombre d'actions qu'ils souscrivaient, ni le total auquel se montait leur souscription, croyant, comme ils le disent, ne souscrire que pour les montants qu'ils avaient pay\u00e9s comptant. Les entr\u00e9es du nombre de parts et de leur total ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par les agents eux-m\u00eames, hors la presence des C\u00f4t\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s la version de ceux-ci, et sans qu'on leur e\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les montants ainsi entr\u00e9s \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rents de ceux pay\u00e9s. Cette version est contredite par Genest, qui d\u00e9clare avoir obtenu cette souscription de la mani\u00e8re ordinaire, comme il avait fait avec tous ceux qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 souscrit. Ii dit qu'il a donn\u00e9 toutes les explications n\u00e9cessaires qu'il avait coutume de donner en pareil cas. 11 ajoute qu'il avait pour s'aider un prospectus de la compagnie, qu'il leur a expliqu\u00e9,\u2014qu'il leur a dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas probable que tout le montant serait appel\u00e9, que ce n'\u00e9tait pas l'intention de la compagnie de demander plus quills ne payaient; mais que cependant, ils \u00e9taient responsables pour tout le montant de parts qu'ils souscriraient, et qu'il ne leur a pas dit cela rien qu'une fois. Ii dit aussi avoir mentionn\u00e9 le nombre de parts le montant souscrit et le montant pay\u00e9 pour le premier et le deuxi\u00e8me versements. Ce t\u00e9moignage avec la production du livre de stock constitue la preuve sur laquelle la compagnie so fonde pour demander l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat qu'elle pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'appelant. Ainsi qu'on le voit, ii y \u00e1 doux versions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es. Si celle de Genest est la v\u00e9ritable, ii est \u00e9vident que l'appelant doit succomber. Il doit au contraire r\u00e9ussir, ai celle donn\u00e9e par ses deux fr\u00e8res, Joseph et Am\u00e9d\u00e9e, est accept\u00e9e. Il s'agit done en grande partie dune appr\u00e9ciation de t\u00e9moignages.\nIl faut d'abord remarquer quo la d\u00e9position de Genest n'est aucunement corrobor\u00e9e. Il tait au pouvoir de la compagnie de le faire puisqu'elle avait un autre agent pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 cette entrevue, le nomm\u00e9 Delisle, Pourquoi n'a-t-il pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 ? Est-ce quo l'on a redout\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage, est-ce que par hasard los quelques mots qu'il a dits auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 une confirmation du r\u00e9cit dos Cot\u00e9 ? Quoi qu'il en soit, on no pout pas tirer de l'absence do Delisle d'autre conclusion contre la compagnie que celle qu'elle n'a Pu corroborer le t\u00e9moignage de Genest. Ainsi, on se trouve d'une part, en pr\u00e9sence d'un version donn\u00e9e par un soul t\u00e9moin, et de l'autre, celle donn\u00e9e par deux t\u00e9moins. Il est vrai quo l'on peut dire quo ceux-ci sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, puisqu'ils ont un proc\u00e8s semblable, reposant sur los memos preuves ; mais \u00e0 part cela rien no fait voir quo leur t\u00e9moignage no soit pas digne de foi. Genest lui-m\u00eame est aussi int\u00e9ress\u00e9, car il avait une assez forte commission sur le nombre do parts qu'il faisait souscrire. Il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 tant par part ; il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 en rapporter le plus grand nombre possible. Si l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat so contrebalance, la version des deux Got\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre, re\u00e7ue. Il y a do plus dans la d\u00e9p\u00f4sition de Genest, l'affirmation d'un fait important sur lequel ii est contredit par des t\u00e9moins \u00e9trangers et d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Cette circonstance est de nature a affecter consid\u00e9rablement son t\u00e9moignage Il dit :\" J'ai donn\u00e9 toutes les explications n\u00e9cessaires et que j' avais coutume de donner en pareil cas,\"\u2014plus., loin : \" J'ai voulu les mettre en \u00e9tat de conna\u00eetre la chose aussi clairement qu'il y avait moyen non-seulement avec eux. mais avec toutes les personnes que j'ai fait souscrire\" ; \" J'ai donn\u00e9 les m\u00eames explications \u00e0 tout le monde.\" Cette assertion positive est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e encore sons d'autres formes. Sur ce point cependant ii est formellement contredit par trois t\u00e9moins tout-\u00e0-fait d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nBasile Marquis raconte ainsi sa rencontre avec les sous-agents Genest et Delisle :\nIls m'ont demand\u00e9 de prendre des actions pour au moins $10.00 ; que si je souscrivais une part \u00e7a ne serait que $10.00, les actions \u00e9tant de dix piastres chacune, quo je no m engageais pas pour plus quo cola. Je leur dis que je n'avais que $5.00, sur quoi ils me r\u00e9pondirent qu'ils accepteraient ces cinq piastres-l\u00e0 et me donneraient deux ou trois mois pour payer la balance. Sous ces circonstances; j'ai pris une part que je croyais de dix piastres, ayant seulement souscrit pour cette somme. Ce n'est que dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi du m\u00eame jour ou le lendemain quo je me suis aper\u00e7u que les parts \u00e9taient de cent piastres et non pas dix piastres.\nIl est admis par les parties que les deux t\u00e9moins Phydime Ferland et Leon Aubin prouveraient les m\u00eames faits. Comment apr\u00e8s cela ajouter foi \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de Genest qu'il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant les m\u00eames explications qu'il a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 tout le monde ? Nest-il pas \u00e9vident qu'il n'a a pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur cc sujet, et ne peut-on pas raisonnablement en conclure qu'il a employ\u00e9 pour obtenir la souscription des Cot\u00e9 le stratag\u00e8me qui lui avait r\u00e9ussi avec d\u2019autres. En acceptant les montants pay\u00e9s par les Cot\u00e9, il a sans doute fait avec eux ce qu'il avait fait avec Marquis\u2014il a r\u00e9parti les sommes pay\u00e9es par eux pour les premier et deuxi\u00e8me Versements sur les parts qu'il leur attribue sans leur en avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le montant, au lieu d'entrer leurs actions comme pay\u00e9es en plein. Cette conclusion est d'autant mieux fond\u00e9e qu'il est en preuve que les Cot\u00e9 ont pay\u00e9 tout ce quill\u00e9s avaient d'argent ; que l'un d'eux a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 oblige d'emprunter $50.00 pour parfaire son montant. Est-il \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que ces trois individus qui paraissent des gens honn\u00eates et respectables, mais dont la fortune totale s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 peine a $3,000 auraient engage leur responsabilit\u00e9 pour le montant de $21000 ? Je crois au contraire que la seule mention de ce chiffre les e\u00fbt tellement effrayes qu'ils auraient absolument refus\u00e9 de n'avoir rien \u00e0 faire avec la compagnie et qu'ils se seraient ainsi \u00e9pargn\u00e9s les proc\u00e8s qu'ils ont \u00e0 soutenir.\nD'apr\u00e8s l'expos\u00e9 ci-dessus, ii parait certain que dans ses d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de C\u00f4te, Genest voulait leur faire prendre un montant plus consid\u00e9rable de parts que ceux-ci n'\u00e9taient disposes \u00e0 le faire ; il pretend avoir fait souscrire \u00e0 l'appelant 50 parts. Celui-ci au contraire d\u00e9clare n'en avoir souscrit que ci\u00f1q qu'il a pay\u00e9es en plein. Il est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage, que chacune des deux parties voulait une chose diff\u00e9rente que leur consentement n'a pas porte sur une m\u00eame chose, faisant l'objet du contrat dont ii est question. Le concours de volont\u00e9s, condition essentielle de l'existence du contrat, na done pas eu lieu,u cons\u00e9quemment ii n'y a pas eu de contrat, faute d'accord entre les parties. C'est le point de vue que j'adopte. Cette appr\u00e9ciation ne m'\u00e9loigne gu\u00e8re des opinions exprim\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet par les deux honorables juges en chef de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et du Bane de la Reine. L'honorable juge en chef Meredith dit dans son jugement :\nWhen. the Defendant subscribed for the shares mentioned in the pleadings in this cause, he did not know the nature or extent of the responsibilities he assumed. Sir A. A. Dorion done ainsi son appr\u00e9ciation du m\u00eame fait :\nIl n'y a aucun doute quo l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit \u00e0 souscrire des actions dans la compagnie d'assurance Stadacona, sans trop comprendre la responsabilit\u00e9 qu'il assumait.\nEt plus loin il ajoute :\nJe conclus donc d'apr\u00e8s cette preuve, quo le contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la compagnie n'est pas prouv\u00e9.\nAussi, l'appelant sans l'acceptation qu'il a faite d'un dividende, et le d\u00e9lai qu'il a laiss\u00e9 \u00e9couler sans prendre des mesures judiciaires pour faire rescinder cette souscription, aurait-il en gain de cause aupr\u00e8s des deux honorables juges en chef Ces deux circonstances constituent dans l'opinion des deux honorables \"juges une ratification ou confirmation du contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 Jaquelle a l'effet suivant eux de le rendre responsable.\nEn effet, ii est \u00e9tabli que l'appelant a re\u00e7u un dividende de 10 pour cent qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par un cheque dans la forme suivante :\nCompagnie d'Assurance Stadacona contre le Feu et sur la Vie \u2014\u2014 Premier Dividende.\u2014Qu\u00e9bec, 25 janvier 1876.\u2014Au caissier do la Banque d'Union du Bas-Canada ; payez \u00e0 ou ordre piastres, \u00e9tant pour dividende sur capital verse au trente et un d\u00e9cembre 1875.\nMais ce dividende avait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 sur cinquante actions, dont dix pour cent avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es, on bien sur cinq actions pay\u00e9es en entier ? Rien no le fait voir Le cheque ne fait mention ni du nombre de parts ni de leur total l il y est seulement fait mention que le dividende est r\u00e9parti sur le montant verse. On ne peut donc de ce fait tirer aucune conclusion contre la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'il n'a souscrit que cinq parts pay\u00e9es en plein. Il n'a, dans ce cas touch\u00e9 que ce qu'il devait recevoir conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce cheque. Si, au contraire, il avait souscrit, comme le pr\u00e9tend la compagnie, cinquante parts sur 1esquelles dix pour cent seulement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ii est vrai qu'il n'aurait encore touch\u00e9 que le m\u00eame montant. De que si, d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 la compagnie peut dire que l'appelant a accept\u00e9 le nombre de parts qu'elle lui a attribu\u00e9, en acceptant ce dividende de l'autre, celui-ci peut r\u00e9pondre que la compagnie a au contraire acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9tention qu'il n'avait souscrit que cinq actions enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9es en lui payant, comme le comporte le cheque, un dividende sur le montant par lui verse. Ce fait pouvant \u00eatre, avec autant de raison, invoqu\u00e9 par chacune des parties \u00e0 l'appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions, ne peut en cons\u00e9quence servir ni l'une ni l'autre, ni affecter en aucune mani\u00e8re leurs positions. Mais si le cheque, au lieu d'\u00eatre con\u00e7u comme ii l'est, avait comport\u00e9 que le dividende pay\u00e9 et re\u00e7u \u00e9tait sur cinquante actions dont dix tour cent avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pav\u00e9 c'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 indubitablement une confirmation du contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et la nullit\u00e9 dont ii \u00e9tait \u00e9tait entach\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 couverte. C'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 alors donner valablement, quoique tacitement, le consentement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la formation du contrat et de ce moment-l\u00e0 seulement le contrat e\u00fbt exist\u00e9. Puisqu'avant l'acceptation du dividende ii n'y avait pas de contrat, il faut que le fait oppose \u00e0 l'appelant soit suffisant pour en former un, et certes, l'acceptation de ce dividende auquel ii avait droit suivant ses pr\u00e9tentions ne constitue pas un consentement d'accepter les 50 parts qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pudi\u00e9es.\nSi le juge ne doit comme le dit l'autorit\u00e9 de Dalloz cit\u00e9e par l'on. juge Tessier, \" prononcer qu'avec la plus g grande r\u00e9serve et ne d\u00e9clarer qu'il y a acquiescement \" que lorsque les faits on actes d\u00e9montrent l'intention \"formelle de la partie de se soumettre,\" il est \u00e9vident que l'acceptation du dividende dans les circonstances o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite n'implique aucunement l'intention de la part de l'appelant de se d\u00e9partir de sa pr\u00e9tention qu'il n'avait souscrit que cinq parts. Cette acceptation n'est nullement en contradiction avec sa pretention ; elle en est\u00e9 plut\u00f4t une confirmation si elle a quelque signification, et ne peut par cons\u00e9quent lui \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e.\nD'ailleurs le pr\u00e9tendu contrat invoqu\u00e9 par la compagnie n'ayant jamais exist\u00e9, faute de consentement, n'\u00e9tait pas susceptible de confirmation. Il en pourrait \u00eatre autrement s'il y avait eu Un consentement, quoique vici\u00e9 par le dol, l'erreur ou par quelque autre cause.\nLaurent ([16]) s'exprime ainsi an sujet de la confirmation des actes\nConfirmer une obligation c'est renoncer au droit que l'on a d'en demander la nullit\u00e9 \u00e0 raison du vice dont elle est atteinte. La confirmation a pour but et pour effet d'effacer ce vice, de sorte que l'obligation quoique nulle dans son principe est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9e.\nLe m\u00eame auteur au No. 531 faisant la distinction entre les obligations annulables et les obligations inexistantes, dit :\nIl no faut pas confondre los obligations annulables avec los obligations inexistantes Nous avons \u00e9tabli ailleurs la diff\u00e9rence qui existe entre les actes nuls, c'est-\u00e0-dire annulables, et los actes que la doctrine appelle inexistants, parce qu'ils n'ont pas d'existence aux yeux do la loi. en ce sens quo la loi ne leur reconna\u00eet aucun effet. Les actes nuls donnent seuls lieu. \u00e0 une action en nullit\u00e9. Quant aux actes inexistants, on ne peut logiquement en demander l'annulation; car on ne demande pas la nullit\u00e9 du n\u00e9ant. Si l'on m'oppose un contrat auquel je n'ai pas consenti, j'ai sans doute le droit de le repousser, mais je no demande pas au juge do l'annuler, car ce contrat n'existe pas puisqu'il n'y a pas de contrat sans consentement. Je demanderai que le juge d\u00e9clare qu'il n'y a jamais eu do contrat Jo puis prendre l'initiative en agissant on justice pour qu'il soit d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le contrat, quo l'on pourrait un jour m'opposera moi, ou \u00e0 mes h\u00e9ritiers, n'a pas d'existence l\u00e9gale. Lo jugement ne l'annulera pas. il d\u00e9clarera qu'il manque do l'une des conditions requises pour son existence et que par suite ii no peut produire aucun effet.\"\nLe deuxi\u00e8me motif du jugement attaque, consistant \u00e0 dire que l'appelant ne peut plus opposer les vices dont on admet que son contrat est entach\u00e9, parce qu'il a laiss\u00e9 \u00e9couler un d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e8s de deux ans, sans prendre aucune mesure judiciaire pour faire rescinder sa souscription, no me para\u00eet pas fond\u00e9 en loi. Pour lui opposer ce moyen avec succ\u00e8s, il faudrait \u00e9tablir par quelque texte de droit qu'il \u00e9tait oblige d'agir dans le d\u00e9lai de deux ans. Jo n'en connais pas. Si l'on adopte l'opinion qu'il n'y a pas eu contrat, faute do consentement, dans ce cas l'appelant avait trente ans pour agir s'il le jugeait \u00e0 propos. Il aurait pu, comme le dit l'autorit\u00e9 cit\u00e9e ci-dessous, prendre l'initiative, mais cc n'est qu'une facult\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait libre d'exercer ou non, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9. Le d\u00e9faut de le faire ne pouvait pas le priver de son droit d\u2019invoquer pendant trente ans l'inexistence du contrat quand il lui serait oppose. Dans le cas ou l'on consid\u00e9rerait qu'il y a eu contrat, mais que le consentement \u00e0 ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9 par le dol ou l'erreur, le contrat \u00e9tant annulable seulement, l'appelant avait encore en vertu do l'art. 2253 0.0. de Qu\u00e9bec dix ans pour prendre son action en nullit\u00e9. Ces deux propositions sont clairement \u00e9tablies pal l'autorit\u00e9 suivante ([17]):\nLa diff\u00e9rence est grande entre la nullit\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par le juge ou le jugement par lequel il d\u00e9clare qu'il n'y a pas en do contrat. Dans le premier cas la partie doit agir dans les dix ans, sinon le contrat est valide par son silence en vertu d'une confirmation tacite) et elle no pourra m\u00eame plus, dans notre opinion, opposer l\u2019exception do nullit\u00e9. Tandis quo, s'il n'y a point de contrat, lo pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9biteur pourra toujours demander par voie d'action ou d'exception, quo le juge le d\u00e9lie du lien apparent d'une obligation qui n\u2019existe point ; aucune confirmation, ni expresse, ni tacite, no peut \u00eatre oppose, car on ne confirme pas le n\u00e9ant.\nVoir encore le m\u00eame auteur aux Nos. 559 et 560.\nLa doctrine contenue dans los citations ci-dessus est confirm\u00e9e par les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans Jo factum de l'appelant. Si, comme je le pense, il n'y a pas eu contrat, lappelant avait trente ans pour agir, et dans le cas o\u00f9 le contrat ne serait qu'annulable \u00e0 cause du consentement vici\u00e9, l'appelant avait dix ans pour en demander ou opposer la nullit\u00e9. Ainsi l'on ne peut lui opposer son d\u00e9faut d'action judiciaire pendant deux ans comme une preuve qu'il a acquiesc\u00e9 au contrat, puisque dans un cas il avait trente ans et dans l'autre dix ans pour agir.\nCependant l'appelant, quoiqu'il ne fut pas oblige, pour se maintenir dans ses droits, de prendre l'initiative d'aucunes demarches, s'est empress\u00e9, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte de l'erreur dont ii se plaint d'en donner information \u00e0 la compagnie. En effet, aussit\u00f4t que les trois fr\u00e8res Cot\u00e9 se sont aper\u00e7us qu'ils pouvaient \u00eatre inscrits comme actionnaires pour de plus forts montants que ceux qu'ils avaient pay\u00e9s, ils ont envoy\u00e9 leur fr\u00e8re Joseph pour informer la compagnie des faits tels qu'ils s'\u00e9taient pass\u00e9s. Joseph Cot\u00e9 s'adressa \u00e0 M. Lindsay, le secr\u00e9taire de la compagnie, et \u00e0 M. Belleau, l'agent principal pour les souscriptions du stock. M. Lindsay comprit la justice des representations faites par Joseph Cot\u00e9 mais M. Belleau refusa d'intervenir pour faire rectifier la souscription. Cot\u00e9 fit aussi des d\u00e9marches pour rencontrer M. J. B. Renaud, le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, mais n'ayant Pu r\u00e9ussir \u00e0le voir, il retourna chez lui d\u00e9courag\u00e9 et \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s convaincu qu'il n'y avait pas moyen d'obtenir justice, mais sans avoir fait aucun acte, ni prononc\u00e9 une parole que l'on puisse consid\u00e9rer comme un acquiescement \u00e0 la souscription qu'on voulait lui imposer. L'appelant et ses fr\u00e8res s'en tinrent l\u00e0, jusqu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du dividende dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 parl\u00e9 plus haut. Etaient-ils obliges de faire plus ? Certainement non d'\u00e2pres les autorit\u00e9s ci-haut cit\u00e9es. Mais la compagnie elle-m\u00eame inform\u00e9e comme elle d\u00fbt l'\u00eatre par son secr\u00e9taire et par l'agent Belleau, n'\u00e9tait-elle pas oblig\u00e9e d'intervenir imm\u00e9diatement et de r\u00e9gler le diff\u00e9rend. On oppose de la n\u00e9gligence \u00e0 l'appelant qui, en loi, n'\u00e9tait pas oblige d'agir, et l'on perd de vue que d'apr\u00e8s son pr\u00e9tendu contrat, l'initiative \u00e9tait obligatoire pour la compagnie. Quel est en effet le pr\u00e9tendu contrat dont ii s'agit ? En voici la teneur, telle qu'on la trouve dans les papiers qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de la cour, transmis par les parties, depuis l'audition de lacause :\nThe undersigned do hereby agree to take, and they hereby do take and subscribe to the number of shares in the said company set opposite to their respective signature, or any portion thereof' as may be allotted ' by the provincial board of directors, the whole subject to such conditions contained in the Act incorporating the said company.\nLe contrat entre les actionnaires et la compagnie est conditionnel, comme on le voit par le fait que celle-ci se r\u00e9serve d'accorder le nombre ou seulement une partie du nombre des parts souscrites, tel que son bureau de direction pourra en faire la r\u00e9partition. Cette r\u00e9partition a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 faite . On n'en sait rien le fait n'est pas prouv\u00e9. Avis en a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant ? On ne le sait pas davantage. Cependant il est clair qu'il \u00e9tait du devoir de la compagnie de se conformer \u00e0 la condition qu'elle a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'introduire dans son contrat. Elle eut Pu se dispenser de l'y ins\u00e9rer comme on le verra par la 2me section de son acte d'incorporation 37 Vic., ch. 94 sec. 2:\nBooks of subscription shall be opened in the City of Quebec and elsewhere at the discretion of the directors, and shall remain open so long as and in the manner that they shall deem it proper after giving due public notice thereof, which said shares shall be and are hereby vested in the several persons, firm or corporations who shall subscribe for the same, their legal representatives and assigns subject to the provisions of this Act.\nD'apr\u00e8s cette section laseule souscription au livre de stock eut \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante pour former un contrat pariait. Mais exer\u00e7ant les pouvoirs que leur donne la sec. 24, les directeurs out sagement pens\u00e9 qu'il devait se r\u00e9server le droit de contr\u00f4ler la souscription, et pour cela ils se sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9s le droit den faire la repartition comme bon leur semblerait. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re dont la souscription des Cot\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue, et surtout, connaissant que cette souscription \u00e9tait tout-\u00e0-fait hors de proportion avec leurs moyens, n'\u00e9tait-t-il pas du devoir des directeurs de ne leur accorder qu'un montant de parts en rapport avec leur fortune ? En ne le faisant pas, ils ont manqu\u00e9 d'accomplir une condition de leur contrat et commis une injustice envers leurs assures, en laissant sur leur livre de stock des actions qui ne valaient rien. Si la repartition eat \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et qu'avss en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, la r\u00e9ception du dividende apr\u00e8s cela, e\u00fbt pu, sans doute leur \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e. 13 apr\u00e8s ce qui precede je crois que c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre l'initiative en faisant la r\u00e9partition du stock et non pas \u00e0 l'appelant, comme je crois l'avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haut.\nPour ces consid\u00e9rations je suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThe respondent company claims in this action that the appellant is a stockholder in it to the extent of fifty shares, while he alleges himself as such only to the extent of five shares. The right of the respondents to recover depends on their showing him to be a stockholder beyond the number of five shares. The appellant, whose statement is sustained by other witnesses, alleges that he only agreed with the canvassing, agent to take five shares, and that for them he paid the whole amount, and was entitled to have received a certificate for them as fully paid up. The agent (Genest) who dealt with him alleges he agreed to take, and with full knowledge of what he was doing, signed the stock list for, the fifty shares. His testimony is not corroborated, although it appears another agent of the company was present at the transaction, and might have been called for that purpose if he would have done so. The stock book, when produced, corroborates Genest's statement, but the appellant swears that he did not know it had been filled up for more than the five shares and that his signature was fraudulently obtained. He is a comparatively uneducated farmer, and one shown to have been in no circumstances to have taken so large an amount of stock. The learned judge who tried the cause found in favor of the appellant's evidence, and. after carefully considering it, I feel bound to say that, so far from differing with his conclusions, were I in his place I would have decided as he did. This view of the result of the evidence seems to have been subsequently adopted in the two courts below. How, then, does the case stand ? The appellant agreed to take five shares, but was fraudulently got to put his name to a stock list for fifty. Did the respondents case rest here it would be a plain one against them. The fraud would render the contract, not necessarily void, but voidable by the appellant. Under the evidence, however, I consider it was a good contract for five shares. Taking the testimony of the appellant and his witnesses there was a verbal agreement for five shares, and the money for them paid in full. The fraud or mistake in inserting fifty in the stock list could have been corrected, and the agreement for the five enforced. But, although it was not so corrected, it does not therefore follow either that there was no contract, or that there was one for fifty shares. Immediately on the discovery of it he appealed to the manager of the company, with whom he had several interviews, informed him of the circumstances in evidence, and repudiated the contract beyond five shares. Amongst other things, he was told by the manager to keep himself quiet, that the sum paid was all he would have to pay. It appears that this satisfied the appellant and his two brothers, who were similarly situated, and they became quiet as desired, no doubt, in my mind, thinking the error would be corrected, and the contracts they had really made carried out. We should construe the acts and dealings of those illiterate men very differently from those of persons of legal or technical acquirements, and from a totally different standpoint. I make this remark in view of another question affecting the decision of the case I intend hereafter to refer to.\nThere was then, no binding contract on the appellant for more than five shares. Has he by his subsequent conduct adopted the contract for the fifty ? It is alleged that he has done so by the acceptance of a cheque for a 10 per cent, dividend the following year. A counterpart of the cheque (with a blank for the name of the payee and the amount) is in evidence, and it states the payment to have been for a dividend upon paid up capital to the 31st December, 1875. The amount in the cheque was the dividend on the sum he had actually paid. It might have been intended by the manager or officer of the company who sent it as a dividend on the paid up capital on the fifty shares, for the amount would be the same in either case, but there is no evidence to show how it was intended. There is no reference in the cheque to the number of shares for which it was sent, nor was there anything to bring to the mind or notice of the appellant that it was for a dividend on the fifty shares nor does it show whether it was intended as a dividend on the fifty shares or on the five. The amount was calculated on the capital paid up and in the absence of any proof, why are we to assume that it was intended for the one any more than the other; and still further, how can we be called upon to assume that the appellant so received or understood it. The cheque told him that it was a dividend on paid-up capital. He had paid in an amount sufficient to entitle him to a dividend, and had no reason to presume it was intended to have reference at all to fifty shares. Whether he was to be held for fifty or five shares was not a subject then necessarily brought to his mind by the words of the cheque. Besides neither the rate of the dividend nor the time for which it was made up was stated, so that he was in no position to make any calculations as to the amount sent him, or the purpose for which it was sent. The receipt by him of the cheque is, however, relied on to prove that he acquiesced in his remaining as a subscriber of fifty shares. I cannot so receive it. To amount to an estoppel, the language or conduct of the acting party sought to be affected must be pointed and unequivocal and must leave no reasonable doubt. Here I think, no such evidence is furnished by the cheque or otherwise. The doctrine of estoppel is necessarily applicable in cases like the present, and if with full knowledge a party accepts a position tendered by another, he is estopped from taking one inconsistent with it. If the appellant was shown with his eyes open to have accepted the cheque on fifty shares, he would not be permitted afterwards to repudiate it, but the evidence before us falls far short of establishing that position. If the filling up the fifty shares was a fraud, the appellant, of course, could have repudiated the whole transaction, and obliged the company to repay the money paid them. He, in that case, should not, however, have received any dividend, but ought to receive back his money. His receipt of the dividend for the money he paid in does not, however, estop him from contending that his contract was but for five shares. When he applied to the manager shortly after subscribing for the stock, he was lulled into security, and when he subsequently received the cheque, he might very properly conclude that if the company intended to hold him for fifty shares, no dividend would be paid him until the dispute was adjusted, he having so forcibly protested against holding any stock beyond five shares, and informed the manager the signature for more was a fraud. I think the company with greater propriety, by sending him the cheque on his paid-up capital, might, under the circumstances, be held estopped from claiming him to have been a holder beyond the five shares. I don't agree with the proposition that there was no contract existing, for, if it had been ab initio void for fraud, there must have been a new one entered into between the parties before an action could have been maintained at all. It was, in my opinion, binding on the company, and the appellant might have adopted it had he so elected to do, but instead of that he repudiated anything beyond five shares, and for those five shares I think there was an enforceable contract. It seems to have been admitted throughout, that but for the receipt of the dividend by the appellant, the respondents would have no claim to recover. I am decidedly of the opinion that the receipt of the dividend by the cheque, under the circumstances, is per se no evidence of acquiescence in, or ratification of, the contract sued on. it is objected that the appellant should have within two years taken action to set aside the agreement, as it appears by the stock list. Article 2,258, C.C. however, provides that in cases of fraud, there is a prescription of ten years from the time it is discovered.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the judgments below reversed, and judgment given for the appellant, with costs. GWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nThis action is by the company to enforce a contract alleged to have been entered into by the defendant, whereby, as is alleged, he became the holder of fifty shares, amounting to $5,000 in the capital stock of the company we have no occasion therefore to refer to the numerous cases decided under the Companies' Clauses Act in England which lay down the broad distinction which exists between the rights of the creditors of a company against a subscriber for shares in the company and the rights of the company against - such a person disputing his liability to the company upon the ground of the fraud and misrepresentations of the agents of the company by which his subscription was obtained. In (Jakes v. Tar quand ([18]), the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chelmsford, alluding to this distinction, says :\nIf this had been a case between Oakes and. the company in which he sought to be relieved from his contract as in the Venezuela Railway Company v. Kisch ([19]), or the company had been suing him for calls as in Bwlch-y-plwm Lead Mining Company v. Baynes ([20]), he would have succeeded in the one case and the company would have failed in the other, on the ground which I venture to think was correctly laid down in the recent case of the Western Bank of Scotland v. Addie ([21]) in this House that when a person has been drawn into a contract to purchase shares belonging to a company by fraudulent misrepresentations, and I would add by a fraudulent concealment of the directors, and the directors seek to enforce that contract, or the person who has been deceived institutes a suit against the company to rescind the contract on the ground of fraud, the purchaser cannot be held to his contract, because a company cannot retain any benefit which they have obtained through the fraud of their agent\nThe equitable rights of creditors against shareholders have nothing whatever to do with the present action, which rests upon the allegations of contract contained in the declaration, and must be determined by the ordinary principles of common law as applied to matters of contract. .As was said by Bram-well, B., in the Bwlch-y-plwm Leud Mining Company v. Baynes ([22]) if the defendant is liable it is because he has undertaken to fulfil the duties of a shareholder in consideration of the plaintiffs giving him the benefits of one.\" The action rests upon the allegation that the defendant is the holder of fifty shares in the capital stock of the company upon which certain calls have been made which are due and unpaid by the defendant; the defendant by his plea denies that he ever became the holder of more than five shares in such capital stock which he alleges he paid up in full at the time of taking them. To entitle the plaintiffs to maintain this action, they must clearly establish it to be true that the defendant is the holder of the fifty shares, as alleged in the declaration or at least that the defendant is the holder of more shares in the capital stock of the company than the five which the defendant alleges he paid up in full That the defendant paid to the plaintiff a sum. of money equal to the full amount of five shares which is equal to 10 per cent. upon fifty shares is not disputed, but the question raised is, as in the Bank of Hindustan vs. Alison ([23]) is the defendant in point of fact the holder of the fifty shares as alleged by the plaintiffs, or of any greater number than the five paid up in full as denied by the defendant, or has he estopped himself from saying that he is not ?\nNow, if the evidence of the defendant's brothers is to be taken as representing truly what passed between the defendant and the company's agent (the brothers each give evidence for the others in the three several actions) there can be no doubt that they were all grossly deceived and entrapped into the appearance of having signed what they never contemplated signing, and what in point of fact they never did sign or agree to. They say most distinctly that when applied to by Mr. Genest as agent of the company to take shares in the company, and to pay 10 per cent., thereon, they absolutely refused to do so, saying that for what they should take, if they should take any shares, they would pay in full once and for all and that the agent of the company, finding them resolved upon this point, at length said to Joseph (the eldest of the brothers, who spoke for the others), in presence of the others :\nEh bien souscrivez mille piastres, votre fr\u00e8re \u00c1med\u00e9e six cents piastres et votre fr\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois Xavier cinq cents piastres, et cela sera tout ce que vous aurez \u00e0 paver et vous aurez dix par cent de dividende sur ces montants l\u00e0.\nThat this was eventually agreed upon, and thereupon they each signed their respective names in a book presented to them by the agent and paid the above several sums as in full for all the amounts they respectively desired to take in the capital stock of the company. They say, also, that they never wrote in this book the matter which now appears in it set opposite to their respective names, namely :\nOpposite the name Joseph Col\u00e9, \" St. Piere Isle d' Orleans, $10,000; 100 shares\u2014167.''\nOpposite the name of Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Cot\u00e9, \" St. Pierre lie d'Orleans, $6000; 60 shares 168.\"\nOpposite the name of F. X. Cot\u00e9, \" St. Piere Ile d Orleans, $5,000; 50 shares 168.\"\nThat these must have been all written by the agent of the defendant afterwards, and without their authority, knowledge or consent.\nMr. Genest, agent of the plaintiffs while admitting that this additional matter is in his handwriting written after the parties had signed their names says that it was done by him in their presence ; and to carry out what he says he clearly understood to be the intention of the parties to whom, as he says, he fully explained the amounts and numbers of shares so written down, and although he admits that he told them it was not the intention of the company to call in more than they had paid, he says he explained to them that they would nevertheless he responsible to the above amounts.\nAgainst the interest which it is urged the brothers have to support the contention of each other, as affecting the weight of their evidence, is to be set the interest which Mr. Genest admits he had in getting subscriptions for as many shares as possible in the books in his hands, for that he was paid 25 cents per share upon all the shares so appearing in such book, and the further interest that he has to free himself from the charge of fraud imputed to him by the brothers Col\u00e9, It sufficiently appears by evidence, which is not attempted to be impeached by any contradictory evidence, that the total amounts above set opposite the names of the brothers Cot\u00e9 is six or seven times in excess of the united property of all three combined ; and that the now defendant F. X. Cot\u00e9, when he paid the $500 paid by him, paid more than the whole of what he was worth, and that he had to borrow $50 from his brother Joseph to make up the amount. We start therefore with a strong presumption, in support of the assertion of these poor farmers, that they never contemplated taking, and absolutely refused to take, any greater amount in the capital stock of the plaintiff's company than they paid for in full at the time. The learned Chief Justice Meredith, before whom the case was tried in the court of first instance, was satisfied by the evidence, that however much Mr. Genest may have thought he had explained to the defendant the nature of the transaction to which he had set his name, he wholly failed to make the defendant understand it, for in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice when the de fendant and his brothers signed their names in the book presented to them by Genest, they did not know the nature or intent of what they had signed, nor the nature, amount, or extent, of the responsibility which, by so doing, they were assuming, that in fact the matter was not fairly put before the defendant nor understood by him. The Court of Queen's Bench, in appeal, was of opinion that without any doubt the defendant, the now appellant, had been induced to sign his name for the shares as appearing in the book produced in evidence without understanding the responsibility which, by so doing, he was assuming ; and the court concludes that the contract alleged by the company in the declaration is not proved and that in this point of view (if that in the judgment of the court were sufficient to decide the action) the action should be dismissed.\nI must say that with this view so expressed by two courts, the presiding judge in one of which himself heard the witnesses,. I should not, sitting as a judge in appeal, feel myself justified in differing, even though the evidence should not present itself to my mind precisely in the same light ; but the true result of the evidence, as it appears to my mind also, clearly is that the defendant never contemplated taking any greater interest in, or any greater amount of, the capital stock of the company than what was covered by the $500 which he paid at the time as and intending it to be in full of all his interest in the company, that is to say in full of five shares, and that he did not comprehend, if he had at the time heard, what the company's agent set opposite to his name, consequently there never was that concurrence of minds which is essential to the making of a contract inter partes, and that, therefore, the first branch of the question which we have to decide, if the evidence relating thereto be received, must be answered in favor of the defendant, namely : That, in point of fact he never was the holder of fifty shares in the capital stock of the company, as alleged by the plaintiff, nor of any shares, unless the plaintiff should be willing to accept, and should accept, his $500 paid to them as payment in full for five shares.\nIt only, therefore, remains to be considered whether the defendant is estopped from saying that he is not the holder of the fifty shares as alleged by the plaintiffs in their declaration? In considering this question, it becomes important to enquire, and we are justified (in a case of this nature having regard to the humble condition and want of experience in business of the defendant) in criticising minutely what was the true legal nature, purport and effect of the document which the defendant without understanding what he was doing, did in fact sign. The attention of the courts below was not as it appears to me drawn to the true nature of that document, the book itself having been withdrawn and only a partial extract, and that of the least important part, taken from it nor has the character or effect of the defendant's prompt repudiation of that document, as soon as he suspected what it did purport to represent, been sufficiently appreciated.\nThe page in the book where the defendant's signature appears had not, nor had any page in it, except the first, any heading to indicate what it was the parties signing their names in the book set their names unto The evidence on the part of the defendant is that he did not see the heading or know that there was one. The evidence of Mr Gemest is, that he read and fully explained to the defendant what appears at the head of the first page. Now what is it that is there and that he so explained if indeed he did so ? It is in French and English, and in English is as follows :\u2014 The undersigned hereby agree to take and they do hereby take and subscribe to the number of shares in the said company set opposite to their respective signatures, or any portion thereof as may be allotted by the Provisional Board of Directors, the whole subject to such conditions contained in the Act incorporating the said company.\nNow, leaving out of consideration for the present the fact that when the defendant signed his name in the book there were no shares or amounts set opposite to his name, and that the words and figures now appearing there were added afterwards by Mr. Genest without the knowledge or consent of the defendant (as the defendant's evidence says, although, as Mr. Genest alleges, with his knowledge), and assuming these words and figures to have been added with defendant's knowledge and consent, what is the legal effect and purport of this document, and what is the explanation of it which should have been given by Mr. Genest, if it be true, as he says, that he read it and explained it to the defendant.\nThis document differs from what appeared to me to be expressed in the document of alike nature which was before us in Nasmyth v. Manning ([24]), lately decided in this court, in which case, although the language of the document there was not so strong as the language of that now before us in support of the conclusion at which a majority of the court arrived, the court held that no liability arose until some subsequent act in the nature of an allotment of shares by the provisional directors should take place and be communicated to the party subscribing the document. The judgment of this court in that case until reversed, I must consider as binding upon me, and. upon the point now under consideration I must regard it as a conclusive authority.\nThe document, then, now before us involved no obligation upon the part of the provisional board of directors to allot to the defendant any portion of the shares set opposite to his name. Mr. Genest did not and could not represent the provisional board for that purpose. The document as appearing now signed in the book produced, the nature of which, as it is found, was not, fully explained to or understood by the defendant, is simply a proposition upon his part, with an undertaking, as yet unilateral, to take and pay for such portion of the shares set opposite to his name, if any, as the provisional board of directors should allot to him. Until this board should exercise their judgment upon that proposition and signify to the defendant in some manner what they had resolved upon doing and had done in the matter, there was not, and, by the terms of the document so signed by the defendant, there does not profess to be any contract perfected between him and the plaintiffs and the defendant was not and did not become, by his mere signature in the book, the holder of any number of shares in the capital stock of the company.\nNow before the provisional board of directors ever assumed to act in the discharge of the function and duty devolved upon them by the defendant's proposition, and which could be discharged by that board only, the defendant became aware that, or had reason to suspect that the fraud and misrepresentation which he now sets up as his defence to this action had been committed whereby he was induced to sign a document purporting to represent his intentions and design to be totally different from what he intended and understood it to represent, and thereupon without delay, and before any action is taken by the provisional board of directors upon the document, he wholly repudiates the matter as erroneously represented in the book by the plaint\u00edffs' agent, and informs the company, through their secretary, that all the defendant intended or proposed to do was to take shares to the amount of $500 raid up il ful; that it was for this purpose he had given his cheque for $50O. There was no legal necessity that such information should, be communicated, in writing; oral communication was as good as in writing. Now, the effect of this notice and repudiation by the defendant of what the book represented was clearly, as it appears to me, to give to the plaintiffs ample notice to require them in the discharge of the duty which they owed alike to him as to the company, which latter was to allot shares only to solvent persons, having regard to the amount allotted, that unless they should be willing to accept the defendant as the holder merely of shares to the amount of $500 all paid up. he would have no shares. If they should not be willing so to accept him, their duty was to erase his name from the book in which it was and to refund him his money, which, to say the least, they had so become possessed of by manifest error of which, after such notice and information given to them, they must be taken to be aware.\nThe board, it appears now never did allot to the defendant any shares, but they retained his money of which they had so become possessed with full notice from the defendant that he had only paid it as, and that under the circumstances communicated to the plaintiff by the defendant, they could only justify their retention of it by accepting if, for the purpose for which it was given by the defendant, as payment in full of so many shares fully paid up in the capital stock of the company as $500 represented. The defendant, then, as it appears to me, effectually withdrew from the provisional board of directors all right to regard him as a subscriber for, or as assenting to become a subscriber for, any greater number than five shares and those as fully paid up; the Board, however never did infact, communicate to the defendant their acceptance of him as the holder of five fully paid up shares, under the notice given by him in repudiation of the proposition as appearing in the book. They simply retained his money, with the knowledge communicated to them by the defendant that he had paid the $500 as and for payment in full of shares to that amount, viz., five shares there having been no completed contract at this time, there was no necessity for the defendant to take any proceedings in any court to annul a contract not entered into.\nWhile things still remained in this condition, the plaintiffs having had sufficient notice that what the book signed by the defendant represented was utterly erroneous, and that the defendant was not an applicant for any shares in the capital stock of the company, unless it should be for five shares for which as payment in full, he had given his cheque for $500 to the company, the plaintiffs in the year 1876 sent to the defendant a cheque in the following terms :\nCompagnie d'Assurance Stadacona contre le feu c t sur la vie.\nPremier dividende Qu\u00e9bec 25 janvier 1876.\nAu caissier de la banque d'Union du Bas-Canada.\nPayez \u00e0 F. X, Cot\u00e9 ou ordre cent piastres tant pour dividende sur capital verse au trente et un d\u00e9cembre 1875.\nThe money made payable by this cheque was received by the defendant. Now, can the acceptance of this money operate as estopping the defendant from now alleging that he never was the holder of more than five shares in the capital stock of the company and these as fully paid up? Clearly not, as it appears to me. for, firstly, the amount so paid was calculated upon the paid-up capital, that is to say, in so far as the defendant is concerned upon his $500, whether that $500 was payment in full of five shares, or as 10 per cent, upon fifty shares, and, secondly, because, after the notice given by the defendant to the plaintiffs in repudiation of what appeared in the book signed by him and informing the plaintiffs that he had only paid. $500 as and for payment of that amount of fully paid up shares, the board of directors had no right to allot, and in point of fact did not allot to the defendant any shares under the , proposition as appearing in such book. They had, in fact, no right to hold him liable for any shares, unless they were willing to accept his version of the erroneous character of what appeared in the book, and of his purpose and intention in paying the $500, and to accept him as the holder of five shares paid up in full.\nWhen then the directors sent to the defendant the above cheque he would have been rather, as it seems to me, justified in regarding it as evidence of the adoption by the plaintiffs of the defendant's statement, as communicated to them through their secretary in repudiation of the proposition as appearing in the book which the defendant was ignorantly, if not fraudulently, induced to sign and of his version of the purpose for which he paid his $500.\nIf there be any estoppel arising out of this cheque it is not against the defendant that it should operate but against the plaintiffs, who, under the above circumstances, and affected with knowledge of the defendant's contention, and of his intention in paying the $500 being as payment in full of five shares, issued the cheque. As to the defendant, his acceptance of the money made payable by the cheque cannot in reason be regarded as acquiescence in anything further than that he is a holder of five fully paid up shares, which is what he has always contended was the utmost he ever contemplated being the holder of.\nThe doctrine of estopped can only operate to prevent the defendant from showing, the truth, if, by any act or declaration acquiesced in by him, the plaintiffs were misled to their prejudice to believe the defendant to be the holder of fifty shares in the capital stock of the company. A party is only estopped from showing the truth when he has by some act or declaration acquiesced in an assumed state of things, and by such acquit the situation of the other party has been altered to his prejudice. Bank of Hindustan vs. Alison ([25]).\nNow the terms of the document bearing the defendant's signature, already commented upon, could not have had that effect for that document was not only not acquiesced in by the defendant, but was immediately, and before having been acted upon, repudiated by the defendant, to the knowledge of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs therefore could not by reason of the defendant's signature appearing in that document, have been prejudiced or have believed the defendant to be in truth the holder of the fifty shares for which they now seek to make him liable. The act of the defendant in receiving the money made payable by the cheque for dividend cannot, as I have already stated my opinion to be, be construed to be an acquiescence in anything more than that the defendant admitted (as he had contended and as he does now was the true state of the case,) that he had paid his $500, intending it to be and as payment in full of five paid up shares.\nIt appears that Joseph Cot\u00e9, having learned in 1877 that the plaintiffs still contemplated holding him and his brothers for the amounts wrongly entered by the plaintiffs' agent in the plaintiffs' book, again remonstrated to Mr. Lemoine one of the directors, who suggested to him to write a letter to the board of directors which he would lay before them. Joseph thereupon, or I should say from the mistakes apparent in the letter, somebody for him wrote a letter in French of the 28th February, 1877, to the directors of the company, of which the following is a translation : The object of. this is to make you understand my actual position towards your company. I am still full of confidence as to the administration of the affairs of the company and I hope we shall not have reason to regret having placed there all the money we possessed. I address you in the name of four brothers who are in the same position as myself. The amount of our subscription has been $2,600, or 260 shares\nHere are the reasons for our having taken so great a number of shares. The agents sent to make known to us the rules of the company. and the conditions of subscription concealed from us almost altogether the risks and responsibilities which we should incur by such subscription. Observe, if you please, Messieurs, that not being able to obtain anything in the Parish of St. Pierre, the agents struggled to show to us the advantages which the company offered without suggesting, save in a vague manner, the dangers that we should run. We yielded to a confidence which we regret to this day. The influence which we have in our locality has been the cause that our mistake has procured many more subscriptions than there would have been without us. If we had had an extract from the act of incorporation, as that which was left with Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Fortin, we should have understood as he did that we should not with our means risk so much. He only paid $125. Your secretary even expressed his astonishment, and admitted how irrational it was in our position (one of my brothers having borrowed $50 to make his payment), to have paid so large a sum. Upon this subject one of your agents at the office, and in the presence of Mr. Lindsay, said that we had made our payment and that we should not be troubled any more about it. By reason of his reassuring words we surrendered ourselves to your good faith For these reasons we take occasion to ask to sell our shares without confiscation, so that after this year we may have still the sum of $2600 in the same manner as if we had paid this sum in three instalments instead of two\nYour humble servant,\nJOSEPH COTE.\nAnd on the 4th of August, 1877, Joseph and his brother \u00c1m\u00e9d\u00e9e and the above defendant, all three signed a letter of that date, addressed to the the directors, in French, of which the following is a translation :\n4th August, 1877.\nTo the Directors, & c.,\nGENTLEMEN, From the different notices, circulars, &c., which you have sent us we see that you have not paid any attention to our observations and demands. This is very unfortunate, for we ventured to hope different treatment on the part of persons so agreeable and intelligent as you appear to be. We repeat, then, the observations which we addressed to you in writing last winter, in the hope that you will pay attention to it. Three brothers, Joseph, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e and Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Cot\u00ea) deposited in your office $2,100 as shareholders, upon the express condition, and well explained, that they understood that they paid thereby the full amount of their shares. Then your agents wrote that they paid only two instalments of 5 per cent. which constituted a responsibility of $210000. Can we, gentlemen, in the name of common sense, believe that you will exact that which your agents have written, our whole.properties are not worth the sixth part of that amount. You would thus deprive us of all means of subsistence, and you would still be at a great loss. At present is it true that we have undertaken to pay all the amount of our shares ? Well we have paid almost every farthing we possess, and Francois Xavier had. to borrow even a part of his to make his payment. Moreover, we have witnesses, if it be necessary, that your agents are mistaken. That our deposit is spent we suspect is true, but as to paying anew we will not, for we are unable to do so. We beg of you, therefore, once for all, to arrange with your agents, that we have taken twenty-one shares instead of 210\nWe respectfully solicit an answer.\nYour three humble servants,\nJOSEPH COTE,\nAMEDEE COTE,\nFRANCOIS X. COTE.\nNow that this last letter cannot operate as estopping the defendant from showing the truth is clear for it is a reassertion of the repudiation of what the plaintiffs' agent had written in the book, involved in the remonstrance and complaint made by the defendant immediately after he first had reason to believe or suspect that it falsely represented him to have taken $5,000 instead of $500 paid up in full.\nThen as to the other letter, its contents show how slow we should be to give the effect of an estoppel to anything over the signature of this poor ignorant man. The letter speaks of his having four brothers, whereas there were only two and of the amount of their subscriptions being $2,600 or 260 shares, when we know that even in the plaintiff's book they were put down for $21,000 and. 210 shares. Then the last sentence in the letter is utterly insensible and unintelligible. It was written at the suggestion of one of the directors to whom Joseph Cot\u00e9 was repeating his original complaint. From what we now know of the nature of that complaint, the letter must be read as having reference to that old complaint, and to the position which, by the alleged wrongful conduct of plaintiffs' agent, Joseph was given to understand that he and his brothers occupied on the books of the company, although it presses other considerations for the board yielding to his demands.\nNow, it is to be observed that no obligation is pretended to have been incurred by the company since the writing of that letter, or upon the faith of any admission contained in it; but there is a further and an insuperable reason why that letter should not operate to estop the defendant from showing the truth in this action\nThe general doctrine laid down in Heane vs. Rogers ([26]), approved and followed in Newton vs. Belcher and Newton vs.Liddiard ([27]) that a party is at liberty to prove that his admissions were mistaken or untrue and that he is not estopped or concluded by them, unless the opposite party has been induced by them to alter his condition, is applicable to mistakes in respect of legal liability, as well as in respect of fact. In all cases, therefore, of this nature, a jury, or judges acting as jurors, with the view of estimating the effect due to an admission, are justified in considering the circumstances under which it is made and if it should appear to have been made under an erroneous notion of legal liability, they may qualify its effect accordingly ([28]). Acting, then, as a juror in this case, and assuming the defendant to be affected by the contents of this letter and that it is the one referred to in the letter of August, signed by the three brothers as having been addressed by them last winter to the directors of which however, there was no evidence, and which it would seem hot to be from a passage in the letter of August, viz : \" We repeat, then, the observations which. we addressed to you in writing last winter, \" I cannot read it as an abandonment by the defendant of the position taken and asserted by him as involved in his original remonstrance and repudiation of what the plaintiffs' agent, contrary to the truth as the defendant alleged, entered in the book opposite to his name, and which contention is repeated in the letter of August, 1877- But now that we see what the nature of the document which the defendant so signed was, the circumstance under which his signature was procured, the fraud or error committed in setting opposite to his signature the amount and number of shares now appearing there, and when we consider that it was the duty of the plaintiffs upon the first remonstrance and repudiation of its contents made by the defendant, either to have erased his name altogether and to have refunded him his money or to have adopted his version of the purpose he had in paying them his $500, we see that they never were justified in incurring any obligation based upon the faith of the defendant being the holder of shares to the amount of $5000 ; and when we see that the letter under consideration was written under a mistaken idea entertained by the defendant of what he had in fact signed as well as of his legal liability and rights in respect thereof, the plaintiffs cannot be heard to say that the defendant is estopped from showing the truth. He was led by the plaintiffs to believe that he had by a perfected contract become the holder of shares to the amount of $5000000 in the capital stock of the company which he was legally bound to pay whereas it now appears that as matter of fact the paper which he signed did not contain such a contract and that his signature to what was in the book did not subject him to the legal obligation which was insisted upon.\nThe fact that the defendant, immediately after setting his name to the book produced, communicated to the plaintiffs the true state of the case, before the plaintiffs had taken any action upon the faith of the defendant's signature having been obtained, and that, in fact, at a time when, as now appears, no completed contract between the defendant and the plaintiffs had been entered into distinguishes this case from that class of cases which was relied upon by the courts below.\nFor the above reasons, I am of opinion that nothing has taken place which can, in law, estop the defendant from showing the truth in this action in relation to the matter which the plaintiffs make the foundation of their claim and that the truth being shown establishes that the defendant never was in fact the holder of fifty shares, nor of any number of shares, in the capital stock of the company, unless he be holder of five shares fully paid up\nThe appeal, in my judgment, should be allowed with costs and judgment should be entered for the defendant in the court below with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellant : Boss\u00e9 & Languedoc.\nAttorneys for respondents : Pelletier, B\u00e9datd Rouleau & Lemoine.\n[1] Vo.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEALSIDE),\nLife Insurance\u2014Insurable Interest\u2014Transfer\u2014Wager Policy\u2014Payment of Premiums.\nG. applied to respondents' agent at Quebec for an insurance on his life, and having undergone medical examination, and signed and \"procured the usual papers which were forwarded to the head office at New York, a policy was returned to the agent at Quebec for delivery. G. was unable to pay the premium for some time, but L., at the request of the agent at Quebec, who had been entrusted with a blank executed assignment of the policy, paid the premium and took the assignment to himself. Subsequently, L. assigned the policy, and the premiums were thence-forth paid by the assignee. Prior to G.'s death, the general agent of the company inquired into the circumstances, and authorized the agent at Quebec to continue to receive the premiums from the assignee.\nHeld (Gwynne, J., dissenting,)\u2014That at the time the policy was executed for G. he intended to affect a bon\u00e2 fide insurance for his own benefit, and as the contract was valid in its inception, the payment of the premium when made related back to the date of the policy and the mere circumstance that the assignee, who did not collude with G. for the issue of the policy, had paid the premium and obtained an assignment, did not make it a wagering policy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) of the 17th September, 1880, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal of the 30th April 1878, which dismissed the appellant's action.\nThe action was brought to recover the amount of a life policy, granted by the respondents on the 5th of November, 1873, for $2,000 on the life of one Hector Gendron, who died on the 16th of September, 1875.\nThe appellant sued as the assignee of one Langlois, under a deed of transfer executed on the 3rd of November, 1875, and Langlois was alleged in the declaration to have obtained an assignment of the policy from Gendron on the 26th of December, 1873.\nThe company pleaded inter alia:\nThat in the application Gendron falsely declared that he was born on the 5th December, 1812, but in fact, as the company had recently discovered, he was born on the 5th December, 1811.\nHe falsely declared that no proposal to insure his life had ever been declined by any company whereas the company had recently discovered that his life had been insured with the \u00c6tna Insurance Company of Hart-ford, in June 1872, by two policies in favor of Vennor and Valli\u00e8re respectively, which had been cancelled on the ground of falsehood and fraud, and the absence of an insurable interest.\nThat Gendron merely lent his name without ever having any interest in the policy or paying any premium. That Langlois knowing that it would be illegal to take it in his own name, procured Gendron to apply for the policy from whom he got an assignment, the whole to defraud the company.\nThe contract or policy sued upon was initiated in Quebec, by application made to the respondents' agent, at that place on the 27th October, 1873, by Hector Gendron a resident of Quebec on his own life for the sum of $2000 for the benefit of his legal representatives and assigns. Michaud, the respondents' agent, filled up the printed form of application used by the respondents with the answers of the applicant, Gendron, to the enquiries contained therein; and then forwarded it to the respondents, in New York,\u2014where the respondents accepted the application and issued the policy on the 5th November 1873. The policy contains an acknowledgment that the first premium had been paid by Gendron; but the premium was only paid on the delivery of the policy on the 26th December 1873 contemporaneously with the assignment made of the policy by Gendron to Langlois.\nThe assignment was effected by a document approved of by the respondents' agent, and by the delivery of the policy, on the 26th December, 1873 ; which assignment was transmitted to the Montreal office and duly acknowledged by the officers at the head office.\nA year later Burke, the general agent of the Company, went to Quebec and cancelled several policies and in his evidence stated that he tried to see Langlois to demand back the policy, and state to him what the consequence would be if he did not do so, but never succeeded in seeing him,\u2014and in the meantime Gendron died.\nMichaud, on the contrary, stated that two years after the assignment, as Langlois was his friend, Burke being at his office at Quebec, annulling some policies, he spoke to him of the policy in question in this cause and asked him to annul it if the transaction was not correct. Burke then asked Michaud if Gendron was a good risk ; Michaud told him : \"Yes\" He then replied : \"Let them pay their money.\" Mr. Langlois was informed of that fact.\nAfter the death of Gendron, Langlois transferred and made over to the appellant his claim and right of action against the respondents.\nMr.Doutre, Q. C., for appellant:\nThe principal ground of defence set up by the company is that neither Gendron nor Langlois, who assigned for value to appellant, ever had any legal interest in the policy, and that Lansglois had no insurable interest in the life of Gendron; that the insurance was obtained through a fraudulent confederacy between Gendron and Langlois; and that in effect the insurance was a wager policy, and as such absolutely void and incapable of being enforced in a court of justice.\nThe question is therefore narrowed down to a question of fact rather than of law viz. : whether there was any fraud between Langlois and Gendron, or whether the agent and Langlois confederated together to make Gendron get a policy for Langlois. Now, it is clear that the first time Langlois ever knew of this insurance was in December, a long time after Gendron had made his application, and when his risk had been accepted no confederacy was proved.\nI accept it as an elementary principle of life insur-anee that every individual, man or woman, has an insurable interest in his or her own life ([1]). Every man is presumed to, possess an insurable interest in his own life, since by insuring it he can pro-tect his estate from that loss of his fortune, gains, or savings which might be the result of his premature death and as that cannot be limited, neither can the amount for which he may insure. The insured must have an insurable interest in the life upon which the insurance is effected. The extent of his interest is measured by the contract,\u2014within reason,\u2014that is, at a large or a small sum, as may be agreed upon between the parties interested.\nGendron was possessed of this interest, and having once insured his life it was his own property to dispose of to whomsoever he pleased, and for what consideration he pleased, even by gift, and in doing so he defrauded no one, especially not the company who had agreed with him as to the terms on which his life should be insured.\nIn St. John v. The American Life Insurance Co. ([2]), it was settled by the decision of the court of last resort in the state of New York, that \u201cIt is only when a person insures the life of another, that the question of interest in the life can arise.\" That a policy of insur-anee effected by a person on his own life is assignable like an ordinary chose in action, and the assignee is entitled on the death of the party whose life is insured to recover the full sum insured, without reference to the consideration paid by him.\nNow, when the premium was paid by Gendron himself, or paid by Langlois for his acquittal to the company, it related back to the time when the policy was issued, and at that time it cannot be said that Langlois had conspired to get this insurance. If Gendroni found he had made a valueless bargain for himself, it was competent for him to part with it, at cost, or even under cost. I also contend that the company, by accepting the premium from Langlois and delivering the policy, acknowledged the validity of the policy and of its assignments, and that the receiving of premiums after the correspondence of Burke, in March, 1874, and the willingness of the company to receive premiums, after the disclosures to Burke, at Quebec, in June or July, 1875, was an insuperable estoppel to raising such objections.\nMr. S'rachan Bethune, Q. C., for respondents :\nIn addition to the important question upon which the respondent succeeded in the court below, there are two fatal objections to appellants' action on this policy: 1st, this representation of age; and 2nd, that Gendron had represented that no proposal to insure his life had ever been declined by any company, whereas in two instances cited although he had secured insurance on his life, the policies were very soon after cancelled on the ground of falsehood and fraud. In the original application the date of birth is given first, and immediately after the age next birthday was apparently written 62 and then struck out and wrtten 61, no doubt to make this latter statement accord with the actual fact, as ascertained by the date of alleged birth, which was left as originally made.\nThere was no evidence whether this change was made before signature by Gendron or not, but as the date of the birth was suffered to remain, and as the copy of the application attached to the policy, and produced by the appellant, states the age next birthday as 61 and is therefore conformable to the amendment on the original, the presumption is very strong that the change must have been made before signature.\nAs to the second point the question put to the applicant was, were you ever refused, and the answer is \"no,\" whereas as a matter of fact it was proved just as we pleaded it, that he had proposed to insure his life, and after being accepted, the risk was cancelled on the ground of falsehood and fraud, in that the said Hector Gendron had misrepresented his age and habits, and had merely lent his name to parties who had taken out said policies, as a mere speculation on their part, and without having any insurable interest whatever in the life of said Hector Gendron. We contend the warranty extends to this answer.\nOn the main question raised by the respondent's \"plea, it was clearly proved that Gendron, in applying to have his life insured for $2000 did not do so for himself and his own benefit (as he falsely alleged in his application), but for the benefit of any third party, who, as a matter of speculation, would pay the premiums on the policy including the first one), and in the hope that such third party would pay him some trifling sum for thus lending his name for the benefit of such third party And it would appear from the evidence that he had done the same thing in two former instances with the 2Etna Life insurance Company.\nAs Gendron was utterly incapable of paying the premium, the sub-agent at Quebec of the respondent's general agent at Montreal retained the policy in his hands, and, after a delay of a few weeks, Langlois agreed to enter into the desired speculation, paid the required first premium, and obtained delivery of the policy from the sub-agent, and as the policy had been made out in the name of Gendron, he took a transfer from him of the policy. There was no evidence that Langlois ever paid Gendron anything for this transfer.\nThe transaction as it occurred, therefore, was precisely the same as if Gendron had insured his life (on the face of the policy) for the benefit of Langlois, who admits in his evidence that he never had any interest whatever in the life of Gendron, and that he paid the premium and took a transfer of the policy as a pure speculation. For, as Gendron never had delivery or possession of the policy and had never paid any premium thereunder he had no legal property in the policy, and the assignment of the policy by him was consequently a mere matter of form, necessitated by the fact that Gendron appeared on the face of the policy as the party insured.\nThe facts being as above stated it is clear that Langlois could never sue to recover the amount of the policy. Art. 2480 of the Civil Code of L. C.,3rd par.: \" Wager or gaming policies, in the object of which the insured has no insurable interest, are illegal.\" And Art. 2590 of said Civil Code : \"The insured must have an insurable interest in the life upon which the insurance is effected.\"\nMr. Justice cross, who dissented from the other judges of the court of Queen's Bench remarked : \"And it appears that seven or eight months after it (the policy) was effected and transferred to Langlois, Burke the general agent of the company, knowing the facts, approved of this and other policies, saying: \" Laisser les payer leur argent,' (let them pay their money.)\"\nNow Michaud, in the first part of his evidence, says that it was two years after the assignment to Langlois, (namely, about the 26th December, 1875) that he explained the transaction to Burke, in his (Michaud's) office at Quebec, and asked him if it was correct, and that Burke made the remark- l let them pay their money.\"\nThe evidence is very unsatisfactory, and on the whole it is quite clear, that if these words were really used by Burke, it must have been on the occasion of his visit in June, 1875. And as no premium was paid after that date Gendron having died on the 16th of September, 1875, and the current year's premium having been paid by Langlois in November or December, 1874, the respondent cannot be held to have confirmed the transaction with Langlois even if Burke had had power thus to bind the respondent.\nIt will be seen also by reference to the 5th condition of the policy that a agents of the company are not authorized to make alter or discharge contracts, or waive forfeitures \"\nMr. Doutre, Q. C, in reply.\nRitchie, C.J.:\u2014\nThis was an action brought on a policy of insurance on the life of Hector Gendron, of which the plaintiff became the assignee through one Langlois, to whom it had been transferred. The policy sets forth that :\u2014\nThe New York Life Insurance Company in consideration of the statements and representationsc submitted to its officers of the home office in the city of New York and contained in the written application for this policy &c. and upon the faith of which statements and representations this policy is issued, and of the sum of eighty-five dollars and twenty-four cents to them in hand paid, and of the sum of one hundred and seventy dollars and forty-eight cents to be paid in like manner, and sums as per margin, in every year during the continuance of this policy doth insure the life of Hector Gendron, &c., in the amount of two thousand dollars for the term of his natural life, commencing on the 5th November, 1873, at noon.\nThe application was made to the agent at Quebec, P.Q., by Gendron himself and signed by his own hand. The applicant was personally subjected to a medical examination. The medical examiner's report was presented to the company, and the conditions of the company required the applicant to procure a certificate from a friend. Gendron applied to a friend, Grondin, who answered the questions proposed to him which were required to be answered by the company. This application these medical documents and certificate of friend having been transmitted to the head office in New York the application of Gendron was acceded to, and this policy, which is set out in the declaration, was executed on the day it bears date by the proper officers of the company, as a valid instrument of insurance, whereby Gendron's application for insurance was accepted and his life was insured from the date of that policy for one twelve-month, upon payment of a certain premium which was by the policy admitted to have been in hand received, and by the payment annually of a certain other premium as marked in the margin of the policy. This policy was transmitted from the head office to the agent in Quebec, to whom the application had originally been made, and who had transmittted the application to the head office in New York to be delivered to Gendron on payment of the premium. The policy appears to have remained in the agent's hands for some time. The payment of the premium was made by Lang-lots and the policy delivered to him under and by virtue of an assignment, which Gendron had signed in blank. The blank assignment which had been left with the agent was filled up by him and the transfer of the policy was made to Langlois, who received the policy and held it as the assignee of the insured. Subsequently Mr. Langlois assigned this policy to the plaintiff in this case, George V\u00e9zina,and the premiums on the policy from that time falling due were paid by the assignee up to the time of the death of Gendron,which took place about two years after the date of the policy. The material defenc (becaus I think the other points of the defencere satisfactorily disposed of below) was that this was not an insurance by Gendron for Gendron' own benefit, but that it was a wager policy obtained by Langlois, the original assignee, or by V\u00e9zina and Michaud or Langlois and V\u00e9zina combined, and that there was no insurable interest under it, and that the policy was therefore void. Now, to ascertain and determine this question, a pure question of fact, we must see what facts there are in the case that are undisputed. I think it cannot be denied that this policy was applied for at the instance of Gendron, by him for his own benefit, that from the time the application was made up to the time the policy was executed in New York and returned to (Quebec, and up to the time of the transfer there was no connection whatever between Gendron and Langlois, or between Langlois and V\u00e9zina in reference to this policy. Gendron appears to have been a man in poor circum-stances, and he was under the impression that if he could obtain an insurance on his life he would be able so to deal with that insurance as to realize money there-from. The evidence upon this point is uncontradicted, The agent of the \u00c6tna Company, Mr. Grondin to whom application was first made, says that he knows the parties :\u2014\nBefore making the said application the said Hector Gendron came to me at my office. * * * He said then that he wished to effect an insurance on his life, so as to get some money, that is to say on the policy. Then I sent him to Mr. Michaud, the defendants' agent, telling him that I thought that this was the only company which would take a risk to be assigned in his case.\nThus in the inception of this transaction there was no combination or confederacv between Michaud, the agent of the defendants, and Gendron the party desiring to be insured. The former says:\u2014\nI do not know whether or not he had the means of paying his premium but one day he came to my office to insure himself; he was accompanied by Joseph Grondin, agent of the \u00c6tna. This was the first time that I saw Gendron. I filled in the blanks which were in the application myself after the answers of Gendron, and it was on this application that the said policy was issued.\nFrom this it appears that this man made a bon\u00e2 fide application. Being jn poor circumstances and wishing, for his own benefit, without any connection with any third party whatever, to insure his life, he applies first to the agent of the \u00c6tna, which company not being willing to take the risk, its agent introduces him to the agent of defendants who accedes to his wishes, It can-not be denied that Gendron had an insurable interest in his own life and had a right to effect an insurance thereon, and to use that policy for his own benefit, whether for the purpose of raising a loan through its instrumentality, or by convincing others that the policy upon his life was of value, and so be enabled to transfer it for a consideration. As his application was bon\u00e2 fide for his own benefit and the company accepted the risk and granted him the policy, he had a right to do with it what he p!eased; the transaction between him and the company being a bon\u00e2 fide insurance of his life for his own benefit, nothing he did subsequently with the policy could make it a wagering policy.\nThen, the policy being in the hands of Mr. Michaud to be delivered on payment of the premium, and Gendron having left a blank transfer with Micliaud, he induced Mr. Langlois to pay the premium. In doing this Michaud states that he did it on behalf of Mr. Gendron. Mr. Grondin, the friend of Mr. Gendron, says that he knew Michaud was acting as the plaintiff's agent. Therefore we have the fact that as the plaintiff's agent he took this policy and having been entrusted with a blank assignment for the purpose of enabling an assignment to be made in the event of his disposing of the policy on behalf of Mr. Gendron, he fills it up in Langlois' name and receives the premium as defendant's agent. It is true the evidence does not show that Mr. Gendron received any consideration for that transfer, but the evidence does show that Mr. Gendron was dissatisfied that he had not and wrote to the head office in New York complaining of the conduct of Mr. Michaud with reference to that transfer and that it was in conquence of that letter, as the manager says, that the present difficulty arose with reference to their acknowledging the validity of the policy as a subsisting and binding contract on their part. With this difficulty between Gendron, the principal, and Michaud, his agent, in the transfer of this policy, the company has nothing to do and whether Gendron received or did not receive the consideration he expected, or was entitled to, is a matter between the principal and agent, and which cannot render the policy valid in its inception void by reason of any misconduct on the part of the agent of Gendron in disposing of the policy at his instance\nThere is also evidence to show that after this the manager was informed of all the circumstances connected with this policy, that he acquiesced in the propriety of what was done, and in the validity of the insurance, directed the money to be taken, and in consequence thereof the company subsequently received the premiums which accrued due until and up to the death of Gendron.\nIt is not disputed that a party insuring upon a life must have an interest in the life insured in other words that if this is a wagering policy the plaintiff cannot recover, but it is alleged that the contract was made by the defendants with the party whose life was insured, and that the insurance being thus effected by a person having at the time an interest in the life insured, the contract was valid in its inception and could not become a wager policy by any subsequent transfers.\nWhen was this policy effected? Was it not, as between the company and the holder, on the day it bears date? and at that time the party effecting the insurance was the party whose life was insured, no other person being in any way interested in or a party to the trans- action. Can it be said that the evidence conclusively shows that this insurance was not effected by the deceased for his own benefit? To enable the defeu-dants to succeed, I think they must show that this policy was void from the beginning. If Gendron had obtained from Langlois the money to pay the premium and had not assigned the policy, could it be contended that the company would not be liable to pay the amount insured to Gendron's representatives, why then should not Gendron's assignee stand in the same position as his personal representatives would have done if no assignment had been made ?\nNo doubt a party cannot procure one, in whose life he has no legal interest, to insure it with his money and for his benefit still if there is an interest at the time of the policy, it is not a wagering policy, and where a life policy effected by one who has an interest, is assigned, it is not necessary that the assignee should have any interest, or even that he should have paid any consideration ; for it has been decided that he stands on the rights of the party who effected the insurance. The want of interest applies to the original parties to the policy, not to their assignees. When this insurance was effected it was not at the instance of and for the benefit of the first assignee or the present holder, the plaintiff, nor was there any arrangement between them or any of them that the insurance was to be for the sole benefit of any one other than the assured.\nThe premium in the second condition of the policy clearly refers to the premium of $170.48 to be paid as per margin in every year during the continuance of this policy, and not to the $85.24, which by the policy the defendants admitted, at any rate for the purposes of the policy had been \"to them in hand paid.\" Therefore, so soon as the premium was paid and policy delivered, the original contract as contained in the policy was complete and it is wholly immaterial whether the premium was paid by and the policy delivered to the assignee of the assured or by the assured himself and delivered to the assignee. The insured had a right to effect an insurance on his life for the benefit of whom he chose, and in this case having applied for this insurance for his own benefit, and his application having been accepted and policy issued, to be delivered on payment of the premium, it was a matter that could not affect the contract where the money came from, so that the premium was paid on the contract and the policy delivered on the contract to the assured or his assignee, or nominee, on which being done a valid contract was effected between the party whose life was insured and the defendants. When the premium was paid it had relation back to the date of the policy the contract was, as between the parties, on the day of the date of the policy, 'being the day it was executed and sent from New York to Quebec, and then only remained in the agent's hand awaiting the payment of the premium for the insurance for a year from the date, which being made the policy took effect as from its date.\nIf the evidence in this case had shown that the insurance was effected by the party nominally insured at the instance of and for the benefit of Langlois, or the present holder, who were to pay the premiums in pursuance of an agreement between them in which either of the latter secured the sole benefit of the insurance by assignment or otherwise, it would be clear that the interest in the policy was not in the party nominally insured, but really in the third party at whose instance the insurance was effected, and so the policy would be void; but where the insurance was effected by the party assured at his own instance without the knowledge of or any connection with the party who subsequently paid the premium, I do not think that the mere circumstance that such other party pays the premium and obtains an assignment of the policy is sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that the interest in the policy at its date and when agreed to and executed by the company was not in the assured\nSTRONG, J . :\u2014\nI entirely concur in the reasons and conclusions which have been expressed by the Chief Justice. I shall content myself with expressing a simple concurrence with his judgment, that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nI agree with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice and I think that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nHenry, J.:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. I did not prepare a judgment in writing, but I may just state my views in a few words. The only tangible defence set up is that this is a wager policy. Every lawyer knows what the meaning of a wager policy is. The amount of it is the assertion that Langlois was in collusion with Gendron to insure the latter's life for his own benefit, and therefore he having no interest. the policy would be void. If the evidence established that position of course this appeal ought to be dismissed but in my view the evidence does not sustain any such position I am of the opinion that the policy was a contract between the original parties. It is not shown that Langlois even knew anything about it, and this contract as far as the policy is concerned, was actually in being a month before the man Langlois knew that Gendron had made an application. He could not, therefore have been in collusion with the insured to obtain a policy for his benefit. I concur in the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice in reference to the validity of the policy and think it a matter of indefference whether the money was already paid by the insured or whether it was paid by some person on his behalf and with his assent. The whole matter was referred to the manager of the company, and with a full knowledge of all the facts he authorized the agent, Michaud, to receive the money and deliver the policy. It is too late, under these circumstances I think, even if it were a wager policy, for the company to set up their defence, because, if they took the risk knowing it was a wager policy, they would be prohibited from setting up such a defence. I think there is not the slightest evidence to show it was a wager policy. The party had a right to insure his life, and we have no right to enquire what his object was, whether it was to sell the policy or make a present of it if he chose. Under the circumstances I agree that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nThe question arising in this case is simply as to the proper view to take of the evidence upon matters of fact. In such a case as I have before taken occasion to observe, a Court of Appeal should not, in my judgment, reverse the judgment of the court of first instance, and & fortiori the concurring judgments of two courts, unless under a thorough conviction that in such judgments there is taken a view of the facts which is plainly erroneous. This principle I have never heard questioned, but, on the contrary, have heard approved in this court, although I fear that in this case, the judgment of the Court does not conform to it. I must say that, so far from seeing anything wrong, I entirely concur in the view taken by the courts below, stud in the reasons given by the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, Montreal, in appeal.\nIt appears that one Gendron, who was a person of no means, and not able to pay the premium upon an insurance on his life for any amount, was in the habit of raising small sums of money by selling his name to others to use in effecting through him, and in his name, but for their benefit, policies upon his life. Two such policies had been effected with the \u00c6tna Insurance Co. the one for the benefit of one Vennor and the other for the benefit of one Vallir\u00e8re, for which Gendron had received $20 each. The \u00c6tna Insurance Co., having discovered these facts about 18 months after the execution of the policies, insisted upon their being, and they were accordingly, given up and cancelled. Afterwards Gendron being still in embarrassed circumstances applied to one Grondin, an insurance agent, with the view of effecting through him, with an insurance company for which he was agent a policy of insurance under like circumstances and for the like purpose as in the case of Vennor and Valli\u00e8re. Grondin declined to enter into such a transaction, and informed him that Mr. Michaud, who represented the New York Life Ins. Co. was the only one through whom Gendron could procure an insurance upon such a risk as that proposed by him. Gendron accordingly went to Michaud,\u2014there an application to the defendant's company was filled up. by Michaud for Gendron to sign, and was signed by Gendron and forwarded by Michaud to the head office of the defendants at New York The defendants by the form of the applications which it requires to be signed by any applicant, and one which was so signed by Gendron (which applications by the form of the policies the defendants incorporate into and make part of the policies) take the precaution, ex majori cautel\u00e2 of protecting themselves by a provision therein that \"under no circumstances shall the policy be in force until actual payment to, and acceptance of the premium by, an authorized agent of the company.\" The defendants, in in reply to the application of Gendron forwarded by Michaud, transmitted to him an instrument or paper writing, dated the 5th November, 1873, with the seal of the company attached thereto purporting to be a policy of insurance for $2,000 upon the life of Gendron and in favor of Gendron, payable to his legal personal representatives, but which paper writing, by reason of the above provision incorporated with and made part of it, expressly provided that notwithstanding such execution thereof the same should not come into, or have, any existence as a policy of insurance unless nor until the premium thereon, viz., $85 24, should be paid to and accepted by Michaud, the defendants' agent in the matter.\nUpon the receipt of this document by Michaud, Gendron continued to be, as he always was, unable to pay the premium, and the document' remained an imperfect instrument and the property of the defendants in the hands of Michaud, who, it is plain, would lose his com-niission on the transaction unless he could contrive in some way to obtain payment of the premium, so as to enable him to issue the policy as an instrument to all appearance, at least, binding upon his principals. Accordingly Michaud, acting, as he says, as Gendron's agent, but while in possession of the imperfect document, as the pr6perty of the defendants, looked about to find some person who would pay the premium and take the policy. For this purpose he applied to Langlois, who had no interest whatever in Gendron's life, and offers the policy to him as a good speculation if he would pay the premium necessary to give it vitality. Langlois at first declined, but at length, satisfied, as it would seem, by Michaud, that the speculation would be a good one, consents. Now at this stage it may be observed,that, as the document had not yet acquired the character of an existing policy, Gendron had no interest in it and could not therefore authorize Michaud to issue it to any one Michaud could issue the policy that is to say could only bring it into existence as the agent of the defendants. Michaud therefore, while he professes to have been acting as Gendron's agent in offering to give the policy to Langlois, if he would pay the premium, must be also regarded as the agent of the company, defendants, to give vitality to the document by issuing it which had not yet been done. To carry out this transaction with Langlois, so proposed to him by Michaud, acting in the two-fold delicate capacity of agent for Gendron, who had as yet acquired no interest in the document, and as agents of the defendants, whose property wholly it still was, and as whose agent only Michaud could issue it, he procured Gendron to execute in blank a paper endorsed upon or annexed to the still imperfect document, the execution of which by Gendron is witnessed by Michaud, and the still imperfect policy, with the assignment in blank so signed by Gendron still remains in Michaud's hands and still as the property of the defendants, for, as the premium had not vet been paid the document executed by the defendants had not as yet acquired vitality or existence, and Gendron had no interest, and not having any he had not anything to assign at the time he signed the paper purporting to be the assignment of the policy not yet in existence nor was there then any person even named in it as assignee; that assignment was therefore invalid, and the paper upon which it was, as well as the document of which it purported to be an assignment, still remained in Michaud's hands as the property of the defendants, not having yet acquired any existence as a policy of insurance. While matters are in this condition, Michaud, having arranged with Langlois, inserts in the blank assignment his name, and Langlois, at a time when Gendron had not, as he never had had, any interest in the document as a policy, pays the premium to Michaud, who accepts it, and then for the first time issues it as the act and deed of the defendants, into the hands of Langlois for his benefit, although he had no interest whatever in the life of Getidron. If this policy ever had existence it came into existence then and for the sole benefit of Langlois, and Gendron, upon whose life it purports to be effected, never had any interest whatever in it.\nIt is said, however, that being so issued it enures back to its date, and that the company is estopped from arguing that Gendron had not had an interest in it; but that is not so, for it is an express provision of any contract contained in it that none shall be deemed to come into existence until the actual pav-ment of the premium and surely if Gendron had died after signing the document called an assignment of the policy, and before the payment of the premium by Langlois, it cannot be contended that the policy would be enforcable\u2014indeed, the only estoppel in the case is one binding on the plaintiff by which he, as claiming under Langlois, is estopped from asserting any existence in the policy until it was issued by Michaud, the defendants' agent, to and for the benefit of Langlois, and having been, when first issued, issued to Langlois, who had no interest in Gendron's life, the infirmity attached to the policv in its issue must continue to be attached to it whatever date it may appear to bear.\nThe above is the position in which the evidence very clearly presents the case to my mind, and to a policy so issued I can attribute no other character than that of one contrived in fraud of the defendants by their own agent, acting also in the character of agent of Gendron, to procure a policy to he effected in the interest of Langlois upon Gendron's life, in whose life Langlois had no interest, and apparently upon behalf of Gendron, who, in truth, had never any interest in the policy. In my judgment the allegation in the plea, \"that the said Hector Gendron never had any legal interest whatever in said policy, and did not pay any portion of the premium on said policy mentioned, and merely lent his name to said Edouard Langlois in the matter of the said application and declaration,\" is sufficiently proved by the evidence which establishes that Michaud as Gendron's agent, as he says, offered to issue the policy to Langlois if he would pay the premium to procure it to be issued. If this proposition was made by Michaud as Gendron's agent, it is the same as if Gendron had said to Langlois \" there is a document which I can not procure to be issued. I have no means it on its face purports to be for my benefit, but I cannot give it vitality or obtain its issue\u2014go and pay the premium and procure it to be issued to you and for your benefit, although on my life \u2014you can have it, and I, although having no interest in it, have, to cover appearances, executed an instrument purporting to he an assignment of it to you, so that the Company's agent may give it existence by issuing it to you, and appearances will protect him also.\" I must say that the transaction appears to my mind so plainly fraudulent that it should not be allowed to prevail in a court of justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Doutre & Joseph.\nSolicitors for respondents: Bethune & Bethune.\n[1] Bunyon Life Ins. 19,No. 14,\n[2] 13 N.

J. Ritchie, Knight, C.J.; and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nWill\u2014Construction of\u2014Surplus\u2014Whether residuary personal estate of the testator passed.\nAmong other bequests the testator declared as follows:\u2013\"I bequeath to the Worn-out Preachers' and Widows' Fund in connection with the Wesleyan Conference here, the sum of \u00a31,250, to be paid out of the moneys due me by Robert Chestnut, of Fredericton. I bequeath to the Bible Society, \u00a3150. I bequeath to the Wesleyan Missionary Society in connection with the Conference the sum of \u00a31,500.\" Then follow other and numerous bequests. The last clause of the will is:\u2014\"Should there be any surplus or deficiency, a pro rata addition or deduction, as may be, to be made to the following bequests, namely, the Worn-out Preachers' and Widows' Fund; Wesleyan Missionary Society; Bible Society.\" When the estate came to be wound up, it was found that there was a very large surplus of personal estate, after paying all annuities and bequests. This surplus was claimed, on the one hand, under the will, by these charitable institutions, and on the other hand by the heirs-at-law and next of kin of the testator, as being residuary estate, undisposed of under his will.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the \"surplus\" had reference to the testator's personal estate out of which the annuities and legacies were payable; and therefore a pro rata addition should be made to the three above-named bequests, Statutes of Mortmain not being in force in New Brunswick.\n[Fournier and Henry, J. J., dissenting.] This was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, by which it was declared that by the proper construction of the will of Gilbert T. Ray, the respondents, \"The Annual Conference of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, in connection with the Methodist Church of Canada,\" and the \"New Brunswick Auxiliary Bible Society,\" were entitled to the whole residuary personal estate of the said Ray.\nThis was a bill filed in the Supreme Court in Equity of the province of New Brunswick, by the plaintiff, as surviving executor of the last will and testament of Gilbert T. Ray, for a decree declaring the persons entitled to a fund of some $40,000 in the executors' hands. The question arose in reference to the last clause in the will. Under it the Methodist Conference of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and the New Brunswick Bible Society (respondents), claim all the residuary, real and personal estate, while the remaining defendants (appellants), who are the testator's heirs, claim that, as to this residuary estate, there is an intestacy, and that they are entitled.\nGilbert T. Ray died on the 23rd October, 1858, without leaving any issue. By his will he appointed the plaintiff and Aaron Eaton and John Fraser, executors; and after giving to his wife an annuity of \u00a3300 per annum and the use of his house and furniture on Carmarthen street for life; and an annuity of \u00a3200 per annum to his sister, Rachael Hallett, for life; and from and after her death an annuity of \u00a3100 per annum for eight years to her daughters, he bequeathed\u2014\n\"To the worn-out Preachers and Widows' Fund in connection with the Wesleyan Conference here the sum of \u00a31,250, to be paid out of the monies due me by Robert Chestnut, of Fredericton; to the Bible Society \u00a3150; to the Wesleyan Missionary Society in connection with the Conference here, \u00a31,500.\" He then gave a number of other legacies, of unequal amounts, to some of his next of kin and others, amounting in the aggregate to $31,360. In addition to a pecuniary legacy of \u00a31,000 to one of his next of kin, he gave him \"All his marsh lands in the County of Annapolis.\"\nTo another, Mrs. Fraser, he gave his house and land on Carmarthen street; and the will then concluded as follows:\n\"I hold by deed 540 acres of land in Sussex, which I leave to be disposed of, by my executors, at a time when they shall deem it most advantageous.\"\n\"Should there be any surplus or deficiency a pro rata addition or deduction, as may be, to be made to the following bequests, viz.:\u2014\n\"Worn-out Preachers and Widows' Fund. Wesleyan Missionary Society. Bible Society.\"\nThe defendants, \"The Annual Conference of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, in connection with the Methodist Church of Canada,\" represent the bequests to the Worn-out Preachers and Widows' Fund, and to the Wesleyan Missionary Society; the defendants, \"The New Brunswick Auxiliary Bible Society\" represent that to the Bible Society; and amongst the other defendants are all the next of kin of the testator.\nAll the legacies mentioned in the will were paid except one of \u00a3400 to Charles Prichard, which, with an annuity of \u00a3100 per annum for eight years to Elizabeth C Hallett, Fanny Hallett and Margaretta Ray Hallett, unmarried daughters of Rachael Hallett, are now the only charges on the estate.\nIn addition to the lands at Annapolis, the lands devised to Mrs. Fraser and the lands at Sussex mentioned in the will, the testator died seized of a lot of land and house (No. 643) fronting on Princess street, in the city of St. John; two lots fronting on Orange street (No. 691 and 692); and another lot fronting on Orange street (No. 730) which were appraised as of the value of \u00a31,300.\nExclusive of these lands, the plaintiff, as surviving executor, has in his hands personal property and assets belonging to the estate amounting to $39,462.12.\nThe matter was heard before Mr. Justice Duff, who made a decree declaring that the two defendants first named were entitled to the fund in question representing the real and personal estate under the last clause in the will. On appeal to the Court in Term this decree was varied, and a majority of the Court held that, as to the real estate (except the land in Sussex), there was an intestacy, and it went to the heirs; but they sustained the decree as to the personal estate, agreeing with Mr. Justice Duff that it passed to the first two named defendants under the will in the proportions of the legacies given them.\nFrom this judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, affirming Mr. Justice Duff's judgment, except as to the four lots of land in the city of Saint John, the present appeal was taken.\nDr. Barker, Q. C., for appellants:\u2014\nThe testator after giving to his relations certain legacies, and bequeathing to the respondents' small legacies, comparatively to the residue of the estate, closes his will by a very short, but which would be a very comprehensive clause if the decision of the court below was sustained. It is upon this clause that the controversy arises.\nIt is a well understood rule that merely negative words are not sufficient to exclude the title of the next of kin; there must be an actual gift to some other definite object. Johnson v. Johnson[1], Fitch v. Weber[2]. It is an equally well understood rule of construction as to wills that the heir is not to be excluded without an express devise or necessary implication. Wilkinson v. Adam[3], Dashwood v. Peyton[4].\nIt is submitted that a clause so ambiguous and general as that in this will amounts neither expressly nor by necessary implication to such a gift as would exclude the heir.\nAdmitting, however, for argument's sake, that the words amount to a sufficient devise to defeat the claim of the heir, what passes under the clause?\nIt seems obvious that the real estate would not pass under it. There is no devise of the real estate to any one. The word bequeath used in the will is inapplicable to real estate. In whom did the title vest? Certainly not in the executors, for it is not given to them. The title could not be in a fund; neither could it be in two unincorporated voluntary societies; much less could it be in the three as tenants in common. Besides this, they were only to take in case of a surplus. It therefore follows that the title to the real estate, except that which the executors were empowered to sell, must have vested in the heirs, subject to the payment of the legacies, if they were a charge upon it.\nIt cannot be argued that by the use of the same words in the same sentence, you are to gather a different intention in the testator as to one subject matter from what he has as to another. The object to be sought in construing a will is the testator's intention. When we find in reference to this clause that the testator could not have intended to pass real estate, we must infer that he did not intend to pass any property to which the word surplus would be applicable.\nIt has been put forward that the word surplus refers only to the personal estate in the hands of the executor, Supposing this to be so, there would still be a large fund undisposed of to go to the heirs. It would seem to have been the testator's intention that the charitable legacies should be paid on his death; payment of them is not postponed as in the case of some others. This being so, the legacies were then due, and if due, the amount due could be ascertained. If, therefore, the latter clause has any reference to these legacies, it must be applied then, for there is no means of recovering a portion of these legacies back in case of a deficiency, to be determined years afterwards, and the will does not contemplate more than one payment. The executors, however, must retain sufficient in their hands to pay the other legatees and to produce the annuities payable to the widow and Mrs. Hallett. Whatever remains of the fund which produced the annuities, at the death of the annuitants, was undisposed of, and must go to the heirs. It is submitted that when these charitable legacies were paid by the executors, the executors waived all claims against the charities in case of a deficiency and the charities all claims in case of a surplus. There was then neither surplus nor deficiency, as there remained, after payment of legacies, sufficient to pay the annuities.\nThe testator made his will but twelve days before his death, and when \"weak in body,\" and at a time when he knew substantially the amount of his property as it would be at his death.\nIf you deduct the amount of legacies from the total estate, the balance represents a capital just sufficient at six per cent. to yield the annuities, and he inadvertently did not dispose specifically of this capital, and the proper construction would be to say the respondents are entitled to whatever \"surplus\" or sums of money would be left after laying aside sufficient capital to pay these annuities. In the absence of any clause in the will declaring an intention to dispose of his whole estate. as is found in the wills under discussion in Enohin v. Wylie[5], and Hughes v. Pritchard[6], and in view of the fact that the testator knew that there would be a surplus of some \u00a38,000, or nearly half of his whole estate, it seems impossible to suppose that if he intended to dispose of it he would not have used different language from the ambiguous clause at the end of his will. Coard v. Holderness[7].\nMr. Sturdee for respondents:\nThe fact that the testator declares it to be his last will and testament shows conclusively that he was making, in his own opinion at least, a will disposing of his entire estate.\nMr. Jarman has, in his Rule 16 of Construction, well laid down the law. Words in general are to be taken in their ordinary and grammatical sense, unless a clear intention to use them in another can be collected, and that other can be ascertained; and they are in all cases to receive a construction which will give to every expresssion some effect, rather than one that will render any of the expressions inoperative; and of two modes of construction that is to be preferred which will prevent a total intestacy[8].\nThe residuary clause as to personalty certainly gives any surplus to these charities. The annuitants were dead, and the capital set aside to pay the annuities now is a surplus covered by the residuary clause. The case of Smyth v. Smyth[9] is perhaps the latest case, and we submit on the authority of that case that by surplus he meant any surplus of the property out of which these legacies were to be paid, viz: The general personal estate. Mr. Kaye, Q. C., followed on behalf of the resopndents:\nThe testator had two things at heart, his family and his religion. He distributes certain legacies to his family and the balance to his religion. He orders his executors to provide for his family for an uncertain number of years and then he says, if there is not enough the charities will suffer, if there is surplus then the charities will benefit.\nWhere a will deals with both real and personal estate, as in this case, it is a rule of construction that a residuary clause will be construed to cover both real and personal estate, as was decided in the case of Smyth v. Smyth[10], and cases there cited.\nThe will directs \u00a3300 per annum to be paid to the testator's wife, and \u00a3200 to his sister Rachel, during their natural lives. These sums are not charged on or payable out of a specific fund. There is no difference between an annuity and a legacy. They both stand on the same footing. In the event of any deficiency both would abate pro rata. Wright v. Callendar[11]. To assume, therefore, that a certain amount must be set apart for the annuities, is assuming what is contrary to fact and law. When the testator speaks of surplus or deficiency, he clearly means of what he has been speaking in the former part of his will, viz.: his estate. He is not speaking of what his property was at the time of making his will, but what it would be at the time of his death. In this will the words are general, not special\u2014there is nothing to control or limit them. As the will speaks from the testator's death, the argument that the estate about equals what would be required to pay legacies and produce sufficient on interest to pay the annuities, cannot apply. The death of the testator occurring shortly after making the will, can have no bearing on the case: he might have lived years; and the court cannot look at the amount of the personal estate to aid in construing a will[12].\nIf the argument that it is necessary to set aside a sufficient amount of the estate to produce interest to pay the annuities were to prevail, it might happen that such a large sum would be needed for that purpose as to leave nothing to pay the charitable bequests. Who, in such case, is to judge of the necessary amount, and the rate of interest on which to base the calculation? There would also, on the death of the annuitants, be an intestacy as to the sum so set aside; an intestacy as to a large amount of the estate, with the possibility of these general legacies being left unpaid.\nIf the doctrine propounded by Mr. Justice Wetmore were to prevail, viz., that the surplus or deficiency refers to the money coming from Chestnut\u2014the effect would be to make a new will for the testator, instead of construing the one he has made, which is contrary to the principle that \"the words must be read in their ordinary sense, as written.\" See Grey v. Pearson[13].\nFrom the clauses of this will, it is evident the time to ascertain the surplus or deficiency spoken of would not be upon the death of the testator, as some of the legacies are not to be paid until a future day.\nDr. Barker, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe case states that:\nGilbert T. Ray, late of the city of Saint John, by his last will and Testament, dated 11th October, 1858, among other bequests gave to his wife, Amelia Ray, \u00a3300 per annum during her life, and the use of the house and furniture on Carmarthen Street, in said city; to his sister Rachel, widow of W. P. Hallett, of New York, \u00a3200 per annum during her life, and on his sister's decease, \u00a3100 per annum for eight years thereafter to be divided equally among his sister's unmarried daughters. He also gave to the \"Worn-out Preachers and Widows Fund in connection with the Wesleyan Conference\" the sum of \u00a31250, and to the Missionary Society in connection with the said Conference\" the sum of \u00a31,500. These charitable funds are represented by the respondent, \"The Annual Conference of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in connection with the Methodist Church of Canada.\" He also gave to the \"Bible Society\" \u00a3150, now represented by the respondent, \"The New Brunswick Auxiliary Bible Society.\" After disposing of a large amount of his property in bequests, in which all his next of kin were named, he closed his will in the following words:\n\"Should there be any surplus, or deficiency, a pro rata addition or deduction, as may be, to be made to the following bequests; viz:\n\"Worn-out Preachers and Widows' Fund; Wesleyan Missionary Society; Bible Society.\"\nIn addition to this the testator owned real estate in the city of St. John, with reference to which no mention whatever is made in his will. When the case came before Mr. Justice Duff in the Supreme Court in Equity of New Brunswick, he decreed against the heirs at law and representatives of the testator, and held that these several parties: The Worn-out Preachers and Widows' Fund, the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and the Bible Society were entitled to the whole surplus of the estate. This went on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and there Mr. Justice Palmer was also of opinion that the whole residuary real and personal estate of the testator should go to these beneficiaries. The majority of the court, however, held that only the surplus of the personal property mentioned in the Will passed and that the heirs-at-law, having no interest in that, this surplus should be divided among the beneficiaries, but as regards the land in the city of St John not disposed of, that went to the heirs-at-law. With this conclusion I entirely agree. At the time of this suit, those persons who had a life-interest were dead, and all the annuities and bequests had been paid, and there being a very large surplus of the estate remaining in the hands of the surviving executor, the heirs-at-law and next of kin of Ray claim it as being residuary legatees of his estate undisposed of under his will. I think that although, when the estate came to be wound up, it was found that there was a very large surplus of personal estate, including certain lands in Sussex, which were made personal estate, that is to say over which the executors were given control, and which they had power to realize, the proper construction of the will is that the testator clearly intended to dispose of all his personal property. The words used are \"should there be any surplus or deficiency.\" What surplus do they refer to if not to the surplus of the general personal estate and the amount realized by the sale of the Sussex lands? I am entirely unable to see what other surplus could meet the exigencies of the case and the words of the will. The appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG, J.: \u2014\nI see no difficulty in construing this will in the same way as the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe testator gives a number of pecuniary legacies, including an annuity of \u00a3300 to his wife and one of \u00a3200 to his sister, and also \u00a31,250 to the respondents, \"The Worn-out Preachers' and Widows' Fund\"; \u00a3150 to the respondents, the Bible Society, and \u00a31,500 to the Wesleyan Missionary Society; he also devises two parcels of real property to devisees named in the will, and leaves 540 acres of land, situate in the county of Sussex, to be disposed of by his executors \"at a time when they shall deem it most advantageous.\" The will concludes with the following provision, which alone has given rise to any question:\nShould there be any surplus or deficiency, a pro rata addition or deduction, as the case may be, to be made to the following bequests, viz: Worn-out Preachers' and Widows' Fund; Wesleyan Missionary Society; Bible Society.\nThere being a considerable surplus of personal estate and some real estate undisposed of, alter paying the pecuniary legacies and setting apart a fund sufficient to produce an income equal to the annuities to the testator's widow and sister, this surplus both of realty and personalty was claimed by the three charities mentioned in augmentation of the pecuniary legacies which had already been paid them. The majority of the court below held that the charities are entitled to the surplus of the fund in the hands of the executors, composed of the residue of personalty and the proceeds of the Sussex lands, and that the real estate undisposed of, other than the Sussex lands, descended as on an intestacy to the heirs at law. One learned Judge, Mr. Justice Palmer, was of opinion that the word \"surplus\" in the concluding provision of the will already stated carried not only the residue of the personal estate, but also all the realty not specifically devised.\nIt has been contended on the appeal before this court that nothing passed under this general bequest of the surplus, but that the next of kin are entitled as upon an intestacy to the whole residue of the personalty, including the capital of the funds invested to answer the annuities to the testator's wife and sister. Whilst I am clearly of opinion that the realty other than the Sussex Lands does not pass under the gift of the surplus, but descends to the heirs at law, I am equally in accord with the court below in their determination that the gift of the surplus does carry the whole residue of personalty, including the reversionary interest in the corpus of the fund invested for the annuitants. The direction that the Sussex lands are \"to be disposed of by the executors\" being imperative and not discretionary, except as to the time of conversion, includes a power of sale and a trust of the proceeds to be applied for the purposes of the will, namely, in the payment of the legacies bequeathed by the testator in the same manner as the general personal estate, the sums to be produced by the sale thus forming with the personalty a blended fund for the payment of legacies[14]. Then the word \"surplus\" has reference to the fund out of which the legacies are payable. The words \"surplus\" and \"deficiency\" apply to the same antecedent subject, and \"deficiency\" can only refer to the fund for the payment of legacies, which, as I have already said, is the general personal estate, and the money produced by the sale of the Sussex lands. And as it was in the case of a deficiency of this fund that the three charitable legacies were to abate, so it was in the event of there being a surplus of the same fund, that they were to be augmented. Had the legacies, by any provision to be found in the will, independently of this gift of the surplus, been charged on the realty, I should have been of opinion that the real estate not specifically devised, passed under the word \"surplus;\" but I cannot agree that the legacies were charged on the real estate generally. The will contains nothing to warrant such a proposition. There is no doubt that many authorities, such as Greville v. Browne[15], shew that where pecuniary legacies are bequeathed, and then the testator has given the \"residue of his real and personal estate,\" the legacies are charged on the real estate; but it is a petitio principii to apply such an argument here, for the very question in the present case is whether the word \"surplus\" is used by the testator as an equivalent for \"residue of real and personal estate,\" or whether it means only \"residue\" of the fund out of which pecuniary legacies are payable.\nFor these reasons it follows that the surplus given to the charitable corporations includes only the residue of personalty and the proceeds of the Sussex lands, and does not carry the realty not specifically mentioned.\nThen it was argued on behalf of the appellants that the capital sums set apart and invested for the benefit of the annuitants were not to be included in the surplus, but were, in the event, which has happened, of the personal estate being ample for the payment of all the legatees, to be considered as undisposed of personalty, and as such to go to the next of kin. This proposition is wholly untenable. The residuary clause with which the will concludes is to be construed as a gift of the residue of the testator's personal estate, and it surely cannot be seriously questioned that the capital invested to secure the life annuities sinks into the residue upon the death of the annuitants. The circumstance that pecuniary legacies are also given to the residuary legatee, which can be paid in presenti, whilst the payment of so much of the residue as is made up of the capital of the annuities must be deferred until after the death of the annuitant can make no difference in the right of the residuary legatee to that capital when the annuities fall in. Take the case of a testator directing his whole estate to be invested in an annuity given to A for his life, with a general residuary gift to B; could it be doubted that B, the residuary legatee, would eventually be entitled to the amount invested to secure the annuities? And in what respect does the present case differ from that supposed. A gift of the residue of personalty wholly excludes the next of kin, for under it everything which would be distributable in the event of an intestacy, including all reversionary interests, passes to the legatee. If, therefore, we were to give effect to this argument, we should be altering the testator's will by interpolating an exception in favour of the next of kin of the reversionary interest in the capital of the annuities.\nNo question was made as to the capacity of the respondents, the three charitable societies, to take these legacies. It was conceded that they were all incorporated and authorized by statute to hold lands, and as to so much of the bequest as consists of impure personalty derived from the sale of the Sussex lands, no question can arise under 9 Geo. 2, c. 36, since that statute is not in force in the Province of New Brunswick[16]. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J,:\u2014\nLe testament de Gilbert T.

Les rentes viag\u00e8res, ou legs annuels, en faveur de la veuve du testateur et de sa s\u0153ur Rachel, veuve Hallett, sont \u00e9teintes par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ces deux dames. Il est admis aussi que les seules charges dont la succession reste grev\u00e9e sont 1\u00b0 le paiement annuel, pendant 8 ans aux filles non mari\u00e9es de madame Hallett, savoir: Elizabeth C. Hallett, Fanny Hallett, and Margaretta Ray Hallett, puis 2\u00b0 le legs de \u00a3400 \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Charles Pritchard, fils de Joseph Pritchard, \u00e0 son \u00e2ge de majorit\u00e9, devenu majeur depuis. La valeur actuelle de la succession d'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9tat fourni par Lockhart, le seul ex\u00e9cuteur survivant, serait de $38,000, sur laquelle il n'y aurait \u00e0 faire que la diminution des deux sommes ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es. Il resterait donc un surplus consid\u00e9rable.\nLes choses \u00e9tant en cet \u00e9tat, Lockhart, le seul ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire survivant, assigna comme seules parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, ceux des l\u00e9gataires qui sont d\u00e9fendeurs devant la cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 l'effet d'obtenir une sentence ou d\u00e9cret de cette cour d\u00e9clarant auxquels d'entre eux devait appartenir le surplus des biens du testateur non absorb\u00e9 par ses diverses dispositions particuli\u00e8res.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick, si\u00e9geant en \u00e9quit\u00e9 sous la pr\u00e9sidence de l'honorable juge Duff, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sidu des biens, tant mobiliers qu'immobiliers, du dit Gilbert T. Ray devait appartenir, sujet aux diverses charges ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s religieuses intim\u00e9es \"The Annual Conference of New-Brunswick and Prince-Edward Island, in connection with the Methodist Church of Canada, et \"The New-Brunswick Auxiliary Bible Society.\" Ce jugement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 en appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick, il fut confirm\u00e9, except\u00e9 quant aux quatre lots de terre situ\u00e9s dans la cit\u00e9 de Saint-John, qui furent d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ne pas faire partie du surplus \u00e0 \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 aux legs des intim\u00e9es. C'est ce dernier jugement qui est maintenant soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de cette cour par les appelants, qui sont tous h\u00e9ritiers ou maris de quelques-unes des h\u00e9riti\u00e8res du testateur Gilbert T. Ray.\nLeur pr\u00e9tention est qu'apr\u00e8s le paiement de tous les legs et l'extinction des annuit\u00e9s cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le susdit testament, le surplus de tous les biens, soit mobiliers, soit immobiliers, doit leur revenir \u00e0 titre d'h\u00e9ritiers pour \u00eatre partag\u00e9 entre eux. Le testateur, suivant eux, n'en ayant point fait de disposition. Sa succession se trouve ab intestat quant \u00e0 ce surplus. Les diverses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s religieuses intim\u00e9es pr\u00e9tendent, au contraire, qu'il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 en leur faveur par la clause du testament d\u00e9clarant que, dans le cas de surplus ou d\u00e9ficit, il faudra, suivant le cas, ajouter ou retrancher \u00e0 leurs legs.\nDe l'interpr\u00e9tation de cette clause d\u00e9pend la solution de la question soulev\u00e9e.\nIl n'est pas douteux qu'un des premiers devoirs du juge dans l'interpr\u00e9tation d'un testament est de s'efforcer de d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9ritable intention du testateur et de lui donner effet; mais, dans le cas actuel comme dans toutes les causes de ce genre, la difficult\u00e9 est de constater cette intention. Les termes employ\u00e9s par les testateurs et la nature des dispositions testamentaires variant pour ainsi dire dans chaque cas, les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents sont ici de peu de secours. C'est, en cons\u00e9quence, aux principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qu'il faut recourir pour trouver la solution de la pr\u00e9sente difficult\u00e9.\nOn a vu, par les dispositions du testament rapport\u00e9es ci-dessus, que le testateur a fait preuve d'une grande lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 envers sa femme et ses proches parents. N'ayant point d'enfant, il a laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme une rente annuelle de \u00a3300 et \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur une autre rente de \u00a3200; \u00e0 ses ni\u00e8ces, filles de cette s\u0153ur, une somme de \u00a3100 pendant huit ans, apr\u00e8s la mort de leur m\u00e8re; \u00e0 ses neveux des sommes consid\u00e9rables et des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res \u00e0 l'un d'eux. Il semble n'en avoir oubli\u00e9 aucun. Rien n'indique donc dans ce testament que le testateur ait voulu priver ses h\u00e9ritiers de sa succession. Aucune disposition ne les exclut, et il est de principe que m\u00eame de simples expressions n\u00e9gatives ne suffiraient pas pour exclure l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime, mais qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire pour cela qu'il y ait une disposition formelle qui donne les biens de la succession \u00e0 d'autres personnes. Le pr\u00e9sent testament n'en contient aucune, \u00e0 moins que l'on ne consid\u00e8re comme telle les expressions au sujet du surplus ou du d\u00e9ficit.\nQuelles pu \u00eatre l'intention du testateur en employant les termes surplus ou d\u00e9ficit? Se rapportaient-ils dans son esprit \u00e0 toute sa succession, ou ne les appliquait-il, comme l'a pens\u00e9 l'honorable juge Wetmore, qu'au surplus des argents qui lui \u00e9taient dus par Robert Chesnut, sur lesquels devaient se prendre les \u00a31250 donn\u00e9s aux Worn-out Preachers et au fond des veuves. Ou bien encore, le testateur voulait-il par ces termes faire allusion au surplus ou d\u00e9ficit qui pouvait avoir lieu apr\u00e8s le placement des fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer le paiement des annuit\u00e9s, ou encore, le surplus de tous les capitaux, argents, biens personnels de toute esp\u00e8ce enfin qui devait in\u00e9vitablement rester apr\u00e8s le paiement des legs et l'extinction des annuit\u00e9s. Voil\u00e0 bien des possibilit\u00e9s; nous n'avons que l'embarras du choix et il n'est pas peu consid\u00e9rable.\nL'id\u00e9e que les termes surplus ou d\u00e9ficit pouvaient se rapporter \u00e0 toute la succession est n\u00e9cessairement exclue par la nature des dispositions du testament fait peu de jours avant la mort du testateur, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait malade et ne pouvait plus songer \u00e0 faire des affaires qui auraient pu mat\u00e9riellement alt\u00e9rer sa fortune. S'il \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de faire un testament valable, on doit consid\u00e9rer qu'il connaissait parfaitement l'\u00e9tat de ses affaires, et qu'il ne pouvait pas ignorer que sa succession valait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ce que l'inventaire, fait peu de temps apr\u00e8s, a constat\u00e9, \u00a318,592,2,7.\nAvec l'id\u00e9e de la valeur r\u00e9elle de ce qu'il poss\u00e9dait, il ne pouvait certainement lui entrer dans l'esprit qu'apr\u00e8s avoir fait des dispositions qui n'absorbaient qu'\u00e0 peine une moiti\u00e9 de sa fortune, il avait \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir le cas d'un d\u00e9ficit, lorsqu'il devait au contraire savoir que, tous les legs pay\u00e9s, il devait encore rester une moiti\u00e9 de sa fortune, compos\u00e9e des capitaux qui devaient \u00eatre employ\u00e9s \u00e0 servir les annuit\u00e9s. Il ne pouvait pas avoir de doute \u00e0 ce sujet. Le caract\u00e8re des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s faites \u00e0 sa femme, \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur et \u00e0 ses ni\u00e8ces devait n\u00e9cessairement, dans son esprit, exiger l'application de capitaux suffisants pour produire le montant des annuit\u00e9s constitu\u00e9es. Il a d\u00fb penser que ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires en agiraient ainsi, apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 tous les legs exigibles au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nLa nature des dispositions indique clairement qu'un tel r\u00e8glement devait avoir lieu peu de temps apr\u00e8s l'ouverture de la succession, car la plupart des legs, \u00e0 l'exception des annuit\u00e9s et de deux autres sommes, sont payables sans d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9, et cons\u00e9quemment imm\u00e9diatement exigibles. Telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'interpr\u00e9tation adopt\u00e9e par les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Elles n'ont pas cru que le testateur avait ajourn\u00e9 le paiement de leurs legs \u00e0 une \u00e9poque \u00e9loign\u00e9e, d\u00e9pendant enti\u00e8rement d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements incertains, comme la mort de son \u00e9pouse, arriv\u00e9e en 1875, et celle de sa s\u0153ur en 1876 et devant se prolonger encore apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re, pendant huit ans en faveur de ses filles. Il est certain que non. Le testament est au contraire fait dans la vue d'un r\u00e8glement imm\u00e9diat, except\u00e9 comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 dit des deux autres legs. Dans le cas d'un tel r\u00e8glement, pr\u00e9vu sans doute par le testateur, les legs une fois pay\u00e9s, et les capitaux n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer les annuit\u00e9s plac\u00e9s, il \u00e9tait assez naturel pour lui de penser qu'il pourrait y avoir un certain montant au-dessus ou au-dessous du capital qu'il fallait investir pour assurer les annuit\u00e9s. Dans le premier cas, le surplus devait \u00eatre partag\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e par la clause en question; de m\u00eame que dans le second cas, le d\u00e9ficit devait \u00eatre combl\u00e9 aux d\u00e9pens des m\u00eames legs. Tout cela suppose une op\u00e9ration qui devait se faire presqu'aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s la mort du testateur et non pas 26 ans apr\u00e8s, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l'expiration de toutes les annuit\u00e9s, Le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9finitif de l'ex\u00e9cution du testament ne peut servir \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation d'une clause qui devait imm\u00e9diatement recevoir son ex\u00e9cution. Pour saisir le sens de cette clause obscure, il faut se reporter \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du testament, alors on comprend mieux que le surplus ou d\u00e9ficit dont le testateur a fait mention devait \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat qu'il entrevoyait comme la cons\u00e9quence du r\u00e8glement imm\u00e9diat de sa succession.\nEn interpr\u00e9tant la disposition de cette mani\u00e8re, il se serait encore trouv\u00e9 un surplus d'environ $8,000; mais d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 le testateur pouvait penser que quelques-unes de ses cr\u00e9ances ou des capitaux pourraient diminuer de valeur et amener peut-\u00eatre un d\u00e9ficit. C'est sans doute pour cette raison qu'il a fait usage des deux mots surplus ou d\u00e9ficit. A ce point de vue les deux mots s'expliquent d'une mani\u00e8re naturelle et tous deux re\u00e7oivent leur interpr\u00e9tation; tandis qu'en les appliquant \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de la succession il faut pour les interpr\u00e9ter omettre la possibilit\u00e9 entrevue par le testateur d'un d\u00e9ficit, et, dans ce cas la clause n'est pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans son entier, puisqu'on l'applique \u00e0 une certitude absolue au lieu de l'alternative possible pr\u00e9vue par le testateur. Ce n'est plus son intention que l'on constate, mais c'est une disposition que l'on fait pour lui en supprimant la possibilit\u00e9 d'un d\u00e9ficit. De cette mani\u00e8re on arrive \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat qui n'a jamais d\u00fb entrer dans l'esprit du testateur, celui de lui faire donner, au moyen de ces expressions vagues et obscures, plus de la moiti\u00e9 de sa succession.\nA part de cette interpr\u00e9tation qui consiste \u00e0 dire que le testateur avait en vue un surplus ou d\u00e9ficit apr\u00e8s le paiement de tous les legs et le placement de tous les capitaux n\u00e9cessaires pour produire les annuit\u00e9s, il y a encore celle sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Wetmore, tendant \u00e0 faire l'application de ces termes au surplus ou d\u00e9ficit des argents dus par Robert Chesnut. Ainsi que l'honorable juge en a fait mention, l'\u00e9tat de la succession produit par l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire Lockhart, les legs en question pay\u00e9s, il reste encore un surplus de $1,200 sur la cr\u00e9ance Chesnut qui pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9parti suivant le d\u00e9sir du testateur. Il aurait pu se faire qu'il y e\u00fbt un d\u00e9ficit dans la rentr\u00e9e de cette cr\u00e9ance, et c'est peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 une probabilit\u00e9 de ce genre que pensait le testateur lorsqu'il a fait la disposition dont il s'agit. L'une ou l'autre de ces deux explications me para\u00eet plus conforme aux intentions du testateur que celle qui lui fait l\u00e9guer plus de la moiti\u00e9 de sa succession, en donnant au mot surplus une signification \u00e0 laquelle il ne pensait pas, puisqu'il ne s\u00e9parait pas l'id\u00e9e du surplus de la possibilit\u00e9 d'un d\u00e9ficit- Il y a en faveur de l'une ou l'autre de ces deux interpr\u00e9tations la possibilit\u00e9 de faire l'application des deux termes employ\u00e9s par le testateur, car dans l'un et l'autre cas, il ne pouvait dire avec certitude s'il y aurait ou non un surplus, tandis que le doute \u00e9tait impossible s'il avait en vue la totalit\u00e9 de la succession.\nQuant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation du mot \"surplus\" comme n'\u00e9tant pas suffisant dans le cas actuel pour transmettre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res, j'adopte le raisonnement de l'honorable juge en chef Allen, \u00e9tablissant bien clairement, suivant moi, que la disposition est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante pour produire cet effet.\nDes diff\u00e9rentes applications possibles du mot \"surplus\" mentionn\u00e9es plus haut, il reste encore celle qui consisterait \u00e0 l'appliquer aux biens mobiliers seulement, restant entre les mains des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires apr\u00e8s le paiement des legs et l'extinction des annuit\u00e9s. A cette interpr\u00e9tation j'oppose le raisonnement fait plus haut pour r\u00e9futer l'application que l'on veut faire du mot \"surplus\" \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de la succession: ce n'est pas le cas pr\u00e9vu par le testateur. Il ne pouvait pas avoir un seul instant l'id\u00e9e qu'il y aurait un d\u00e9ficit; il devait, au contraire, \u00eatre bie ncertain qu'apr\u00e8s d\u00e9duction faite des sommes l\u00e9gu\u00e9es, sa succession mobili\u00e8re laisserait un surplus consid\u00e9rable. Ce devait \u00eatre pour lui une certitude absolue \u00e0 laquelle il n'est pas possible de faire l'application d'une phrase comportant un doute. Si son intention e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u00e9guer le r\u00e9sidu de ses biens, il n'aurait certainement pas fait usage des deux mots surplus ou d\u00e9ficit. Il se serait \u00e9videmment born\u00e9 \u00e0 parler du r\u00e9sidu.\nQuoi qu'il en soit, le moins que l'on puisse dire, c'est que, dans les circonstances de la cause, cette clause du testament fait na\u00eetre tant de doute qu'il n'est gu\u00e8re possible de lui donner effet sans s'exposer \u00e0 faire un testament pour le testateur. Il n'y a aucune raison de donner une interpr\u00e9tation forc\u00e9e \u00e0 ces termes, dans le but d'assurer l'ex\u00e9cution compl\u00e8te du testament. Toutes ses dispositions positives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es: chacun des l\u00e9gataires a re\u00e7u ce qu'il devait recevoir. Dans un cas semblable, le doute qui rend l'ex\u00e9cution d'une telle disposition aussi incertaine doit tourner au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime. Dans le cas d'une telle interpr\u00e9tation, il est vrai qu'il reste une partie de la succession dont le testateur n'a point dispos\u00e9. C'est vrai, mais ce n'est pas un \u00e9v\u00e9nement tr\u00e8s rare, et lorsqu'il se pr\u00e9sente, la loi suppl\u00e9e \u00e0 l'omission du testateur. Rien n'oblige un testateur \u00e0 faire une disposition de tous ses biens par testament. S'il est vrai que l'on pr\u00e9sume ordinairement qu'il a voulu disposer de la totalit\u00e9, faut-il au moins pour cela qu'il y ait dans le testament des expressions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui puisse \u00e9tablir que telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 son intention. Nous n'en trouvons aucune dans le testament en question. Les expressions en t\u00eate du testament: \"This is my last will and testament,\" font bien voir que c'est le testament auquel il s'arr\u00eate et le seul auquel il entend donner effet, si toutefois il en a fais d'autres; mais cette d\u00e9claration ne fait aucunement voir l'intention de disposer de la totalit\u00e9 de succession. Pour r\u00e9aliser cette intention, si elle e\u00fbt exist\u00e9, il faut des dispositions formelles pouvant avoir cet effet.\nIt certainly shows that the testator commenced his will with the intention not to die intestate with respect to any portion of his property; but does not supersede the necessity of that intention being subsequently carried into effect by an active disposition.\nSi les expressions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui, dans bien des cas, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es suffisantes pour op\u00e9rer une disposition de toute la succession, comme celles-ci par exemple: \"All that I am worth\" \"all that I shall die possessed of, \"real and personal, of what nature and kind soever,\" \"such \"wordly property wherewith it has pleased God to bless me in this world, I give\" etc., se rencontraient dans le pr\u00e9sent testament, on pourrait avec raison en tirer la conclusion que les mots surplus ou d\u00e9ficit doivent se rapporter \u00e0 une disposition universelle et qu'ils doivent en avoir les effets, au moins quant aux biens mobiliers. En l'absence de semblables expressions, je ne puis pas donner aux mots surplus et d\u00e9ficit une autre signification que celle que j'ai essay\u00e9e de leur trouver et que j'ai expos\u00e9e plus haut. C'est sur cette signification que je m'appuie pour conclure que le testateur n'a pas dispos\u00e9 de toute sa succession et que le surplus qui devait \u00eatre adjug\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9es devait \u00eatre seulement l'exc\u00e9dant des capitaux n\u00e9cessaires au service des annuit\u00e9s,\u2014les capitaux eux-m\u00eames devant retourner aux h\u00e9ritiers du testateur, faute de disposition suffisante pour les transmettre \u00e0 d'autres personnes.\nHENRY, J:\u2014\nThe will in this case was made on the 11th October, 1858, and the testator died on the 23rd of the same month; and, probate having been granted to his executors, they, on the 25th July, 1859, filed an inventory of his estate amounting to \u00a318,592 2s 7d., or $74,390.11. The legacies to be paid under the will amounted to \u00a310,350 or $41,400.\nThe testator left to his widow an annuity of \u00a3300, or $1,200, a year during her life, and the use of a house, valued at \u00a31,500, or $6,000, and the furniture therein. He also left to his sister Rachel an annuity of \u00a3200, or $800, a year for her life, and at her death one-half that sum to her daughters for 8 years.\nIt appears and it is admitted, that after the paying the legacies and annuities, there remained of the estate at the time of the commencement of the suit, undisposed of in the hands of the surviving executor in the shape of land in the county of Sussex, valued at $608, mortgage securities $17,005, stocks $14,900, debentures $6,600 and cash $349.12, making in all $39,462.12.\nThe widow of the testator died in 1875, and his sister Rachel in 1876. The only remaining charges on the estate under the will are a legacy of \u00a3400 to Charles Pritchard, and the annuity of \u00a3100 to the daughters of Rachel the sister of the testator.\nThe appellants claim to be entitled to the balance as next of kin and heirs at law of the testator. The respondents claim it under the last clause of the will.\nThe testator, by his will, after giving an annuity of \u00a3300 and the use of a house and furniture to his widow during her life, and an annuity of \u00a3200 to his sister Rachel during her life, made bequests to the respondents amounting in the aggregate to \u00a32,900, and several bequests to some of the appellants and others amounting to $7,840, and concludes his will by these words \"should there be any surplus or deficiency a pro rata addition or deduction, as may be, to be made to the following bequests, viz: Worn out preachers and widows fund. Wesleyan Missionary Society. Bible Society.\"\nOur judgment therefore depends solely on the construction to be put upon this clause of the will. The testator was a permanent resident of St. John, New Brunswick, but his will shows it was made at Granville, in Nova Scotia, where, it states, he was \"at present residing.\" Being absent from his place of business when the will was executed it is not unreasonable to conclude that he had not all the means of reference for information as to the value of his estate which he otherwise would have had, and that may account for the large part of it left specifically undisposed of. We cannot speculate as to the result of a more specific disposition under other circumstances. It is, however, reasonable to conclude that had he known or thought, at the time of making his will, of the value of his estate, he would have disposed of it more specifically. If indeed he had reason to believe his estate was as valuable as it really was, would he, if he intended so large a bequest to the respondents, have given them the specific sums bequeathed to them respectively, or is it not the reasonable presumption that he intended to make a distribution of his estate in something like the proportions stated in his will, but that he wished to have the annuities and legacies to his relatives and other friends, securely provided for, and that any unimportant deficiency or excess should affect only the legacies to the respondents. We must gather the intentions of the testator from his will, and from that alone where it is unambiguous. Where it is otherwise, we are not only permitted, but bound, to call to our aid, in considering the matter, the surrounding circumstances, including the quality, extent and value of his whole estate, and, looking at the whole will, come to a conclusion as to the intentions of the testator. It is an elementary principle of the law that it requires an express devise or bequest to oust the heir-at-law, or, what may be as effectual, a clearly manifested intention shown in the will to oust him. The party seeking to do so has the burden on him of showing it, and if there is any reasonable ambiguity as to the right or claim of a residuary or other legatee, the heir is entitled. That principle is clearly applicable in this case, if the residuary clause admits of two constructions\u2014one favorable, the other adverse to the claim of the respondents\nIn resolving the difficulty it becomes necessary to enquire, in the first place, at what time under the will was the distribution to be made? If the inventory showed sufficient to pay and provide for the specific legacies other than those to the respondents, independent of the security necessary to provide for the payment of the annuities, the other legacies vested and the legatees could, in a short time after the inventory was filed, being the time provided by law for distribution, have enforced their claims to them. The inventory having been filed in July, 1859, we find nothing in the case to show when the specific legacies were paid except those to the respondents, which was in November and December, 1860. The receipts for the same are, in one case, for \"one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds bequeathed to the worn-out Preachers and Widows Fund in connection with the Wesleyan Conference here.\" Another for \"One thousand five hundred pounds bequeathed to the Wesleyan Missionary Society in connection with the Conference here;\" and the third for \"One hundred and fifty pounds bequeathed to the Bible Society.\"\nThose entitled to the legacies just mentioned, at the dates of the payments to them, received from the executors the several sums as and for the bequests made to them respectively by the testator. They received, and the executors paid, those several legacies, with, as we must assume, a full knowledge of all the circumstances of the estate and of the terms of the will. It is very questionable in my mind, whether the parties who received payment of those legacies on the terms stated in the several receipts would not be estopped from claiming further of the estate. The words used make no reference to any specific legacy, but refer to and include all bequeathed by the testator. The parties entitled to the legacies had then the alternative of accepting or refusing the several amounts, and in doing the latter might have waited until some future time to have ascertained whether they would be entitled to claim more under the residuary clause, or run the risk of getting less. The residuary clause (so called), in the shape we find it, is an unusual one. In the usual residuary clauses the terms are plain and simple; they, in most cases, provide for giving unqualifiedly the residue of the estate. Here the residuary clause operates both ways; either to add to or diminish the amounts of certain preceding specific legacies. A different construction must therefore be be given toit. It gives nothing absolutely; and not only so, but provides for even a deduction from previous bequests. We must, therefore, ascertain from the whole will what the testator intended when he made provision for the result of \"any surplus or deficiency.\"\nAs I have already shown, parties interested as legatees, the payment of whose legacies was not postponed, might, under the law, have enforced the payment of all the legacies at or about the date of the payment of the legacies to the respondents. We are not informed whether they did so or not; but it may be presumed from what we do know, that they pressed for payment at the usual time, and the respondents may also have done so. There was no provision in the will for ascertaining the amount of the several legacies to be paid to the respondents more than once; and, when once done, I think it must be considered as final. It was a question of deduction from or addition to the amount of the specific legacies to them; and the case is, therefore, very different from what it would have been had no question of deduction required to be settled. That question had to be considered in connection with the provision for addition, if the value of the estate entitled the respondents to it. When, therefore, they received the respective amounts, they saved themselves from the chances of a reduction, and that, it appears to me, taken in connection with the receipts signed, is evidence of a waiver of any further claim. At the time (in 1860) when the respondents received the amount of the specific legacies, in what position was the estate, and what course had the executors to adopt to secure to all parties the rights they obtained under the will, and, at the same time, to secure themselves? After the lapse of over twenty years we are apt to look at the present position of the estate and be thereby influenced. It is, however, wrong to do so. That a comparatively large balance remains undisposed of is fortunate; but it was not necessarily so, and although the assets in 1860 warranted the belief that the estate would eventually be sufficient to meet the provision for the annuities and unconditional legacies, it might have resulted very differently. The assets were largely composed of property liable to loss and deterioration, such as vessels liable to be lost, damaged, or decreased in value, and unsecured debts due to the estate. This information I have got from the inventory. We have none as to the position or value of the assets when the legacies were paid to the respondents; but we have this fact, that several of the debts are marked \"doubtful\" in the inventory. No general account of the executors showing receipts and payments was in evidence, and all we have is a statement of what, at the time the present suit was commenced, was then alleged to be in the hands of the surviving executor. This gives us no information as to the position of the estate in December, 1860. We cannot therefore judge as to it when the payments of the legacies in question were made, and cannot decide whether or not it was, at that time, for the interests of the respondents to have accepted the sums paid them as in full for what was bequeathed to them. Their acceptance of the amount of the specific legacies is, however, affirmative evidence that it was so. In taking this position, however, I do not, in the absence of more positive evidence, insist upon their receipt of the specific legacies as a full and complete bar to the claim they now make; but as evidence to aid us in the construction of the ambiguous clause in question, so far as their acts are evidence of the construction put upon it by themselves at the time. Independently, however, of every other consideration let us see, as far as we can from the evidence before us, what were the duties and responsibilities of the executors in December, 1860, before the payments in question were made. They had then, as shown by the inventory, an estate amounting in gross to $74,368.50.\nThey had, then, that sum available to provide for the annuities and legacies. I have made a calculation of the amount the executors should retain for the annuities, which constituted the first charge, and for the unconditional legacies, and find that for that purpose nearly the whole sum would be required, leaving little or nothing for the conditional legacies to the respondents. Did then the testator intend that should be the mode of dealing with his estate, or did he mean that the matter of his estate should remain open and undistributed, and the matter of the adjustment, under the residuary clause, postponed until the lapse of the annuities by the death of his widow and his sister Rachel? We find the former lived seventeen and the latter eighteen years after his death; and, for all we know, they might in the course of nature have lived many years longer. I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the latter is the proper construction of the clause. We must read the will, as I before said, not by any speculation as to how he would have disposed of the balanee now claimed had he known positively how the administration of his estate would have resulted, but by the words he uses in respect to his bequests. And if we can find a reasonable interpretation we should at once adopt it in preference to one of an opposite character. We must assume, in the absence of postponing provisions, that he meant his estate to be administered in the usual legal way and within the prescribed time. Did he desire the estate not to be governed by the law as to estates generally? We would look for some manifestation of such in the will; but such is not to be found in it; we cannot therefore attribute to him any such desire. He, in my opinion, therefore, virtually instructed his executors within the prescribed period to ascertain how much of his estate, specially undevised, would be necessary to secure the annuities and pay or secure the unconditional legacies, and to apply the balance to the payment of the conditional legacies to the respondents. If not sufficient to pay the whole, then to pay in the proportion he prescribed. If more than sufficient, to distribute the surplus in the same proportion. Taking the clauses giving the specific sums to the respondents, with the residuary clause, they are just the same as, and no more, in my opinion, than a provision in the will, stating that if any balance remained after providing for the annuities and unconditional legacies, it was to be distributed to the respondents in the proportion of \u00a31,250 to one; \u00a31,500 to another; and \u00a3150 to the third. Each of those specific bequests is just as effectually made to depend on a contingency in the one case as in the other; and the question is, what that contingency is, and when it was to arise and govern the distribution? I have called the clause in question a residuary clause, but it is not so in the usual acceptation of the term. It amounts to nothing more than conditional bequests to the bodies named. The usual residuary clause is evidence of an anticipated surplus from the whole or certain prescribed parts of an estate. The clause in this will is evidence that the testator was altogether uncertain whether there would be sufficient to pay even the whole or any part of the specific bequests to the respondents.\nI have fully considered the bearing of the cases cited at the argument, and others, from which I am justified in saying that it requires, in order to divest the heir-at-law, that it should conclusively appear on the face of the will to have been the testator's intention to do so; in fact, that the testator should clearly manifest his intention of disposing of the whole of his estate.\nI will refer to two cases in proof of the positions I have taken.\nIn Hughes v. Pritchard[17], in 1877, the words used by James, L. J., as showing the purport of the will in that case, are:\nIn order to make a disposition of all my estate, real and personal, I give Whiteacre to A.; Blackacre to B.; \u00a31,000 to C.; my shares to D., and I make E. F. and G. my residuary legatees.\nThe question at issue was whether such a devise would include a farm to the residuary legatees which was not specifically devised, and it was held that it did, to the exclusion of the heir-at-law.\nBramwell, L. J., in his judgment, uses these words:\nBut it is true that though he says \"I ordain this to be my last will and testament,\" if he had omitted to dispose of any portion of it, it would follow then that the intention he had expressed would be unfulfilled as to part of his estate. But that is not so, because, after giving, as has been observed, gifts of personalty and devises of realty he finishes in this way: I make my sister, Mary Pritchard, and the others my residuary legatees, that is to say, legatees of the residue. Residue of what? Why, residue of that of which he had been previously disposing of parts.\nThe learned judge thought, from the tenor of the will generally and the words \"the estate which God has been pleased in his good providence to bestow on me,\" which are very comprehensive, and upon which much stress was laid, that the testator did not intend to die intestate as to the farm then in question.\nIn that case the residuary clause is altogether unambiguous and very comprehensive. In this the provision is of very uncertain meaning and reference. There are no words showing, as in the case cited, the intention of the testator to dispose of his whole estate. In that the testator expressly stated his intention to devise and bequeath all the estate, real and personal, which it pleased God to bestow on him. Here no such intention is manifested or declared. In this case we have not only the absence of any expression of such intention, but a disposition which can be understood, as the intention of the testator to make his bequests to the repondents wholly to rest on the contingency which I have explained.\nAs I before stated, the onus of sustaining the bequests is on the respondents; and in order to divest the heir-at-law the devise must be certain and unambiguous.\nThe prevailing rule is laid down by Lord Mansfield, C. J., in Roe ex dem. Willing v. Tend[18], thus:\u2014\nIn cases between the heir and the devisee the question is not whether the heir can prove that the testator did not intend to pass real property, but whether the devisee can prove that he did; the proof lies on the devisee.\nThe same doctrine is applicable to this case and must guide us.\nAfter the best consideration I have been able to give to the matter, I have arrived at the conclusion that the respondents have failed to show, as they were bound to do, a devise to them sufficient to oust the heirs. At the very least, there are grounds for serious doubts which should not exist in a case in which it is sought to oust the right of the heirs-at-law and which alone are sufficient, in my opinion, to prevent the recovery of the respondents; such doubts should not be resolved in favor of the latter upon mere speculation. If they have failed to remove all such doubts, the heirs are entitled to our judgment. I think there are such doubts at all events in this case, and therefore our judgment should find that the balance now in contest was undisposed of by the will\u2014that no provision was therein made for the disposition of it, and that to that extent the testator died intestate.\nI think the appellants are entitled to our judgment in their favor, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt may be that if the testator had thought that his estate would have turned out as valuable as it has done, he might have made a different disposition of the surplus; but the question we have to deal with is, what is the disposition which he has made of his property by his will, and upon this point I concur in the construction put upon the will by the majority of the court below, and in the reasons given for that judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: F.

T., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J.J\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nSale en bloc-Deficiency\u2014Warranty effect of.\nBy a deed executed October 22nd; 1866, for the purpose of making good a deficiency of fifty square miles of limits which respondents had previously sold to appellants, together with a saw mill, the right of using a road to mill, four acres of land, and all right and title obtained from the Crown to 255 square miles of limits for a sum en bloc of $20,000, the respondents ceded and transferred \"with warranty against all troubles generally whatsoever\" to the appellants, two other limits containing 50 square miles : in the description of the limits given in the deed, the following words are to be found: \"Not to interfere with limits granted or to be renewed in view of regulations.\" The limits were, in 1867, found in fact to interfere with anterior grants made to one H.\nHeld, That the respondents having guaranteed the appellants against all troubles whatsoever, and at the time of such warranty the said 50 miles of limits sold having become, through the negligence of respondent s auteurs, the property of H. the appellants were entitled, pursuant to Art. 1518 C C, P. Q., to recover the value of the limits from which they had been evicted proportionally upon the whole price, and damages to be estimated according to the increased value of said limits at the time of eviction, and also to recover, pursuant to Art. 1515 C. C, for all improvements, but as the evidence as to proportionate value and damages was not satisfactory, it was ordered that the record should be sent back to the court of first instance and that upon a report to be made by experts to that court on the value Of the same at the time of eviction the case be proceeded with as to law and justice may appertain.\nPer Henry and Gwynne, L J., dissenting, That the only reasonable construction which could be put upon the words \" with warranty against all troubles generally whatsover \" in the deed, must be to limit their application to protecting the assignee of the licenses against all claims to the licenses themselves, as the instruments conveying the limits therein described, and not as a guarantee that the assignee of the licenses should enjoy the limits therein described, notwithstanding it should appear that they were interfered with by a prior license. But, assuming a different construction to be correct, there was not sufficient evidence of a breach of the guarantee.\nAPPEAL from a judgment rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench, Montreal (Sir A, A. Dorion, C. J. and Monk, Ramsay and Cross, J.J.), confirming a judgment of the Superior Court, Toilette (Olivier, J.), 'whereby the action of T H. (Cushing, plaintiff, now represented by appellant, against the respondents, was dismissed.\nThe facts of the case are briefly these : The late Edward Scallon, of Joliette, lumber merchant, by pro mise of sale, dated 10th. July, 1858, agreed to sell to Benjamin Peck or his assigns, a saw mill built of stone, situated on the L'Assomption river, in the second range of township of Keldon, in the parish of St. Charles Borrom\u00e9e, in the said district of Joliette with its saws straps, gearing, water power, booms, chains, anchors.\n\" The right of using the road leading from the Queen's highway to said mill.\n\" Four acres of land bounded as follows: in front by the Queen's highway, in rear by the brink of the hill, on the north side by the road leading from the Queen's highway to the mill on the south side by the land owned by the seller with the right of passing over the land of the seller along the bank of the river from the mill to the boom.\n\"All the right and title obtained by seller from the Crown to certain timber limits situated on the banks of L'Assomption river and its tributaries, the Black river and river Ducharme\" in all thirteen limits covering an area of 256 square miles, for the sum of $20,000 and other considerations. .After Scallon's s death his successors, represented by respondents, in execution of the promise of sale, by notaries deed of the 16th March, 1865, \" did cede, transfer and abandon with promise of warranty against all troubles generally', ' to the appellant as Peck's assign, the immovable\u2019s and rights which the late Edward Scallon had promised to sell to the said Peck giving the description verbatim as in the promise of sale of the 10th July, 1858.\nThe sellers by this deed also acknowledged that the $20,000, price of sale of the said limits, had been paid to the said late Edward Scallon in the manner stipulated for in the paper-writing of the 10th July, 1858. they recognized also having received from the said B. D. Peck, his representatives and assigns, the costs of the renewal of all the licenses for said limits dating ron 10th July, 1858, up to the 16th March, 1865. It was, however afterwards discovered that there was a deficiency of fifty square miles in the extent of the timber limits sold, and thereupon P. E. McConville as agent for the respondents, for the purpose of making good the above deficiency of fifty miles of timber limits, by another notaries deed dated 22nd October 1866 \" did cede and transfer, with warranty against all troubles generally whatsoever', to the appellant present and accepting thereof, an equal quantity of fifty miles of timber limits on the L'Assomption river, and described as follows in the English language, to wit :\n\"No 25.\"Commencing at the upper end of 25 square miles ( limit No 94, on the south west side of L'Assomption river, granted to late Edward Scallon, and extending five miles on said river, and five miles back from its banks, making a limit of twenty-five square miles, not to interfere with limits granted or to be renewed in virtue of regulations\"\n\"No.26. Commencing on the north-east side 25 square miles ' of L'Assomption river, at the \"upper end of limit No. 96, granted to late Edward Scallon, and extending five miles up the river, and five miles from its banks, making a limit of twenty-five square miles, not to interfere with licenses granted or to be renewed in virtue of regulations.\" And the licenses for the year 1866, 1867, were handed to Mr. Cushing, and a sum of $500 for all claims whatsoever up to that day was paid by respondents.\nWith a view to work these 50 miles of limits and to bring the wood down by the river L'Assomption, the plaintiff in 1867-1868, caused the rocks to be blasted, and the obstructions existing in the river to be removed and constructed four dams to hold in the water and facilitate the bringing down of the wood from said limits.\nBut it was found that these limits also interfered with limits granted to George B. Hall, and .the matter having been referred to the Crown Lands Department, it was ascertained that the limits assigned by the last deed of 22nd October, 1866, to appellant by respondents did not exist, and were covered by the licenses previously granted to Mr. Hall as far back as 1853. Conformably to the foregoing facts plaintiff (appellant) brought his action and prayed for a condemnation against the defendants in the sum of $58,200, leaving them, however, the option of immediately placing him in possession of the of 50 miles of limits either those sold him by the deeds of 10th July, 1858, and of the 16th March, 1865, or else those above described, and in either case asking condemnation for $8,200 damage only.\nThe defendant, Dafne Clothide Scallon, pleaded separately from the other defendant, but she, as well as the others, setup against the action a d\u00e9fense en fait followed by a peremptory exception. By the latter plea the defendants allege :\nThat by the deed of 22nd October, 1866, the plaintiff acknowledged having received from the defendants the licenses for the two timber limits which he pretended then to be deficient upon those sold him by the late Edward Scallon and the said defendants.\nThat by the same deed the plaintiff acknowledged having received from the defendants a sum of $500 for all rights and claims whatsoever that he might have had until that time against the defendants by reason of the deeds made by said Edward Scallon, or by the defendants in favor of said plaintiff or his predecessors (auteurs.)\nThat the parties to the said deed reciprocally and in good faith gave to each other a general acquittance of all claim that might exist on one side or the other.\nThere was a cross action, but the judgment rendered on the cross-action was not appealed from. The plaintiff, by his answers to the defendants' peremptory exceptions, alleged that it was only in consideration of the cession and abandonment made to him, in full ownership by defendants of the 50 miles of limits in question, and of the undertaking on their part to secure him in the enjoyment thereof with warranty against all possible disturbance, encroachment or trouble of whatever nature or kind, and upon the payment to him made of the sum of $500, that he consented to grant acquittance of the claims he had against the defendants, the said acquittance relating chiefly to divers claims which the plaintiff had against the defendants for encroachments they had made upon his limits and other properties.\nUpon this issue the parties went to proof, and judgment was rendered against the plaintiff dismissing his action, which judgment was confirmed in the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side.) Mr. Bethune, Q.O., for appellant ;\nThe action in this case arises out of an agreement, dated 22nd October, 1866, between T. S. Gushing, appellant's representative and the respondents, by which the latter expressly sold and conveyed to said Gushing, with promise of warranty against all hindrances, 50 miles of limits, Nos. 25 and 26, in lieu of limits 97 and 98 that were wanting in a previous transaction. Gushing' only found out. in 1868 that he could not get possession of limits 25 and 26, the Government having previously sold them to one Hall, and thereupon this action was commenced against Scallons's estate upon a breach of the express warranty contained in the agreement. The Superior Court and the Court of Appeal dismissed our action on the ground that the warranty did not extend to these licenses; in other words, that the warranty, only meant the .seller had the licenses and the buyers stood in his room and place with the Crown.\nI submit that view is erroneous. These licenses are issued under Con. Stat. Can. ch. 23 and under Order in Council August, 1851, licentiates were entitled to renewal perpetually, and the Courts of Quebec have so held. Watson v. Perkins ([1]).\nUnder the code, art. 1592, they are bound to deliver us what is sold to us, and having found Hall in possession they were bound to put us in possession ; the burden is upon them to show that Hall had no right to be there. We say also that, under the departmental regulations, it is provided, if any conflict between adjoining owners .arises, it shall be determined in the office, and we say the Commissioner having given his decision against us, that was practically an eviction and there was no need on our part to produce Halls licenses. The bargain was, that they were to give us licenses which would have been renewed from year to year, and we complain that they had no such licenses to give us. We have given legal evidence that we could not get possession as Mr. Hall had been lumbering for ten years on this land. Harper v Charles-worth ([2]).\nAs to the obligation of the seller I will cite arts. 1491, 1492, and 1493, 1500, 1505. See also Troplong Vente ([3]).\nNow as to the warranty-The respondents, by notarial deed, acknowledge their obligation in the most formal manner to make up the deficit of these fifty miles, and they convey to plaintiff, with express warranty against all hindrances whatsoever, not the licenses simply, but the specific quantity of 50 miles of limits indicated in the licenses set forth in the deed. It cannot have been meant to weaken or impair the warranty in the prior part of this deed.\nThe danger .of prior title was one it was quite competent for Scallon's representatives to warrant against, which was legally and appropriately done by just such a warranty clause as was used. Every grant from the Crown whether of timber limits or of the soil itself, is made subject to the conditions stated in the deed or the statute authorizing it, that in cases of a prior grant, and in other instances also, the grant shall be void ; but it could not surely be pretended that the holder of such a title or a person holding a quit claim deed could not be held to the consequences of a sale with warranty, because for the purpose of indicating the property sold, the original title was recited in the deed of sale, especially as in the case in question in this cause, the sale was avowedly made to effectually replace a like quantity which the purchaser had the most undoubted right to have from the vendors, and the warranty stipulated has no meaning unless attaining that object or its legal equivalent.\nIf the appellant is right, as he believes, in claiming that warranty against non-delivery exists in his favor, this, it seems, is decisive of the case, for the other points mentioned in the judgment and invoked by respondents have no force to prevent reversal of the judgment appealed from.\nIt is clear that the five hundred dollars cash paid by respondents at the execution of the deed of 22nd October, was in no way meant to stand alone as a sufficient consideration for the deed, if the fifty miles of limits failed, and that the right of appellant to indemnity for failure to convey these fifty miles is unaffected by the payment of said sum, which appears to have been paid as the difference in value between limits .Nos. 97 and 98 and Nos. 25 and 26 If it be a fact that the possibility of not getting the limits was foreseen at the execution of the deed of the 22nd October, this is all the more reason why it is D covered by the warranty, especially when this was the only thing to which the warranty could apply. See articles 1506, 1507, 1508, 1524, 1511, 1512, 1514, 1515, 1516, 1487, C. C.\nThen that there was good cause and consideration for the stipulation fully appears in the deed itself.\nThese licenses were represented to the buyer as having been all renewed. Now, it appears that Scallon instead of renewing all the licenses, put the money in his pocket and therefore we find his succession recognizing that he was obliged to make them good.\nIt is in evidence that when the plaintiff wished to take possession of these limits he found there another person (Hall) who had been in possession of them for a period long prior to the deed of 22nd October 1866. Was he therefore obliged to take recourse by petitory action against Hall, or had he not the right to take a direct action against the respondents? It seems to us that this last course was open to him, for he had never had delivery of the limits from defendants according to terms of art. 1493 of the Civil Code. Several witnesses were examined and all agreed in saying that the greater part of the land comprised in these licenses was covered by prior licenses granted to Hall If counsel permits evidence to be gone into, it is too late afterwards to object, and I submit that point was waived.\nThen the decision given by the Commissioner of Crown Lands is binding. See Kennedy v. Lawlor ([4]), and in this court Farmer v. Livingstone ([5])\nIndependently of that, we contend the proof of Hall's right of preference to the limits in question is legally proved by the official documents and plans of the Crown Lands Department.\nThen it is argued also on the other side that there is. no proof of Mc Conville's agency with power to give this warranty, but they themselves-rely on this deed, and it is too late now for them to raise that point here McConville was a witness for the defence and there was no dispute as to his power to enter into the deed.\n\u00c1.S to damages I refer to art. 1511\nMr. Trenholme followed on behalf of the appellant: The case of Watson v. Perkins ([6]) clearly establishes that the right and title in timber limits is a real right and that the same rules apply in cases of sale of timber limits as of immoveable property. Now, this being admitted, can it be said that a man who goes into the market and pays $50,000 for limits, and it turns out there are no limits is not even entitled at least to a return of the price paid? This brings me to discuss the judgment appealed from. There is, I respectfully submit, manifest error in saying respondents were under no obligation to make good the 50 miles conveyed to us. That point was not dealt with in the Superior Court. The deed of 1866 admits there was an obligation to make good these 50 miles, and then they superadded a warranty. Did they plead they were never obliged to this? I could stop and say if there was mistake, it was for respondents to plead it and prove it.\nI will now say that they were bound to give us the deed of 1866. By the promise of sale in 1858 they sold their right and title ; if these words are used it is because they are descriptive of the species of ownership which they had, and does not mean there is any defect in the title, and when the property is specified, the seller is responsible in damages, for when a party sells, he warrants by law that he is the owner of the thing sold, and express warranty covers all defects. See Duranton ([7]) Laurent ([8]).\nMr. Pagnuelo, Q. C., and Mr. McConville, for respondents :\nIf it were true that the warranty clause was inserted not by mistake but deliberately if it were true that Hall had prior licenses and that Scalloni had been guilty of pocketing $800 ; that plaintiff never had possession, and that all the parties interested had agreed to submit the difficulty to the commissioner, and he had decided against us, we admit we would be bound and this appeal would have to be allowed. But we deny all these propositions, and we contend that the documents produced show that these assertions are without foundation The point for decision in this case is whether we have fulfilled our original agreement by which we sold simply our rights to these limits. Now, in 1865, when it became necessary to fulfil the agreement entered into between Scallon and Peck instead of following the original agreement of 1858, by which we sold simply our rights to cut timber on 256 miles of timber limits, the notary at the beginning of the deed inserted a general warranty clause which is to be found in all printed forms of notarial deeds of sale It was evidently a lapsus calami the intention of the parties clearly to fulfil the promise made in 1858, and nothing more. Peck had bought Scallon's licenses such as they were at his own peril l all licenses were issued with such reservations under a statute and under regulations published in the official Gazette of August 16th 1851. Peck therefore made the risk his own by bargaining for \" all the right and title obtained from the crown to certain timber limits and also the right of using and cutting timber on said limits is now given to the full extent which, the said Edward Scallon possesses from the crown,\" and no more. Under such circumstances, and for either of these two reasons, to wit, the knowledge of the. danger of eviction and the fact that he bought at his own risk, Peck could not claim back any portion of the price paid for such limits already granted to other parties or covered by former licenses in that wild, unsurveyed and unexplored part of the country, unless there be a positive and clear clause of warranty (1510, 1512, 1523, C. C.); and even then he could not claim any damage at all.\nThe undertaking by Edward Scallon, to give a good and sufficient deed to Peck on the payment of the price stipulated, had reference only to the mill, and went no further. There is an express stipulation to that effect.\nThere was no occasion to grant a deed for the timber limits, as the licenses were yearly renewed, and in 1855 were renewed in the name of the plaintiff and were together with his possession, the only deeds that could be grated to him and that he required. Scallon transferred to Peck the right he had to the renewal of the licenses and Peck was to possess all the rights under such licenses that Scallon would have had. The licenses for the then current year were sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to a renewal in his own name ; and it is not denied but admitted that he availed himself of this right.\nHowever, on discovering that licenses for Nos. 97 and 9S were missing, the appellants, by deed of 22nd October 1865 substituted for them Nos. 25 and 26. Now, this deed shows that it was made for the purpose also of giving effect and fulfilling the bargain of 1858 in So far as the timber licenses were concerned. It is staled that under and by the terms of this bargain, Mr. Scallon had agreed to sell to Mr. Peck 256 miles of timber limits; this declaration can have no further extension than the writing of 1858 will warrant; it simply means therefore that I Mr Scallon had. sold and. transferred over to Mr. Peck such rights in timber limits intended, to cover an extent of 256 miles as he himself held under licenses from the Crown and no more.\nAs to our pocketing $800, it is not stated or proved that we received the amount hut simply that all dues of the Crown were paid. It was stipulated that Gushing should pay ground rent, but there is no evidence that Gushing ever paid for these two licenses. The plaintiff held at that time licenses from the crown, and was perfectly well aware that they could not avail as against a former grantee ; and further, the licenses themselves contained that reservation.\nUnder such circumstances, he accepted licenses Nos. 25 and 26 at his own risk and no guarantee of any nature existed on the part of the defendant\u2019s art. 1020, 1523, C. C. Pothier ([9]) ; Troplong ([10]).\nA timber limit is something in its nature more aleatory than a venal office, on account of the uncertainty of its value, and even of its existence, against which the statute and the license itself forewarned the grantee\nThe statute (R. S. C. ch. 23) enacts that if, by reason of inaccuracies in the surveys, or for any other cause, a license should include lands already granted the license last in date is of no effect, and no claim shall lie against the crown.\nWhat the defendants meant to guarantee was not the existence of the limits but that of the license all they transferred was the license and the rights that might accrue under it.\nIf it were intended that the guarantee should go further, it should have been expressly declared and warranted that the license was the one first issued that the limits did exist, and that the plaintiff would have the peaceful enjoyment of them. In the absence of such a special guarantee, all the plaintiff can claim is that he shall enjoy the benefit of the licenses just as the defendants would have done\nWe see an example of such a guarantee in 2 Boniface, p. 119, where the seller of a venal office stipulated a guarantee against the suppression of the charge, and was held liable in damages on account of new offices being created.\nAlso in art, 1577 C. C, which provides that when a debt or other incorporeal right is sold, and the seller, by a simple clause of warranty, obliges himself for the solvency of the debtor, the warranty applies only to his solvency at the time of the sale if there is no clause of warranty, he is only responsible for the existence of the debt.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the evidence and contended that the plaintiff had not proved that Hall held licenses covering the territory included in limits Nos. 25 and 26.\nLet us now examine the plaintiff's other propositions necessary to establish his demand, that the Crown Land Commissioner was the proper authority to decide upon a question of timber limits or berths.\nUnder the rules and regulations adopted on 8th August, 1851, \"in cases of contestation as to the right to berths Or the position of bounds the opinion of the surveyor of licenses at Bytown, or agent for granting licenses elsewhere, is to be binding on the parties unless and until reversed by arbitration within three months after notification of such opinion has been communicated to the parties or their representatives on the premises, or sent to their address, or by decision of court.\" The licenses for Nos. 25 and. 26 were issued under these regulations, which were revoked and replaced by new regulations only on 13th June, 1866, as appears from official Gazette of 23rd June, 1861 not fyled in this cause.\nBy these new regulations, disputes as to berths were to be settled by \"the decision of the crown timber agent of the locality, or the inspector of crown timber agencies, or other officer authorized by the commissioner of crown lands.\" Never was the commissioner or his assistant invested with this supreme authority of deciding upon disputes between grantees of timber limits ; practical men are always chosen. But we have only to look at the regulations of 1851 under which both the licenses of Mr. Hall and licenses Nos. 25 and 26 to estate Scallon were issued, and the only persons invested with that right are the surveyor of licenses at Bytown, or agent for granting licenses elsewhere\nPlaintiff was asked under oath to produce a copy of any claim in writing made by him with the commissioner; he answered that he could not find any Copy.\nThe defendants then applied to the crown lands department for a copy of any claim filed by the plaintiff and the result is the production of a memorandum dated 13th November, 1869, made and signed by plaintiff on behalf of Theophilus Cushing, the then proprietor pro forma of the limits.\nAll he claims then by that memorandum is to be maintained in the possession of Nos. 94, (29), and 96, (30) to the exclusion of Mr. Hall who advanced pretensions even against a portion of them.\nThis very important fact shows conclusively that the plaintiff did not lose his right to limits Nos. 25 and 26 (of 1866) through a decision of the crown lands commissioner rendered in 1874 as the question was not submitted to him, and plaintiff had virtually given them up in 1869 and even in the fall of 1868, when he gave way \"without resistance before Mr. Halls men and. agents then in 1869 by this document, and next year by ceasing to renew the licenses.\nArt. 1521 -C. C. rules the present case.\nFinally, supposing it to be true that the whole of Nos. 25 and 26 are covered by licenses issued in 1853 in favor of Mr. Hall, the plaintiff is precluded from claiming a cent from defendants on that ground because he accepted them, together with $500, in full settlement of all claims whatever against the defendants ; he accepted these licenses 25 and 26 issued in 1866 such as they were, as he had accepted No. 97 and 98 in 1858, such as they were at that time, whether they were prior or posterior to Mr. Hall's.\nThe present claim is but an attempt to take an advantage of an evident lapsus calami in order to have all the benefits of and be relieved of all the risks assumed in a bona fide contract, fairly executed by respondents. As to bad habits of notaries introducing clauses of style, Troplong de la Prescription ([11]) i Laurent de Villargue Repertorie ([12]).\nMr. Trenholme, in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J:\u2014-\nIt is quite clear that the release contained in the deed of the 22nd of October 1866 does not extend to or in any way affect the warranty contained in that deed in relation to the fifty miles of limits thereby conveyed to the plaintiff ; therefore the peremptory exception of defendants must fail, the replication of the plaintiff being a good and sufficient answer.\nThere is nothing whatever in the evidence or circumstances surrounding this transaction to justify our going behind the deed of 22nd October, 1866. My brother Fournier has made this so manifest in the judgment he is about to deliver, which he has kindly permitted me to peruse, and in which I entirely agree, that it would be waste of time for me to discuss the question at greater length. Agreeing then, as I do, with the learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench that:\nIt is plain that the appellant, having by the deed of the 22nd day of October, 1866, discharged the respondent from all claims what-so ever arising out of the previous deed of the 16th March, 1865, cannot now refer to the original sale and promise of sale to sustain his present action. Whatever rights he might have had under the original deed, have been finally adjusted by the transaction of the 22nd of October, 1866\non the same principle I am at a loss to conceive how it can be invoked by the respondents to defeat any rights the appellant may have acquired by the deed of the 22nd October, 1866, or to control or in any way prevent that deed from having its full effect in accordance with the terms and provisions therein contained by which the rights of both parties must, in my opinion, be governed. I It is, therefore, \" as the ' the learned Chief Justice says, \"under this last deed alone that the appellant can have any claim against the respondents, and any reference to other deeds, and to the obligations of the respondents under those deeds is only calculated to create confusion, as such reference can have no effect whatsoever on the determination of this case. \"\nBy the deed of 22nd October, 1866, compensation is made to Cushing, assignee of Peck, for the deficit of fifty miles of the 250 miles of limits Scallon had, by deed of 6th March, 1865, agreed to sell to plaintiff in these words :\nEt en vertu, de ce titre feu M.

This is in truth the main and substantial question in the case, and was so treated by the respondent in his factum.\nI think there was a clear case of misinterpretation of the contract. It seems to me the guarantee is not limited in any such way, and so to read it would make it meaningless; the clause in the license is for the protection of the Crown, the guarantee in the deed is for the protection of the assignee and to prevent his being subjected to the trouble and loss which would result from the limits having been already granted, and therefore subject to be renewed to other parties in virtue of regulations.\nIf this was not the intent and object for which the guarantee was given, it simply meant nothing and if licenses, valueless by reason of the ground being already licensed to other parties could be held as within the contemplation of the parties how could the deficit be made good, and the object of the parties and of the giving of the deed be accomplished, viz.:\u2014\" Pour completer la dite quantit\u00e9 de deux cent cinquante six milles ? \"\nIt is very clear to my mind that the original quantity having fallen short and the parties representing Scallon being liable and ready to make up the deficiency, as by the giving of the deed of the 22nd October it is clearly admitted they were bound to do, did it by transferring these limits with a. warranty that they were good, valid and subsisting? licenses and if they were not they would guarantee the holders of the licenses against all troubles whatsoever that might thereafter arise, by reason of the insufficiency to convey the right thereby purported to be conveyed. \"Without this guarantee if the licenses should prove ineffective the deficiency would not be made up as intended ; with the guarantee, in such an event, the guarantee would furnish an \u00e9quivalent and so the evident intention of all parties that the deficiency should be made up, successfully carried out; therefore, while the respondents did not and could not convey to the appellant an indefeasible title to these timber limits, they undertook to convey such a title as the timber licenses granted by the Crown professed to give, and, in effect, guaranteed that if the licenses did not convey such a title they would indemnify the appellant against any loss which might arise to him by reason of the insufficiency of the licenses ; in other words, by their guaranteeing, they assumed the licenses were, at the time of the transfer in force, entitling the appellant to all the rights and advantages accruing to a license under a valid subsisting license and with which no other person had any right to interfere, that is to say, that they did not when so assigned interfere with limits already granted or to be renewed in virtue of regulations and that they would guarantee the appellant against any trouble that might arise by reason of any such outstanding or prior right.\nThen again it is said, there is no cause or consideration for this guarantee but it seems to me the very best cause and consideration apearas on the face of the deed itself; the representatives of Scallon discover that they cannot make good the undertaking of Scallon, that he having greed to sell 250 miles they were fifty short, by reason of which Gushing representing Peck had a claim on them, to settle and dispose of which, it is agreed that they will give Gushing $500 for damages sustained, or difference in value of lots, and fifty miles of other limits in lieu of the deficiency, which they propose to do by transferring two other limits of fifty miles by a good and sufficient title.\nTo make good this deficiency, it is absolutely necessary that they should have right to those limits, that the licenses they claim the right to transfer should be valid and sufficient to convey the fifty miles, for if not valid and sufficient for that purpose and not conveyed by a good and sufficient title, matters would remain just as they were, the deficiency would not be made up, and without a guarantee of title, Gushing, while relinquishing his claim under the deed of 16th March 1865, would have no security that he was actually obtaining what they proposed to give in lieu of such claim, viz., fifty miles of limits.\nIn consideration of Gushing releasing the succession of the late Scallon generally from all claims up to the date of the deed, they agree to pay him $500 damages, and to cede to Gushing, with guarantee against all troubles whatever, the limits in question, by which operation the deficiency is secured to Gushing under the license if good and valid or under the guarantee should the lease prove valueless. A better cause or consideration for a guarantee I cannot very well conceive. As to force majeure, I cannot see there was anything of the kind in this case had. the licenses been issued and been good, valid and effectual at the time of transfer, and on the termination the Crown had refused to renew them, I can readily understand how, in such a case, respondents should be held to have fulfilled their undertaking\", and should be held harmless as to any loss the appellant might make by such refusal. I think it is abundantly clear from the evidence in the case, as well on the part of the defendant as on that of the plaintiffs, that the limits in question were held by Hall and in his possession at the time of the giving of this guarantee under a prior license, and so the license proposed to be transferred was of no effect and consequently there was a breach of the guarantee.\nAs to the damages, I think they should be estimated as follows\nThe whole purchase money or value of the mill etc. and all the limits having been $20,000, experts shall ascertain the value of the mill and the land and deducting the amount from the said $20000 the balance will be the price of all the limits sold viz., 250 square miles ; a fifth of this balance will be the price paid for the fifty square miles, from which deducting $500 already paid by respondents as being the difference in value between the fifty miles which were wanting and the substituted fifty miles the balance arrived at will be the amount to which plaintiff is entitled to on account of his purchase money, together with interest from 22nd October, 1866 ; and if the property at the time of eviction has increased in valu\u00e9 then plaintiff would be entitled to recover such increased value in addition to the price paid, of which the experts could be directed to enquire ; but the eviction being so soon after the 22nd October, 1866, there would be probably no increase in the value. And finally experts to ascertain also the amount expended by plaintiff in improvements, and this amount with interest from the date at which it was expended, being added to the above balance of purchase money and increased value, if any, shall be the total sum which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, with costs in the different courts.\nSTRONG, J, concurred in the judgment of Fournier, J.\nFOURNIER J. .\u2014\nLa premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 examiner et \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est de savoir exactement en quoi consiste le contrat intervene entre les auteurs des parties pour ha vente du moulin et des limites qui faisaient l'objet de la promesse de vente du 10 juillet 1858 entre Edward Scallon d'une part et Benjamin D- Peck de l'autre, ainsi que du contrat de vente en date du 16 mars 1865 fait en ex\u00e9cution de cette promesse de vente. Est-il vrai comme le pr\u00e9tendent les Intim\u00e9s que la vente n'est que du moulin et des quatre acres de terre avec un certain droit de passage, et qu'elle ne comprend aucunement les droits et titres obtenus de la Couronne par le ven-deur aux treize limites \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la promesse et dans l'acte de vente ? C'est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019aucune partie des $20,000, prix de vente, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e comme la consid\u00e9ration de la cession de ces limites, lesquelles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es sans consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 l'acheteur, comme le pr\u00e9tend le conseil des Intim\u00e9s,\u2014ou bien, cette vente n'est-elle pas au contraire, la vente de plusieurs choses ne formant qu'un tout,\u2014qu'une seule exploitation, comme l'\u00e9tait le moulin en question et les limites qui fournissaient le bois de commerce n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 son alimentation ?\nLa solution de cette question se trouve dans les termes de la promesse de vente et surtout dans l'acte de vente qui a d\u00e9finitivement fix\u00e9 les droits des parties. Pour appuyer leur pr\u00e9tention que les limites de bois ne font pas partie de la vente, et qu'aucune consid\u00e9ration n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour icelles par l'acheteur, les intim\u00e9s se fondent sur certaines expressions de la promesse de vente, qui, si elles \u00e9taient prises seules et sans \u00e9gard aux termes formels de l'acte de vente, pourraient rendre assez plausible leur pr\u00e9tention. En effet on y trouve le passage suivant au sujet des limites s\nThe right of using and cutting timber on said limit is now given to the fullest extent which the said Edward Scallon possesses from the Crown.\nEt cet autre concernant le moulin;\n\" Now, if upon the payment of the above sum as specified for payment of the said mill I, Edward Scallon, give a good sufficient title of the above named mill, then this obligation shall be null and void, otherwise remain in full force and virtue.\nC'est sur les mots \" now given \" dans la premi\u00e8re citation que les intim\u00e9s appuient leur proposition que les limites ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es sans consid\u00e9ration, et ils invoquent pour la confirmer les expressions qui se trouvent dans la seconde \" the above sums as specified for payment of the said mill\"\nCe n'est pas en prenant des expressions isol\u00e9es que l'on doit interpr\u00e9ter un acte ; lorsqu'il y a doute sur sa signification, c'est par l'examen de l'ensemble des conventions qu'il contient que l'on doit arriver \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la v\u00e9ritable intention des parties. En faisant application de ce principe \u00e0 la promesse de vente en question, on v d\u00e9couvre facilement la nature du contrat des parties.

Peck, or his assigns : A saw mill built of stone, situated on the L'Assomption river, in the second range of Township of Keldon, in the parish of St. Charles Borrom\u00e9e, in the said district of Joliette, with its saws, straps, gearing, water power, booms, chains, anchors.\nThe right of using the road leading from the Queen's highway to said mill\nFour acres of land bounded as follows in front by the Queen's highway, in rear by the brink of the hill, on the north side by the road leading from the Queen's highway to the mill, on the south side by the land owned by the seller with the right of passing over the land of the seller along the bank of the river from the mill to the boom.\nAll the right and title obtained by seller from the Crown to certain timber limits situated on the banks of L'Assomption river and its tributaries, the Black river and river Ducharme as here enumerated and numbered as follows\nNo. 94, twenty-five miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 96, twenty-five miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 97, twenty-five miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 98, twenty-five miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 27, twelve miles situated on the Black river.\nNo. 271\/2, twelve miles situated on the Black river.\nNo. 28, twelve miles situated on the Ducharme river.\nNo. 93, eighteen miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo 92, twenty-four miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 91, eighteen miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 90, twenty-four miles situated on the L'Assomption river.\nNo. 132, eighteen miles situated on the Black river.\nNo. 133, eighteen miles situated on the Black river, being in all an area of 256 miles.\nLa promesse de vente est donc d'un ensemble de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 compose de quatre lots diff\u00e9rents, L'expression de la consid\u00e9ration qui suit l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration des proprieties ne peut laisser aucun doute sur ce sujet ; \" This bargain is made for and in consideration of the \"sum of twenty thousand dollars, five thousand the s said seller acknowledged having received, &c, &c.\" Les mots \"this bargain \" ayant rapport \u00e0 toute la transaction font bien clairement voir que la consideration de $20,000 est pour toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9cuites et non pas pour une seule en particulier.\nLes mots \"now given \" au sujet des limites, venant apr\u00e8s l'expression de la consid\u00e9ration de $20,000, ne peuvent pas signifier \" donner \" dans le sens d'une donation gratuite, ils signifient dans cette phrase, donner pour la consid\u00e9ration ci-dessus exprim\u00e9e. Le mot \"donner\" doit avoir ici la signification qu'il a dans l'art. 1472 C.C. d\u00e9finissant la vente: \" Un contrat par lequel une personne donne une chose \u00e0 une autre moyennant un prix en argent que la derni\u00e8re s'oblige de payer il faut encore observer que les mots now given ne se rapportent qu'au droit d'entrer en possession des limites et de les exploiter imm\u00e9diatement sans \u00e9gard aux d\u00e9lais qui doivent s'\u00e9couler pour le paiement du prix de vente avant que l'acheteur puisse obtenir un titre d\u00e9finitif.\nIl en est de m\u00eame de l'expression \" The above sums as specified for payment of the said mill\" Le mot n'est seul employ\u00e9 que pour abr\u00e9ger, en \u00e9vitant de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que dans la premi\u00e8re partie Scallon s'obligeait de vendre et qui sont comprises dans l'expression de la consid\u00e9ration \" This bargain is made, etc., etc. \"\nSi cette interpr\u00e9tation n'\u00e9tait pas bien fond\u00e9e il n'y aurait pas que les limites qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es, il y aurait encore le droit de passage et les quatre acres de terre. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation serait manifestement contraire \u00e0 l'intention des parties.\nEn effet, pourquoi les limites auraient-t-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 donness ? Est-ce parce que ce genre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est sans valeur, ou bien encore, est-ce que les conventions en question font voir de la part de Scallon une intention de faire une lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 \u00e0 Peck ? Ni l\u2019une ni l'autre de ces suppositions ne sauraient \u00eatre accept\u00e9es pour un seul instant. Ind\u00e9pendamment de la preuve faite en cette cause, il est de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique que les limites ou licences pour exploiter le bois de commerce sur les terres de la couronne ont une grande valeur. Il s'en vend fr\u00e9quemment et pour des prix consid\u00e9rables, d\u00e9pass\u00e2t presque toujours la valeur des moulins qui servent \u00e0 leur exploitation. Dans une vente comme celle dont ii s'agit, l'objet principal d e la vente \u00e9tait sacs doute les limites-le moulin n'\u00e9tait qu'un accessoire assez facile \u00e0 remplacer, tandis que le moulin seul, sans limites, n'aurait eu \u00e0 pea pr\u00e9s aucune valeur. Si, apr\u00e8s un examen attentif des conditions de la promesse de vente, il pouvait rester encore un doute sur 1 intention des parties, les citations ci-aigres faites de l'acte de vente le feront bient\u00f4t dispara\u00eetre.\nComme on l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu par les termes de la promesse de vente, ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s le paiement entier du prix de vente que Scallon s'obligeait de donner \" a, good sufficient title\" C'est ce que ses repr\u00e9sentants ont fait en faveur de l'acqu\u00e9reur des droits de Peck par l'acte de vente du 16 mars 1865, consenti en ex\u00e9cution de la promesse de vente, dans le but de donner a good sufficient title que Scallon s'\u00e9tait engage de fournir.\nPour mieux faire ressortir le peu de valeur des arguments des intimes, concernant la vente des limites je serai oblige de citer d'assez longs extraits de l'acte de vente.\nApr\u00e8s renonciation des qualit\u00e9s des parties, et une d\u00e9claration de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la promesse de vente ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, l'acte de vente proc\u00e8de ainsi :\nLes dites partios do premi\u00e8re part es-dites (qualit\u00e9s d\u00e9clarent qu'en. 291\/2 ex\u00e9cution audit acte du dix juillet mil huit cent cinquante-huit, dont d\u00e9p\u00f4t est ci-dessus fait, elles c\u00e8dent, transportent et' abandonnent avec promesse do garantir chacun en droit soi, do tous troubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, au dit Monsieur Th\u00e9ophilus Hamilton Cushing, comme \u00e9tant aux droits et repr\u00e9sentant le dit sieur Benjamin D.

Th\u00e9ophile-lus Eu Cushing, ses hoirs et ayant cause, consentant qu'il en soit saisi et mis en possession par et ainsi qu'il appartiendra, constituant \u00e0 cette fin pour procureur le porteur des pr\u00e9sentes lui donnant pouvoir do ce faire j car ainsi, etc\nSi la promesse do vente du 10 juillet 1858 ne contient pas une clause de garantie aussi pr\u00e9cise quo celle de l'acte de vente ci-dessus cit\u00e9, c'est qu'elle ne constituait pas le titre d\u00e9finitif, mais elle contient cependant l'obligation formelle d'accorder cette garantie dans la promesse de donner a good sufficient title apr\u00e8s paiement entier du prix de vente. Peut-on dire que les h\u00e9ritiers Scallon auraient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e cette convention en offrant \u00e0 Cushing un titre sans garantie ou m\u00eame un titre dont la clause de garantie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 omise e Non car ii est de principe que le vendeur est tenu de garantir \u00e0 moins de stipulation contraire mais il y a plus dans le cas actuel la condition de fournir un titre bon et suffisant (a good and sufficient title) contient l'obligation de donner un titre avec garantie. Un titre sans garantie ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, un titre bon et suffisant. C'est ainsi crue les h\u00e9ritiers Scallon l'ont compris en ins\u00e9rant la clause de garantie ci-dessus, laquelle, au lieu d'\u00eatre un lapsus calami de la part du notaire, est \u00e9videmment en ex\u00e9cution de la promesse de donner un bon titre. La clause de garantie ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans cet acte est la clause ordinaire que l'on trouve dans toutes les ventes s\u00e9rieuses et importantes. Elle est d'un usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et personne, on peut dire, n'aurait l'id\u00e9e, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, d'acheter des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l\u2019imp\u00f4t tance de celle dont ii s agit sans cette stipulation de garantie. Les intim\u00e9s ne pouvant nier avec succ\u00e8s l'existence de cette clause, essaient d'en restreindre l'effet \u00e0 la vente du moulin, mais contrairement \u00e0 leurs pr\u00e9tentions, cette clause est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et s'applique \u00e0 toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vendues par Scallon. Elle ne contient pas de restriction\u2014elle couvre toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en propres termes par les expressions suivantes : \" Avec promesse \" de garantir chacun en droit soi, de tons troubl\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, au dit M. T. U. Cushing, etc., \"etc., les immeubles et droits que le dit feu Edward S Scallon avait promis et s'\u00e9tait oblige de Vend\u00e9e an dit \" sieur Benjamin D. Peck, desquels immeubles et droits \" la d\u00e9signation est ci-apr\u00e8s donn\u00e9e litt\u00e9ralement et ver \" balim et telle qu'elle se trouve en langue anglaise an \" dit acte du 10 juillet 1858, savoir, etc , etc.\" Cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la description contenue dans la promesse de vente, ind\u00e9pendamment de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des termes, fait bien voir que la garantie devait s'appliquer aux licenses on permis de coupe de bois, comme aux autres immeubles vendus, En examinant les termes de la promesse de vente j'ai dit que l'obligation de vendre embrassait comme un tout les diverses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s y d\u00e9crites. L'acte de vente rend \u00e9vidence cette interpr\u00e9tation, en ne r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que comme un tout. Apres leur description, ii est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la vente en est faite ainsi que le tout se trouvait et comportait et \u00e9tendait, etc., etc. Il en est de m\u00eame de la clause de saisine qui est en ces termes : \" Pour par le dit sieur acqu\u00e9reur partie de seconde part, jouir, user, faire et disposer du tout pr\u00e9sentement vendu en toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes.\" On retrouve encore la m\u00eame qualification dans la clause portant quittance du prix de $20,000, \" pour lequel le dit feu sieur Scallon s'\u00e9tait oblige de passer titres en bonne et due forme du tout pr\u00e9sentement vendu, etc., etc.\" S'il fallait ajouter encore \u00e0 cette d\u00e9monstration, on pourrait recourir \u00e0 l'acte du 22 octobre 1866, qui contient encore dans les termes les plus clairs et les plus positifs l'admission que la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec garantie de tous troubles des immeubles et droits que feu Edward Scallon s'\u00e9tait oblige de vendre. Il faut donc conclure de tout cela que la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question comme un tout et pour une seule consid\u00e9ration, $20,000. S'il existait r\u00e9ellement quelque diff\u00e9rence importante entre les conventions de la promesse et l'ex\u00e9cution de la vente n'est-ce pas le dernier acte qui dolt les r\u00e9gler. Le contrat entre les parties n'est devenu parfait et d\u00e9finitif que par ce dernier acte. C'est lui qui contient leurs v\u00e9ritables conventions ; s'il y a eu quelque d\u00e9rogation, ce que je n'admets pas, c'est du consentement des deux parties. S'il y avait eu erreur, on aurait sans doute attaqu\u00e9 l'acte pour ette cause. Cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait les conventions contenues dans l'acte de vente restent enti\u00e8res. L'obligation de livrer 266 milles de limites n'ayant pu recevoir son execution parce qu'il s'est trouv\u00e9 un deficit de 50 milles pour compl\u00e9ter la quantit\u00e9 convenue, l'acte en dernier lieu cite a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 entre les m\u00eames parties dans le but special de combler le deficit. Par cet acte les intim\u00e9s ont c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9, avec la garantie de tous troubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques au dit L. H. Gushing, la dite quantit\u00e9 de cinquante mulles de limites sur la dite rivi\u00e8re de L'Assomption et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme suit en langue anglaise, savoir :\nNo. 25. C Commencing at the upper end limit No. 94 on 25 square miles \" the south west side of L'Assomption river, \" granted to late Edward Scallon and extending five miles on said u river and five miles back from its banks, making a limit of twenty \" five square miles, not to interfere with limits granted or to be \" renewed in virtue of regulations.\"\nNo. 26 \"Commencing on the north east side of L'Assomp 25 square miles s u tion river, at the upper end of limit 96, granted \" to late Edward Scallon, and extending five miles up the river and \" five miles back from its banks, making a limit of twenty-five square \" miles not to interfere with licences granted or to be renewed in \"l virtue of regulations,\"\nLes licenses de ces limites pour les ann\u00e9es 1866-7 furent alors remises an dit Gushing, pour par lui le dit M. Gushing, .ses hoirs ayant cause et successeurs, jouir, faire et disposer du tout comme bon lui semblera, d'exploiter et couper du bois dans et sur les dites limites \u00e0 la charge de se conformer en tout aux r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements auxquels les dites limites peuvent \u00eatre assujetties envers le gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9 en cette province, comme aussi de lui payer tous les droits qui peuvent \u00eatre dus pour la coupe du bois sur les dites limites.\nLa preuve fait voir que le d\u00e9ficit qu'il s'agissait de combler par cet acte provenait de ce qu'une partie des limites en premier lieu c\u00e9d\u00e9es se trouvait alors sujette aux droits ant\u00e9rieurs de G. S. Hall comme premier concessionnaire. Malheureusement ii en a \u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00eame pour les limites c\u00e9d\u00e9es en second lieu.\nIl s'agit maintenant de d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9tendue de la garantie des intim\u00e9s en vertu du dernier acte. C'est avec connaissance parfaite de la cause qui avait amen\u00e9 le d\u00e9ficit, et dans le but \u00e9vident de se garder contre une semblable \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite la deuxi\u00e8me cession.\nLa garantie stipul\u00e9e devait donc dans l'esprit des parties, porter sur cette cause d'\u00e9viction. C'est sans doute pour cette raison que la clause qui la contient est si g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et si absolue.\nLes intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent cependant qu'elle ne l'est pas qu'au contraire, elle contient plusieurs restrictions la 1\u00e8re que les limites en second lieu c\u00e9d\u00e9es n'interviendront pas avec d'autres limites d\u00e9j\u00e0 c\u00e9d\u00e9es ou qui peuvent \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9es en vertu des r\u00e8glements ; la 2i\u0141me que cette cession est faite comme la 1\u00e8re \" \u00e0 la charge de se confirmer en tout aux r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements auxquels les dites limites peuvent \u00eatre assujetties.\"\nQuant \u00e0 la 1\u00e8re restriction, celle prot\u00e9geant la Couronne contre les cons\u00e9quences d'une concession ant\u00e9rieure, il est clair qu'elle ne se trouve pas dans la clause de garantie, c'est dans la description de la limite qu'elle est ins\u00e9r\u00e9e, et, en faveur de la Couronne seulement Les intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fait de cette r\u00e9serve de la Couronne une restriction \u00e0 leur garantie, elle ne se trouve mentionn\u00e9e que dans la description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9e et ne peut, cons\u00e9quemment, aucunement affecter leur convention de garantie qui a pour but pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de couvrir ce danger. Si, d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 on peut dire \u00e0 l'appelant que dans tous les cas, il \u00e9tait averti par les termes de la license de la cause probable d'\u00e9viction, de l'autre ii peut r\u00e9ponde que c'est contre cc danger pr\u00e9vu, et dont il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime, qu'il s'est pr\u00e9muni par la clause de garantie.\nPour \u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences de cette garantie, les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent encore assimiler l'effet de cette r\u00e9serve en faveur de la Couronne \u00e0 une \u00e9viction pour cause de force majeure on fait du prince. Cette pr\u00e9tention n'est aucunement fond\u00e9e, car en loi, on ne doit consid\u00e9rer le fait du prince comme un cas fortuit et une force majeure que lorsque personne ne peut le pr\u00e9voir ni l\u2019emp\u00eacher. Certes, ce n'est pas le cas actuel, car non-seulement le fait \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu, mais ii \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 accompli au moment de la cession,\nRien n'\u00e9tait plus facile pour les intim\u00e9s quede s'en assurer, puisque c'est par le fait de leur auteur Scallon que la priorit\u00e9 du titre qu'il avait sur Hall a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue Si on ne peut pas assimiler le cas actuel au fait du souverain les intim\u00e9s auraient encore bien moins raison de pr\u00e9tende que ce pr\u00e9tendu fait du souverain, pr\u00e9vu et m\u00eame accompli, ne pouvait pas en loi faire le sujet de la garantie. La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit le contraire, comme on peut s'en assurer en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au R\u00e9p. de Merlin. Vo. \" Fait du souverain.\" Si la garantie n'avait pas lieu dans le cas actuel il faudrait contrairement \u00e0 cette autorit\u00e9 conclure que l'on ne peut pas l\u00e9galement stipuler la garantie contre le fait du souverain. Ce qui serait une erreur \u00e9vidente.\nL'\u00e9viction dont Cushing a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9e par aucune infraction aux obligations que lui imposaient ces r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements auxquels il devait se soumettre. Elle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e que par la n\u00e9gligence de Scallon \u00e0 faire r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ses renouvellements de licences.\nCette n\u00e9gligence ayant eu pour cons\u00e9quence de permettre aux licences de Hall de prendre effet ii s'en est suivi devant l'assistant commissaire des terres et ses employ\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, et aux r\u00e8glements du d\u00e9partement, les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qui ont eu pour r\u00e9sultat l'\u00e9viction de Gushing.\nLes intim\u00e9s soutiennent qu'ils ne peuvent \u00eatre tenus responsables des cons\u00e9quences de cette \u00e9viction par\u00e9e que Gushing ne les a ni notifi\u00e9s ni mis en cause pour le d\u00e9fendre. S'il se fit agi d'une action devant les tribunaux au lieu de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s administratifs, les intim\u00e9s pourraient sans doute se plaindre de n'avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s en garantie dans les d\u00e9lais voulus. Mais il est clair que les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s du code de proc\u00e9dure ne pouvaient s'appliquer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de questions uniquement de la comp\u00e9tence du d\u00e9partement des terres. D'apr\u00e8s les lois et r\u00e8glements concernant ces sortes de contestations, le D\u00e9partement n'avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que sur les pretentions respectives de Hall et de Cushing. Ces lois et r\u00e8glements n'\u00e9tablissent aucun mode de faire intervenir ou mettre en cause dans ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d'autres parties pouvant y avoir des int\u00e9r\u00eats. En n'appelant pas les intim\u00e9s en garantie dans ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s, Gushing ne s'est donc rendu coupable d'aucune n\u00e9gligence qui puisse compromettre sa position.\nTout au plus, tombe-t-il sous l'effet de l'art. 1520. C. C. \" La garantie pour cause d'\u00e9viction cesse lorsque \" l'acheteur n'appelle pas en garantie son vendeur dans l les d\u00e9lass\u00e9 prescrits par le code de proc\u00e9dure civile, si \"celui-ci prouve qu'il existait des moyens suffisants \" pour faire rejeter la demande en \u00e9viction.\"\nLes intim\u00e9s n'ont pas fait cette d\u00e9fense pour la raison \u00e9vidence qu'il n'y avait aucun moyen d'emp\u00eacher l'\u00e9viction de Cushing, resultant de la n\u00e9gligence de ScalIon \u00e0 renouveler ses licences, et du fait qu'il avait vendu avec garantie des limites qui avaient cess\u00e9 de lui appartenir an temps m\u00eame de la vente.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me restriction consistant dans l'obligation de se conformer aux r\u00e8gles et r\u00e8glements du d\u00e9partement des terres ne porte que sun la mani\u00e8re d'exercer les droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s en vertu de la licence. II n'y a aucune plainte \u00e0 ce sujet contre Gushing, et c'est, comme on l'a vu plus haut, pour une autre cause que 1 eviction a eu lieu.\nLes motifs ci-dessus expos\u00e9s m'am\u00e8nent \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte de cession du 22 octobre 1866 contient une garantie expresse contre le danger dune seconde \u00e9viction pour cause de priorit\u00e9 de titre.\nEn outre de la question de garantie, il y en a plusieurs autres qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais sur lesquelles la Cour du Banc de la Reine n'a point exprim\u00e9 d'opinion. L'opinion de cette cour sur la question de garantie rendait inutile une d\u00e9cision sur les autres points. La majorit\u00e9 de cette cour adoptant une conclusion diff\u00e9rente, on doit s'assurer si, malgr\u00e9 son droit \u00e0 une garantie, l\u2019appelant n'a pas failli dans la preuve de faits essentiels an succ\u00e8s de sa cause.\nUn des consid\u00e9rants du jugement est que d'apr\u00e8s l'article 1204 du Code Civil du Bas-Canada, la preuve offerte doit \u00eatre la meilleure dont le cas, par sa nature, soit susceptible, et qu'une preuve secondaire ou inf\u00e9rieure ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 moins qu'au pr\u00e9alable il n'ap paraisse que la preuve originaire on la meilleure ne peut \u00eatre fournie, et que 1 article 14 du dit Code Civil frappe de nullit\u00e9 ce qui est fait en contravention d'une loi prohibitive.\nCes propositions de droit sont sans doute bien fond\u00e9es. Mais la preuve faite en cette cause donne-t-elle lien \u00e0 leur application ? Il e\u00fbt, sans doute, \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux de produire les licences de Hall que den faire la preuve par d'autres documents. Cette preuve consiste dans les exhibits No. 14 et D, produits \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate et dans les plans des lieux provenant du d\u00e9partement des terres. Cette preuve ne laisse aucun doute sur la priorit\u00e9 des licences de Hall. Est-il vrai de dire que ces documents ne font qu'une preuve secondaire ou inf\u00e9rieure ? Ce serait le cas, si par plusieurs textes de nos lois ils n\u00e9taient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s la meilleure preuve que l'on puisse faire, celle qui r\u00e9sulte de la production de documents, rev\u00eatus du caract\u00e8re de l'authenticit\u00e9. Un acto authentique pass\u00e9 levant notaire a-t-il plus de force probante qu'un autre acte auquel la loi accorde \u00e9galement l'authenticit\u00e9. Y a-t-il des degr\u00e9s dans la force probante des actes d\u00e9clar\u00e9s authentiques par le code civil ou par un statut ? Certainement non. Ils font tons pleine foi de leur contenu au m\u00eame degr\u00e9.\nLes exhibits cites \u00e9tablissant l'existence des limites de Hall sont de la cat\u00e9gorie de ceux que l'article 1207 CO., d\u00e9clare authentiques et faisant preuve de leur contenu. Un des paragraphes de cet article s'exprime ainsi : L Les archives, registr\u00e9s, journaux et documents \" publics des divers d\u00e9partements du gouvernement e ex\u00e9cutif et du parlement de cette province.\"\nLa 32e Vict., chap. 10, (stat. de Qu\u00e9bec, 1869) contient les dispositions suivantes sur le m\u00eame sujet, s.-s. 2, iles archives, registres, journaux et documents publics des divers d\u00e9partements du gouvernement ex\u00e9 \" cutifs de cette province ;\u2014s.-s. 3, les copies et extraits o officiels des livres et documents et \u00e9crits ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, les certificats et tous les autres \u00e9crits qui peuvent \u00eatre compris dans le sens legal de la pr\u00e9sente section quoique non enumeres.\" Ces autorit\u00e9s font voir que la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la preuve de l'existence des limites de Hall est \u00e9tabli par le Code Civil aussi bien que par les statuts. Cela doit certainement suffire,\nUn autre motif de ce jugement est que le demandeur (appelant) n'avait pas le droit de soumettre \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'amiable la verification des lignes de divisions des limites en question. Ce consid\u00e9rant ne me parait pas mieux fonde que le precedent. Cushing troubl\u00e9, comme il l'\u00e9tait par Hall, dans son exploitation qu'il fut. force d'abandonner, devait-il se croiser les bras s On me r\u00e9pondra peut-\u00eatre que non, mais on dira avec les intim\u00e9s qu'il ne s'est pas adress\u00e9 au tribunal qui avait juridiction dans une contestation de ce genre, savoir, celui de l'inspecteur des licences \u00e0 Bytown (Ottawa} en vertu des me estime articles des r\u00e8glements du d\u00e9partement des terres, en date du 8 ao\u00fbt 1851. Cette objection serait s\u00e9rieuse si la loi n'avait pas modifi\u00e9 ces r\u00e8glements en donnant au Commissaire et \u00e0 I' Assistant Commissaire des terres les \"pouvoirs les plus amples pour la d\u00e9cision de ces sortes de contestations. L'appelant avait le choix de deux tribunaux, celui de l'Inspecteur des licences ou celui du Commissaire ou de son assistant. Les deux lui \u00e9taient ouverts. Peut-on lui reprocher de s'\u00eatre adress\u00e9, comme ii l'a fait, l la plus haute autorit\u00e9. Il avait indubitablement, comm\u00e9 on le verra par la citation ci-apr\u00e8s, la facult\u00e9 de s'adresser au'd\u00e9partement des terres dont le Commissaire et son assistant avaient tons les \"pouvoirs n\u00e9cessaires pour adjuger sur cette contestation. La 36me Vict., ch. 8, sec. 1, s.s. 1, contient la disposition suivante sur le sujet.\nThere shall continue to be an assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands, who shall be appointed, from time to time as a vacancy occurs, by the Lieut.-Governor in council, and he shall have the superintendence of all the officers, clerks, messengers or servants, and the general control of all the affairs of the department ; his orders shall be executed in the same way as those of the Commissioner of Crown Lands himself, and his authority shall be deemed to be that of the head of the department, so that he can validly affix his signature, in this said quality, and thereby give force and authority to all acts, receipts, permits of occupations, contracts or deeds of sale or location.\nTickets, letters patent, adjudication revocations of sales or locations and all other documents whatsoever which are or may be within the juridiction of the Department.\nCette section ne laisse certainement aucun doute sur la comp\u00e9tence de l'assistant commissaire \u00e0 prononcer sa d\u00e9cision sur la r\u00e9clamation qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise par Gushing.\nDu fait que la dur\u00e9e des licences ne doit \u00eatre que du ler juin au 30 avril de chaque ann\u00e9e, et que l'ann\u00e9e 1866 s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9e sans que Gushing ait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 aucun trouble, l'Honorable juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee en a tire la conclusion que los d\u00e9fendeurs avaient satisfait \u00e0 leur obligation. Mais on ne peut en arriver l\u00e0 qu'en oubliant qa'au moment de la cession du. 22 octobre 1866 les repr\u00e9sentants de Scallon c\u00e9daient des droits qu'ils n'avaient plus. De plus, ils s'\u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s de c\u00e9der une licence contenant la condition de pouvoir \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9e en se conformant aux r\u00e8gles du d\u00e9partement des terres. Ces renouvellements sont \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 du concessionnaire, licenci\u00e2tes. Il est \u00e0. pen pr\u00e8s sans exemple qu'un concessionnaire qui n'a contrevenu \u00e0 aucune de ses obligations se soit vu refuser un renouvellement. Cette tenure, quoique en apparence tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9caire d\u00e9pend en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, pour sa dur\u00e9e, de la volont\u00e9 du concessionnaire. Il est de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique que les marchands de bois ont toujours conserv\u00e9 \u00e0 volont\u00e9 leurs limites en d\u00e9pit de cette pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 qui semble n'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e que comme un moyen puissant de forcer les concessionnaires d'\u00eatre exacts dans le paiement des droits de la couronne. En c\u00e9dant une licence qui ne pouvait pas \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9e pour la raison qu'elle appartenait \u00e0 Hall, les intim\u00e9s ne remplissaient donc pas leur obligation. Il eat vrai que c'est apr\u00e8s avoir pris lui-m\u00eame lea renouvellements des licences c\u00e9d\u00e9es que Gushing a \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9 par Hall, mais ce trouble n'a pu avoir lieu que parce que lea renouvellements se trouvaient sans effet, en cons\u00e9quence de la violation de l'obligation d\u00e9c\u00e9der des licenses \u00e0 des limites sur lesquelles personne n'aurait de priorit\u00e9 de titre. Si Gushing n'a Pu faire de renouvellements \u00e9lectifs c'est en cons\u00e9quence de l'insuffisance de son titre et c'est aux h\u00e9ritiers Scallon \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre des cons\u00e9quences en vertu de leur garantie.\nEnfin, l'honorable juge a admis un autre moyen invoqu\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s. C'est celui tire du d\u00e9faut de production des procurations autorisant McConville, \u00e0 agir comme procureur des parties qu'il repr\u00e9sentait aux divers actes cites dans la declaration et notamment celui du 22 octobre 1866. C'est seuls doute un moyen tr\u00e8s rigoureux\u2014si surtout l'on consid\u00e8re que ces m\u00eames actes sont invoqu\u00e9s par les Intim\u00e9s dans leur exception p\u00e9remptoire. Mais il est vrai qu'ils out en le soin d'accompagner cette exception d'une d\u00e9cence au fonds en fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2014ce qui aurait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 la production des diverses procurations si les intim\u00e9s eussent persist\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin dans leurs d\u00e9n\u00e9gations. Mais dans leurs r\u00e9pliques aux r\u00e9ponses du demandeur \u00e0 leur exception p\u00e9remptoire en droit perp\u00e9tuelle, les intim\u00e9s ayant invoqu\u00e9 eux-m\u00eames l'acte due octobre 1866, sans cette fois l'accompagner de la d\u00e9fense au fonds en fait, ils doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme s'\u00e9tant d\u00e9partis de leur injuste d\u00e9n\u00e9gation. Cette r\u00e9plique contient une admission de l'acte du 22 octobre 1866 qui rend inutile la production des procurations. En bonne proc\u00e9dure ii \u00e9tait du devoir des intim\u00e9s de renouveler leurs denegrations on de d\u00e9clarer qu'ils persistaient dans celles qu'ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 faites, \u2014par cette omission ils out r\u00e9par\u00e9 celle commise par le demandeur en ne produisant pas ces procurations. Aucune des objections queje viens de passer en revue ne formu\u00e2t d'obstacle s\u00e9rieux contre la demande de l'appelant, je suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'en cons\u00e9quence de l'\u00e9viction que cushing a soufferte il v a lieu \u00e0 des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 1518, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'appelant a droit de r\u00e9clamer des intim\u00e9s: le. La valeur des limites dont ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9e, proportionnellement au prix total de $20,000. 2o. Les sommes d\u00e9pens\u00e9es dans les ann\u00e9es 07-68 pour le nettoyage de la rivi\u00e8re afin d'y faire flotter le bois de commerce, aussi celles employ\u00e9es \u00e0 la construction de chemins et de maisons et \u00e9curies n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des dites limites. Il aurait aussi droit \u00e0 l'accroissement de valeur que pouvaient avoir les dites limites en 1868, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle Cushing en a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9 de fait\nPour arriver \u00e0 la determination exacte du montant des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats il manque dans la preuve un element indispensable, c est la valeur des limites en question proportionnellement au prix total de vente qui \u00e9tait de $20,000. C'est cette proportion du prix de vente qui devait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant, l'augmentation de valeur plus les sommes ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es d\u00e9pens\u00e9es en travaux d'am\u00e9liorations. Pour \u00e9tablir cette proportion j\u00e9sus d'avis que la cause devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la cour inf\u00e9rieure, etc., etc., pour verr\u00e9 proc\u00e9d\u00e9 par experts, etc., etc., pour constater cette proportion.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nI have not prepared a written judgment in this case, as my brother Gwynne favored me with the reading of a lengthy one prepared by him some time ago, and which embraces my views on the several points to which it refers. I may add, however, that admitting the respondents are liable under the covenant, the appellant is not entitled to recover for several reasons:\n1st. He has shown no eviction. The purchaser went into full possession of all the lands and premises he purchased, made roads through the \" limits \" and cut a number of logs which he voluntarily abandoned to a party who claimed the laud on which they had been cut without as I can see, any reason whatever. He therefore, by his own act, gave up possession and the right to the limits now in dispute.\n2nd It is admitted that the limits sold and covenanted for covered the lands originallyy and the evidence to my mind shows that if the right to the limits was subsequently lost or interfered with it was a loss for which the purchaser was liable, and not the covenantor. 3rd. No title was shown to the locus by Hall who claimed under the adverse licenses. They were not produced on the trial, nor their contents shown, nor was any survey of them shown. It was not, therefore, shown that they touched or included any part of the locus. It is on the other hand shown by the evidence, that even had they been put in evidence the rights under them would have been restricted to the one side of the height of ground between two rivers, while the locus was on the other I think the decision of the assistant commissioner of crown lands not having been made under the proceedings provided by the statute\u2014is not binding on the respondents who got no notice of the proceedings before him, and were no parties to them.\nI concur, then, in the judgment to which I before referred and think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nWith great deference to my learned brothers, with whom I am unable to agree I must say that in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Montreal, in appeal as well as in that rendered by the learned judge of the Superior Court of the district of Joliette, before whom the case was originally tried, I entirely concur. If I am in error in the view which I take it is at least a satisfaction to me to be in such good company. By the deed of the 10th July, 1858, after reciting therein an agreement made by Edward Scallon to sell to Benjamin D. Peck, or his assigns, a saw mill built of stone, and four acres of land annexed thereto together with all the straps, gearing, water-power, booms, chains and anchors to the mill belonging and the right of using a road leading from the Queen's highway to the mill ; and all the right and title obtained by Scallon from the crown to certain timber limits situate on the banks of the River l'Assomption and its tributaries, the Black River and the River Ducharme particularly enumerated by numbers, among which were Nos. 97 and 98 (stated as covering each 25 miles on the river l'Assomption), and being in all 13 and stated as covering an area of 256 miles at and for the price or sum of $20,000, of which $5,600 was acknowledged by the deed to have been then paid, and the balance was made payable in five annual instalments of $3,000 each, with interest, Scallon bound himself in the penal sum of $30.000, with a condition thereunder written, that if, upon payment of the above sums as specified for payment of the said mill, he said Edward Scallon should give a good and sufficient deed of the above mill, then the said bond or obligation should be null and void. The deed also contained the following clause : \" The right of using and cutting timber on said limits is now given to the full extent which the said Edward Scallon possesses from the crown.\" As to these licenses it was also by the deed agreed that they should be renewed in the name of Scallon, and that the cost and expenses of such renewals should be paid by Peck as well as the moneys which should accrue to the crown for the limits and for timber duty to be cut on the limits, and that Peck should conform to the regulations of the Crown Land Department, and that after the last instalment of the $20000 should be paid, the licenses might be taken out in the name of the purchaser.\nNow by this deed it appears that all the title Scallon agreed to give for the timber limits mentioned therein, including those numbered 97 and 98, was such title\" as he had and no more : and that title he did give ; all his title to those limits passed by the deed. The vendee, however, by the deed agreed that the renewals to be taken out for them, which were to be taken annually, should be taken out and paid for by the vendee in Scallon's name until the last instalment of the $20,030 should be paid, when the vendee might procure their issue in his own name. These numbers 97 and 98, it may be here remarked, covered the following limits : namely, 97, ten miles in length up the river lAssomption, measuring from the upper boundary line of No. 94, and on the left bank as you ascend the river and extending to a line back 21\/2 miles from and parallel with the river ; and 98, the like length up the river, measuring from the upper boundary line of No. 96 which is a continuation of the upper boundary line of limit No. 94, and extending 21\/2 miles from the river on its right bank as you ascend it. For the protection of his own rights, the onus lay upon the vendee to see to the renewal of those licenses which he undertook to do in Scallon's name whose only interest was to see that they should be renewed by the vendee in his (Scallon's) name, as security to the latter until his last instalment of the $20,000 should be paid. The agreement itself vested in Peck all Scallon s title to those timber limits which was all in relation to them that he had sold or agreed to sell.\n\"Why Peck and his assigns did not, if they did not, enjoy the benefit of those limits numbered 97 and 98 or why renewals of them were not issued from year to year, does not clearly appear. The onus of taking what proceedings might be necessary to procure the renewals, lay upon Peck and his assignees.\nIt was alleged by the plaintiffs, but I see no proof of the allegation, that Peck and his assigns paid yearly the moneys payable for their renewal to Scallon who neglected to renew Nos. 97 and 98, and appropriated to his own use the moneys paid to him to be applied for their renewal amounting to $800.\nThe only evidence which the plaintiffs offered in support of this allegation, is a passage referred to by them in a deed dated the 16th March, 1865, executed by the plaintiffs and the heirs of Scallon, who was then dead, which does not support the allegation. The deed at the place referred to declares that the whole 220 000 had been paid and further that the cost of the renewal of the timber licenses transferred to Peck by the deed of 1858 had been paid by Peck and his assigns, and that those licenses had been renewed each year in the name of Scallon as had been undertaken by Peck.\nThis passage is obviously no proof of the allegation that Peck or his assigns had paid the moneys for renewal of the licenses to Scallon ; the passage simply amounts to a declaration or admission by the parties to that deed that Peck and his assigns had at their own cost and charges renewed the licenses in Scallon's name as in the terms of the deed of 1858, it was their duty to do.\nThe plaintiffs also offered evidence which was objected to as not the best evidence procurable upon the point\u2014that by the books of the department in the possession of a witness named Bell but which books were not produced, it appeared that for the year 1858, or any subsequent year, no renewal had been obtained for Nos. 97 or 98. This evidence was objected to upon the ground that if this appeared by books in the department, these books should have been produced to enable the parties sought to be affected by such entry to see if it in truth, were so, and if so to examine the parties making the entries as to their correctness, and in explanation of the cause of the non-renewal but assuming the fact to be as suggested, that at the time of the execution of the deed of 1858 Scallon had not renewed his licenses for the limits 97 and 98 for that year, it appears by the regulations of the department put in evidence that he had still the right to do so and that he transferred such right to Peck who could have procured the renewal of the licenses for those limits to be issued in right of Scallon for 1858 and each subsequent year, if non-payment of the license fees was all that stood in the way of their being issued for it is not alleged or pretended that in consequence of Scallon's omission to renew in 1858, his right to renew was lost by reason of a subsequent grant of the same limits by the Crown Laud Department to any other person. So that the fact of Scallon not having renewed his licenses for limits 97 and 98 in 1858 if true would not have afforded any reason for the non-renewal of these Nos. 97 and 98 by Peck in virtue of the provisions of the deed of 1858 in the subsequent years. The true reason for the non-renewal of the licenses for those numbers is to be found, I apprehend, in the fact which appeared in evidence that by reason of an error in the measurement of the limits lying lower down the river than Nos 94 and 96, the upper boundary lines of those latter limits were placed higher up the river than they ought to be, and that in truth there was no such distance as ten miles higher up the river l'Assomption to represent the whole extent in length of the limits 97 and 98 and if that was the reason then the defect was not one which would give any claim whatever under the deed of 1858 against the heirs of Scallon, or against Scallon himself, who by that deed only agreed to give just such title as he had to those limits and no more. Now that this was the reason for Nos. 97 and 98 not being renewed I think, appears by the fact which does plainly appear in the evidence, that in 1866 the Crown Land Department issued licenses Nos. 25 and 26 the former in substitution for 97 and the latter for 98 and that these licenses, Nos. 25 and 26 respectively, comprise limits extending only five miles up the river instead of 10 from the upper limits of 94 and 96 and five miles in width from the river instead of 21\/2 miles, covering the same quantity of land as did 97 and 98 respectively, although differently shaped and covering one-half of the precise land comprised in 97 and 98 respectively. These licenses Nos. 25 and 26 were issued from the same office of the Crown Land Department as 97 and 98 had been issued from and the limits therein described were granted to and in the name of \" the heirs of the late Edward Scallon ;\" from this form of expression the natural and reasonable presumption is that the licenses were granted to Scallon's heirs in right of Scallon who had been the licensee of 97 and 98 which covered respectively half of the identical limits described in 25 and 26. There can I think be no doubt that the limits described in 25 and 26 were granted as they were \" to the heirs of the late Edward Scallon \" in substitution for Nos. 97 and 98 for the reason that there was found not to be ten miles up the river from Nos. 94 and 96 to meet the requirements of 97 and 98. We see here a good reason, and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary I think we may take it to have been the real one for the substitution and for the licenses for 97 and 98 not having been renewed. Now, immediately prior to the execution of the deed of the 22nd October 1866 which is relied upon as containing what is insisted upon as the guarantee for the alleged breach of which this action is brought the condition of the parties was this : Scallon by the deed of 1858 had already transferred to Peck all his right title and interest in the timber licenses enumerated therein, including Nos. 97 and 98. By the deed of 1865 the Scallon succession had conveyed the mill and the four acres of land thereunto annexed with the roadway mentioned in that deed in fulfilment of the condition of the obligation in that behalf, contained in the deed of 1858, upon the part of Scallon, his heirs and assigns, to be fulfilled ; all therefore that remained for the heirs of Scallon to do was as the parties named under the designation of \" the heirs of the late Edward Scallon\" as 1icersees of the limits described in the licenses 25 and 26 to transfer them to the assignee of Peck, who was entitled to receive them as a fruit growing out of the right which Scallon had had by reason of his having been the licensee named in 97 and 98, all which right he had transferred to Peck by the deed of 1858. In so far as Scallon's heirs were concerned, they were under no obligation to do anything more ; and, although it appears that a sum of $500 was allowed by them to the plaintiff, for the reason that the haul to the river was greater in the limits Nos. 25 and 26, by reason of their greater depth from the river than had been that of the limits described in 97 and 98 it does not seem to me that the Scallon succession was under any obligation to make such or any allowance ; for that Scallon had a right, title and interest in the limits described in the licenses Nos. 97 and 98 at the time of the execution of the deed of 1858, and that by that deed he did transfer to Peck all such right, title and interest, and that this was all he agreed to do, appears to me to be clear. All right to renew those licenses thenceforth belonged to Peck and his assigns, and if the Crown Land Department had, for any reason other than prier forfeiture by Scallon and a subsequent grant of the same limits to some other person, of which there is no evidence or pretence whatever, refused to renew such licenses the loss consequent upon such refusal must have fallen upon Peck who had acquired, as all that he was entitled to, all Scallon's rights whatever they were on the 10th July, 1858 ; and when, therefore Nos. 25 and 26 were issued to and in the name of the heirs of Scallon in recognition as we must take them to have been of Scallon's rights in 97 and 98, and in substitution for those latter, they enured in the hands of Scallow's heirs to the benefit of the assignee of Peck as \u00e0 fruit issuing from the rights of Scallon which had been transferred to Peck and his assigns by the deed of 1858. The heirs of Scallon were, in fact, trustees of those limits for the plaintiff, the assignee of Peck, who could have compelled their transfer to him. It would. have been impossible for them to have resisted the right of the plaintiff, as assignee of Peck under the deed of 1858 to have had those licenses Nos 25 and 26 which covered one-half of the precise limits described in 97 and 98 respectively, and which were given the additional width to make up for the diminished length, transferred by a legal instrument to the plaintiff. In such a state of things it is obvious that in any deed to be executed by the heirs of Scallon, transferring those licenses to the plaintiff, any covenant or guarantee by them as to the goodness of the title purported to be given by those licenses, or the insertion of anything directly or indirectly imposing upon the heirs of Scallon any greater liability than was by the deed of 1858 imposed upon them, would be altogether out of place, improper and without any cause, motive or consideration therefor ; and the evidence does not supply anything which is suggestive even of any cause, motive or consideration for their incurring such obligation. In this condition of things the deed of the 22nd October, 1866, was exe cuted. Now apart from, and laying aside, all question as to whether it was, or not, necessary for the plaintiffs to have offered evidence of the right of McConville to represent and bind the parties which in that deed La is said to represent, that deed declares that :\nThe said Sieur McConville, for and in the name of those for whom he acts, declares that the said parties whose attorney he is, have, m execution of the said deed under private signature of dale of the 10th July. 1858, and each for himself, ceded with warranty against all disturbances generally whatsoever to the said Mr. Theophilus H. Cushing, as exercising the rights of the said Mr. Pech, the immovable property and the rights which the said late Edward Scallon had promised and obliged himself to sell to the latter by and in virtue of the said deed of deposit, cession and transfer of date of 16th March, 1865, of which immovables and rights the designation and description is given literally and verbatim in the said deed of cession, as also it is found in the said deed of the 10th July. 1858.\nAnd in virtue of this title, the late Mr. Scallon obliged himself to sell 256 miles of limits for cutting timber upon the crown lands situated on the river l'Assomption and its tributaries Black River and River Ducharme, and as there exists a deficit of 50 miles to complete the said quantity of 256 miles ceded to the said Mr. Theovhilus H. (Gushing by the deed of deposit, cession, and transfer of the 16th March, 1865, the said Sieur McConville, for and in the name of those for whom he acts, wishing to complete the deficit which exists, has by these presents ceded and transferred, with warranty against all disturbances generally whatsoever, to the said Mr. Theophilus H. Gushing, hereto present and accepting, the said quantity of limits on the said river l'Assomption. and designated as follows in the English language, to wit :\nNo. 25. 25 square miles. Commencing at the upper end limit No. 94, on the south-west side of l'Assomption river, granted to late Edward Scallon, and extending five miles on said river and five miles back from its banks, making a limit of 25 square miles not to interfere with limits granted or to be renewed in virtue of regulations.\nNo. 26. 25 square miles. Commencing on the north-east side of l'Assomption river, at the upper end of limit 96, granted to late Edward Scallon, and extending five miles up the river and five miles back from its banks, making a limit of 25 square miles, not to interfere with licenses granted or to be renewed in virtue of regulations\nThe licenses for the said quantity of fifty miles of limits for the years 1866 and 1867 have now been handed to the said Mr. Cushing, as he acknowledges and grants acquittance and discharge thereof to whom it shall appertain.\nFor the said Mr. Cushing, his heirs, assigns and successors, to enjoy, have and dispose of the whole as to him shall seem fit ; to make operations and to cut timber in and upon the said limits at the charge of conforming himself in all respects to the rules and regulations to which the said limits may be subjected towards Her Majesty's Government in this province ; as also to pay thereto all the dues that may be exigible for cutting timber on the said limits * * * Further, the said Mr. Theophilus H. Cushing declares that the said Mr. McConville for, and in the name of those for whom he is acting has now paid him the sum of $500 currency for all claims generally whatsoever that he might have against the succession of the said late Edward Scallon and his legal representatives ; declaring, more- over by these presents that he has nothing further to pretend or claim for any objects, causes, or reasons against the latter, accruing to him either from deeds or acts up to this day, giving them general and final acquittance and discharge.\nNow with reference to this deed it is to be observed that the allegation therein, that in virtue of this title the late Mr. Scallon obliged himself to sell 256 miles of limits for cutting timber &c., is not a correct statement of the \"purport, tenor and effect of the deed of 1858 which is the only instrument containing the obligation which Scallon had in his lifetime entered into with Peck in relation to these timber limits. That instrument as we have seen, only professed to sell and transfer and did transfer to Peck and his assigns all the right, title and interest which Scallon had under and in virtue of the licenses therein enumerated, which professed to cover 256 miles of limits, and the operation of the deed of 1866 is to cede and transfer the 1icenee ; No. 25 and 26 and all the right title and interest of the licensees therein named under and in virtue of such licenses to the limits therein described, to have and to hold the same to the use of Cushing his heirs and assigns so as however, not to interfere with limits granted, or to be renewed in virtue of regulations to which, if any such there should prove to be, the licenses 25 and 26 were in express terms made subject.\nThe contention of the plaintiff is, that the words \" with warranty against all disturbances generally whatsoever \" being inserted in connection with the words \"ceeded and transferred, &c., &c.,\" operate as a warranty that the 50 miles of limits as described in the licenses had not, nor had any part thereof, been granted to any other person, and that no part of such limits was liable to be interfered with by any other person whomsoever. So to construe these words would be to subject the heirs of Scallion to an obligation which by the deed of 1858 they were not subjected to, and would make the guarantee to be altogether sans cause, as no cause, motive or consideration whatever existed for the heirs of Scallon to give any such guarantee.\nThe alleged interruption which is relied upon by the plaintiff as a breach of the warranty, construing it as the plaintiff construes it, shows how utterly absurd it would be for any vendor of these timber licenses to give such a guarantee. The interruption is alleged to have been made in virtue of a title conferred by a prior license issued from a wholly different office, and describing limits situate upon a different river altogether The fact that the description inserted in licenses so issued might overlap each other was an event so probable from the manner in which the licenses are issued, that the Crown Land Department takes the precaution of drawing the attention of all licensees to the fact by inserting in express terms in every license the provision that they are liable to be interfered with by any prior license, if any there should prove to be, and by their regulations, which provide that in such case the subsequent licensee shall have no claim whatsoever against the government in respect of any such interference. Now, that any licensee when selling one of these licenses, should give his guarantee that his license should not be interfered with by the owner of any previous license of the existence of which he was not and could not be aware, which in effect would be a guarantee that his license should not in the hands of his assignee be affected by the condition to which it was in express terms made subject would be absurd in the extreme ; but the insertion of such a guarantee in a deed executed by the heirs of Scallon, situate as they were in the present case, could be attributed only to ignorance or inadvertence the only reasonable construction therefore, which can be put upon the words \" with warranty against all disturbances generally whatsoever \" ii the deed of October, 1866, must be to limit their application to protecting the assignee of the licenses against all claims to the licenses themselves as the instruments conveying the limits therein described, and not as a guarantee that the assignee of the licenses shall enjoy the limits therein described, notwithstanding it should appear that they are interfered with by a prior license, to which they are, in express terms, contained in the license themselves, made subject ; or, in other words, that while holding the limits under the licenses they shall be relieved from the effect of a condition which constitutes an express term, subject to which alone the license can be held.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the judgment should be sustained, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBut assuming the deed of 1866 to be subject to the construction put upon it by the plaintiff, there was no sufficient evidence given of any breach of the guarantee, construing it as the plaintiff desires to have it construed. As to license No. 25 which was a substitute for 97, no question arises, for no interference with the limits described in it is pretended to have occurred. If any reliance is to be placed upon the map annexed to the printed case, it appears that the plaintiff himself, subsequently to the transfer to him of license No. 25, accepted from the Crown Land Department a license, numbered 37, which that map exhibits as encroaching upon part of the limits described in No. 25, but that is a matter of no importance in the present case. The plaintiff s claim is reduced to the alleged interference with the limits described in license No. 26 and no evidence whatever was given, which could affect the defendants, to show that Hall, the alleged claimant, had any prior license which interfered with the limits described in license No. 26, or that his licenses, which were admitted to be for limits upon the river Matawin, made those limits cross the height of land separating the watershed of that river from the watershed of the river l'Assomption and reach to the latter river ; comprehending thus, not merely the additional width given to the limits described in license No. 26 over what had been described in license 98, but comprehending even the limits described n license 98, which was a subsisting license at the time when the license under which Hall acquired any rights was said to have first issued. What appeared in evidence was, that while the plaintiff was in possession and enjoyment of the limits described in license No. 26 and after he had cut a quantity of timber thereon, Hail, who claimed under a license issued to him for limits situate upon the river Matawin, whose watershed is wholly distinct from that of the river l'Assomption, claimed the timber so cut, as cut upon his limits, to which claim the plaintiff, notwithstanding a strong and almost violent presumption that such claim could not be supported, appears to have at once yielded, and to have paid Hall a trifling sum for the timber, trifling for the reason which constituted the strong presumptive evidence against his claim, namely, that being cut within the watershed and valley of the l'Assomption, by which alone the logs could be conveyed to market through lands covered by other licenses belonging to the plaintiff, to his mill at the mouth of the river, they were not available to Hail, whose mills were at the mouth of the Matawin, to which river the logs could not have been at all hauled or if at all, not at a cost which would have warranted their being conveyed to that river, and so were useless to Hall, The plaintiff, as dispensing with evidence of the contents of Hall's license, and of the limits which it described, and of its being prior to the plaintiff's license, and having precedence over it, relies upon a letter of the Commissioner of Crown Lands dated 24th April, 1874, wherein he asserts that Hall had a license having priority over license No. 26, but this letter cannot deprive the defendants of their right to compel the plaintiff to prove, by legal evidence, an interruption of his possession by a superior title : true it is, that by the regulations of the department, subject to which the licenses are issued the holders of the licenses for the time being are subjected to certain special provisions for determining disputes between contestants as to the right and position of berths or limits, but such special provisions being in derogation of the general law can only affect the parties actually contesting about the situation of the limits. There is nothing in the guarantee of the defendants, construing it as the plaintiff desires to construe it, which subjects them to any such mode of determining their liability. The matter relied upon by the plaintiff as a breach of their warranty must be established by evidence in accordance with the provisions of the general law ; they have a right to insist upon strict legal evidence that the interruption was under superior title, and that, too, under the circumstances appearing in evidence, superior to the title granted, not only by license 26, but to that which had been granted by license 98 part of which is comprised in 26 ; and such evidence was the more important to be given in a case like the present, in which it appears that the plaintiff so readily submitted to the claim of Hall made as it was in the face of strong presumptive evidence against its validity. But, in truth, in whatever way the Commissioner of Crown Lands may have satisfied his mind of the matters asserted in his letter referred to, the evidence fails to show any proceeding to have been taken of the character of an investigation which under the provisions of the regulations in that behalf, was made binding on the plaintiff. There does not appear to have been any contestation between Hall and the plaintiff as to the boundaries of their respective limits brought under the notice of the proper authority by the statute and the regulations in that behalf authorized to decide between contestants\nThe plaintiff submitted at once to Halls demand Hall, influenced, perhaps, by the fact that, if there were any more timber upon limit No. 26 (as to which there was evidence given by defendants calculated to create a doubt), he could not carry to his mill, or make it available, and, perhaps, doubting the goodness of his claim and content with the easy success of his demand for the timber cut, or for some other reason, declined to become a party to any contestation with the plaintiff under the provisions of the regulations. The plaintiff took no steps to make him a party. The regulations provide that, as between contestants as to the right to berths or the position of bounds, the opinion of the surveyor of licenses at Bytown, or agent for granting licenses elsewhere, is to be binding on the parties, unless and until reversed by arbitration within three months after the notification of such opinion has been communicated to the parties or their representatives on the premises, or sent to their address, or by decision of court and that the surveyor of licenses at Bytown and officer thereunto authorized elsewhere shall at the written request of any party interested, issue instructions stating how the boundaries of timber berths should be run to be in conformity with existing licenses.\nNow, there was no evidence whatever that anything of the nature here indicated occurred. There was in fact no evidence that anything was done which, by the special regulations in derogation of the general law, was made binding upon the plaintiff, or gave him an opportunity to appeal from the decision as erroneous. There was, in short, no evidence of anything which could give to the letter of the Commissioner of Crown Lands the character of an adjudication binding upon the plaintiff, nor, a fortiori, upon the defendants, but even if the plaintiff was bound thereby, the defendants are not deprived of their right, when sued upon their guarantee, to insist upon strict proof of the breach relied upon, according to the course of the general law, wholly irrespective of the special regulations affecting owners of berths, by which regulations the defendants have not consented that any liability arising under their guarantee shall be governed. In a recent case, the Court of Appeal of the High Court of Justice in England ([13]) has held that, in the absence of special agreement, a judgment or an award against a principal debtor is not binding on the surety, and is not evidence against him in an action against him by the creditor, but the surety is entitled to have the liability proved in the action against him equally as it was necessary to have been proved against the principal debtor ; so in like manner, as it appears to me, the defendants in this action, upon their guarantee, are entitled to strict proof of Halls title irrespective of anything which may have taken place between the plaintiff and him, which, as between them, could amount to an adjudication under the provisions of the regulations to which the licenses were subject.\nIt is unnecessary, in my opinion, to show, as could be readily done, that the plaintiff has offered no evidence entitling him to any damages, if his evidence had gone far enough to raise a question as to damages. In every particular necessary to the maintaining an action, plaintiff's case, in my judgment, fails.\nThere was evidence adduced by the defendants that at the time of the trial there was no valuable timber to be seen on limit 26. The plaintiff's counsel, however, contended that the plaintiff was entitled to recover what he gave for that limit, which, as he contended, was the limit 98, but the foundation of his claim is that he never got limit 98. If he had gotten it, he got all Scallon agreed to give ; but assuming that the plaintiff is entitled to recover what he gave for 26, it having been taken as a substitute for 98, what the plaintiff gave for 98 is what he gave for 26, and when we look at the deed by which 98 was sold, we find not only that all Scallon agreed to sell was his right thereto, but that the price agreed to be paid and paid by Peck is stated to be for the mill, and its appurtenances, and all Scallon's interest in the timber limits named, no sum being mentioned as the price of any of the limits, so that it is impossible to say what price, If any, in particular, was the price paid as the price of No. 98, or whether the limits were not all thrown in as having no special value apart from the mill, and its appurtenances.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Beique & McGoun.\nSolicitors for respondent : McConvills & McConville.\n[1] 18 L.

Ritchie, Kt., C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMortgage, agreement to postpone\u2014Non-registration\u2014Priority.\nIn 1861, W.M., the owner of real estate, created a mortgage thereon in favor of J.T. for $4,000. In 1863 he executed a subsequent mortgage in favor of J.M., the appellant, to secure the payment of $20,000 and interest, which was duly registered on the day of its execution. In 1866, W.M. executed another mortgage to the respondent C., for the sum of $4,000, which was intended to be substituted for the prior mortgage of that amount, and the money obtained thereon was applied towards the payment thereof, and J.M. executed an agreement under seal\u2014a deed poll\u2014consenting and agreeing that the proposed mortgage to respondent C. should have priority over his. In 1875, J.M. assigned his mortgage for $20,000 to the Quebec Bank, without notice to the bank of his agreement, to secure acceptances on which he was liable, which assignment was registered, and superseded the agreement, which C. had neglected to register.\nC. filed his bill against the executors of W.M., and against J.M., and the Bank. The Court of Chancery held that the respondent was not entitled to relief upon the facts as shown, and dismissed the bill. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decree as to all the defendants, except as to J.M., who was ordered to pay off the respondent\u2019s (plaintiff\u2019s) mortgage, principal and interest, but without costs. J.M. thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, (Strong, J., dissenting), that as appellant could not justify the breach of his agreement in favor of C., he was bound both at law and equity to indemnify C. for any loss he sustained by reason of such breach.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal from a decree of the Court of Chancery[2].\nThe plaintiff David Campbell, being about to advance money to William McDougall on property on which the appellant, James McDougall, had a prior mortgage, procured a written consent by appellant that the proposed mortgage to him should have priority over his.\nThe consent was as follows:\n\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, James McDougall, of the city of Montreal, miller, hereby declare and agree that a certain mortgage now being made by my brother, William McDougall, of Baltimore, in the county of Northumberland, miller, unto and in favor of David Campbell, of Cobourg, Esquire, upon his milling and other property, near Baltimore, as described in a mortgage prior to mine made in favor of Dr. Taylor, which is registered, for securing to the said David Campbell four thousand dollars with interest, shall stand as the first charge upon the property so described, and that my mortgage, which I now hold on the same property, shall be postponed thereto and shall rank thereafter notwithstanding priority of date and registration.\n\u201cIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, this 7th day of February, A.D. 1866,\n(Signed)James McDougall\u201d\nThe mortgage to James McDougall, referred to in this deed, was dated 24th October, 1863, and registered the same day, and was for $20,000. The mortgage to Taylor, was dated 12th July, 1851, and was for $4,000.\nThe mortgage by William to Campbell, also for $4,000, was dated 28th January, 1866, and was intended to be substituted for the mortgage to Taylor, and the money advanced by Campbell was, in fact, applied to the discharge of the mortgage to Taylor. In 1875, James McDougall assigned his mortgage to the Quebec Bank to secure a liability to the bank, which assignment was registered, and superseded the agreement, which had never been registered, and the existence of which James McDougall did not mention to the bank. The plaintiff (Campbell) filed a bill against the executors of William McDougall, the Quebec Bank and the present appellant, asking for the sale of the land; payment of any deficiency by the executors, and that appellant might be ordered to make good any loss by reason of the assignment of the mortgage.\nThe Court of Chancery was of opinion that the respondent was not entitled to relief; the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the bill as against the exe- cutors of William McDougall and the Quebec Bank should be dismissed. \u201cAs to James McDougall, the plaintiff should have a decree for the payment of the mortgage money and interest, the amount of which to be computed by the registrar, and as between the plaintiff and James no costs to either party up to the issuing of the decree now directed.\u201d\nFrom this judgment the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Maclennan, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe ground on which the court seems to rest its judgment, is that the appellant owed the plaintiff the duty of notifying the bank of the paper he had signed, and that having failed in that duty he must make good the loss, although it is admitted that ordinarily no such duty exists. But it is argued, that because the bank gained priority, the security was more beneficial to them, and that this was an advantage to the appellant, and it is therefore only just and reasonable that he should pay off the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. If, however, the appellant owed no duty to the plaintiff to give notice, it is difficult to see how it can make any difference whether the result was or was not advantageous.\nAs the decree now stands, it is simply an order upon the appellant to pay off the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, principal and interest, because the plaintiff has lost his priority by the prior registration by the bank of their assignment; the appellant does not owe the debt by covenant or otherwise, and the suit is not for either redemption or foreclosure. It must therefore be shown that the appellant, by some wrongful or inequitable act, has caused the loss.\nThe only act done by the appellant was the assignment of the mortgage to the bank. This was done first on the 17th November, 1875, and afterwards by a more formal instrument on the 16th March, 1876; the assignment was not registered till nearly six weeks afterwards on the 24th April, and the appellant had nothing to do with the registration. The injury to the plaintiff did not arise from the assignment\u2014that was perfectly harmless; the injury arose from the bank\u2019s registering and the plaintiff\u2019s omission to register, and then only by force of the statute which made the plaintiff\u2019s instrument void as against the bank; while both were unregistered, the plaintiff\u2019s priority was undisturbed.\nThe appellant cannot be held liable now unless he became liable by the very act of assignment, nor unless the plaintiff could have filed the bill against him the very moment the assignment was made to the bank.\nThe appellant could not have given notice to the bank, for he had no knowledge. The important thing for the bank to know was, not merely that the agreement had been signed by appellant, but that it had been acted on, and that plaintiff had, if such was the fact, advanced his money on the faith of it. The appellant could not notify the bank of this, for he did not know it. The plaintiff had not notified him, and it is not now proved as a fact in the cause. The evidence fails to show that the plaintiff ever knew of the existence of the document, or relied upon it in any way.\nIf the not giving such notice as would subject the bank to the agreement referred to has the effect contended for by the plaintiff, one answer to his claim is, that he has not proved, by an examination of those who represented the bank, or otherwise, that the bank had no such notice, and the evidence of the appellant shews the contrary sufficiently for his exoneration.\nIf the plaintiff would be entitled to relief notwithstanding the absence of fraud, because the appellant, by his own neglect, had been benefited to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, the plaintiff has failed to prove such benefit to have been received by the appellant. Equity does not relieve against the operation of the registry law except on the ground of fraud on the part of those against whom the relief is to be given. The appellant had a right to assign the mortgage, and the bank to register the assignment. If the plaintiff did not choose to register the instrument under which he now claims, and to thus give notice of it to all the world, he cannot claim to be relieved from the consequences of his own ten years\u2019 negligence in giving such notice, by now insisting that it was the duty of the appellant to keep the matter in his mind for all that long period for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, and in assigning to assume (without having been informed) that the plaintiff had acted on the paper, but had not registered it, and to have given notice of these facts to the bank before assigning his own mortgage. The appellant got no advantage from the bank not being informed of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage having priority.\nThe decisions under the statute 27th Elizabeth apply in principle, and are to the effect that a voluntary grantee has no remedy or redress either against a subsequent purchaser, or against the grantor or even against the unpaid purchase money, though on the subsequent transaction all parties had notice of the voluntary settlement; and no matter what covenants the voluntary settlement may contain. The principle of these decisions is, that to give active relief on the first instrument which the statute had declared void, would be to impair the effect of the statute; and the same reasoning applies to the Registry Acts; and the existence of valuable consideration makes no difference. Kerr on Frauds[3]; Daking v. Whymper[4]. Mr. Boyd, Q.C., for respondent:\nThe reasoning of V.C. Blake, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal Ontario[5], is correct, and the respondent is entitled as against the present appellant to be paid all the costs of the litigation. The litigation was entirely occasioned by the wrongful act of the present appellant.\nThe instrument executed by the defendant, being a declaration and contract, that his own mortgage, though prior in point of date and registration, and by consequence superior to the plaintiff\u2019s, shall be postponed to the plaintiff\u2019s, and shall rank thereafter, it follows that the defendant could obtain no benefit from the lands embraced in the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, or in respect of his equity of redemption, except by redeeming that mortgage. The defendant subsequently assigned his mortgage to the Quebec Bank for valuable consideration, the full benefit of which he received. By that assignment he covenanted with the bank that he had in himself good right, full power, lawful and absolute authority to assign the mortgage-money and interest to the bank, and also that he had not at any time theretofore made, done, or executed, or knowingly suffered, any act, deed, matter or thing whatsoever, by means whereof the premises, or any part thereof, were or was charged, encumbered or in any way affected in title, estate, or anywise howsoever.\nBy virtue of the apparent priority of his mortgage referred to in his agreement, and of the absolute and unqualified assignment which he made, he has actually obtained the full benefit of the mortgage, as a first mortgage prior to the plaintiff\u2019s, and so profited to the extent of four thousand dollars and interest, which as between himself and the plaintiff was a preferential charge, but which he has succeeded in postponing in favor of himself and his assignees, to his gain and the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\nIt was inconsistent with his declaration and agreement, and with his duty in the premises, for the defendant to execute such an assignment. He should have transferred only the interest which, as between himself and the plaintiff, he was entitled to, and not the absolute interest which he appeared to have.\nThe respondent hoped, that notwithstanding the improper form of the assignment, the defendant might have given such notice to the bank of the existence of the plaintiff\u2019s rights as would have preserved those rights, and the bill was originally framed on this hypothesis.\nThe bank, however, by its answer denied notice, and the present appellant by his answer, so far from setting up that he had given any notice which would in anywise affect the position of the bank or the plaintiff, alleged that he received no consideration for the declaration and agreement, declared that when he made the assignment to the bank he had not in his mind that instrument, and if he had, it would probably not have occurred to him to make any mention thereof to the bank, and submitted that the prejudice to the plaintiff was due to his own neglect in not registering the document.\nIt would be manifestly unjust, in view of the facts hereinbefore stated, and of the evidence, that the appellant should be permitted to profit by his own wrongful act. It appears that he derived personal profit, by reason of the assignment to the Quebec Bank, to the amount due on the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, and the respondent submits that the decree of the Court of Appeal is correct except as to the said costs, as to which the said respondent submits the decree should be amended. The following authorities were cited by counsel. Judd v. Green[6]; Re Ph\u0153nix Life Assurance Co.[7]; Redfearn v. Ferrier[8]; Weir v. Bell[9]. Mr. Malennan, Q.C., in reply,\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nIt is manifest that the plaintiff was induced to lend his money on the agreement under the hand and seal of defendant James McDougall, that the mortgage to be taken as security therefor should stand as a first charge on the property, and have priority over the defendant\u2019s mortgage, which should be postponed thereto, and should rank thereafter, notwithstanding priority of date and registration. Had this been a mere representation made by defendant to plaintiff, with a view to induce him to alter his position and advance his money, and plaintiff on the strength of such representation had acted on such representation and changed his position and advanced his money, it is quite clear that, as between these parties, the party so representing and so inducing the actions of the other party would never be allowed to repudiate the representation, and by his own act, in direct opposition thereto, deprive the party to whom it was made of the benefit thereof, and secure such benefit to himself. How much stronger this case where plaintiff\u2019s security was a solemn covenant and agreement under seal. The instrument containing this agreement with the plaintiff, the intending mortgagee, that his mortgage should have priority, amounted to a contract with him, that out of the proceeds of the property, his, plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, should be first satisfied. If by reason of defendant\u2019s assignment of his mortgage to the bank, without notice of this agreement, the agreement cannot have effect, and thereby plaintiff is deprived of such priority or satisfaction, why, as against defendant, who by his act has prevented his agreement from operating as intended, should the plaintiff be remediless? At the outset it is worthy of remark that the mortgage so to have priority was made to secure money loaned to take up the Taylor mortgage which had priority over the defendant\u2019s mortgage, that in point of fact defendant was giving up nothing, but in effect simply allowing plaintiff\u2019s mortgage to take the place of the Taylor mortgage. I think defendant had no right, either at law or in equity or good conscience, to do any act which would militate against his undertaking so made and on which plaintiff acted, and, in an equitable view of the case, still less to do an act by which the priority would not only be absolutely destroyed and plaintiff\u2019s mortgage cease to be postponed, but whereby he, the defendant, would in fact directly derive the benefit of the destruction of such priority, and that at the expense of the plaintiff who advanced his money on the strength of such undertaking, and thereby relieved the property from the Taylor mortgage; in other words, that the law will not permit the defendant to break his covenant and agreement without holding him responsible and liable for the loss his covenantee may sustain by reason of any such breach.\nI am of opinion that no question of registration or non-registration arises in this case, as between plaintiff and defendant, but that the legal or equitable rights, or both, of the parties depend purely on matters of representation and agreement, and, pursuing the equitable view, I do not think defendant should be in a better position in relation to the property after his assignment than he was before, and that though, by virtue of the Registration Acts and want of notice of plaintiff\u2019s prior equity, the Quebec Bank may have obtained a priority, such privilege should not enure to the benefit of the defendant and confer upon him a position he had resigned, and by resigning had induced plaintiff to act and advance his money. It is not, in my opinion, unjust or unreasonable to place the defendant, James McDougall, exactly in the position he undertook to assume when plaintiff advanced his money, and in which he would have been had he made no assignment; not to do so, would be, in my opinion, to do a gross wrong and injustice to plaintiff. The property, it is very clear from the evidence, is wholly insufficient to pay the mortgage in the bank\u2019s hands; it follows that if defendant gets the benefit of the whole proceeds of the property it must be at the expense of the plaintiff to the amount of his mortgage, $4,000. In what particular is defendant wronged in saying to him: \u201cYour agreement was that out of the proceeds of the property plaintiff should first have his $4,000. As between you and him there is no right or equity, that because the bank, by reason of want of notice of plaintiff\u2019s priority, has secured by registration of your assignment, to the detriment of the plaintiff, a priority, you should reap the actual benefit thereof; that in the disposition of the proceeds you shall obtain the benefit of a priority you had by solemn deed surrendered and agreed plaintiff should have.\u201d\nHad defendant retained the mortgage and under it realized the value of the land, he would have been obliged to account to plaintiff, out of the money so realized, for the amount of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage; in other words, plaintiff\u2019s mortgage must have been first paid. Why then, because he has transferred the mortgage to the bank, to be held by them for his benefit as a collateral security for certain bills of exchange on which he is liable to the bank as acceptor, should he be in any better or different position, whether he realized directly as mortgagee, or through the bank as his assignee? In either case, it is for his benefit the proceeds of the land are to be realized. Why should he lose his priority in the one case, when he realizes himself, and maintain it in the other, when the bank realizes for him? In both cases the money secured by the mortgage enures alike to his benefit, in the one case directly, in the other indirectly, through the bank; why then should he not stand in the same relative position towards the plaintiff and the property in the one case as the other? I can see no wrong done to the defendant or hardship imposed on him that he did not himself assume; it is but carrying out his own agreement. All plaintiff asks leaves defendant exactly where he was if he had made no assignment. It takes from him no rights; it burthens him with no new liabilities; the bank\u2019s rights are respected, but as between the plaintiff and defendant it leaves them just as they were if the bank had no right; it adds nothing to the rights of the one, it takes nothing from the other. I can see no principle of law or equity by which plaintiff can, with any propriety or justice, be allowed to claim by an act of his against the plaintiff the benefit of a priority he has surrendered and agreed that plaintiff should have, and on the strength of which plaintiff advanced his money; or be permitted by any act of his to repudiate his own solemn instrument under seal and his covenant and agreement therein contained; or to allege that plaintiff\u2019s mortgage shall not stand as a first charge, and that his mortgage shall not be postponed and shall not rank thereafter, notwithstanding priority of date of registration, when by such instrument he has declared and agreed the contrary shall be the case. The only case the defendant sets up in answer to plaintiff\u2019s claim is by way of excuse for assigning, rather than any defence against the claim itself, or justification for the breach of his agreement occasioned by his assigning his mortgage. He seems to me rather to seek to relieve himself from any imputation of moral fraud in assigning the mortgage with a view of defeating his undertaking, and the priority of the plaintiff secured thereby, by alleging that he had no such intention, but that he forgot the instrument he had executed, and so made the assignment without reference thereto, though through his whole evidence he gives us very clearly to understand that when he assigned he was under the impression there was on the property a claim to the amount of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage prior to his, and therefore he could hardly in a court of equity claim that he had a right to be benefited by his own destruction of such prior claim. Assuming all defendant says, while it may relieve him from all charge of moral wrong or of any intentional desire to get the better of the plaintiff, does it in law or equity relieve him from the duty of standing in the same position he would have been in had he recollected it, and had not made the assignment at all, or had made it subject to plaintiff\u2019s right of priority? Why should he, still retaining his interest in the mortgage, and entitled to the benefit of the proceeds recoverable thereunder, and to a re-assignment thereof in the event of his paying the bill of exchange, as collateral security for which he made the assignment, benefit by his forgetfulness at the expense of the plaintiff? Or, in other words, what answer has he set up justifying a breach of his agreement?\nIn Burrowes v. Lock[10], the defendant\u2019s answer was that he had forgotten the circumstance complained of. Sir Wm. Grant held that this was no defence. The plaintiff cannot dive into the secret recesses of his [the defendant\u2019s] heart: so as to know whether he did or did not recollect the fact; and it is no excuse to say he did not recollect it.\nThe mortgage was assigned to the bank as a collateral security, and defendant is still therefore the party beneficially interested in the amount secured thereby; and as the bank, if they had had notice, would have been in equity bound by it, so defendant himself must, I think, continue bound by his deed, and can neither claim nor receive any benefit under his mortgage which would militate against or destroy the priority of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage secured to him under such deed. In other words, I think defendant at law must be bound by his agreement, and in equity must be treated as the equitable owner of the mortgage, and so hold his interest in it subject to the priority he, by his deed, guaranteed to the plaintiff\u2019s security, and so neither at law or in equity be permitted by an act of bad faith, whether intentional or unintentional, as against the plaintiff, to reap the benefit of a priority he agreed plaintiff should have, and on the strength of which he was induced to advance his money.\nNo equitable doctrine is better established since the days of Lord Hardwicke than that enunciated by that learned judge, that the \u201ctaking of a legal estate after notice of a prior right makes a person a mal\u00e2 fide purchaser;\u201d in other words, that a purchaser with notice of a right in another is in equity liable to the same extent and in the same manner as the person from whom he purchases, and therefore, notwithstanding the Registry Acts, there can be no doubt that it is well settled that when a purchaser, by deed duly registered, has notice of a prior unregistered conveyance he will be restrained in equity from availing himself of his purchase on the ground that though the Registry Acts provide that unregistered deeds should be void as against subsequent purchasers, the legislature never could have intended to sanction such gross wrong and injustice as is implied in accepting a conveyance of an estate with a knowledge that it had previously been sold to another, and for the purpose of depriving him of the benefit of his purchase; and on a like principle it was held in Kennedy v. Day[11], that if a party conveys to a person who has no notice of a trust and then takes a re\u2011conveyance, he having notice of the trust, it attaches to him.\nIn Schutt v. Large[12] it was decided that a conveyance to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser by a purchaser with notice cannot cure the defect of the original purchase, although it may put the property beyond its reach, and that it will attach itself to the title upon a subsequent re-conveyance to the guilty party.\nIf these are governing principles, it appears to me \u201ca fortiori\u201d the present defendant cannot, by his own act, get rid of his agreement and the equity he himself created, and secure to himself a pecuniary gain, at a corresponding pecuniary loss to plaintiff, by destroying a priority established by himself, and so have his own mortgage which he had made a second change substituted and made a first charge in lieu of that of the plaintiff. I am, therefore, of opinion that both at law and in equity plaintiff is entitled to indemnity. If, by the evidence it had appeared that there was any likelihood of the property not being sufficient to pay the first mortgage of $4,000, then the decree of the Court of Appeal might not be right, but it is clear that the property is much more than sufficient to satisfy the $4,000 security, but not sufficient to satisfy the defendant\u2019s mortgage. Therefore, as the bank stands in the shoes of the defendant, and as it is for its interest and therefore for the interest of the defendant, that the property should not now be sold, but held in view of an increased value, there is no reason that I can discover why the plaintiff should not, as against the defendant, realize his prior security, which, but for the transfer to the bank, he might now do as he would in such case be in the position of a first mortgagee and as such entitled to a sale.\nIt would possibly have simplified matters if the bank would have consented to a sale, but they may have good and substantial reasons for not doing so, particularly as the property is estimated much below in value the amount of the mortgage held by them. And as it very clearly appears there could be no surplus after paying that mortgage I can see no reason why plaintiff should not now have a decree against the defendant for his mortgage and interest. I had great doubts at the hearing as to the form of the decree. On further consideration, I am not prepared to dissent from the decree adjudged by the Court of Appeal. The decree proposed by V.C. Blake would commend itself more to my mind if a sale could be ordered, but as this cannot be done, and as from the evidence it is clear that in the ultimate result any decree the court might make with a view of indemnifying the plaintiff would practically resolve itself into that made by the court of Appeal, I am not prepared to say that that decree ought to be altered, much less reversed. I think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe facts of this case, so far as they are material to the present appeal, may be stated as follows: On the 24th of October, 1863, the late William McDougall, now represented in this cause by the trustees and executors of his will, David McDougall and John Ludgate, mortgaged the lands in question to the appellant, James McDougall, to secure the payment of the sum of $20,000 and interest. There were at this date two antecedent mortgages on the property, one to a person named Carpenter, and the other to Dr. Taylor. On the 25th January, 1866, William McDougall executed another mortgage to the respondent, David Campbell, the plaintiff in the court below, on a portion of the property comprised in the mortgage to the appellant, to secure payment of \u00a3l,000 and interest in three years. The mortgage to the appellant was registered on the day it bears date, and that to the respondent, Campbell, on the 15th February, 1866. On the 7th February, 1866, the appellant executed an instrument under seal, or deed poll, in the words following:\nKnow all men by these presents, that I, James McDougall, of the city of Montreal, miller, hereby declare and agree that a certain mortgage now being made by my brother, William McDougall, of Baltimore, in the county of Northumberland, miller, unto and in favour of David Campbell, of Cobourg, Esquire, upon his milling and other property near Baltimore, as described in a mortgage prior to mine in favour of Dr. Taylor, which is registered, for securing to the said David Campbell $4,000 with interest, shall stand as the first charge upon the property so described, and that my mortgage which I now hold on the same property shall be postponed thereto and shall rank thereafter, notwithstanding priority of date and registration.\nThis instrument was delivered to the respondent David Campbell, and upon the faith of it he advanced to William McDougall the \u00a31,000 which the mortgage was given to secure. This deed poll was, however, never registered. No re-conveyance or statutory discharge was ever obtained from Taylor, and the legal estate was outstanding either in him or Carpenter when the bill was filed. On the 17th November, 1875, appellant, by an informal instrument, transferred his mortgage to the Quebec Bank as collateral security for the payment of certain acceptances of his held by the bank, amounting in the aggregate to \u00a320,000, and subsequently on the 17th March, 1876, he executed a formal deed of transfer for the same purpose. This last mentioned deed was registered on the 24th April, 1876. It is alleged that the property is insufficient to pay off both the plaintiff and the Quebec Bank. The respondent Campbell filed his bill alleging notice of his mortgage to the Quebec Bank at the time they obtained their assignment, insisting that in case the plaintiff should fail to obtain priority over the bank the appellant was bound to indemnify him, and praying that he might be declared entitled to priority in respect of his mortgage over the Quebec Bank, and that the property might be sold and the encumbrances paid off in due order of priority. The Quebec Bank by its answer denied the notice alleged. At the hearing of the cause before the Chancellor of Ontario the plaintiff failed to prove notice to the Quebec Bank, and as the plaintiff had not by his bill offered and did not at the hearing submit to redeem the bank, the bill was dismissed with costs, the Chancellor holding that the appellant was not liable to indemnify the respondent against the consequences of his loss of priority caused by his omission to register the instrument of the 7th February, 1866. From this decree the respondent Campbell appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that court affirmed the decree so far as related to the question of priority between the respondent Campbell and the Quebec Bank, but directed that the appeal should be allowed as against the present appellant, James McDougall, and that the decree should be varied by ordering him forthwith to pay off the amount due for principal and interest on the mortgage to the present respondent Campbell, together with his costs of the original suit and of the appeal. From that order, the appellant, James McDougall, has appealed to this court.\nNo question of evidence arises before this court, but the case as here presented is purely one of law as to the equitable rights of the appellant and the respondent, David Campbell, upon the facts already stated. The grounds on which the Court of Appeal seems to have proceeded were, that the loss of priority by the respondent is attributable to the act of the appellant in assigning his mortgage to the bank without notice of the respondent\u2019s rights, and at all events that the priority acquired by the bank having made their security more beneficial, this was an indirect advantage to the appellant, and that therefore it was just and reasonable that he should be ordered to pay off Campbell\u2019s mortgage.\nI am unable to see that there is any foundation in law for either of these propositions. The appellant has, so far as I can see, done nothing which makes him liable to the respondent Campbell, either ex contractu or ex delicto. The effect of his transfer of the mortgage of 1863 to the Quebec Bank was innocuous as regards the plaintiff. The priority gained by the bank was not through any act of the appellant, for the assignment of the mortgage only operated to pass to the bank such title and right of priority as the appellant himself had. The bank upon the execution of the assignment stood exactly in the position of the appellant,\u2014they acquired no priority or advantage over Campbell by reason of the absence of notice to them of the deed of 1866, giving Campbell priority over the appellant, and until the registration of their assignment they were as much bound by that deed as the appellant had been. In short, the transfer to the bank, though without notice, had no greater effect on the respondent\u2019s rights than it would have had if it had been made expressly subject to the priority which had previously been conceded by the appellant to the respondent. That this is a correct view to take of the effect of the assignment by itself, apart from the subsequent operation of the registry laws, is, I think, clear when it is considered that the legal estate was outstanding in Taylor or Carpenter, whose mortgages preceded the appellant\u2019s, and therefore a mere equitable estate passed to the bank under the transfer, so that between the respondent, Campbell, and the bank, both being equitable encumbrancers, the precedence of their encumbrances depended on the arrangement which had been effected by the deed of February, 1866, just as it had previously depended as between Campbell and the appellant, whose rights, and whose rights only, the bank, as the purchasers of an equitable estate, acquired under the assignment.\nThe priority which the bank subsequently obtained by registration of their assignment whilst the instrument of February, 1866, remained unregistered in the hands of the respondent, Campbell, cannot be imputed to any act or conduct of the appellant, but resulted exclusively from the operation of the Registry Act upon the neglect of the respondent to register a deed which formed an important part of his title as mortgagee. That the deed of February, 1866, granting priority to the respondent was a deed affecting lands, and as such requiring registration under the Con. Stats. of U.C., cap. 80, sec. 17, the statute in force at the date of its execution, as well as under the statute of Ontario, 31 Vic., cap. 20, the Registry Act, under which the assignment to the bank was registered, and so liable to become fraudulent and void under either of these acts by the prior registration of a subsequent deed affecting the same lands, is a proposition too plain to be disputed. Neither can it be contended that the deed of February, 1866, was one not susceptible of registration in consequence of the omission to set out the parcels to which it related in the body of the instrument itself, for it is clear that a deed referring to lands described in another deed, as in the present case, could have been registered in a memorial properly framed under the first mentioned act, and can now be registered at full length under the later statute.\nIf, however, this deed had not been a deed requiring registration within the Registry Acts, it would have made no difference as regards the present appellant; the consequence would have been that the bank would have gained no priority, and the respondent, Campbell, would have been entitled to be first paid off out of the proceeds of the sale, and would have had no occasion to seek indemnity from the appellant, who in that case would have been equally entitled to relief against the order appealed from as he is in the view which I take.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the loss which the respondent has sustained of the preference which had been given to his mortgage, and in respect of which I concede he was a purchaser for value, is not to be imputed to any breach of contract, or to any wrongful or inequitable act or omission on the part of the appellant, but entirely to the provisions of an Act of Parliament operating on the respondent\u2019s own negligence. That any obligation rested on the appellant to obviate the possible consequences of the respondent\u2019s omission to register, would be equivalent to saying that it was incumbent on every grantor to register the deed, a proposition surely not to be sustained, more especially since it would interfere with the right of the grantee to retain his conveyance unregistered if he thinks fit to do so.\nThen, if the appellant cannot be said to have broken any covenant or agreement, or to have been guilty of any illegal misrepresentation or concealment, upon what principle can he be said to be liable, merely because he has accidentally acquired an advantage under the provisions of a statute? I concede, of course, that if the estate was a sufficient instead of a scanty security, and the derivative mortgage to the Quebec Bank did not absorb the whole amount of the original mortgage, as between the appellant and respondent, the latter would be entitled to priority of payment out of the proceeds of a sale. This, however, does not depend on any personal liability of the appellant, but results from the deed of February, 1866, by which the appellant postponed his interest, and which is still binding on the appellant as regards the estate, though as between the respondent and the Quebec Bank it has been avoided by the Registry Act.\nI can see no ground upon which the appellant can be made responsible to the respondent for the loss which he has sustained by the operation of the registry laws which would not apply with very much greater force to a voluntary settlor who avoids the settlement by a subsequent conveyance to a purchaser for value. In that case it has been held that the grantee claiming under the voluntary deed has not only no right against the settlor personally, but cannot even claim a lien on the purchase money. And the reason given for this is, that to hold otherwise would defeat the policy of the law, the statute of 27 Elizabeth having enacted that the prior voluntary deed is to be deemed fraudulent and void in favour of the second purchaser.\nThen, is not the same reasoning a fortiori applicable here? The Registry Acts have avoided unregistered deeds against later registered deeds in order to carry out the policy of the act, which is that all deeds should be registered, and surely it would tend to defeat that policy if a purchaser unwilling to register could obtain indemnity against the penalty imposed by the statute from one who derived an advantage to be ascribed entirely to the effect of the statute, apart from any act or omission of his own. In short, I think the argument, which seems to me a conclusive answer to the second position taken by the Court of Appeal, may be summed up by saying that any benefit which has accrued to the appellant, having been given to him by the law, and by the law alone, no court of justice ought to take from him that which he has so acquired.\nEven if I had come to the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal, I should still have thought their order premature. It does not appear to me that the evidence is sufficient to warrant the conclusion that there can be possibly nothing left available for the respondent. I think the proper decree in that point of view would have been to have directed all accounts to be taken and a sale, leaving the ultimate liability of the appellant to be dealt with on further directions.\nI am of opinion that the order of the Court of Appeal should be reversed, and the Chancellor\u2019s decree restored, with costs to the appellant both here and in the Court of Appeal.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nFrom the evidence in this case, it appears that William McDougall, a brother of the appellant, was, in 1866, the owner of a mill and other real estate near Baltimore, in the county of Northumberland, upon which he had executed a mortgage to a Dr. Taylor for four thousand dollars, which was duly registered. Subsequent to the making and registry of that mortgage he executed a second one to the appellant (McDougall) on the 24th of October, 1863, which was registered on the same day.\nIn 1866, the mortgagor applied to the respondent for the loan of four thousand dollars to pay off the first mortgage to Dr. Taylor, which he agreed to give on a mortgage to himself, provided the appellant would undertake to admit that mortgage when executed to hold the same relative position to his mortgage as Dr. Taylor\u2019s then occupied. To this the appellant agreed, and before the advance of the four thousand dollars by the respondent and the delivery of the mortgage to him executed under his hand and seal, an agreement and covenant to and with the respondent, that the mortgage being made by his brother (William McDougall) unto and in favor of the respondent \u201cupon his milling and other property near Baltimore, as described in a mortgage prior to \u2018his,\u2019 in favor of Dr. Taylor, which is registered, for securing to the said David Campbell four thousand dollars, with interest, shall stand as first charge upon the property so described,\u201d and that his mortgage, which he then held on the same property, should \u201cbe postponed thereto, and rank thereafter, notwithstanding priority of date and registration.\u201d\nWith the respondent\u2019s money the mortgage to Dr. Taylor was paid off and discharged.\nThe interest on the respondent\u2019s mortgage was paid up to the 25th January, 1877. The bill claims the four thousand dollars and three hundred and eighty five dollars for interest due at the commencement of the suit.\nThe appellant, in 1876, assigned his mortgage to the Quebec Bank, in consideration of bills of exchange held by the bank for an amount equal to the mortgage he held, and for which bills he was liable, and the assignment was registered a few days afterwards. It is not alleged or shown that the bank had any knowledge of the appellant\u2019s agreement and covenant with the respondent. It is shown the mortgaged property is not more than sufficient to satisfy the mortgage assigned to the bank, and if the respondent has no recourse upon the appellant his claim will be probably lost. The money which is the foundation of that claim the respondent was induced to advance solely on the faith of the appellant\u2019s covenant, and as between the parties we are asked to decide that it is worthless. By its true interpretation it is not only a warranty that the respondent\u2019s mortgage shall have priority to the appellant\u2019s, but that it should stand as a first charge on the property.\nThe appellant, in his answer, denies, for reasons given, that he was guilty of any moral fraud when he assigned the mortgage to the bank in not communicating the position he occupied with the respondent in regard to it. He committed no fraud, legal or moral, upon the bank, because he gave them a good conveyance, but he was guilty of a legal fraud upon the respondent by failing to make such communication. The substance and spirit of his covenant required him as far as he dealt with his mortgage to preserve the priority of the respondent\u2019s mortgage, and having failed in his duty to the respondent he claims an acquittance from his covenant, by resting the only defence he attempts to make in his answer on the failure of the respondent to register it. The registry of documents effecting interests in lands, besides other objects, is intended to operate as a notice to subsequent parties, and the statute makes no provision by which a failure to register would invalidate instruments between immediate parties to transfers or agreements. A mortgagor could not, as between himself and his first mortgagee, who, by neglecting to register his conveyance, had lost his lien through the means of a second mortgage executed to another, set up that negligence as a defence to his convenant in the first mortgage to repay the amount of it.\nMcDougall was bound to fulfil his convenant, and it would be no excuse to say that he had forgotten it when making the second conveyance. He testified that he was not aware his covenant had been acted upon by the advance of the money by the respondent. He, however, executed it, knowing it was intended to be acted on. He knew, as the covenant shows, that the respondent had agreed to advance the money, and that the mortgage was being prepared, and he was bound at his legal peril to enquire and ascertain that it had not before putting it out of his power to fulfil it. With all deference to the learned Chancellor, I think the case of Slim v. Croucher[13] is in these particulars quite in point.\nThe covenant was at least a warranty against the acts of the covenantor himself, and how can he, by his own wrongful act in violation of it, claim exemption from it. He warranted that the respondent\u2019s mortgage should have priority over his own, and he does an act which prevented that priority. His answer to the respondent is: I acknowledge the breach of the warranty, but if you had registered the covenant I could not have broken it. Such a defence cannot, in my opinion, be for a moment considered. Suppose that the appellant, when he assigned the mortgage, was unable to pay the damages arising from the breach of his covenant, by that act his conduct would be justly called fraudulent. By his covenant he had induced the respondent to advance his money, and by his subsequent act he nullifies the security upon which the money was given. If he did so wilfully it was a moral as well as a legal fraud. He received from the bank the consideration of $20,000, when he was bound to have known his interest in the mortgage, as against the respondent\u2019s claim, was but $16,000. He got, therefore, $4,000 of the respondent\u2019s money, having got that amount over and above his proper interest in the mortgage.\nThe respondent, under the pleadings and evidence, is, in my opinion, entitled to a decree against the appellant for that amount with interest at the rate stated in the respondent\u2019s mortgage, from the date of the assignment, less the amount paid up to the 25th January, 1877 with costs.\nThe bank is entitled to our judgment. As the respondent\u2019s action is not to redeem, and the bank had no notice of the lien of the respondent, and paid the full consideration for the mortgage, the respondent, I think, can have no decree in his favor as to the bank. A second mortgagee can tender the amount of a first mortgage and enforce an assignment of the first to him, but I know of no law under which a second mortgagee by legal proceedings can force a first one to sell. The bank then, I think, is entitled to the costs of their defence. It is proved that under a covenant in the respondent\u2019s mortgage, the mortgagor was bound to keep $4,000 permanently insured on the mortgaged property. It appears that after his death the executors on one occasion failed to pay the premium which the respondent\u2019s agent paid on his own account. I think the respondent should also have a decree against the appellants David McDougall and John Ludgate the executors of William McDougall, for fifty dollars, the amount so paid, with costs.\nThe decree should, I think, provide that on payment of the amount due on the mortgage, with the costs herein, the respondent shall be required to assign his mortgage to the appellant, McDougall.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nDuring the argument, and for some time since, I was, I confess, much impressed by the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant.\nSome passages in the judgments of some of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal who pronounced the judgment against which the defendant McDougall has appealed, seemed to me to support the impression made upon my mind. The Chief Justice, at p. 514 of Vol. 5 of the Appeal Reports, says:\nPutting the case on the highest grounds for the plaintiff, there was negligence on both sides, and I think that most persons would be inclined to designate that of the plaintiff as more gross and inexcusable than that of James McDougall.\nMr. Justice Patterson, at p. 513, says:\nHere there is no formal contract by McDougall to do anything. When he signed the paper he had done all that he was to do. The mischief to the plaintiff arose from his own neglect to register the instrument, and that neglect has been the occasion of the litigation.\nAnd I confess, as it appeared to me, the occasion also of the damage sustained by the plaintiff, and regarding the case in that light I could not well see how a man who had done all he had contracted with another to do, could be made liable to reimburse that other damages sustained by his neglect to do something which, if done, would have prevented his sustaining the damage of which he complains. But upon a more careful consideration of the terms of the instrument executed under the hand and seal of James McDougall, which I agree in thinking, in view of the circumstances under which, and the purpose for which, it was executed, must be treated as the covenant of James McDougall to and with the plaintiff, I am of opinion that even if it were correct to say that the covenantor, by signing the paper, \u201chad done all that he was to do,\u201d it is not correct to say that all was done that he covenanted should be done, or that he has kept his covenant and for this reason, as it appears to me, the defendant may be made answerable for the damage sustained by the plaintiff. The covenant so made with the plaintiff is \u201cthat a certain mortgage now being made by my brother, Wm. McDougall, in favor of David Campbell\u201d (the plaintiff) \u201cshall stand as first mortgage on the property\u201d (mortgaged) \u201cand that my mortgage, which I now hold on the same property, shall be postponed thereto and shall rank thereafter, notwithstanding priority of date and registration.\u201d\nNow, the only time when the priority here covenanted for could be asserted or given would be upon some proceedings being taken in court to obtain payment of the mortgages, or of either of them, out of the land mortgaged; and the covenant of James McDougall is not qualified by any condition that, upon that occasion arising, the mortgage then held by him should still be held by him; the covenant is absolute, that upon a question arising as to priority between the mortgages, whenever arising, the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, although subsequent in date to that held by James McDougall, shall have priority over the latter, which shall be postponed to the plaintiff\u2019s. The occasion has now first arisen for calling for the fulfilment of that covenant, and James McDougall, by his own act of assigning his mortgage without securing to the plaintiff the priority covenanted for, has incapacitated himself from securing to the plaintiff that priority which McDougall contracted that he should have, and his assignee is, by James McDougall\u2019s act, in a position to refuse, and does refuse, to let the plaintiff have the benefit of James McDougall\u2019s covenant. This covenant is therefore broken, and it is immaterial whether the plaintiff could or could not have registered the covenant, or whether by so doing he could have secured himself. James McDougall\u2019s covenant is broken, and the damages awarded are the natural consequence of the breach of that covenant. Upon this ground I think the decree can be sustained, and that the appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Mowat, Maclennan & Downey.\nSolicitor for respondent: Sydney Smith.\n[1] 5 Ont.

(the plaintiff) being desirous of securing a residence, entered into negotiations with S. (defendant) to purchase a house which defendant was then erecting. W. alleged that the agree\u00adment was, that he should take the land (2\u00bd lots) at $400 a lot of fifty feet frontage, and the materials furnished and work done at its value. In August, 1874, a deed and mortgage were executed, the consideration being stated in both at $5,926. The mortgage was afterwards assigned to the N. and N. W. L. Company. W. alleged in his bill, that S., in violation of good faith, and taking advantage of W.\u2019s ignorance of such matters, and the confidence he placed in &, inserted in the mortgage a larger sum than the balance due as a fair and reasonable market value of the lands, and of what he had done to the dwelling house and other premises, and he prayed that an account might be taken of the amount due.\nS. repudiated the allegation of fraud, and alleged that W. had every opportunity to satisfy himself, and did satisfy himself, as to the value of what he was getting ; that he had told the plaintiff he valued the land at $2,000, and that in no way had he sought to take advantage of the plaintiff. & was unable to be present at the hearing, and applied for a postponement, on the grounds set forth in an affidavit, that he was a material witness on his own behalf, and that it was not safe for him, in this state of health, to travel from Ottawa to Winnipeg.\nDubuc, J., refused the postponement, on the ground that the court was only asked now to decree that the account should be opened and properly taken, and the amount ascertained, which would be done by the master if the court should so decide, and that the defendant would then have an opportunity of being present, and that he was not necessarily wanted at the hearing : and, as the result of the evidence, made a decree in accordance with the contentions of the plaintiff, and directed an account to be taken.\nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, under sec. 6 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879, allowed an appeal direct to the Supreme Court of Canada, it being known that there were then only two judges on the bench in Manitoba, the plaintiff (Chief Justice) and Dubuc, J., from whose decree the appeal was brought.\nHeld, that under the circumstances, the case ought not to have been * proceeded with in the absence of appellant, and without allow\u00ading him the opportunity of giving his evidence.\nPer Ritchie, C.J., and Strong and Gwynne, JJ., that on the merits there was no ground shown to entitle the plaintiff to relief.\nPer Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, J., that the bill upon its face alleged no ground sufficient in equity for relief, and was demurrable.\nTHIS was an appeal from a judgment pronounced and a decree made by Mr. Justice Dubuc, of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in the Province of Manitoba, on the 12th day of April, 1879.\nBy an order made on the 18th day of September last, by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, an appeal was permitted on behalf the defendant Schultz to the said Supreme Court of Canada without any appeal from the said judgment to any intermediate Court of Appeal in the Province of Manitoba. The facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellant.\nThere was no completed contract until the 12th August, 1874, when the arrangement was reduced to writing in the shape of a deed and mortgage, the consideration being stated at $5,926 in both, that being the amount or balance due upon the accounts between the plaintiff and the defendant at the time the mortgage was executed.\nNow, what we complain of is that the decree says in terms there has been no contract, and in fact, makes a new contract for the parties, and proceeds to enforce it upon the same principle as that on which the plaintiff recovers upon a quantum meruit in an action at law. In a case of the kind alleged by the plaintiff, the only possible course was to have set aside the contract in toto, but that could not have been done in this case, as the plaintiff had acted upon it for so long a time as to make it inequitable now to decree a cancellation of it.\nNow, the ground taken for re-opening the accounts was, as alleged in the bill, that plaintiff was to pay the fair and reasonable value of the land, of the materials, and the work then done, and that the mortgage was executed by plaintiff, relying on the honesty and fairness of defendant, reposing confidence in him and being ignorant of the value of the matters; and that defendant had been guilty of fraud throughout the whole transaction. As to the land, the plaintiff says that he should take the land at $400 a lot of 50 feet frontage, whilst the defendant says that the plaintiff agreed to pay him at the rate of $800 per lot. Now, the plaintiff states in one of his letters that \u201cthe land was valued at $800.\u201d This is precisely what the defendant says the land was to be per lot.\nThe question naturally arises, what put this amount of $800 into the plaintiff\u2019s mind at the time he was writing, and the natural answer is that that amount was mentioned in the negotiation, and it is impossible that it should have been mentioned in any other way than as $800 per lot.\nWhen the mortgage was presented to the defendant for execution he saw the amount, and thought \u201cit pretty large.\u201d He had then the building before him and all the material he had to pay for. If he thought it too high a valuation, then was his time to question it. He had asked Corbett what the building would cost and he told him about $6,000, and here was a mortgage presented to him for execution for $5,926, and he had paid $500 before, making $6,426 ; and the land, according to his story, was only to be $1,000, leaving $5,426 for the building, and only left $574 to complete the house, according to Corbett\u2019s estimate. Could he have thought that amount would complete the house ? could he have been under the impression for about two months afterwards that the building was only going to cost him some $574 more or $6,000 in all; or could he have felt that he had not been taken in, taking his own figures as a basis ? He also says he felt, as a result of this conversation with Corbett that he had been taken in.\nOn the other hand, the plaintiff undertakes to pledge his oath \u201cthat the arrangement with Mac Arthur, of the Merchant\u2019s Bank, was merely a collateral arrangement. It really had no substance, as the bank never took an assignment of the mortgage, and never advanced any money on it. It was simply a contrivance of Schultz.\u201d The same may be said of this statement as the plaintiff says of the defendant\u2019s.\nThe judge who heard the case seems not to have looked upon the defendant\u2019s answer, which is under oath, as evidence, but merely as a statement of his case. The learned judge is clearly in error when he says the difference or amount charged for the land would be either $1,863.50 or $2,853.50.\nThe learned judge seems to have overlooked those portions of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence which were most strongly against him. He does not refer to that part of it which states that \u201cI made an arrangement with you and Mr. Mac Arthur in good faith, supposing that he alone was the person to whom I was responsible, notwithstanding I was satisfied the mortgage was for double the sum it should be.\u201d \u201cWhatever may have been my convictions on this point\u2014a matter even now susceptible of demonstration\u2014I intended to carry it out faithfully, but it seems circumstances have prevented me.\u201d It is altogether likely, if the learned judge had not overlooked the above quotation from the plaintiff\u2019s letter, he would not have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff had not any knowledge of the fraud which he says the defendant perpetrated upon him.\nI contend, therefore, 1st. That the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is not entitled to prevail against the defendant\u2019s without corroboration, and that his evidence is not corroborated as to the agreement made, or as to the settlement or non-settlement of the account, at the time the mortgage was executed.\n2nd. The evidence as to value of works and land cannot be considered corroborative, because it does not touch the question as to what the agreement was between the parties, and is only matter of opinion, so far as the land is concerned, and the same may be said of the material, as a great part of the building was burned before the valuation was made by Blackmore and Woods.\nCounsel for the defendant Schultz applied before the hearing to have the hearing postponed until after said defendant\u2019s return from Ottawa in April or May then following, and read a doctor\u2019s certificate stating that in the then state of said defendant\u2019s health, it was not safe for him to make the journey from Ottawa (where he was then) to Winnipeg, and an affidavit of the defendant to the same effect, and that he was a necessary and material witness on his own behalf, and an affidavit of his solicitor that he was a necessary and material witness on his own behalf; but the plaintiff and his counsel pressed the presiding judge so strongly to proceed with the case in the defendant\u2019s absence that he decided to do so ; and, even if this court was to hold that a prim\u00e2 facie case is made, which the appellant denies, the cause ought now to be sent back to be re-heard, after the evidence of the appellant shall have been heard.\nAnother ground on which appellant relies is, that if there was any irregularity or fraud in making up the amount inserted in the mortgage, the plaintiff confirmed and acquiesced in the transaction after he had obtained knowledge of the facts and the value of the premises. In this connection see Clanricade v. Homing ([1]) ; Patterson v. Osborne ([2]).\nThe plaintiff thought, when he signed the mortgage, that it was for too large an amount; and yet, notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of all this, he voluntarily prepared in his own handwriting the agreement and power of attorney, and executed them, intending, as he says he did, to carry out the arrangement in good faith. See Villiers v. Beaumont ([3]). The plaintiff in this case is known as a very clever man, not liable to be imposed upon or unfairly dealt with; but, if the portions of his evidence which he would have the court believe are to be believed, he is the most credulous man in the universe ; but this cannot be believed by anyone who is acquainted with him or with his reputation. Anyone who believes that he is the credulous babe he pretends to be in his evidence believes an impossibility.\nMr. Boyd, Q. C, for respondent :\nThere is no appeal from the order of the judge at the trial to proceed with the evidence. All that we know of this refusal is what appears in the judgment. The counsel called his witnesses. He could have refused to continue, and the proper practice would have been to appeal from that order. If appellant had intended to appeal from this ruling, he should have printed in this case all the materials upon which the order was given Not having seen them, I cannot argue this point.\nThe evidence substantiates all the allegations of the bill, most fully and explicitly, and the same evidence shows the untruth of all the material grounds of defence set up in the answer. The learned judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, has found upon the facts and law in favor of the respondent. It was said the learned judge did not take into account the sworn answer of the defendant, but this the learned judge has done. In his judgment, he specially refers to the sworn answer as follows :\u2014\u201cWhile the defendant in his sworn answer, states, &c,\u201d and comes to the conclusion that the defendant has failed to prove his assertion. The real point, however, in this case, is whether there was any deception practiced upon the respondent.\nThe representation of the appellant was in effect in this case that the market value of land was $800 per lot, and. it is impossible to think that he could have believed this upon the evidence given. He also, in effect, represented that what the building and materials cost him was $5,426, as he stated he did not want to make any profit on them, and this is also substantially the meaning of his answer. But in fact this was more than double their real value, as he must inevitably have known from the accounts kept by him and otherwise. Now, had such misrepresentations of value been made and their falsity discovered, while yet the contract was executory, it would have been a valid ground for resisting completion of the contract. Wall v. Stubbs ([4]) ; Codman v. Horner ([5]).\nAnd such falsity of representation (even as to matters of value) would be ground for avoiding an executed contract or requiring the party to make good his representations. Ingram v. Thorp ([6]); Story Eq. Jur. ([7]) ; Smith v. Gunteyman ([8]).\nThe rule is that even when the parties deal at arm\u2019s length, the seller must do or say nothing to deceive or mislead, even a single word is enough to avoid a transaction. Twiner v. Harvey ([9]).\nA multo fortiori is this the rule when, as in this case, the parties were not dealing at arm\u2019s length, but the purchaser relied upon the skill and judgment of the seller, accepted his statements and representations, and, as the appellant well knew, forbore to inform himself elsewhere. The very fact of there being no going into accounts and items and details as to the work done upon the building and the values thereof, in the strongest way indicates the reliance the respondent placed on the word of the appellant.\nThe defence of laches or acquiescence suggested by the answer herein (though not expressly pleaded) does not avail, because it appears that the respondent did not delay after being aware of the fraud committed on him, and such dealings as are mentioned in the answer without a competent knowledge of the facts which entitle to relief are no evidence of acquiescence (see Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd) ([10]), as compared with the same case before the privy council ([11]) where it is laid down that fraud being established against a party, it is for him, if he allege laches in the other party, to show when the latter acquired a knowledge of the truth and prove that he knowingly forbore to assert his right.\nThe bill proceeds upon the theory of the accounts never having been gone into or settled; that apart from the formal execution of the mortgage there is no stated account, and that the specific error charged and proved in regard to the price of the land, justifies and demands the opening up of the whole sum claimed on the footing of that mortgage.\nIn this aspect of the case the authorities cited in the court below are sufficient to justify the decree. Reference may be made especially to the following :\u2014\nDe Montmorency v. Devereux ([12]); Davis v. Sparling ([13]); Allfray v. Allfray ([14]); Breckridge v. Walley ([15]).\nThe case may also be viewed and supported in another aspect. The evidence shows misrepresentations or false statement of facts on the part of the appellant which would justify a rescision of the contract. There is evidence of fraud which would have entitled the respondent to avoid the transaction had he not changed his position, before knowing of the imposition practised upon him. But by going on and completing the building, matters were so changed that it was not open to the respondent to avoid the whole transaction as the parties could not be placed in statu quo. But the rule of equity is that the person deceived can elect which course he will take : whether to set aside the transactions, or to recover compensation for the misrepresentations, or to require the person deceiving to make good his statements.\nIf the person deceived has not changed his position he can elect to disaffirm the whole contract. Rawlins v. Wickham ([16]). If his position has been changed he can claim reparation. Mixers case ([17]).\nAnd in such a case as the present the person deceived has an equity to be placed in the same situation as if the matter represented was bon\u00e2FF fide carried out, that is (in the present case) to retain the property on paying the fair and reasonable and market value thereof. Blair v. Bromley ([18]); Burrows v. Lock ([19]); Ellis v. Coleman ([20]) ; Palsford v. Richards ([21]) ; Slim v. Croucher ([22]).\nRITCHIE, C. J. :\u2014\nIn this case the bill was filed 20th December, 1879 ; answer, the 19th January, 1880 ; replication, the 10th February, 1880 ; hearing, 28th February, 1880.\nIt appears that counsel for the defendant Schultz applied, before the hearing, to have the hearing postponed until after said defendant\u2019s return from Ottawa in April or May then following, and read a doctor\u2019s certificate stating that in the then state of said defendant\u2019s health, it was not safe for him to make the journey from Ottawa (where he was then) to Winnipeg, and an affidavit of the defendant to the same effect, and that he was a necessary and material witness on his own behalf, and an affidavit of his solicitor that he was a necessary and material witness on his own behalf; but the plaintiff and his counsel pressed the presiding judge so strongly to proceed with the case in the defendant\u2019s absence, that he decided to do so.\nThe learned judge thus states the matter :\nAt the hearing, before the merit of the case was gone into, Mr. Monkman applied, on behalf of defendant Schultz, to have the trial put off until May or June, on the ground that the said defendant is absent attending his parliamentary duties at Ottawa, and because he is in a delicate state of health. He read an affidavit from defendant Schultz, in support of said facts, and a certificate from Dr. Grant, of Ottawa.\nMr. Howell resisted the application, and said that defendant was served with the bill on the 20th December, and could have had the case tried before the session which commenced only the 12th February, had he filed his answer at once instead of on the 19th January, the last day allowed him for filing it. The principal fact of the case is admitted by plaintiff, viz: that the plaintiff has purchased the house and land, and that he was to pay a fair valuation for the same. They only differ as to the amount of the said valuation. An account was stated by defendant, but without plaintiff examining it. It can be ascertained now. The Court is only asked now to decree that the account should be opened and properly taken, and the amount ascertained, which will be done by the master, if the court so decide. The defendant will have an opportunity of being present when the account will be taken. He is not necessarily wanted now.\nThe plaintiff is here with his witnesses ready to go on.\nMr. Monkman replies that the defendant is charged with fraud and should be here to contradict the charge.\nI decided that as the merit of the case by the decree to be made, if it should be made, as it will only be to re-open the account stated in his mortgage, and as I intended to see that the defendant should have an opportunity of being present at the taking of the account, if necessary, the defendant could not be prejudiced, and as the plaintiff was ready with his witnesses, and was pressing his right to go on with the hearing, I did not see that according to the rules of practice, I could properly refuse to proceed with the taking of the evidence.\nI think this cause was forced on with unjustifiable haste, and this is the more apparent when the untenable reasons assigned by the learned judge for refusing delay are considered. The learned judge assumes and prejudges against the defendant the very point in issue between the parties, viz. : that the defendant is bound to account to plaintiff, and that, as he should have an opportunity of being present at the taking of the account, he concludes he could, not be prejudiced by the hearing going on without his presence or testimony. The very point in controversy to be determined at the hearing being, not the amount in dispute, but whether plaintiff\u2019 was entitled to any account, or to re-open the matter of the sale, or to have the mortgage in any way interfered with, and the learned judge seems entirely to have overlooked the fact that delay could only be injurious to defendant, the plaintiff having nothing to gain by a speedy adjudication. If plaintiff was ready to go on with his witnesses, and would have been damnified by not having them then examined (which does not appear to have been the case), I can see no possible reason why they should not have been examined and the further hearing postponed ; but, independent of and in addition to. this, a perusal of the proceedings on the hearing shows that the plaintiff was permitted, when being examined as a witness, to make most objectionable statements, and statements he knew not to be evidence, to use most intemperate language, and generally to give his evidence and act iii a most unbecoming manner, wholly inconsistent with the due and proper administration of justice ; and, therefore, if the plaintiff\u2019s bill disclosed a case entitling him to relief, and the facts proved made put a prim\u00e2 facie case, I think, for the irregularities referred to, this court should, in the interest of justice, hold that there had been a mis-trial, and that the case should go down to another hearing, when the defendant would have an opportunity of being present and testifying, and when the proceeding should be conducted in a manner more consistent with the usages and practice of British courts of justice.\nBut, as for the reasons I am about to give, I think the plaintiff has failed to set out or establish a case entitling him to the relief he claims, the case and the litigation must end here.\nI think the bill in this case is clearly demurrable; admitting all the facts stated in the Bill to be true, the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief he seeks, and therefore the bill should have been dismissed at the hearing.\nThe transaction between the plaintiff and defendant as detailed in the bill appears to have been an extremely simple one.\nThe bill, after stating that plaintiff, on or about the month of June, 1874, went to the province of Manitoba to reside, having been previously appointed Chief Justice, sets forth that:\nPrior to the plaintiff accepting the office he now holds, and removing to Winnipeg, he became acquainted with the defendant, Schultz, as a member of the House of Commons, of which the plaintiff was also a member, and the defendant, Schultz, and the plaintiff were on intimate and friendly terms, and on the plaintiff arriving in Winnipeg the defendant, Schultz. manifested kindness to the plaintiff in many ways and interested himself in looking up a dwelling place for the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s family, which were to come up from Ontario in the month of August or September following, and in this way and by various other acts of kindness the defendant, Schultz, quite won the confidence of the plaintiff.\nThe bill then sets out the contract entered into between plaintiff and defendant in these words :\nThe defendant, SchuItz, had commenced to erect a dwelling house in the city of Winnipeg, on the south side of Notre Dame street, and had the foundation thereof laid and had erected thereon the frame thereof, and had certain material on hand to go on with the completion of the same, and had workmen engaged thereat when it was arranged between the plaintiff and the defendant, Schultz, that the plaintiff should take the foundation and frame and other the promises as it then stood, and go on at his own expense and finish the same for a dwelling for himself, and should pay the defendant, Schultz. the fair and reasonable value of the work then done, and of the material then on hand in respect of the said dwelling house, and the fair and reasonable value of the land to be taken therewith, and in pursuance of such arrangement the plaintiff went on and at his own expense completed the said dwelling house, into which he then moved with his family, and has ever since resided and now resides.\nAnd the consummation of this agreement is set out in these words :\nShortly after the above arrangement, and on the twelfth day of August, 1874, it was proposed that the said arrangement should be consummated by the defendant, Schultz, giving to the plaintiff a deed of conveyance of the said property, and taking from the plaintiff a mortgage thereon to secure the defendant, Schultz, in the payment for the land and the fair and reasonable value of what he had done towards the construction of the said dwelling house as aforesaid, and a deed of conveyance of the lands consisting of what the defendant called two and one half lots of fifty feet frontage each, was executed by the defendant, Schultz, to the plaintiff, and contemporaneous therewith, the defendant, Schultz, presented to the plaintiff for execution on the same lands a mortgage to himself to secure the payment of the price of the said lands and of the balance due him for the reasonable and fair value of what he had done to the said dwelling house, which, together, he alleged to be the sum of five thousand nine hundred and twenty-six dollars, but he presented no account of items showing in what manner, or on what valuation, or how that sum was made up, and the plaintiff relying on the honesty and fairness of the defendant, Schultz, and reposing confidence in him for the reasons aforesaid, and being entirely ignorant and unacquainted with the value of said matters, executed the said mortgage.\nAnd after stating that plaintiff has been informed and believes that the mortgage has been assigned to \u201c The Manitoba and North-West Land Company (Limited) \u201c who hold the same subject to any equities, &c, and after alleging that payments have been made from time to time \u201c on account of the said indebtedness, but that the payments by the terms of the mortgage are in arrear and the said mortgage is in default,\u2019 \u2018 proceeds (paragraph 7) thus to set forth his charges on which he grounds his claim for relief; The plaintiff charges that the defendant Schultz in violation of good faith and fraudulently made up and caused to be inserted in the said mortgage a much larger sum than was the balance due on the fair and reasonable market value of the said lands, and of what he had done to the said dwelling house and other the premises, and very recently the defendant Schultz in justification of that amount to the plaintiff has asserted that the price of the lots aforesaid was eight hundred dollars each, making two thousand dollars for the land alone, whereas in truth and in fact the defendant Schultz told the plaintiff at the time of the transaction that they were only four hundred dollars each, making a difference in the land alone of one thousand dollars, of which fact the plaintiff was ignorant until a few days ago, and s:nce then the plaintiff has ma le the most careful inquiry into the residue of what must form the defendant Schultz\u2019s account, and he is informed and fully believes the charges for what the defendant Schultz did towards the construction of the said dwelling house is by its excess in estimate fraudulent, and that to require the plaintiff to pay the same, without investigation, would be contrary to justice and good conscience, the excess in these respects in the particulars thereof the plaintiff is unable to state with particularity having never seen or been furnished with an account or any particulars thereof.\nThe Bill then alleges that:\nThe plaintiff has demanded from the defendant Schultz, an account of the items which make up the amount inserted in the said mortgage, but the said Schultz has not furnished the plaintiff with the same, or offered any excuse for failing to do so, and the plaintiff submits that under the facts aforesaid he is entitled to have an account taken of what is the indebtedness now due for principal and interest so secured by the said mortgage as aforesaid, and that if any of the said indebtedness shall appear to be outstanding and unpaid, then upon payment by the plaintiff into this honorable court to the credit of this cause of what shall, on the taking of such account, be found due, the defendants may be decreed to discharge the said lands covered by the said mortgage from the said mortgage, free from all incumbrances done by them or either of them, and deliver up to the plaintiff the said mortgage and all deeds of assignment thereof and writings relating thereto, and the plaintiff prays\n(1). That the defendants may be ordered to make a full discovery and disclosure of and concerning the matters hereinbefore stated.\n(2). That an account may be ordered to be taken of what was the real indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant Schultz at the date of the said mortgage, and of what is now due thereon for balance of principal and interest.\n(3). That upon payment of the balance so found due for principal and interest, if any, into court to the credit of this cause the defendant may be ordered to discharge the said mortgage and deliver up the same with all deeds and writings relating thereto to the plaintiff.\n(4). That the defendant Schultz may be ordered to pay the costs of this suit.\n(5). That the plaintiff may have such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require.\nNow, what does all this amount to, but that plaintiff and defendant, being on terms of friendship and intimacy, the one agreed to buy and the other agreed to sell certain properties, that is to say, as to the unfinished house, for \u201cthe fair and reasonable value of the work then done and the materials then on hand in respect of the said dwelling house,\u201d and as to the land, \u201cthe fair and reasonable value of the land to be taken there with.\u201d\nThat shortly after this arrangement was entered into, it was consummated by defendant giving plaintiff a deed of the property, and plaintiff giving defendant a mortgage to secure the payment of the balance due him therefor, which was alleged by defendant to be $5,926, which amount the plaintiff accepted as the fair and reasonable value by executing and delivering to defendant a mortgage for that amount. No account of items (as the bill alleges) showing in what manner or on what valuation, or how that sum was made up, was presented, nor requested by plaintiff, nor does any information appear to have been sought by him from defendant as to how that amount was arrived at, or in reference thereto ; on the contrary, the bill says, that the plaintiff relying, not on any false or fraudulent representation made by defendant to him, whereby he was deceived and fraudulently induced to sign the mortgage, but, relying on the honesty and fairness of the defendant Schultz, and reposing confidence in him for the reasons aforesaid (viz., the intimate and friendly terms existing between them) and being entirely ignorant and unacquainted with the value of such matters, executed the said mortgage.\nNow, it is too clear to admit of a moment\u2019s argument, that this, as set forth in the bill, was an ordinary business transaction of bargain and sale between parties dealing upon equal terms, that there was between this Chief Justice and this Member of Parliament no peculiar financial, fiduciary or other relationship or confidence recognized by law as imposing special duties or obligations. There was no confidence existing that enabled the defendant to exert influence over the plaintiff, no relation existed which put the plaintiff in the power of the defendant; there was not, in other words, the existence between them of any relationship which withdrew the contract between them from the considerations affecting contracts between strangers, or to adopt language used in course of the argument in Pike v. Vigers ([23]),\nThe present is a case in which the parties stand in no situation of confidence ; a case in which the law imposes no duty or obligation ; a case, in which the law, so far from imposing mutual duties, places by its maxims the parties at arm\u2019s length, telling each they are to act upon their own judgment, and to exercise their own power of enquiry.\nThe price then to be paid being, as alleged in the bill, the fair and reasonable value, this was in every sense of the term purely a matter of opinion, and as to which the means of information were equally open to both parties, each could make enquiries, each could get estimates, each could have had the property valued; in fact each could have done what I think it may be presumed every prudent reasonable man would have done before either selling or buying a property, viz: satisfy his own judgment that in the one case as vendor he was not selling his property below its value, or in the other as purchaser, that he was not paying more for the property than its value, unless indeed in an exceptional case, either might think it for his interest to do one or the other.\nThe only breach set out is that defendant in violation of good faith fraudulently made up and inserted in the mortgage a much larger sum than was the balance due on the fair and reasonable market value of said lands, and of what he had done to the said dwelling house and other premises, and the only allegation of misrepresentation, if misrepresentation it can be called, is that \u201c very recently Schultz (defendant), in justification of that amount (amount in mortgage), has asserted that the price of the lots aforesaid was $800 each, making $2,000 for the land alone, whereas in truth and in fact defendant told plaintiff at the time of the transaction that they were only $400 each, making, a difference in the land alone of $1,000, of which fact the plaintiff was ignorant until a few days ago,\u201d and then simply alleges as the grounds of his charge \u201c that defendant falsely and fraudulently caused to be inserted in the mortgage a much larger sum than was the balance due on the fair and reasonable market value of the said lands, and of what he had done to the said dwelling house,\u201d and that he is informed and believes the charges for what defendant did towards the construction of the dwelling house is by its excess in estimate fraudulent, and that to require plaintiff to pay same without investigation, would be contrary to justice and good conscience.\u201d\nThe fair and reasonable market value was matter of opinion as to which each party had a perfect right to put forward their own view, and which, when agreed on by both parties and inserted in the deed and mortgage, was, as between the vendor and purchaser, the fair value; supposing defendant did assert as alleged, and did, in the course of the negotiations, tell plaintiff the value of the lots was only $400, how can that possibly affect the case ? It was plaintiff\u2019s duty to have ascertained what the fair value was and to have seen that no more than the fair value was inserted in the mortgage before executing it; and as to what defendant may have expended, under the contract set out in the bill, it matters not, the then fair market value of the building according to the bill was to be the price. But the bill simply says that he is informed that charges for what defendant had done to the house were, by their excess, fraudulent, and that to pay the sum without investigation, would be contrary to justice, which simply amounts to this : having chosen to assent to this amount as the fair value without investigation, but having, years after, heard that it is in excess of such value, he has desired an investigation ; but as to excess in estimate the bill says there was no account, and the contract as set out was based on no estimate but on the fair value, so that I think it may be safely affirmed that on this record, in this bill, there is no allegation of any false and fraudulent representation, misrepresentation or concealment, on which the contract was founded on the part of the defendant, establishing any ground for rescinding or altering the contract as indicated by the deed and mortgage, still less to justify any court in making an entirely new contract, even if this court had power to do so, which it clearly has not; nor is there any allegation of any undertaking, obligation or duty unperformed on the part of the defendant, nor any allegation whatever that I can discover, which the defendant was bound to answer.\nSupposing, however, that this bill is not demurrable, and that we ought to look at the evidence and so from it establish a case against defendant, we are met at the outset with the fact that the whole case, as set out in the bill, is departed from, and the claim put forward on the trial is based on a contract entirely different from that set out in the bill, instead of a contract, the consideration of which was to be the fair and reasonable value of the improvements and of the land. The plaintiff\u2019 says in his evidence that \u201cthe arrangement which amounts to a contract, was simply a very fair and reasonable proposition that I should have the place at the value of the work and material, and that I should pay him $400 a lot.\u201d Then again we have it put forward that the price of the improvements was to be the actual amount expended by defendant, and that that was to be and was established by defendant and Corbett, and that defendant misrepresented the amount, or falsely represented that the amount had been established by himself and Corbett, when such was hot the case, and that in signing the mortgage plaintiff relied on the honesty of defendant and Corbett, and on plaintiff\u2019s representation, and that as to the land, the price was not its fair and reasonable value, but was absolutely fixed at $400 a lot. On the contrary, while the bill alleges no misrepresentation or concealment, it sets out that no account of items showing in what manner or on what valuation or how that sum was made up, was presented by defendant, and as to the land no such contract as an absolute sale for $400 a lot. Surely the plaintiff should riot have been permitted to depart from his bill, and defendant condemned on a case and on evidence of which the bill gave him no notice, and which he was never called on to answer. But supposing it possible that plaintiff could have a right thus to change his base, it seems to me, the evidence on the new base entirely fails to establish a right to the relief claimed, if it was true that plaintiff signed the deeds on the representation that Corbett had been a party to the establishment of the fair value of the improvements. Six weeks after, plaintiff had, if his statement is correct, undeniable evidence from the mouth of Corbett himself that such was not the case, and surely this was the time at which he should have complained and sought redress, if he thought he had been imposed on or wronged ; but his conduct indicates the exact opposite of any such idea, asking no explanation and uttering no complaint or remonstrance whatever from that time till the 27th June, 1875, when, instead of complaining, he writes plaintiff:\nMEMO. FOR DR. SCHULTZ.\nI am trying to make arrangements in Ontario to meet the first payment and hope to succeed, but may not. I need not say, contrary to my expectation, I can only make out with difficulty to pay debts incurred on the building and live. What discount will you make on the whole mortgage, for cash down ? As money is needed in Manitoba, it should be considerable.\nE. B. WOOD.\nJune 27th, 1875.\nAnd plaintiff again writes:\nWinnipeg, 31st July, 1876.\nDEAR DOCTOR,\u2014At your request, I repeat the substance of my private note to you of some days ago, which, by-the-way, I have no objection you should show Mr. Macarthur.\nSince writing that note, and after conversation with you, I have thought over the whole matter again and again. In fact, it has seldom been from my mind. I really do not see how I can, in so far as I am concerned, with a reasonable hope of carrying it out, change or modify what I in that note proposed. But what I there proposed, I think I can carry out, and I will do my best to accomplish it. Angels can do no more. My proposition was to enter into an arrangement to pay $100, to be taken out of my salary every month until the mortgage is paid. The principal outstanding to bear interest at 8 per cent. To secure this I would give an irrevocable power of attorney so to draw and apply the $100. First payment to be made on the 1st of September. Or I would leave the premises and surrender them to you at once, your paying what any disinterested person or persons might say, under all the circumstances, was fair and right.\nMr. Macarthur will from this understand what this asset is, and in any arrangement or calculation lie may make with you, he may count upon my being ready to enter into the necessary writings giving effect to my proposition in either form.\nMost sincerely yours,\nE.

Schultz of the second part, and Duncan Macarthur of the third-part: Whereas, the said Schultz is the mortgagee, and the said Wood is the mortgagor of certain premises in the city of Winnipeg, whereby by a certain mortgage, dated on or about the fourth day of August, 1874, the said Wood covenanted to pay the said Schultz $5,926 and interest on the outstanding principal at twelve per cent, per annum at the time and in the manner therein mentioned, which said mortgage is registered in the registry office for the county of Selkirk, on or about the fourteenth day of August, 1874, at 12,10 o\u2019clock in the afternoon; and whereas, the said Wood has made default in the payment of said mortgage, and the said Schultz has assigned the said mortgage, to the said Macarthur, who now holds the same ; and whereas, it has been agreed by the parties hereto, that for and notwithstanding anything in the said mortgage contained, the said Wood shall pay the same, and the same shall bear interest as follows : One hundred dollars to be taken out of the salary of the said Wood every month until the said mortgage is paid, the principal outstanding to bear interest at eight per cent, per annum, instead of twelve per cent, per annum, as provided in said mortgage, and to secure such payment the said Wood agrees to give an irrevocable power of attorney to the said Macarthur, to draw and apply the said one hundred dollars per month out of his salary as Chief Justice of Manitoba, the first payment to be made on the first day of October, 1876. Now, therefore, this indenture witnesseth, that for and in consideration of the premises it is mutually and irrevocably agreed by and between the parties to these presents, their respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, as follows: The said Wood shall pay to the said Macarthur one hundred dollars per month, to be taken out of the salary of the said Wood, payable to him as Chief Justice of Manitoba until the said mortgage is paid,\u2014the principal of the said mortgage outstanding to bear and be computed at eight per cent, per annum instead of twelve per cent, per annum, as provided in said mortgage.\nThe said payment of one hundred dollars to be made on or before the first day of every month.\n2. The said Wood shall forthwith give and execute to the said Macarthur an irrevocable power of attorney to draw out of the said salary of said Wood the said sum of one hundred dollars per month, in the manner aforesaid, to be applied on the said mortgage as aforesaid.\n3. When and as soon as the said mortgage is paid in the manner aforesaid, the said Schultz and Macarthur shall discharge the said mortgage according to law. In witness whereof the said parties to these presents have hereunto set their hands and\u2019 seals the day and year first above written.\n(Signed), E. B. WOOD, [S.]\n(Signed), J. C. SCHULTZ, [S.]\n(Signed), D. MACARTHUR, [S.]\nOn the same day plaintiff executed a power of attorney in these words :\u2014\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY _ WOOD TO MACARTHUR.\nKnow all men by these presents, that I, Edmund Burke Wood, of the city of Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba, the Chief Justice of Manitoba, constituted and appointed, and by these presents do nominate, constitute and appoint Duncan Macarthur, of the said city of Winnipeg, the agent and manager of the Merchant\u2019s Bank of Canada at Winnipeg aforesaid, my true and lawful attorney, irrevocable for me and in my name, place and stead, to demand, take and receive one hundred dollars every month from the Receiver General of Canada, and from and out of the salary payable to me by Canada as Chief Justice of Manitoba, and to apply the same on a certain mortgage, of which the said Duncan Macarthur is assignee, made by me to one John Christian Schultz, and mentioned in a memorandum of agreement this day made between myself and the said John C. Schultz and Duncan Macarthur, until the said mortgage according to the terms of the said agreement is fully paid and satisfied.\nIn witness whereof, I, the said Edmund Burke Wood, have hereunto set my hand and seal this nineteenth day of September, 1876.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\n(Signed) E B. WOOD. [S]\n(Signed) C. B. Daly. )\nThus giving an entirely different character to the whole transaction, and this agreement was made, as we shall see, by his letter of 22nd November, 1879 : \u201c Notwithstanding I was satisfied the mortgage was for double the sum it should be,\u201d and he adds, whatever his convictions were on this point, he \u201c intended to carry it out faithfully.\u201d And on 2nd December, 1879, plaintiff wrote to the party representing the holders of the mortgage, as follows: Winnipeg, 2nd Dec, 1879.\nG. A. Muttlebury, Esq.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Enclosed find cheque for $100 payment on account of the Schultz\u2013Macarthur mortgage.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) E. B. WOOD.\nPlaintiff also says :\nAfter the defendant had transferred the mortgage to the loan society, or about that time, he wrote me a note asking for the payment of some arrears under the arrangement made in the assignment to Macarthur, and was rather pressing. The note was in pressing terms. In reply I wrote him on the 22nd November, 1879:\nWinnipeg, Saturday,\nNov. 22, 1879.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014As I presume you know, I was not at home yesterday, but was absent holding the court at White Horse Plains.\nYour note came in my absence, and it was handed me on my return in the evening.\nI must say its contents surprise me. I made an arrangement with you and Mr Macarthur in good faith, supposing he alone was the person to whom I was responsible, notwithstanding I was satisfied the mortgage was for double the sum it should be. Whatever may have been my convictions on this point\u2014a matter even now susceptible of demonstration\u2014I intended to carry it out faithfully, but it seems circumstances have prevented me.\nI mentioned in this connection that I hoped to be able to overtake the arrears. You told me not to think of it.\nIt seems now you have thought fit to assign this mortgage to some company of which one Muttlebury is manager. To this, of course, I could have no objection ; but I did object to giving a new mortgage for the sum claimed, as under the terms of the arrangement I made with you and Mr. Macarthur, it was simply monstrous\u2014quite in keeping with the making up of the original sum.\nIf my refusal to give anew mortgage for such a sum as he said you claimed has occasioned your note, so unlike the tenor of your conversation, I have only to say, I regret it.\nI shall pay no insurance in the past or for the future. I shall pay only eight per cent, on the principal from the date of the mortgage; but I shall endeavor to overtake the arrears as speedily as I can.\nIf this will not suit you, I have but one course to pursue, and that is to surrender up to you your property.\nThe land was valued at $800, your building charges were $5,126; making the mortgage $5,926. I paid in building, etc., upwards of $5,000.\nI propose, in giving the property up, you should give me what, under the circumstances, is fair. If on this score, there should be any difficulty, it can be arranged by arbitration. If it should be thought I am not entitled to anything, so be it. I shall at all events be freed from a most disagreeable and humiliating position.\nI speak plainly, as I always do when I have anything to say. I think I am understood.\nBefore you leave be good enough to let me know distinctly what you claim as a balance on the mortgage, bearing in mind what I have said about rate of interest and insurance ; also your views on the other parts of this note.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) E. B. WOOD.\nDr. SCHULTZ,\nWinnipeg.\nTherefore, it is obvious that plaintiff had notice that Corbett had taken no part in making up any estimate, long before he drew up with his own hands the new arrangement, by which he secured such a modification of the original agreement as not only extended the time of payment, but reduced 33\u2153 the rate of interest, that is, from 12 to 8 per cent. Surely, having obtained knowledge of all of which he now complains, if he wished to take advantage of any misrepresentation as to Corbett, he should not have drawn up and signed the new contract and induced plaintiff to accept it in lieu of the original.\nLord Brougham, in Irvine v. Kirkpatrick ([24]), says:\nIn order that the misrepresentation or the concealment, I care not which, may be of any avail whatever, it must be to the dolus clarus locum contractui, it must inure to the date of the contract. If one party misrepresents or conceals, however fraudulently, however wrongly, and however wickedly to another, with whom he is treating, and if that other, notwithstanding the misrepresentation, discovers the truth, notwithstanding the concealment gets at the fact concealed, before he signs the contract, the misrepresentation and the concealment go for just absolutely nothing, because it must be dolus clarus locum contractui. It is of no avail if the party has, in whatever way, become acquainted with the truth at the time.\nThe Master of the Rolls in Marquis of Clanricarde v. Henning (1):\nUntil the fraud is discovered, the term does not operate; but the fraud is considered to be discovered at the time when such reasonable notice of what has happened has been given to the person injured, as to make it his duty if he intends to seek redress, to make inquiry, and to ascertain the circumstances of the case.\nCampbell v. Fleming (2) establishes:\nIf a party induced to purchase an article by fraudulent misrepresentations of the title respecting it, and after discovering the fraud, continue to deal with the article as his own, he cannot recover back the money from the seller.\nPer Lord Denman\u201d GJ., Littledale, J., and Patteson, J., the right to repudiate the contract is not afterwards revived by the discovery of another incident in the same fraud.\nLittledale, J.:\nIt seems to me that this non-suit was right. No doubt there was, at the first, a gross fraud on the plaintiff. But after he had learned that an imposition had been practiced on him, he ought to have made his stand. Instead of doing so, he goes on dealing with the shares; and, in fact, disposes of some of them. Supposing him not to have had, at that time, so full a knowledge of the fraud as he afterwards obtained, he had given up his right of objection by dealing with the property after he had once discovered that he had been imposed upon.\nParke, J.:\nI am entirely of the same opinion. After the plaintiff, knowing of the fraud, had elected to treat the transaction as a contract, he had lost his right of rescinding it; and the fraud could do no more than entitle him to rescind.\nPatteson, J.:\nNo contract can arise out of a fraud; and an action brought upon a supposed contract, which is shown to have arisen from fraud, may be resisted. In this case the plaintiff has paid the money, and now demands it back on the ground of the money having been paid on a void transaction. To entitle him to do so he should, at the time of discovering the fraud, have elected to repudiate the whole transaction. Instead of doing so, he deals with that for which he now says that he never legally contracted. Long after this, as he alleges, he discovers a new incident in the fraud. This can only be considered as strengthening the evidence of the original fraud ; and it cannot revive the right of repudiation which has been once waived.\nLord Denman, C J.:\nI acted upon the principle which has been so clearly put by the rest of the court. There is no authority for saying that a party must know all the incidents of a fraud before he deprives himself of the right of rescinding.\nThen as to the lands, in letter of the 22nd November, 1879, he says: \u201c The land was valued at $800, your building charges were $5,126, making the mortgage $5,926.\u201d\nIn reply to this, defendant, on 22nd November, 1879, writes plaintiff, and inter alia, says :\nThe $5,926 for which you gave the mortgage was made up, you say, of land, $800, and the building charges, $5,126. Your memory is faulty in this. The land was to be $800 per lot, the lots being four of the present ones, or 50 feet front each. You got two and a-half of these or ten (?) of the present, and the land came to twice and a-half as much as you state it.\nIt was this statement, the plaintiff gives us to understand, was what induced him to institute the present suit. Now, it is obvious, from his own showing, if the statement in his letter is correct, that the amount of the mortgage, $5,926, was not made up of the land valued at $800 and the building charges at $5,126; his idea that he was only to pay $400 a lot, being $1,000 for o two and a-half lots, must be wrong, because a month before the mortgage was executed, according to his own statement, he \u201c gave Schultz a cheque for what (he says) I supposed to be the land I wanted for $500 on the Merchants\u2019 bank here. Have the cheque endorsed by Schultz, It seems it was not dated, but that it was filled in by the bank when deposited by Schultz, and that was the 7th July. I produce the cheque.\u201d\nPaid 7. July.\nNo__\nWinnipeg\u2014\u2014\u2014\u20141874.\nManitoba,\nTo the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada,\nPay to John C. Schultz or order Five Hundred Dollars.\n$500\nE. B. WOOD.\n(Endorsed) John Schultz.\nTherefore, by his own showing he was to pay $1,300, $500 by the cheque and $800 included in the mortgage, a state of facts entirely inconsistent with his present contention. This shows how loose and unsatisfactory and wholly irreconcilable is his bill with his evidence, and both with the claim now put forward. Taking the whole case together the difficulty would seem to me to have arisen in plaintiff\u2019s mind, in respect to the land, rather to the quantity taken being more than he originally contemplated, than to a misunderstanding as to the price.\nWhen a party comes before a court to seek to set aside a deed duly and solemnly executed, and to have substituted therefor another, and a different contract, the case he puts forward should be clearly and distinctly stated and should show, if sustained by evidence, undoubted right to the relief claimed, and to support such a claim and justify a court in ignoring a solemn instrument, and rescinding a contract under seal and substituting another therefor, the evidence should be unequivocal and conclusive, for no court would rescind a contract without the clearest proof of the fraudulent misrepresentations, and that they were made under such circumstances as to show that the contract was founded upon them. Lord Justice Turner, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Osborne v. Eccles ([25]), says: A court of equity ought not, as we think, to interfere with a legal right upon the assertion of a mere doubtful equity. It ought, we think, before it interferes in such a case to be satisfied that there is an equity calling for its interference as clear as the legal right which it is called upon to control.\nNo attempt is made to repudiate this mortgage until the 16th December, 1879\u2014five years and four months after its date, and three years and two months after an entirely new arrangement had been entered into, whereby plaintiff sought and obtained such, to him, favorable modifications of the original terms, both as to the mode of payment and rate of interest. To rescind this mortgage on such meagre and unsatisfactory evidence as has been produced, would, in my opinion, be nothing less than a perversion of law and justice.\nIt is a delusion on the part of the plaintiff to suppose that any relationship or confidence existed between himself and the defendant which the policy of the law specially protects, or to justify him in assuming, as he does in his evidence, that they were not acting in this matter as vendor and purchaser at arms\u2019 length, each bound to look after his own interests, failing to do so, neither having any claims to invoke the interposition of a court of equity.\nIt may be that the land was over-valued, and, in the opinion of the witnesses called by the plaintiff, it no doubt was, but its value was mere matter of opinion ; if so, can the plaintiff blame any person but himself ? Called upon to settle the business, lest, as he says, death should intervene, he names his own son to draw up the papers, accepts the amount inserted, if his statement is correct, without inquiry, without discussion, where the materials were at hand and information could be had for the asking, apparently making not the slightest attempt to obtain any materials whatever to enable him to form even an approximated estimate or opinion of the correctness of the indebtedness he was about to assume, if the bargain he has made is a bad one could he reasonably expect it to be otherwise ? It is not easy to understand how a man who describes himself as \u201c entirely ignorant and unacquainted with the value of such matters \u201c should undertake (without assistance from persons acting in his interest, or at any rate from disinterested parties) the negotiating and concluding such a large purchase, or that he should accept from his vendor an amount as the value of the property without having even the curiosity to ask how that amount was made up or on what it was based. If parties will so act and not attempt to protect themselves when they can so easily do so, it is impossible for courts to relieve them from the effect of their own negligence, recklessness or folly. Is it possible that a man, who has been engaged in the active business of life for any length of time, can be ignorant of the fact that as a general rule sellers put a high estimate on the value of their estates, and can any buyer in dealing with the owner of property be so simple minded and innocent at this day as to believe that it is not the seller\u2019s aim to secure a good price, and the man who is not aware of his position towards his vendor in these respects must be a singular exception to the general run of mankind.\nIf the plaintiff has been as credulous, as confiding, as innocent, as inexperienced, or as ignorant of everything connected with the value of property as he in his evidence so prominently puts forward, or so careless, negligent and regardless of his interests as his evidence might lead some to conclude, it may be his misfortune or his fault. The law, however, provides no special protection for such cases.\nIn deciding this case in the court below, the doctrine of caveat emptor, as applicable to affirmations and representations in regard to sales of real estate, has been entirely ignored, as is the idea that it is a man\u2019s own folly not to use his own sense and discretion in matters of this sort, that it is his own folly and laches not to use the means of information within his reach, and that any loss or injury, as is said in the books in such a case, is to be attributed to his own negligence and indiscretion from which it is not the province of the courts of equity to relieve parties who neglect or refuse, to exercise a reasonable diligence and discretion.\nDefendant in his evidence says :\nThe building was there and the material, and I could have inquired what the cost would be.\nIn Pike v. Tigers ([26]), the Lord Chancellor says :\nNow the very able counsel for the defendant felt that they could not press for a reference to the master to inquire into the fair value. If I had directed such an inquiry, it would have been a false issue; it would have implied that a report of inadequate value would have justified an inference of fraud. But mere inadequacy of value, even in a case capable of an exact measure, in an ascertained subject, would not justify such an inference. The principles (unless in extravagant cases, which are to be judged of rather by uplifted hands and exclamations of astonishment at the disproportion between price and value) are well established as applicable to cases at law, and equally so, where the contracts have been executed, to cases in equity 5 but I cannot better illustrate the doctrine as applicable to the principles of a court of equity, than by reference to the observations of Lord Lyndhurst in the case of Small v. Attwood (2), when the case came before him in the Court of Exchequer. He there says: \u201c I have seen so much of its flexible character, and of its means of adapting itself to the interest of the party on whose behalf the evidence is given, that I confess I place very little reliance on evidence of this nature. But if it were otherwise, and I was compelled to decide between the evidence, I should come to the conclusion that the value of the mine is greatly indeed below the sum that was Stipulated to be given for it, namely, \u00a3600,000., But that alone is not a ground on which the contract could be set aside, although it is some evidence to show that the representations made with respect to the productive power and character of the mine were fallacious.\u201d\nIn Walker v. Symonds (3) there was concealment by the defendant of a material fact; and that, too, accompanied by their having given information, but not the whole information. The information they gave was true, that Donnithorne had been guilty of a breach of trust, but it was imperfect, inasmuch as the fact, that they themselves had been guilty of a breach of trust, was concealed ; and yet there, though the plaintiff was helpless and without the advice of any friend, and under the influence of a hard pressure from her father, and her whole fortune was involved in it, it was held that the imperfect ness of the communication did not constitute fraud 5 and Lord Eldon rested his judgment on the character of the defendants as trustees, and the duty of trustees, as I have already stated. That case, therefore, as far as the question of concealment or imperfect information is concerned, is rather an authority for the plaintiff here ; for Lord Eldon expressly negatives the inference of fraud arising from the imperfection of the information, and rests his decree solely on the confidential relation of the parties. Here Lord Audley stood in the situation of the vendor, desirous of getting the best price he could for his property, and the vendee in the ordinary situation of purchasers, anxious to give the lowest price that the vendor may be prevailed on to take. What are the respective rights and duties of parties so circumstanced ? If, on either part, they enter into covenants, they are bound by them to that extent and no further. The vendor is at liberty to state, in the strongest terms, his opinion of the high value of the thing to be sold, and the purchaser to state equally the opinion of the worthlessness of it. If the vendor is so giddy as to trust to these representations, and to sell his property at a gross undervalue, and executes a deed for the purpose, and hands over the possession to the purchaser, he has no claim either at law or in equity to be restored to his former rights 5 neither has the purchaser, if the price is excessive, any ground to be relieved from his bargain, or to be compensated for his loss. If the purchasers had been in possession of important facts, calculated to increase the value of the mine, they would not have been bound to disclose them nor could Lord Audley, on the subsequent discovery of such increased value, have any ground to be relieved from his contract.\nAs to misrepresentation Story says ([27]):\nIt must not be of a mere matter of opinion equally open to both parties for examination and inquiry, when neither party is presumed to trust to the other, but to rely on his own judgment.\nAnd again: But ordinary matters of opinion between parties dealing upon equal terms though falsely stated are not relieved against because they are not presumed to mislead or influence the other party where each has equal means of information. Thus a false opinion expressed intentionally by the buyer to the seller of the value of the property offered for sale, whose there is no special confidence, or relation, or influence between the parties and each meets the other on equal grounds, relying on his own judgment, is not sufficient to avoid a contract of sale ; in such a case the maxim seems to apply scientia enim utrinque par pares contrahentes facit.\nAnd again, sec. 195 :\nNor is it every wilful misrepresentation even of a fact which will avoid a contract upon the ground of fraud, if it be of such a nature that the other party had no right to place reliance on it and it was his own folly to give credence to it, for courts of equity like courts of law do not aid parties who will not use their own sense and discretion upon matters of this sort.\nAgain, as to false and fraudulent representations on a treaty of sale of property such as would induce a court of equity to rescind the contract entered into upon such treaty, Mr. Story says :\nBut then in all such cases the court will not rescind the contract without the clearest proof of the fraudulent misrepresentations and that they were made under such circumstances as show that the contract was founded upon them.\nAnd continuing, sec. 200 :\nOn the other hand, if the purchaser choosing to judge for himself does not avail himself of the knowledge open to him or his agent he cannot be heard to say that he was deceived by the vendor\u2019s misrepresentations, for the rule is caveat emptor. It is his own folly and laches not to use the means of knowledge within his reach, and he may properly impute any loss or injury in such a case to his own negligence and indiscretion, Courts of equity do not sit for the purpose of relieving parties under ordinary circumstances who refuse to exercise a reasonable diligence or discretion.\nFrom Attwood v. Small (1), the same principle is clearly deducible.\nIn Sugden on Vendors:\nOur law adopts the rule of the civil Taw simplex commendation non obligat. If the seller merely made use of those expressions which are usual to sellers who praise at random the goods which they are desirous to sell, the buyer could not procure the sale to be dissolved ; an action of deceit cannot be maintained against a vendor for having falsely affirmed that a person bid a particular sum for the estate, although the purchaser was thereby induced to purchase it and was deceived in the value * * * Neither can a purchaser obtain any relief against a vendor for false affirmation of value, for value consists in judgment and estimation in which many men differ.\nIn Duke of Beaufort v. Nellds ([28]) Lord Campbell says :\nEquity will not interfere in favor of a man who wilfully was ignorant of that which he ought to have known, a man, who without exercising that diligence which the law would expect of a reasonable and careful person, committed a mistake in consequence of which alone the proceedings in court have arisen.\nIt is said American cases carry the doctrine still further as to representations, and further than is warranted by our law. The doctrine as held in the American courts will be found in Medbury v. Watson ([29]), before Chief Justice Shaw, and three other judges. This case was followed by Hemmer v. Cooper ([30]).\nIf I have not referred at all to the defendant\u2019s answer, parts of which were read by plaintiff, and which entirely and unequivocally contradicts the whole case as put forward by plaintiff in his evidence, but agrees with the case put forward in the bill in stating that the sale was for the fair value of the building and improvements and land, and explains the whole transaction and denies and rebuts all pretention of fraud on the defendant\u2019s part, claimed by plaintiff, it is not because I am not keenly alive to the very obvious result that would naturally flow from allowing a party to break down or reform his own solemn deed, under seal, and free himself from the obligations he has thereby imposed on himself on his own uncorroborated verbal testimony, directly, positively and unequivocally contradicted by his opponent, who claims, under such an instrument, viz. ; to place in jeopardy, if not to destroy, all security in written, sealed instruments, but because I am of opinion that the plaintiffs bill sets out no case entitling plaintiff to any relief, and that his evidence, even assuming he should have been permitted to have gone into a case not put forward in his bill, makes out no sufficient case for re-opening the transaction, either as to the land or the improvements. But when this is taken in connection with the fact of plaintiff\u2019s uncorroborated evidence being directly contradicted by the oath of the defendant, how can be expect to obtain a decree, for the plaintiff declares in the strongest possible language that defendant\u2019s statements are false, it is only the plaintiffs oath against the defendant\u2019s.\nIn Grant v. Grant ([31]) the Master of the Bolls says:\nIn the first place there is a rule constantly acted on in Chambers in Equity, that the unsupported testimony of any person on his own behalf cannot be safely acted on. * * * The court cannot act on the mere unsupported testimony of a claimant. * * * In this case I could not act on the uncorroborated testimony of the wife, the alleged donor.\nIn East India Company v. Donald ([32]) Lord Eldon says:\nIf relief is prayed, the rule is laid down here (and it is much too late now to discuss the principle of it) that if there is nothing more than positive assertion, unqualified in the terms of it, by one witness, and a positive denial by the defendant, the plaintiff shall not have a decree, and this court giving relief beyond the law will not give it on such terms, and that has been laid down and acted upon.\nLord Eldon in Evans v. Bicknell ([33]) says:\nA defendant in this court has the protection arising from his own conscience in a degree, in which the law does not effect to give him protection. If he positively, plainly and precisely denies the assertion, and one witness only proves it as positively, clearly and precisely, as it is denied, and there is no circumstance attaching credit to the assertion over-balancing the credit due to the denial, as a positive denial, a court of equity will not act upon the testimony of that witness, The Master of the Rolls in Pilling v. Armitage (1) says :\nAs far as the testimony of one witness can go, this witness distinctly proves all the allegations of the bill as to the agreement. But it is objected that this is but the evidence of one witness ; and the agreement is denied by the answer, and, therefore, according to the established rule of the court, a decree cannot obtained.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nWith two exceptions I concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice. I am not able, however, to agree that the rule which formerly prevailed in courts of equity requiring two witnesses to outweigh a positive denial of the defendant in his answer is in force where the evidence is taken, as it is under the practice existing in Manitoba, viva voce in open court. Further, I am of opinion that misrepresentation by a vendor as to the price which he himself paid for the property, which is the subject of the contract of sale, invalidates the contract. There are, I am aware, American authorities to the contrary, but the case of Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd (2) is, I think, conclusive the other way. I have nothing further to add, for in all other respects my opinion accords with that just pronounced by the Chief Justice.\nFOUENIER, J. :\u2014\nWas also of opinion that the case ought not to have been proceeded with in the absence of appellant, and without allowing him the opportunity of giving his evidence.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThe respondent, who is the plaintiff in this suit, alleges substantially that the appellant in July, 1874, sold him a lot of land at Winnipeg, together with a house in course of construction upon it, and some materials provided on the ground for it. That the respondent was, by a parol agreement entered into between them, to pay the appellant the fair and reasonable value of the work then done to the house, and of certain materials which he provided for it, and also the fair and reasonable value of the land to be taken therewith. That in August (about six weeks afterwards) the appellant requested that the negotiations for the property should be completed by written documents, to which the respondent agreed. It was agreed further that the appellant should convey the land to the respondent in fee simple, and that the respondent should give a mortgage on the property to the appellant for the balance due, after deducting a payment of $500, for which the respondent had given the appellant a cheque on the Merchant\u2019s Bank, and which was paid to the appellant on the 7th July previous. At the suggestion of the respondent, his son was selected to make out the deed and mortgage, and the amount of the consideration in both to be furnished by the appellant.\nThe respondent alleges that the deed and mortgage were brought to him by his son, and that trusting to the good fath he had in the appellant, he executed the mortgage, believing that the amount of the consideration had been correctly stated in it. That, at the time, he thought the amount high, but nevertheless executed the mortgage, trusting in the correctness of the amount furnished by the appellant. That, previous thereto, he had never in any way ascertained what the correct amount should have been; o nor had he got from the appellant or otherwise any statement of the amount he had expended towards the erection of the house, nor had he any means of knowing what proportion of the consideration money was made up for the house, or what amount was included for the land. That some short time thereafter, from information received from the appellant\u2019s foreman Corbett, he became suspicious that all was not right, and that he had been overcharged, but that until very shortly before the commencement of the suit he had nothing sufficiently definite to enable him to seek legal redress. That until the receipt of a letter from the appellant, dated the 22nd November, 18*79, he never knew or had reason to suspect that the consideration of the mortgage covered more than $1,000 for the land, but when he found by that letter that he had been charged $2,000, he felt that he had been charged at least double what he should have been.\nThe answer to the respondent\u2019s bill admits the original contract as stated in it\u2014denies anything like fraud, misrepresentation, concealment, error or mistake on the part of the appellant as to the amount he caused to be inserted as the consideration money of the mortgage, it denies the allegations contained in the seventh clause of the bill amongst which is a statement that the lots (two and a-half) were not worth more or to have been higher in price than at the rate of four hundred dollars each, hut that, on the contrary, the land was to be two thousand dollars, or at the rate of $800 each lot; and that the appellant based the estimate of that value \u201c on the selling value of such land.\u201d\nIn the sixth paragraph of the answer the appellant admits the contract as stated in the bill, and that the respondent was, by it, to pay the value of the work done on the house so far as it had progressed and of the material on the ground The appellant alleges that the value of the work and materials was ascertained in the presence and with the co-operation of the respondent. When the work was being carried on. He says:\nWe had the plan in our hands to refer to and compare with what had been done on the ground in carrying it out, and by these means and by reference from time to time to the foreman and otherwise, the calculations were made and placed on sheets of paper as data on which our agreement was to be based, which papers, I believe, are now in the plaintiff\u2019s possession as he retained the same.\nThe defence rests largely on the proof of those allegations. The respondent positively denies that he had ever seen the sheets of paper alluded to before the execution of the mortgage or afterwards, or, indeed, any other statement, paper or estimate. There is no evidence outside the allegation in the answer that he did. The only witness who spoke about them was the appellant\u2019s book-keeper (Fulthorpe), who says that it was he that made them out, and says he made them \u201c from time-books and other data in the office at the time.\u201d In his direct testimony, he says :\nI was told to make them out for the Chief Justice, and to the best of my knowledge and belief they were given to the Chief Justice.\nIn his cross-examination, he says :\u2014\nI suppose the other account referring to the one just mentioned, was given to the Chief Justice at the time, but do not know this.\nAgain :\nI did not deliver these papers or a copy of them to the Chief Justice, and do not recollect of any one delivering them. I have no means of recollecting the circumstances at all, except the sight of these papers. I remember only that I made copies for the Chief Justice, but do not know whether he got them. The Chief Justice himself never came to me that I recollect to make any remark about these items.\nThe allegations of the respondent in his bill and his sworn statements on this point are not contradicted or affected by any evidence adduced by the appellant, and they must be taken as sustained.\nBut if the statement contained in the four sheets put in evidence (exhibit 2) just referred to was correct, and that the value of the land was really $2,000 as claimed by the appellant, the aggregate would only amount to $6,172.50, from which to deduct the $500 paid by cheque would leave a balance of, but $5,672.50 while the mortgage was taken for $5,926, or for the sum of $253.50 more than was due. By the most favorable view of the evidence on the part of the appellant the mortgage was taken for that amount in excess of what it should have been. But there are fundamental objections to the statement in question as evidence of the value of the work and materials. It was prepared merely, as I understand it, as a basis, upon, or as one of the means by, which an estimate of the value was to have been subsequently made and agreed upon. There is nothing in the evidence to connect the Work and materials stated in it with the work done and materials provided for the house. It was made by a book-keeper from data that might have been largely inaccurate. Without such connection being shown it proves nothing. The agreement was not to reimburse the amount expended, but to pay the then value of the work which might or might not have been an advantage to the appellant. If he had got some of the work done for half value he would, pro tanto, be the gainer, or, if he had paid over the value for the work or materials, he would be the loser, when the value was ascertained. At all events, we have only to give effect to the contract as we find it entered into.\nThe appellant admits that the selling value of the land was to be the criterion to fix the amount to be paid for it, and in the ninth paragraph of his answer he, as I before quoted it, says he based his estimate of $2,000 on the selling value of the land. If that was the contract it seems to be shown by nine apparently competent and disinterested witnesses that the value of the land was not over $1,000. The appellant admitting the contract was bound to show that the sum of $2,000 was the fair selling value of the land, which has not been attempted. No court or jury under the evidence would be justified in rejecting the evidence of value put on it by the evidence of so many competent witnesses, and unless other reasons can be found to deny it, the respondent is, in my opinion, entitled to have that view entertained. As far as I can see the respondent is not estopped by anything shown to have been done by him previous to the execution of the mortgage. I will hereafter consider the effect of what he did afterwards.\nAs to the contract about the house and materials, the appellant was to be paid for their value ; and when evidence of value was given by several competent witnesses of the respondent, the appellant could not expect any court to reject their sworn estimates, unless, indeed, those estimates were impeached by substantial and reliable evidence. None such was, however, given. The necessary conclusion is, therefore, that the estimates of the respondent\u2019s witnesses are reliable. One of them (Blackmore, a contractor for buildings, who had been 18 or 20 years in that business\u2014eight years of the time at Winnipeg\u2019) states the value of the work at the house and materials to be $2,351.15, for which he made a detailed written statement.\nAnother (Woods, a carpenter for 26 years, the last seven years of which he worked at his business in Winnipeg) estimates, by a detailed statement, the value of the work and materials at $2,452.69, or about $100 above the estimate of Blackmore, Corbett, the foreman, proved that he compared and verified the estimate of Blackmore in which he found one or two unimportant errors which operated both ways, but that it was substantially correct, and that he knew it to be so from his own personal knowledge of the work when being done, and of the materials on the ground. If such uncontradicted evidence is not to be entirely ignored, the value of the building and materials was not over $2,452 according to the higher of the two estimates, while it is charged at $4,426, an excess of $1,972. This may be all wrong and the estimates may be far too low, but the appellant has not impeached them, and so far they must be taken to be correct. According to the evidence on the trial, which is our only guide, the land should be $1,000, on account of which the respondent paid $500, leaving a balance due of $500. To this add the value of the building and materials $2,452, which makes due, when the mortgage was taken, $2,952. The mortgage for $5,926 would therefore be in excess of the value of the land, building and materials to the extent of $2,974. If the case were here for a final judgment, I think we, under the evidence, would be justified in deciding that the appellant should pay that amount to the respondent, or cause it to be deducted from the amount due on the mortgage, but as the question is merely one of a reference to a master we have only to ascertain whether the decree for that purpose can be sustained. The other matters of defence to the bill as set up are contained in allegations in the answer. 1st. That the respondent made payments on the mortgage, and the appellant claims that such payments are evidence of a ratification and adoption of the consideration money in the mortgage. That defence cannot, however, be available unless it be both alleged and proved that they were made after the knowledge of the respondent of the alleged fraud for which he now seeks redress. In this case there is neither such allegation or proof.\nIn the fourth paragraph of the answer an agreement is alleged to have been entered into on the 19th Sept., 1876, between the respondent, the appellant and Duncan Mac Arthur, who became the assignee of the mortgage, by which arrangements were made for the payment to MacArthur of the balance due on the mortgage. The object of setting it out does not plainly appear. There is no allegation of any knowledge by the respondent of the alleged fraud at that time, and the only object for setting it out as stated in the introductory part of the paragraph appears to have been to show the leniency of the appellant in regard to the payment due on the mortgage. In that way it is no bar to the respondent\u2019s right to an account. If a case of fraud were shown it would vitiate the mortgage, but the respondent does not seek relief in that way, but to obtain a proper account from the appellant. The mortgage being in the hands of the loan company and held as a collateral security for the appellant, the latter is the real and only party interested as a defendant in the action. Under all the circumstances hereinbefore referred to and shown by the allegations and proof of the parties, I am of opinion that as to them the decree was right.\nBut another objection was taken to it of a much more serious character. From the judge\u2019s minutes it appears that the bill herein was served on the appellant on the 20th of December, 1879, and the answer filed on the 19th of January following. The learned judge reports that \u201c at the hearing, before the merits of the case were gone into, Mr. Monkman applied on behalf of the defendant (Schultz) to have the trial put off till May or June on the ground that the defendant is absent attending to his parliamentary duties at Ottawa, and because he is in a delicate state of health. He read an affidavit from. defendant (Schultz) in support of said facts and a certificate from Dr. Grant of Ottawa.\u201d The hearing took place on the 28th of February, being about 40 days after the filing of the answer, and 18 days after the cause was at issue by the filing of the replication. The report does show when the appellant left Winnipeg for Ottawa, nor if the notice of the hearing was served before he left Winnipeg. If it were not, a reasonable continuance should have been granted. The learned judge, however, thought it unnecessary that his evidence should be heard on the merits at the hearing, and refused the motion for a continuance, and in the concluding paragraph of his judgment says, that\nIf it is thought necessary by the defence that the defendant (Schultz) should be present when the account will be taken sufficient time will be given him to come from Ottawa and appear before the master when the account will be taken.\nFrom the bill and answer and the evidence of the respondent and others at the hearing the conclusion is irresistible that, not only in respect of the matter of taking the account before the master, but also as to the main facts of the case upon which rest the respondent\u2019s claim that an account should be taken, the evidence of the appellant under the peculiar circumstances in evidence was most important; and before a decree against him to account was passed, he should have had reasonable opportunity of being heard in his defence. Absence at a great distance from the place of hearing and detention by sickness at Ottawa were legitimate and sufficient reasons for the postponement of the hearing. It would be contrary to natural justice that a man should have a judgment against him during his temporary absence when he desired to be heard and showed himself unable to be present.\nFrom the respondent\u2019s own evidence and otherwise he appears to have acted in the most careless and negligent manner as regards his own interests, and allowed a long time to elapse before taking any action towards obtaining redress. Still, if there was no express or implied ratification after knowledge of what he complains of, and no actual acquiescence, the matter of the effluxion of time short of the statutory period will not bar his remedy. I cannot find in any of his subsequent dealings or conduct, as shown by the evidence, any such ratification or acquiescence. There are cases wherein a party, to avoid a contract in toto, must, on notice or knowledge of fraud, take measures at once to avoid it, but in such cases he must remit the other party to the position he had previously occupied. Here, however, the rights and positions of the parties had materially changed at the time the respondent alleges he first discovered the fraud he complains of. His bill is not to avoid the contract but to reform the mistake or fraud as to the amount of the consideration money stated in the mortgage. He prays for adjudication as to that matter and for the necessary relief. I think the evidence shows him entitled to it, but for the objection I have last considered.\nI think the decree cannot be upheld under the circumstances and for the reasons I have stated, and that our judgment should be to allow the appeal with costs and remit back the case to the position it occupied before the hearing. At a second hearing the appellant\u2019s evidence will be heard as well as that of the respondent, and the important facts more fully investigated to the end that justice may be done between the parties.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nIn his bill the plaintiff alleges that the verbal agreement which was made between him and the defendant, and which was made in the month of June or July, 1874, was that the plaintiff should purchase the foundation and frame of the house the defendant was then erecting,1 as it then stood, and go on and finish the same at his own expense for a dwelling for himself, and should pay the defendant the fair and reasonable value of the work then done and of the material then on hand in respect of the said dwelling house, and the fair and reasonable value of the land to be taken therewith, and that in pursuance of such agreement that plaintiff went on and at his own expense completed the house. In one part of his evidence he says that on the 4th July he gave the defendant a cheque for $500, which he says was to pay for the land he required; in another that the price of the land was agreed to be $400 per lot, which for two and a-half lots taken would make the price of the land to be $1,000. In a letter dated November 22nd, 1879, addressed to the defendant, he says: \u201c the land was valued at $800, your building charges were $5,126, making the mortgage $5,926.\u201d\nNow the contract, whatever it was, remained verbal until the 12th August, 1874, when the defendant executed to the plaintiff, who accepted, a deed in fee simple of the property agreed to be sold, and executed to the defendant a mortgage on the property so conveyed, securing the payment of the sum of $5,926 with interest thereon at 12 per cent, per annum, as the amount due to the defendant for the land and building thereon with the material so agreed to be sold, and so sold and conveyed to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, in his evidence, says that at the time of the conveyance to him, and the mortgage by him being executed, he thought the amount pretty large, but that he signed the mortgage supposing it was all right. It is to be observed here that the relation then existing between the plaintiff and the defendant was that of vendor and vendee; there was no relationship of trustee and cestuique trust; nor is it alleged that the defendant by any device or contrivance prevented the plaintiff from exercising his judgment in determining what was the amount which, under the verbal agreement, should have been inserted in the mortgage. When he gave the mortgage for $5,926, that must be taken to be his own act determining the price to be paid by him, and, upon the completion of the deed to him and the execution of the mortgage by him, the contract, which had up to that time been in fieri, was wholly completed and executed ; and if the plaintiff was then willing to accept, as he says he did, the defendant\u2019s statement of the value as the amount for which the mortgage should be executed, that was his own act, and if that was imprudently done, or was not done with sufficient deliberation, the plaintiff had only himself to blame. Then two years afterwards, and after the plaintiff had, as he says in his evidence he had, discovered that he had made a bad bargain, and after he had reason to suspect, from information given to him by Corbet, that the defendant had taken, an unfair advantage of the confidence reposed in him by the plaintiff, the latter executes the agreement of the 19th September, 1876, whereby, after reciting the. mortgage, and that it bore interest at 12 per cent., he accepts a reduction of the interest to, 8 per cent., and he agreed to pay the principal secured by the mortgage, with interest at 8 per cent., by monthly instalments of $100, and he agreed to give an irrevocable power of attorney to one Duncan McArthur, assignee of the mortgage, securing such payment. The indenture witnesseth that in consideration of the premise, it is mutually arid irrevocably agreed between the parties thereto, namely, the plaintiff, the defendant and Me Arthur, as follows :\nThe said Wood shall pay, to the said McArthur $100 per month to be taken out of the salary of the said Wood, payable to him as Chief Justice of Manitoba, until the said mortgage is paid, the interest on the said mortgage to be computed at 8 per cent, per annum instead of 12 per cent., as provided in said mortgage.\nIn the above letter of the 22nd November, 1879, the plaintiff says that he made this agreement of September, 1876 \u201c notwithstanding that he was satisfied the mortgage was for double the sum it should be.\u201d Now, up to this re-affirmation of the correctness of the amount secured by the mortgage, there is no allegation of any contrivance of the defendant to prevent the plaintiff ascertaining what should have been the amount for which the mortgage should have been given in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s view of the verbal agreement; nor was there any fiduciary relation whatever existing between the plaintiff and defendant. If therefore it be true, as the plaintiff now wishes to establish, that his confidence in the defendant was misplaced when he accepted, as he says he did, his representation of the value of the premises to be inserted in the mortgage, the plaintiff has only himself to blame, and he cannot expect that any court shall now assist him to set aside the contract completed and ratified with such circumstances of formality, upon the allegation that\u2014for this is really what the equity stated by him in his bill, and his evidence amounts to\u2014he was altogether too confiding and acted very foolishly in adopting the defendant\u2019s representation of the value of his property as the amount which the plaintiff was willing to pay for it. The plaintiff has, with his eyes open, abstained from making inquiries which he might have as readily made prior to the execution of the mortgage as now, and it is not the province of a court of equity to interfere to set aside contracts completely executed, and indeed, as here, deliberately ratified and confirmed, long after (as the plaintiff alleges) his suspicions were aroused, simply because the vendee, who was not entitled to regard the vendor as in fiduciary relation with him, has placed more confidence in the statements of the vendor as to the value of the property he was selling than the vendee now finds to have been prudent.\nVigilantibus non dormientibus leges subserviunt is a maxim recognized in courts of equity as well as in courts of law, and under the circumstances of this case, as detailed by the plaintiff himself, he must abide the consequences of his own imprudence. A court of equity cannot set aside his own completed contract and make a new and more favorable one for him. I agree, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed, with costs, and the bill in the court below be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: A.

Ritchie, Kt., C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.\nLetters Patent, under Great Seal P.E.I. of foreshore in Summerside Harbor, void\u2014B.N.A. Act, sec. 108\u2014Public Harbor\u2014 25 Vic., ch. 19., P.E.I.\nG. (defendant) was in possession of a part of the foreshore of the harbor of Summerside, and had erected thereon a wharf or block at which vessels might unload. H. et al (plaintiffs) brought an action of ejectment to recover possession of the said foreshore.\nH. et al's title consisted of letters patent under the Great Seal of Prince Edward Island, dated 30th August, 1877, by which the crown in right of the island, and assuming to act in exercise of authority conferred by a provincial statute, 25 Vic., ch. 19, purported to grant to plaintiff in fee simple the land sought to be recovered in the action.\nHeld, that under sec. 108 B. N. A. Act, the soil and bed of the fore-shore in the harbor of Summerside belongs to the crown, as representing the Dominion of Canada, and therefore the grant under the great seal of P. E. Island to H. et al. is void and inoperative.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Prince Edward Island, making absolute a rule for judgment of non-suit in the cause.\nThis was an action of ejectment brought by the appellants (plaintiffs below) against the respondent (defendant below) to recover possession of a piece of land, being part of the foreshore, between high and low water mark of the town of Summerside, lying outside of and to the westward of Queen's wharf.\nThe writ was issued on the thirty-first day of August, A.D., 1877. The defendant limited his defence to that part of the premises described in the writ, situate on the western side of Queen's wharf. The cause was heard before the Chief Justice and a jury in October, 1878.\nThe appellants (plaintiffs below) claimed title to the locus under a grant to them from the crown in fee, under the Great Seal of Prince Edward Island.\nThe local statute 25 Vic. c. 19, enabled the Lieut.-Governor in Council to issue grants of certain parts of the seashore of Prince Edward Island.\nThe respondent offered no evidence of any title to the locus.\nThe jury found a verdict for the appellants (plaintiffs below) for all the lands in issue. The respondent afterwards, pursuant to leave reserved by the Chief Justice at the trial, obtained a rule nisi for a new trial or non-suit on the following, among other grounds:\u2014\n\"3. Because said grant is void on the ground that at the time it was made the plaintiffs were not in possession of the whole of the land in front of which the locus lies, part of the same being a public street, another part being in possession of I. L. Steeves, and another part in possession of Thomas Brehaut tenants of the plaintiffs.\n\"4. Because said grant is void on the ground that the locus is in front of and abuts the railway, which is vested in the Dominion of Canada, and it was admitted that no consent from the Dominion Government had been obtained.\n\"5. Because said grant is void on the ground that the locus abuts on the public wharf under the control of the corporation of Summerside and no consent was obtained from such corporation.\n\"8. Because said grant is void on the ground that by the British North America Act all public harbors are vested in Canada, and Summerside is a public harbor.\"\nThis rule nisi, after argument, was made absolute for a non-suit on tbe above 3rd, 4th and 5th grounds, and against this latter rule the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe counsel were heard at length on the several grounds taken in the rule nisi, but as the judgment of the Supreme Court proceeded entirely on the ground that the grant was void because by the British North America Act all public harbors are vested in Canada, and Summerside is a public harbor, their arguments on these points are omitted.\nMr Davies, Q.C., for appellant:\nAs to the eighth ground taken for the rule nisi that the grant is void because public harbors are vested in the Dominion of Canada by the B. N. A. Act: the public harbors which became the property of the Dominion by the 108th section of the B N. A. Act must clearly be such public harbors (if any) as the local government as such had acquired an actual property in, e g., artificial harbors constructed by the outlay of monies. This section contemplated public works of the province only, and not natural harbors in which the province had no special property. The words must be construed ejusdem generis with the class of words in the clause where they are used. This is not an artificial harbor. The only monies expended here were on the wharves by private individuals and provincial government.\nMr. Peters for respondent:\nThe wharf in question was built out of the funds of the government of Prince Edward Island, and has always been known as a government wharf. Putting aside the question that Summerside is a public harbor, and is vested in the government of Canada under sec. 108 B. N. A. Act, I contend the wharf in question is a public work and comes within the word \"piers\" mentioned in the third schedule of the act. It is not an answer to say that a pier should be built of stone. It is built on public property and advances into the harbor. Surely the Dominion parliament alone has control over public works necessary to carry on trade.\nIt is called the Queen's wharf, and was the largest wharf at Summerside until the railway wharf was built. I also contend that the whole soil of the harbor passed to the Dominion, and that the giving of grants is inconsistent with the rights of the Dominion government in the harbor. See B. N. A. Act, 1867, sec. 108, schedule 3.\nIf it is necessay for the purposes of carrying on trade that the Dominion government should have the property of artificial harbors, why should they not also have the control of natural harbors, and it cannot be denied that Summerside harbor is one of the natural harbors of the island. RITCHIE, C. J.:\nOne of the points raised, on which I think the case must turn, was that the harbor of Summerside is a public harbor and is vested in the government of Canada under the British North America Act, 1867, sec. 108 and 3rd schedule, and that the making of grants of the foreshore, or land between high and low water, by the Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island, is inconsistent with the rights of the Dominion government in the harbor, and therefore the grant under which plaintiff claims is void.\nThe locus in quo in this case is situate between high and low water mark in the harbor of Summerside, P.E.I, which is a public harbor and port for ships where customable goods may be laden and unladen. By section 108 of the B. N. A. Act, 1867, headed: \"Transfer of property in schedule,\" the provincial public works and property enumerated in the third schedule to be the property of Canada are: 1. Canals with lands and water power connected therewith. 2 Public harbors. 3. Lighthouses and piers and Sable Island; and other descriptions of properties, among which are military roads, property transferred by the Imperial government and known as ordnance property, lands set apart for general public purposes. The property in public harbors being thus vested in the dominion, the soil ungranted at the time of confederation between high and low water mark, and being within the limits of public harbors, by the express unqualified words of the enactment, became vested in the dominion as part and parcel of the harbors which belonged as property to the provinces, as distinct from the franchise of a port, it being clear from Lord Hale:\nThat the franchise of a port may be in one person and the ownership of the soil within the limits of the port in another. Thus Lord Hatherley in Foreman vs. Free Fishers and Dredgers of Whitstable ([1]):\nHowever commodious a place may be for vessels, it will not, therefore become a port, the establishment of which must be by the authority of the crown.\nAnd in the same case Lord Chelmsford says:\nIt appears from Lord Hale, de portibus maris, chap. 6, that \"though A. may have the property of a creek or harbor or navigable river, yet the king may grant there the liberty of a port to B., and so the interest of property and the interest of franchise be several and divided.''\nThe words of the B. N. A. Act are, in my opinion, too clear to admit of any doubt. But it was contended that the public harbors referred to in the B. N. A. Act, were only such public harbors (if any) as the local governments, as such, had acquired an actual property in, that is to say, artificial harbors constructed by the outlay of moneys and not natural harbors. But I can find nothing in the act to justify this restriction being placed on the clear words of the statute, and if we look to the general scope of the act in relation to matters with which harbors are connected, I think it is apparent that parliament intended the words to be construed in their full plain grammatical sense. In the first place, the exclusive legislative authority over the regulation of trade and commerce, beacons, buoys, lighthouses, and Sable Island, navigation and shipping, is vested in the parliament of Canada; then, secondly, property in canals, with lands and water power connected there-with, and lighthouses and piers, and Sable Island, is specifically transferred to the Dominion. It is but consistent with this that the property in public harbors, so intimately connected with and essential to trade and commerce, and shipping and navigation, lighthouses and piers, should likewise be vested in the Dominion for their more efficient management, control and regulation; a matter in which, not only the whole Dominion, but foreign shipping are likewise interested, and which could hardly be effectually managed and regulated if there were to be a divided control. Still less can it be supposed that having vested all matters connected with trade and commerce, and shipping and navigation, and matters pertaining thereto in the Dominion parliament, the property in and control of the public harbors should have been left to provincial authority. Such being the case with reference to the property in harbors in the provinces originally united under the B. N. A. Act, 1867, the same is now applicable to the harbors in the province of Prince Edward Island, it being one of the terms upon which Prince Edward Island was admitted into the union or Dominion of Canada \"that the provisions in the British North America Act, 1867, shall, except those parts thereof which are in terms made or by reasonable intendment may be held to be especially applicable to and only to affect one and not the whole of the provinces now com-posing the Dominion, and except, so far as the same may be varied by these resolutions, be applicable to Prince Edward Island in the same way and to the same extent as they apply to the other provinces of the Dominion, and as if the colony of Prince Edward Island had been one of the provinces originally united by the said act.\"\nAs, therefore, this clause relating to public harbors is alike applicable to all the provinces, and was in no way varied by the resolutions referred to, the same became applicable to Prince Edward Island as if it had been one of the provinces originally united by the British North America Act, 1867, and therefore the executive government and legislature ceased to have any property in, or executive or legislative power over, the ungranted lands between high and low water mark in such public harbors as that in question, and as a necessary consequence the grant under which plaintiff claimed, issued by the Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island under the Great Seal of that island, was of no force or effect, and therefore plaintiff had no right of action against defendant though a wrongdoer.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island making absolute a rule for a non-suit in an action of ejectment brought to recover possession of a portion of the foreshore of Summerside Harbor. The plaintiff's title consisted of letters patent, under the great seal of Prince Edward Island, dated the 30th August, 1877, by which the Crown, in right of the island, and assuming to act in exercise of authority conferred by a provincial statute, passed long before the island became a province of the Dominion, purported to grant to the plaintiffs, in fee simple, the land sought to be recovered in the action. The first question which arises is as to the title of the Crown in right of its government of Prince Edward Island, it having been contended, on the part of the defendants, that the land in dispute, upon the admission of the island as a province of the confederation, being part of the soil or bed of a public harbor, became vested in the Crown as representing the Dominion of Canada. If this contention is correct, it follows that the grant under the great seal of the island, which constitutes the plaintiff's title, was wholly void and inoperative.\nThere can be no doubt that by the common law of England the sea shore between high and low water mark, or as it is sometimes called the foreshore, is vested in the Crown. Hale, in the treatise De Jure Mans ([2]) says:\u2014 The shore is that ground that is between high and low watermark. This doth, prim\u00e2 facie and of common right, belong to the king both in the shore of the sea and in the shore of the arms of the sea.\nChitty, on the Prerogatives of the Crown ([3]), lays it down that\nThe king is also by his prerogative the prim\u00e2 facie owner of the shores ; that is, the land which lies between high and low water mark in ordinary tides of the seas, and arms of the seas, within his dominions.\nIn the Mayor of Penhym v. Holmes ([4]) Cleaseby, B., says:\nThe prim\u00e2 facie title to the foreshore everywhere is in the Crown.\nAnd this general rule of law applies to ports and harbors as well as to the shore of the open sea. In Coulson and Forbes, Treatise on the law of Waters ([5]), it is said:\nThe ownership of the soil of all ports as well as of the sea shore between high and low water mark is vested prim\u00e2 facie in the Crown, and the Crown might formerly have conveyed the soil to a subject by grant or royal charter, either apart from or in conjunction with the franchise.\nAnd the books abound in authorities to the same effect ([6]).\nTherefore at the date of the admission of Prince Edward Island \"into the Union\" pursuant to the provisions of the 146th section of the British North America Act, the land in question formed part of the demesne lands of the Crown belonging to that province. Then by the express provision of the 146th section of the British North America Act, upon the admission of Prince Edward Island all the provisions of that Act became applicable to the province, including the 109th section, which enacted that the public lands should belong to the provinces in which they were situated, and the 117th section, which provided that the several provinces should retain their public property not otherwise disposed of by the Act. These lands would therefore have remained the property of the province after confederation, unless by some particular enactment they were distinguished from the ordinary Crown lands and taken out of the operation of the 109th and 117th sections by being expressly vested in the Dominion. The only section which can have this effect is the 108th, which enacts that:\nThe public works and property of each province enumerated in the third schedule to this Act shall be the property of Canada.\nThe second enumeration of the schedule referred to is \"Public Harbors.\" The question for our decision is therefore narrowed to this:\u2014Did the 108th section of the British North America Act transfer the property in the soil or bed of this harbor to the Crown in right of the Dominion?\nThe land in dispute is situate opposite the town of Summerside and forms part of the foreshore or the land between ordinaryhigh and low water marks of Bedeque or Summerside harbor - a harbor of which the public have the common right of user, and which in that sense at least is therefore a public harbor. It does not appear that any public works have been erected or any public money expended for the improvement of, or in any way in connection with, this harbor, either by the Dominion Government since, or by the Provincial Government before or since, Confederation. I can, however, conceive no other meaning to be attached to the words: \"Public Harbors\" standing alone, than that of harbors which the public have the right to use, and consequently if a more restricted construction is to be put on those words it must arise from the context or from some other provision of the Act. I find no other pro- vision of the Act conflicting with what thus appears to be the prim\u00e2 facie construction of the terms in question.\nIt is said, however, on the part of the appellants, that the 108th clause itself, or at least the words of the third schedule, which may be read as incorporated with it, so exclusively refer to property consisting of public works and which has resulted from the expenditure of public money that it must be taken in the enumeration of public harbors to refer to harbors ejusdem generis, and is therefore confined to those harbors which at the time of confederation had been artificially constructed or improved at the public expense. I find nothing in the section and schedule combined to warrant such a construction, which, it seems to me, can only be based on conjecture. The words of the section are\" public works and property,\" and in the schedules, though most of the properties enumerated have resulted from the expenditure of public money, this is not so as to all, for we find \"Sable Island \" \"property transferred by the Imperial Government, and known as ordnance property, \"and\" lands set apart for general public purposes,\" none of which descriptions imply, as they do not actually include, properties which had been improved at the general public expense.\nThis argument seems therefore wholly to fail, and we must conclude that there is nothing in the context which would warrant us in restricting the wide general description of \"public harbors\" to a meaning different from that which the words bear in their ordinary and primary signification.\nNext arise the questions\u2014Does the description \"Public Harbors\" include the bed or soil of the harbor? and if so, is the foreshore also comprised in it? I am of opinion that there is even less doubt on this head than on the first point. By the attri-\n[Page718]\nbution of the harbors to the Dominion it never could have been, meant to transfer a mere franchise to the Dominion Government\u2014that is, to the Crown in right of the Dominion\u2014leaving the property in the soil vested in the Crown in the right of the province. Such a construction would be so arbitrary, unnatural and improbable as to be totally inadmissible. Who ever heard of such an anomaly as the Crown, as a body politic representing one Government, having a franchise in the property of the Crown itself as a body politic representing a distinct Government? Then the object of vesting the harbours in the Dominion was doubtless with the object of enabling that Government to carry out with more facility such measures as it might, under the power granted to it to legislate on the subject of navigation and shipping, from time to time think fit to enact. And for this purpose it was material that the right of property in the soil of harbors should be under the control of the Dominion, a result which would not be attained by conferring a mere franchise or the police power of regulating harbors and taking tolls in them. Further, the taking of tolls or harbor dues would have implied the duty of conservancy, which could not have been properly performed if the bed of the harbor had been vested in a different proprietor. Then there would have been no necessity for this special provision of the 108th section vesting harbors in the Dominion, unless it was intended to vest the property in the beds of harbors, for under the grant of legislative power relating to navigation and shipping, Parliament might have assumed ail such powers as would have been comprised in the 108th section, if it were to be construed as a mere grant of a franchise, or police, or conservancy power, or of all these together. The fair inference is therefore that it was intended to transfer the harbors in the widest sense of the word, including all proprietary as well as prerogative rights, to the Crown as representing the Dominion. And this construction is in accord with the presumption of law as laid down by Lord C. J. Hale, De Jure Maris ([7]), who says:\nThat a subject having a port of the sea may have, and, indeed, in common experience and presumption hath, the very soil covered with water, for though it is true the franchise of a port is a different thing from the propriety of the soil of a port, and so the franchise of a port may be in a subject, and the propriety of the soil may be in the king or in some other, yet in ordinary usage and presumption they go together.\nThat the foreshore is comprised in and forms part of the harbor, and passed to the Dominion under that denomination, is too plain to need demonstration, for it is held by the crown by the same title and is part of the soil of the harbor, the harbor or port being held to include all below high water mark. The passage from the text writers already quoted ([8]) is also to this effect.\nThe conclusion is that nothing passed to the plaintiffs under the letters patent of 30th August, 1877, and this appeal must consequently be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nL'Intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi en cette cause pour une voie de fait (trespass) consistant dans l'\u00e9rection d'un quai dans la baie de Summerside, sur la devanture de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des appelants, demandeurs en cour inf\u00e9rieure.

Ce terrain est en outre sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme faisant partie du rivage situ\u00e9 en front de la terre appartenant aux appe\u00adlants (\"being part of the shore situated in front of land owned by the said Robert McCaul and Robert Tenson Holman.\") La validit\u00e9 de ces lettres patentes a \u00e9t\u00e9 atta\u00adqu\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s sur le principe que la commission du lieutenant-gouverneur ne lui conf\u00e9rait pas express\u00e9\u00adment le pouvoir de faire une telle concession, et aussi comme n'\u00e9tant pas faite en conformit\u00e9 des dispositions du statut ci-dessus cit\u00e9, lequel par la sec. 3, exige pour la validit\u00e9 des lettres patentes le consentement de tous les propri\u00e9taires sur la devanture de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des\u00adquels se trouve situ\u00e9 un lot de gr\u00e8ve publique. Le chemin de fer de l\u2019Ile du Prince-Edouard, maintenant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement du Canada, et un quai, appel\u00e9 le quai de la Reine, construit par la province comme ouvrage public avant son annexion \u00e0 la Puissan\u00adce, s\u00e9parent la terre des appelants de l'endroit o\u00f9 est cons\u00adtruit le quai en question. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que d'apr\u00e8s le statut le consentement du gouvernement du Canada, comme propri\u00e9taire du dit chemin de fer, \u00e9tait n\u00e9ces\u00adsaire pour la validit\u00e9 des lettres patentes. Il soutient aussi que le consentement de la corporation de Summerside, qui, en vertu de son acte d'incorporation, 40 Vict., ch. 15, a le pouvoir de faire des r\u00e8glements pour l'admi\u00adnistration de quais, \u00e9tait aussi n\u00e9cessaire pour la vali\u00addit\u00e9 des dites lettres patentes. Il y a encore plusieurs autres objections invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l'appui de la demande d'un non suit ou d'un nouveau proc\u00e8s, mais je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire de s'en occuper pour arriver \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cette cause, si la 8e objection est fond\u00e9e. Cette objection est formul\u00e9e comme suit: \"Because said\n[page 721]\ngrant is void on the ground that by the British North America Act all public harbors are vested in Canada, and Summerside is a public harbor.\"\nIl est admis que la preuve constate que les lignes lat\u00e9rales de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des appelants prolong\u00e9es dans la baie jusqu'au del\u00e0 du quai, comprendraient dans leurs limites le terrain c\u00e9d\u00e9 par les lettres patentes et particuli\u00e8rement l'endroit sur lequel est construit le quai dont il s'agit; que Summerside est un havre form\u00e9 par la nature, employ\u00e9 comme Charlottetown, Pictou, Halifax ou St. John, aux usages de la navigation. L'admission est en ces termes :\nThat Summerside harbour is a natural harbour, largely used for shipping purposes like Chariottetown, Pictou, Halifax or St.John.\nQue le quai de la Reine, est un quai public, construit par le gouvernement local avec des deniers publics vot\u00e9s \u00e0 mesure qu'il en \u00e9tait besoin, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que pour la plupart des autres quais de l'Ile. Ce quai fut construit vers l'ann\u00e9e 1840, et a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 depuis comme quai public \u00e0 l'usage des nombreux vaisseaux qui fr\u00e9quentent le havre de Sum\u00admerside.\nCes admissions constatent d'une mani\u00e8re certaine que le havre de Summerside est un havre public. En vertu de la sec. 108 de l'acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, d\u00e9clarant que les travaux et propri\u00e9t\u00e9s publics de chaque province, \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la troisi\u00e8me c\u00e9dule annex\u00e9e au dit acte, appartiendront au Canada, les havres publics \u00e9tant compris dans l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration faite dans la dite c\u00e9dule, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du havre de Summerside appartient au gouvernement du Canada, depuis que l\u2019Ile du Prince-Edouard en fait partie. A dater de cette \u00e9poque le havre en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 sous la juridiction du gouvernement du Canada qui y a nomm\u00e9 un ma\u00eetre du havre charg\u00e9 de la police de ce havre etc., etc.\nDu moment que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du havre est devenue celle du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le gouvernement de l'Ile a cess\u00e9 d'y avoir aucun droit. En cons\u00e9quence lors de l'\u00e9mission des lettres patentes en question, le 30 ao\u00fbt 1877, le gouvernement de l\u2019Ile du Prince-Edouard n'avait plus dans les limites du havre en question aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le sol formant ce havre. En cons\u00e9quence ces lettres patentes sont nulles en autant qu'elles c\u00e8dent aux appelants une partie de ce havre qui \u00e9tait alors la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nJe suis en cons\u00e9quence d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThere is another difficulty, too, which presents itself to my. mind, in addition to those mentioned by my learned colleagues, and that is that since con\u00adfederation, even if the local legislature had the soil of the harbor, the public had an easement\u2014that is, the whole public (not the public of Prince Edward Island, but the public everywhere) had a right to an easement of the wharves, and if the legislature of Prince Edward Island assumed the right of granting the land between low water mark and high water mark, they might carry that still further, and grant the soil so as to be injurious to the whole shipping interest. I think, therefore, that ever since confederation, even if the soil did belong to Prince Edward Island, and its legislature had the right to dispose of the soil, which I think it had not, there was an easement that the public had in it that the Local Government had no right to obstruct by granting the sole right to other parties to occupy the waters of the harbor by putting up buildings, erec\u00adtions, or in any other way impeding the passage of it. I concur in the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice and those who have preceded me.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nTo the real question which is involved in this suit, the only answer which can be given is in the negative ; that question is\u2014is a deed executed by a lieutenant-governor of one of the provinces of this Dominion with the public seal of that province thereto annexed, competent and effectual to transfer to a person named in such deed as vendee, the legal estate in property which, by force of the provisions of the B. N. A. Act, is vested in Her Majesty for the public purposes of the Dominion, and is for that reason expressly placed under the exclu\u00adsive control of the Dominion parliament.\nUpon Prince Edward Island being admitted into the Dominion, an event which took place upon and from the 1st July, 1813, the legislative authority of the parliament of Canada (by force of sec. 91, item 1, and of sec 108 and item 2 of the schedule therein referred to of the B. N. A. Act) became absolute and exclusive over ail public harbors situate in the island. Her Majesty remained seized of those harbors and of the land covered with the waters thereof, jure regio, for the public purposes of the Dominion and subject to the exclusive control of the parliament of Canada.\nUnder the provisions of the Dominion statute, 37 Vie, c. 34, and the orders in council made in pursuance thereof, the Dominion government has assumed control over the pi\u00e8ce of land situate in the harbor of Summerside, and which the plaintiffs claim to be their property under and in virtue of a deed dated the 30th August, 1877, purporting to be executed by R. Hodgson, Lieutenant-Governor, with the Great Seal of the pro\u00advince of Prince Edward Island attached. It is contended that this deed is valid and effectual to transfer to the vendee named therein the land therein described, by force of two statutes of the province passed before the passing of the B. N. A. Act, viz., 15 Vie., c. 7, and 25 Vie, c. 19, but it is obvious that upon the province being admitted into the Dominion under the provisions of the B. N. A. Act, the executive authorities of the province under its new constitution could have no power, statutory or otherwise, to sell property placed for Dominion purposes under the supreme control of the Dominion parliament, and that the property in question is such property cannot admit of a doubt. The deed, therefore, under which the plaintiff claims is inoperative and void, and the non-suit was, therefore, right, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs It is a matter of no importance that the defendant has no right either to the land in question, or that his acts at the place in question are punishable under the provisions of the Dominion statute 37 Vic., c. 34 and the orders in council issued thereunder. For the purpose of the present action it is sufficient to say that the plaintiff has no title to the land in question.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellants: Davies & Sutherland.\nAttorneys for respondent: Peters & Peter.\n[1] L.

Ritchie, Kt, C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry Taschereau and Gwynne, JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (APPEAL SIDE.)\nWrit of prohibition to municipal corporation\u2014Assessment roll, amendment of\u2014Arts. 716 & 746 a, municipal code, P Q.\nThe municipal corporation of the county of H., in the province of Quebec made an assessment roll according to law in 1872. In1875 a triennial assessment roll was made, and the property subject to assessment was assessed at $1,745,588.58. In 1876, without declaring that it was an amendment of the roll of 1875 the corporation made another assessment in which the property was assessed at $3,138,550. Among the properties that contributed towards this augmentation were those of appellants, who, by their petition, or requite libell\u00e9e. addressed to the Superior Court, P. Q., alleged that the Secretary-Treasurer of the county of H. was about selling their real estate for taxes under the provisions of the municipal code for the province of Quebec, 34 Vic., c. 68,sec. 998 et seq., and prayed to have the assessment roll of 1876 in virtue of which the officer of the municipality was proceeding to sell, declared invalid and null and void, and that a writ of prohibition should issue to prevent the respondents from proceeding to sell. The Superior Court directed the issue of the writ restraining the defendants as prayed, but upon the merits held the roll of 1876 valid as an amendment of the roll of 1875 The Court of Queen's Bench reversed this judgment on the merits and held the roll of 1876 to be substantially a new roll and therefore null and void.\nHeld, per Henry. Taschereau and Gwynne. JJ., affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the roll of 1876 not being a triennial assessment roll or an amendment of such a roll, was illegal and null, and that respondents were entitled to an order from the Superior Court as prayed for to restrain the municipal corporation from selling their property, and the writ which issued, whether correctly styled \" writ of prohibition\" or not. was properly issued, and should be maintained. Per Rithie, C.J., Strong and Fournier, JJ., that a writ of prohibition issued under art. 1031 as was the writ issued in this case will only lie to an inferior tribunal, and not to a municipal officer.\n[The court being equally divided, the judgment appealed from was confirmed, but without costs.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (appeal side), maintaining a writ of prohibition addressed to appellants forbidding them from proceeding to the sale of the lands of the respondents for taxes.\nBy the declaration or requite libell\u00e9e of the respondents, they alleged that the appellant Joseph Michael C\u00f4i\u00e9 as secretary-treasurer of the county of Hochelaga, was about selling their real estate by forced sale for taxes under the provisions of the municipal code for the province of Quebec; that in the year 1876 the corporation of the village of Hochelaga, while there was a valid subsisting assessment roll for the municipality made in 1875, which by law was, and continued to be in force for three years, and under the false pretence that there was no such roll, nor any made since 1873 proceeded to make a new assessment roll, which by law could only be made every three years; that the school commissioners of the school municipality of the village had taken for the base of their roll the said illegal assessment roll; that these taxes, which were claimed by the municipality of the village of Hochelaga and by the catholic school commissioners of the same municipality, were utterly illegal. In consequence, they prayed that a writ of prohibition should issue, that the two corporations who claimed the taxes and the county of Hochelaga and their secretary treasurer, by whom the sale was to be made, should be enjoined and forbidden from selling the real estate in question. And further that a certain valuation roll for 18766 of the municipality of the village of Hochelaga, upon which the legality of the contested taxes turns should be declared illegal null and void.\nThis requ\u00e9te libell\u00e9e was sworn to, and the following order was made by Torrance, J.S.C., \"Let the writ issue as prayed for. 1st March, 1878.\"\n(Signed)\n\"F. W. Torrance, J.\"\nOn the same day, under 35 Vic. c. 6, sec. 21, Quebec, the appellants sued out of the Superior Court of the district of Montreal, an ordinary writ of summons, whereby the respondents were summoned to appear in the said court in the city of Montreal on the fourteenth day of March to answer the demand which should be made against them for the causes mentioned in the requ\u00e9te libell\u00e9e thereunto annexed.\nThis writ to which was annexed the requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e or declaration, was served upon all the defendants. The defendants appeared and severed in their defence They filed an exception to the form, and they also, by demurrer, objected that no writ of prohibition lies in such a cause; they pleaded al8o to the merits, denying the truth of the allegations in the declaration, thereby raising an issue as to the validity of the assessment roll. The learned judge of the superior court maintained the action to be well founded, and pronounced judgment for the plaintiffs on the demurrers, but in favor of the defendants upon the issue as to the validity of the roll, thereby holding the roll of 1876 to be valid as an amendment of the roll of 1875 which was admitted to have been duly made. From this judgment upon the merits the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), the majority of which court reversed the judgment of the superior court, holding the assessment roll impugned not to be an amendment of the roll of 1875 but to be a wholly new roll and absolutely null and void. From this judgment the present appeal was taken.\nMr. Archambault, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe first ground we rely upon is that no writ of prohibition lies against an officer of a municipal corporation. Writs of prohibition can only issue here as in England, to prevent an inferior tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction. Art. 1031 C. C. P. Writs of prohibition, mandamus, &c., are granted only in default of any other remedy.\nOur municipal code articles 734, 735, 736, 737 and 738 provide the necessary means to have a roll reformed; it is a cheap and rapid remedy to which the respondents would not resort. Then, again, they had an appeal by art. 927, but respondents not only did not resort to these remedies but in their petition or requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, they do not mention that they used those remedies, and they do not complain that the appellants prevented them, either by fraud or otherwise, from employing those remedies. They only said you had no right to make a new roll for 1876. We answer the roll of 1876 was only an amendment for local and school purposes. All the formalities in making the amended roll of 1876 required by art. 746 a, arts. 736 737 and 738 have been observed, and, after the homologation of the roll, the appellants or a number of them, appealed to the county council, as they had a right to do, and as held by the Superior Court this roll is valid, regular and legal.\nMr. Mousseau, Q.C., followed on behalf of appellants:\nThe appellant (C\u00f4t\u00e9) should not have been condemned to pay costs. He had nothing whatever to do with the confection of the roll. He had no discretional power and he was bound to obey the law. Arts. 371, 373, 998 999 and 1,000 M. 0., P.Q. Neither could the corporation of the county council of Hochelaga be made a party and made liable for costs and although the court of first instance dismissed the exceptions to the form and the demurrers of the defendant, the appellants are entitled before this court, to urge in support of the final judgment of the superior court all the grounds taken by them before the Superior Court.\nNow, with reference to the writ of prohibition, as was contended by my learned colleague I submit that no such Writ lies in the present case under art. 1031 C. C. P. In my opponent's factum it is very ingeniously tried to confuse the writ of injunction with the writ of prohibition. This cannot avail the respondent's case, for 41 Vic., c. 14 was passed after the issue of the writ in this case and before then no such writ as a writ of injunction was known in our procedure. The writ which was issued in this case could not be addressed to a municipal corporation ([1]).\nThere was nothing in the evidence to show that the roll of 1876 was a new roll. Art. 746a under which this roll was made, virtually gives the power to the council to make a new roll every year. Here there was no injustice; all respondents complain of is that, instead of making alterations on the roll itself the secretary-treasurer recopied the whole roll; and the reason was that as at that period property increased very much in value every year, and there were so many changes it was found better to copy the whole roll. Under such circumstances this court ought to uphold the judgment of the Superior Court, and declare the roll valid and regular. See Coo1ey on Taxation ([2]).\nMr. Barnard, Q.C., and Mr. Creighton, with him, for respondents: Two questions arise on this appeal: 1st. Whether the taxes sought to be collected were or were not perfectly illegal, null and void? 2nd. Whether the petitioners had a remedy, and whether by a writ of prohibition. With regard to the first question the judge who rendered the judgment in the court of first instance, and all the judges in the Court of Queen's Bench seem to have admitted that this roll of 1.876 in so far as it was an original triennial roll, was an absolute nullity. The minority in appeal and the judge of the court of first instance however held that the council has under article 746a, the power, every year, of revising, for local purposes, the triennial roll and as the roll of 1876 has been revised by the council they consider it as if it were the revised edition of the roll of 1875. They think that it is practically the same thing whether the result arrived at finally by the council is reached by way of a revised roll or by way of a new roll.\nNow, we submit there can be no doubt that this was not an amended roll of the original triennial roll of 1875.\nArt 746a says:. The revision must be made in accordance with art. 786 among others. Now under article 736 the council, before proceeding to the revision of the valuation roll of 1875 were bound to give notice of the day and hour when such revision should take place. The notice given in this case so far from being a notice that the roll of 1875 would be revised, expressly refers to the revision of the new roil made by valuators for the year 1876.\nIn the second place, art. 737 says that the council, sitting as a revising board, must take into consideration the complaints made, and hear the interested parties in presence of the valuators Surely the valuators referred to are the valuators who made the roil to be revised. In this case the roil of 1875 therefore could not be revised, if the valuators present were those who made the roll of 1876.\nThe importance of article 738, which says that the amendments made must be entered on the amended roll or on a document annexed thereto lies in the fact that it practically recognizes that no revision can take place of a roll unless that roll is before the revising tribunal The incongruity attaching to the appellants pretention on this point is so manifest that it is deemed unnecessary to pursue the matter further. Here the council, sitting as a court, are called to revise the judgment of A. and the argument on the other side is that this is done if by some new law of equivalents the court revise the judgment of B.\nIt will possibly be argued that in Lower Canada the council, sitting as a revising board, has power to alter the roll proprio motu in the absence of any petition or complaint. No doubt such is the case under the article 734 when the council examines the tricnnial roll It is an anomaly however which it is impossible to account for. But even supposing the council, in the case of a roll actually in force, to have the same right to make alterations of its own accord the fact would still remain that the roll to be revised was that of 1875 and it could not be revised when it was not before the council at all.\nAs to the pretention of the school commissioners that they could render a foll valid which is an absolute nullity by simply adopting it as their own, it was entertained neither by the judge of the court of first instance nor by any one of the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench, and it seems to require no special notice, at least at present.\nWith regard to the second point whether the remedy we employed was a proper remedy.\nAlthough the writ in this case has been called a writ of prohibition, the prayer of the petition was that the defendants should be enjoined and forbidden from selling. There can be no doubt that in Lower Canada it is sufficient that the facts] and conclusions be distinctly and fairly stated without any particular form being necessary, and if the respondents' proceeding was valid as an injunction it was not invalid because called a prohibition. In fact, to speak of writs of prohibition is not correct, although the code uses the term, for the writ is an ordinary writ of summons as held by the judicial committee in the case of Brown v. Cur\u00e9 &c. de Montreal ([3]) and the real character of the remedy depends on the conclusions of the requ\u00e9te libell\u00e9e, which is allowed by the preliminary order of the judge.\nIf, however, it were necessary to show that prohibition strictly so called did lie in this case, the respondents contend that the English precedents and authorities fairly applied to the altered circumstances existing in this country are conclusive in their favor and such seem to have been hitherto the view not only of the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada but of the Chief Justice of that court also See report of Armstrong and Sorel in Taschereau's Code of Procedure ([4]), and the report of the same case ([5]) and also Bourgouin and the Montreal Northern Colonization Railway Company ([6]); Carter v. Breaky ([7]); McDougall and Corporation of St Ephrem Upton ([8]). In all those cases, according to our own jurisprudence, the name is nothing.\nThe further objection, that the respondents had a remedy of another kind under the municipal law, will be found to be without any foundation. The respondents Opposed the valuation roll of 1876 before the village council, but their opposition was not even taken into consideration. They then had the choice of an appeal to the county council or to the circuit court. They chose the county council, who took the opinion of counsel and were told that the valuation roll was a nullity. A. decision of the county council in favor of the respondents, unfortunately, was prevented by the fact that the opinion of counsel came too late and the appeal stood dismissed by the mere lapse of time.\nThe last point we urge is that this court cannot entertain the objection raised to the form of the writ. There is no cross appeal, and as the judgments of Mr. Justice Torrance and IMr. Justice Rainville dismissing the appellant's preliminary pleas, have not been printed in the record this court will hold that they have acquiesced in these judgments.\nThe learned counsel also referred to the following cases:\nKane v. Montreal Tel. Co. ([9]); Guyot R\u00e9pertoire ([10]); Guyot R\u00e9pertoire ([11]); Bouteiller Somme Rurale ([12]); Savard v. Moisan ([13]); Mayor etc., of Montreal v. Harrison Stephens ([14]); Molson v. City of Montreal ([15]); Mayor et al v. Benny et al ([16]); Mayor of Iberville v. Jones ([17]); Atty. Gen. v. Litchfield ([18]).\nMr, Mousseau, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C.J. :\u2014\nThe questIon in this case arises under a decision of the Court of Appeal of the province of Quebec. Proceedings were initiated by petition\u2014requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e\u2014 by which the parties sought to stop the sale of certain property which was about being sold under an assessment which was made in the county of Hochelaga. There are a number of parties to the suit but it is not necessary to refer to them. The Court of Queen's Bench held that the assessment was unjustfiable, and that the order prayed for, the prohibition, should issue to prevent them going on with the sale. The decision of the court was that the valuation roll was null and illegal, and that the sale ought to be stopped, and granted the prayer of the petition. The Honorable the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tessier dissented from this decision\nI think that the whole case turns as far as my view of it goes on the question not whether the assessment was null and void or not, but whether, in the proceedings which were taken by the parties, they were entitled to a writ of prohibition, or to a writ in the nature of a writ of prohibition under the circumstances which were proved in this case. The code art.1031, provides that in writs of prohibition which are to be addressed to courts of inferior jurisdiction wherever they exceed their jurisdiction, they are to be applied for and obtained in the same manner as writs of mandamus, with the same formalities. Now, it is obvious that this power of issuing writs of prohibition in the province of Quebec, under the code of civil procedure art. 1031, is substantially the same as the power to issue writs of prohibition under the English jurisprudence, and these writs of prohibition can only go to the courts to prevent their acting without jurisdiction, or to prevent their exceeding their jurisdiction, and it is abundantly clear that the prerogative writ of prohibition under the English law does not go for the purpose of stopping or preventing the proceedings of commissioners under assessments, or of those persons who are to carry out the assessment laws, they not being judicial tribunals to which the prohibition will go. It is true that in the United States there are to be found some cases, in some of the states where writs of prohibition, similar to the writ of prohibition under English jurisprudence, have been used for such a purpose, but it is to be remarked that in the majority of the states the writ of prohibition has not been used for any such purpose, and it is further to be remarked that in those states where the writ of prohibition has been so used and in those courts out of which those writs have issued, the judges, I think, in all the cases that I have looked up have stated that the writ of prohibition was justified by the practice of those courts, but could not be justified by English principles or by English practice, and that while used in the United States in these individual states, it was in opposition to the usage in England. Therefore, this writ of prohibition which is prayed for could not, if it was the prerogative writ in England, avail in this case, and the writ under article 1,031 of the civil code of procedure, if the writ is the same (as I think is very clear from the wording of the code) as the English prerogative writ of prohibition, would not be applicable to a case of this kind; and this seems to have been admitted by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the majority of the court in this case, but he gets rid of the difficulty by saying that the jurisprudence of Quebec does not regard the name of the writ but that by whatever name it may be called, the writ may issue in a case of this kind, and it is not a writ of prohibition as understood under the English law, or as under article 1031 of the code, but that it may he treated in the nature of an injunction. Now, it is well known that the writ of injunction under the English law and the writ of prohibition are writs of an entirely separate and distinct character. High, on Extraordinary Legal Remedies ([19]), points out that while some points of similarity may be noticed between the extraordinary remedial process of prohibition and the extraordinary remedy of courts of equity by injunction against proceedings at law, says :\nThese is this vital difference to be observed between them that an injunction against proceedings at law is directed only to the parties litigant, without in any manner interfering with the courts, while a prohibition is directed to the court itself, commanding it to cease from the exercise of a jurisdiction to which it has no legal claim, and injunction usually recognizes the jurisdiction of the court in which the proceedings are pending and proceeds on the ground of equities attecting only the parties litigant, while the prohibition strikes at once at the very jurisdiction of the court. The former remedy affects only the parties, the latter is directed against the forum itself.\nThe difficulty that strikes my mind (and I put it forward with a great deal of hesitancy, still, it is the best judgment at which I have been able to arrive in this matter) is this '. that the conclusion at which the minority of the Court of Queen's Bench arrived was the correct decision, if I may be permitted to say so. I think that when Mr. Justice Ramsay pointed out that according to the jurisprudence of Quebec it mattered not by what name you called the writ, if the party was entitled to the remedy, he overlooked the fact that when the parties in this case were seeking to restrain municipal officers they were doing it by a proceeding which, according to what I understand of the practice in the province of Quebec, was applicable to the writ of prohibition, and was not open to the parties as it would be if they had taken proceedings to set aside this assessment and to get the remedy which they were entitled to, if the assessment was null and void, by a regular proceeding. In fact, that they did not adopt that course, but that they adopted this summary proceeding which would be open to them if they were merely seeking to get a writ of prohibition under this act, and, therefore, in my opinion, the remedy as sought for in this case was misconceived, and therefore they ought not to be allowed to use the writ of prohibition to give them that relief which under the procedure in the province of Quebec, could only be obtained by a regular suit in which the proceedings are of an entirely different character.\nI must confess myself much impressed with the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice Meredith and the very exhaustive judgment he has given in the case of Carter v. Breaky ([20]), in which he has put forward, with much force, that there was no writ of injuction applicable under the system of procedure then in force in the province of Quebec. He points out that the want of a writ of injunction was considered by the courts, by judges and by counsel, as a casus omissus in the law of Quebec, and he expresses his regret and the regret of others that it was not provided for by the code, and we find that the legislature very lately has given, by statutory enactment, the writ of injunction.\nReference is made to that in Chief Justice Dorion's judgment, in which he points out that by the Act 41 Vic, ch. 14, security is necessary to be given in such proceedings, and says to allow a writ of prohibition to issue in a case where a writ of injunction is the proper remedy, would deprive a defendant of the substantial right of obtaining security; but, I think that is answered by this fact: that at the time these proceedings were taken that statute had not come in force and therefore, if the writ of injunction did not exist, I am very much inclined to think in accordance with the view of Chief Justice Meredith, in Quebec, no matter what proceedings they had taken, they could not have got writ of injunction, as we term it in the English law. But, however that may he, hereafter no questions will arise as to whether the writ of injunction can be issued in the province of Quebec or not, because the legislature has made pro- vision for it, but of course the provisions which have been made for the issuing of it by the legislature must be acted on. As Chief Justice Meredith pointed out in the case to which I have referred, that authority must be found for the proceedings and we must know under what law the power is derived to do what has been done, so just in the present case, we must know what authority the court had; and I must confess that for the issuing of this prohibition, injunction or restraining writ, by whatsoever name it may be called, I have sought in vain to find in the jurisprudence of Quebec any authority for issuing such an order, if order it is, or such a writ, if, writ it is, in the proceeding which has been taken in this case, and, altogether, I think that the judgment cannot be sustained, but that the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs,\nStrong, J.:\u2014\nArt. 1031 of the Code of Procedure of the province of Quebec, is as follows:\u2014\" Writs of prohibition are addressed to courts of inferior jurisdicition. \" Without entering upon any discussion as to the analogy or distinction between writs of prohibition as known to the common law of England and those authorized by this article of the Quebec code, it is manifest that such a writ as that defined by the article quoted, is a remedy entirely inapplicable and inappropriate in the present case. The defendants, who were proceeding to execute a ministerial office did not constitute a court of inferior jurisdiction, nor were they threatening any excess of jurisdiction in assuming to exercise any judicial authority whatever. The proceeding appealed against cannot therefore be sustained as a writ of prohibition It has, however, been suggested that the writ may be considered as. a writ of injunction, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench supported on that ground. The plain and conclusive answer to this, however, is that the writ of injunction was unknown to the procedure of the courts of the Province of Quebec, until the stat. of Quebec 41 Vic., cap. 14 made provision for such writs, and the proceedings in the present case were taken before that act came into operation.\nThen it has been contended that although a technical writ of injunction could not have been obtained before the statute it was still the right of the plaintiff if the assess\u00e9ment was null to have it so pronounced judicially, and the defendants prohibited from enforcing payment of the illegal tax, on an ordinary action at common law. Granting that this was so the respondents are met by the objection that they have not made use of the procedure prescribed by the code for an ordinary action, but have instead adopted the special and exceptional mode of proceeding prescribed for writs of prohibition, which differs essentially from those which the law authorizes in common actions the delays being different, and the proceeding being originated by petition (requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e) instead of by service of a writ of summons and a declaration. It has been urged, it is true, that these proceedings are notwithstanding the same, and for that reason we should ignore formal distinctions, but to this argument I cannot accede. The law has directed a different mode of proceeding in each case, and I do not think we are at liberty to disregard the plain distinctions of the code and to recognise one form of action as an equivalent for another; were we to do so we should be virtually subverting and repealing the code of procedure.\nI am, therefore, obliged to come to the conclusion that the appellants are entitled to prevail. 1 have come to this determination reluctantly, I admit, for I am of opinion that the assessment was illegal and the merits altogether with the respondents, but the technical difficulties I have mentioned appear to me to be insurmountable.\nMy conclusion is, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversed and the action dismissed with costs to the appellants in this court and both the courts below.\nFouhnier, J.:\nLa reau\u00eate libell\u00e9e des Intim\u00e9s demandant un bref de prohibition avait pour objet d'emp\u00eacher la vente de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, situ\u00e9es dans le village d'Hochelaga, annonc\u00e9es en vente par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du comt\u00e9 d'Hochelaga, pour arr\u00e9rages de taxes.\nLe principal moyen invoqu\u00e9 au soutien de cette requ\u00eate est la nullit\u00e9 du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation de 1876 d'apr\u00e9s lequel s'est faite la repartition des taxes demand\u00e9es.

On voit, par une note de sir A. A. Dorion, que le m\u00eame jour cette cour a rendu un jugement semblable dans la cause de Jones contre le maire d'H\u00e9bertville C'est la premi\u00e8re fois que ce principe a re\u00e7u Ia sanction de la Cour d'Appel. A venir jusqu'\u00e0 ces deux decisions le contraire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 1031 C.P.C. qui declare que les brefs de prohibition sont adress\u00e9s aux tribunaux de juridiction inf\u00e9rienre lorsquills exc\u00e8dent leur juridiction. En cela le code est conforme \u00e0 la loi anglaise.\nDans la cause de Blain vs. La corporation de Granby, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant en revision pour le district de Montr\u00e9al avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'un bref de prohibition no pouvait \u00eatre adress\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 une cour et non pas \u00e0 une corporation municipale. Le m\u00eame principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la cause de Beaudry vs. The Recorder of the City of Montrell ([21]), Dans Ia cause du Maire de Sorel vs. Armstrong ([22]), la Cour de R\u00e9vision a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de Ia Cour Inf\u00e9rieure ordonnant l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de prohibition et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission de ce bref. La m\u00eame cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 20 septembre 1876 qu'il n'y avait pas lieu an bref de prohibition pour emp\u00eacher une corporation de faire d'une partie de son territoire une municipalit\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9e.\nOn volt par ces citations que les decisions de la Cour du Banc de la Reine ont d'abord refuse d'admettre qu'il v avait lieu au bref de prohibition en mati\u00e8res municipales. Ces decisions \u00e9taient plus conformes au Code de proc\u00e9dure et aux autorit\u00e9s anglaises que les deux derniers judgements qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire et dont l'un, celui rendu en cette cause, forme le sujet du present appel.\nHigh, on Extraordinary legal Remedies, \u00a7 782 states from American and English Authorities the rule on this subject as follows :\nThe legitimate scope and purpose of the remedy being, as we have already seen to keep inferior Courts within the limits of their own jurisdiction and to prevent them from encroaching upon other tribunals, it cannot properly be extended to officers or tribunals whose functions are not strictly judicial. And while there are cases where the writ has been grranted against ministerial officers intrusted with the collection of taxes, yet the better doctrine both upon principle and authority, undoubtedly is, that it will not lie as against municipal officers, such as collectors of taxes, or as against municipal boards of quasi judicial functions, entrusted with taxing powers, to restrain them from levying or collecting taxe.\nEn effet I'article 1031 du Code de proc\u00e9dure declare que les biefs de prohibition sont adress\u00e9s aux tribunaux de juridiction inf\u00e9rieure lorsqu'ils exc\u00e8dent leur juridiction. Ce texte pr\u00e9cis devrait dispenser de citer aucune autre autorit\u00e9. Il doit r\u00e9gler la question.\nL'article 1031, comme on le voit par l'autorit\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par les codificateurs indiquant son origine, nous vient du droit anglais. Le code n'a sous ce rapport aucunement modifi\u00e9 la loi anglaise au sujet du bref de prohibition, il n'a fait qu'en r\u00e9gler Ia procedure; mais il n'a pas admis le recours \u00e0 ce bref en d'autres cas que dans ceux o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait admis dans le droit anglais. Rien n'est plus certain que ce bref d'apr\u00e9s le droit anglais, ne peut \u00eatre employ\u00e9 contre les corporations municipales J'ai en vain cherch\u00e9 dans les auteurs anglais des traces de son application dans ces mati\u00e9res; je puis dire avec assurance qu'on n'en trouve aucune. L'assertion de High \u00e0 ce sujet est certainement exacte: \" The exercise of the jurisdiction for this purpose (in municipal matters) is conceded to be without the sanction of English precedent.\"\nPour ces raisons je suis d'avis qu'il n'y avait pas lieu \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de prohibition et que les Appelants doivent avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'objection quills ont prise \u00e0 ce sujet. Mais le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour proc\u00e8de moins sur l'existence du bref de prohibition en pareil cas, que sur le fait que dans Ia pr\u00e9sente cause les conclusions prises dans la demande de ce bref ne sont pas diff\u00e9rentes do cellss que les Intim\u00e9s auraient pu prendee par un bref d'injonction. Il est vrai que d'apr\u00e9s le Code de procedure, les actions et autres proc\u00e9d\u00e9s judiciaires n'ont pas besoin d'\u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par un nom particulier, et qu'une erreur \u00e0 ce sujet n'emporterait aucune consequence. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaitement correct de dire, que le bref en question quoique appel\u00e9 \" prohibition \" devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un bref d'injonction, si \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis le bref d'injonction e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 admis dans notre syst\u0141me de proc\u00e9dure, mais il ne l'\u00e9tait pas encore. Le bref dont il s'agit est dat\u00e9 du ler mars 1878, et la loi introduisant le bref d'injonction dans le Code de proc\u00e9dure de P. de Q. n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionnn\u00e9 que le 9 mars, quelques jours apr\u00e9s. Ainsi la proc\u00e9dure des Intim\u00e9s doit \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la loi en force le ler mars 1878. Si le bref d'injonction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en existence le ler mars, je n'h\u00e9siterais nullement \u00e0 me joindre \u00e0 l'opinion que le bref de prohibition en cette cause doit \u00eatre pris comme l'\u00e9quivalent d'un brefd'injonction; mais avant d'en arriver l\u00e0 til faudrait d\u00e9montrer l'existence de ce dernier bref \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Le bref de prohibition existait pour les fins de l'art. 1031 comme bref de prerogative introduit avant le code comme faisant partie du droit public anglais. Mais ii n'en \u00e9tait pas de m\u00eame du bref d'injonction qui, comme appartenant au droit civil anglais, n'a jamais fait partie du droit de la province de Quebec. Cette importante question a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re si compl\u00e8te et si savante par l'honorable jugeen-chef Meredith, qu'apr\u00e8s avoir lu et \u00e9tudi\u00e9 son admirable jugement sur cette question dans la cause de Carter vs. Breaky ([23]), je n'ai Pu faire autrement que d'en venir comme lui \u00e0 la conclusion qu'avant la 41\u00e8me Vict., ch. ch. 14, le bref d'injonction n'existait pas dans la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl est vrai que la derni\u00e8re clause de cet acte, en exceptant de son effet les causes pendantes, laissa la question ouverte; mais dans mon humble opinion elle ne peut recevoir une autre solution que celle donn\u00e9e par l'honorable juge en chef. 1ans le cas actuel on ne pouvait donc employer ni l'un ni l'autre de ces deux brefi,\u2014le bref de prohibition ne pouvant l'\u00eatre pour contr\u00f4ler les corps municipaux, et le bref d'injonction n'existant pas encore.\nFaudraitil conclure do l\u00e0 que la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'offrait aucun rem\u00e8de aux Intim\u00e9s pour se prot\u00e9ger contre 1 imposition dune taxi ill\u00e9gale et qu'il devenait en cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tendre l'application du bref de prohibition? Ce serait une grande erreur que de croire \u00e0 une telle lacune dans notre droit.Nonseulement le code municipal mais le droit commun offrait aussi aux Intim\u00e9s des moyens suffisants de protection Ils avaient d'abord contre la d\u00e9cision du conseil local, l'appel au conseil de comt\u00e9, droit qu'ils ont exerc\u00e9. Ils avaient aussi l'appel \u00e0 la Cour de Circuit. puis, d'apr\u00e8s le droit commun, le recours \u00e0 l'action n\u00e9gatoire pour emp\u00eacher la vente de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ([24]),\u2014 ii \u00e9tait aussi facile d'adopter le mode do l'action n\u00e9gatoire reconnu par les lois de la province de Qu\u00e9bec quo do recourir au bref de prohibition;\u2014et enfin l'action en dommages apr\u00e8s la vente pour la faire annuler. Ce n'est certainement pas une raison de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qui devait faire admettre outre tons ces diff\u00e9rents recours, celui du bref de prohibition que la loi n'a pas accord\u00e9 en pareil cas. Les moyens d'obtenir justice \u00e9taient assez nombreux sans cela. Pour ces raisons je suis d'avis qu'il n'y avait pas lieu au bref de prohibition.\nAdoptant cette mani\u00e8re do voir sur la premiere question, ii devient inutile que je me prononce sur la seconde, car je consid\u00e8re qu'elle n'est pas devant la Cour.\nHenry, J. :\u2014\nAfter a good deal of consideration, in fact all I have been able to give to this subject I have arrived at the conclusion that I should sustain the finding of the court below in reference to the question of the power of a judge of the Superior Court to issue such an order. On looking at the jurisprudence in France I find that there the courss are authorized to issue an ordre provisionel\u2014 a provisional orderaand it is necessary to the proper administration of justice, not only in Quebec, but in every part of the world, that a superior court of a country should exercise a summary jurisdiction to prevent immense wrong and injury being done by one party to another. If there were not such an inherent power in the court, or if the legislature did not think it necessary to enact it, one party might seize upon a valuable gold mine or other valuable property of another, and before the right and title to it could be tested the party would be left without any redress whatever except by an action to recover damages, and that, possibly, from a party who is not worth the cost of the suit. I take it, then, that Quebec always had in its jurisprudence the power, through one of its judges, of issuing some kind of process in the shape of an order to restrain the party from doing an irreparable injury to his neighbor's property. I have ascertained that such a recourse always existed in France and that being. the case I am free to say that the practice and the law applicable to such cases in France would be sufficient I think, to give to the Superior Court of Quebec the right to issue a provisional order. We are told however, that an action could be brought I believe it is called an action negatoire\u2014but, as I understand it that would be no stay of proceedings. It would not stop the party so going on with a trespass that might be disastrous in its consequences, and he might ruin, a large amount of the property of his neighbor. As I have said, before a decision could be had the property would be gone and no redress would foe left. I think under the circumstances therefore such a power was inherent in the court, independent of the legislature.\nI am free to say that I agree with my brother judges who expressed the opinion that the process in regard to what is called specially a writ of prohibition, does not apply to this case. At the time this process was commenced, there was no judicial action about to be taken and therefore there is nothing to which the writ could apply I need not consider whether the case was one in which a remedy could be given by a writ such as is issued in England. I do not think that the parties there could adopt the English practice in regard to the matter of injunction, but it is no matter. I agree to that extent with Judge Ramsay when saying that it is no matter if the court had the power to restrain a party it makes very little difference what you call it\u2014 provided it is sufficient to enable the other party to obtain redress in the case, so far as protecting property until the question as to the right to it is determined. Chief Justice Meredith, in his judgment in the case referred to says this is a case that has been often mooted and the want of such a power has been often felt. If I am right in the conclusion at which I have arrived, the judges were wrong in not putting it in force years and years before. I consider the jurisprudence of the country was defective without it but I find in a number of cases such a proceeding has been had. I find that on this point there is a difference of opinion among the judges of the province of Quebec.\nLooking at the whole case then I am inclined to sustain the judgment of the court below, and I am the more inclined to do it because I am of the opinion that the assessment is altogether wrong. The law authorized the parties to amend the assessment roll, but not to make a new roll two years in succession. Having, then, not amended the roll, but having taken the proceedings that were adopted of providing a new assessment roll altogether, they have clearly shown they did not amend the roll, but made a new roll, which they were not justified in doing. I am, therefore, of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be confirmed Taschereau, J. :\u2014\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal. On the merits of the case, that is to say, on the point submitted, whether the valuation roll in question was legally made or not, I really see nothing but a question of fact. On the question of law connected therewith at the argument whether a new valuation roll could be made in 18*76 there cannot be two opinions. The council in 1866 could amend the existing roll, but clearly could not then make a new roll. Now as a matter of fact what did they do? It is sufficient to take their own notice as publicly given of the deposit of their proceedings, in accordance with the municipal code, to see that they did unmistakably make a new roll in 1876. This roll is therefore a complete nullity.\nOn the question of the legality of the proceedings taken in this case to contest this valuation roll I am also of opinion with the court appealed from, that whatever name should be given or ought to have been given to these proceedings cannot affect the redress the plaintiffs have clearly established themselves to be entitled to in this case. In France,in matters requiring urgency, the judge could always grant un ordre provisoire ([25]).\nChief Justice Meredith's judgment, in Carter v. Breakey ([26]), relied upon before us by the appellants,has so little to do with the present case that it was not even noticed in the Montreal Court of Appeal. Judge Meredith held in that case, that the writ of injunction as known in England is not known in Lower Canada. This we have nothing to do with here. Judge Ramsay, speaking in the court appealed from, for the majority of the court, said that the name given to the writ is of no importance, and that it does not sgnify whether it be called a prohibition or an injunction. I add call it an ordonnance provisoire, or a mandamus, or a mandatory injuction, if preferred, and the result is the same. Then against Chief Justice Meredith s judgment in Carter v, Breakey, stands the late Judge Dorion's judgment in the very same case. The Chief Justice, it is true, says that Stuart and Casault, JJ., whom he had consulted, are of his opinion. But what shows conclusively that Stuart and Casault, JJ.'s, views cannot be invoked in this case by the appellants in support of their contention, is that these two judges, in Penlland v. La Corporation d'Hiibertville, held distinctly that a municipal corporation can be stoppdd from selling lands for taxes by the very same process taken by the respondents here.\nThen Bourgouin v. Montreal Northern Railway ([27]) is the judgment, and the unanimous judgment, of the Court of Appeal. And this fact must not be lost sight of when investigating what is the jurisprudence of Lower Canada on the point. At page 66 of the report of the case it will be seen, by the very words of the judgment itself, that the Court of Appeal maintained distinctly a writ of injunction. In the notes of the judges they seem to maintain it rather as a writ of mandawus. There the writ, as here, was to prevent the execution of an unlawful act. Call it mandamus here, if appellant prefers it, or a mandatory injunction. A writ of prohibition would prohibit from selling lands in questton\u2014a writ of injunction would enjoin not to sell such lands a writ of mandamus would order to cease the proceedings on and for the sale of these lands. Is the result not the same in the three cases? By an oversight, Chief Justice Dorion, who dissented from the majority of the Montreal Court of Appeal in this present case, said :\nA writ of injunction, on the contrary, is not a prerogative writ, is is issued under the provisions of the Quebec Act, 41 Vic, ch. 14. And, by section 4 of that Act, it is provided \" that no writ of injunction shall issue unless the person applying therefor first give good and sufficient security in the manner prescribed by and to the satisfaction of the court or a judge thereof, in the sum of six hundred dollars or any higher sum fixed by the said court or judge, for the costs and damages which the defendant or the person against whom the writ of injunction is directed may suffer by reason of the issue thereof\"\nNo security whatsoever is required for the writ of mandamus, and none has been given in the present case To allow a writ of prohibition to issue in a case where a writ of injunction is the proper remedy, would be to deprive a defendant from the substantial right of obtaining security, not only for his costs, but also for all damages he might suffer from the proceedings adopted against him. This alone would be a sufficient ground of* objection to prevent one writ from being used for another.\nNow, this was correct at the time when it was said, but cannot be applied to this case, as the proceedings therein were instituted eight days, or thereabouts, before the said Quebec Act 41 Vic. ch. 14 came into force. Consequently the respondents in this case did not deprive the appellants of the right of obtaining security for costs and damages\nIt has been said that in Bourgouin's case, an action n\u00e9gatoire had been first taken. That is so, but what is the difference? Where is there in the code anything authorizing such a writ during an action more than before such action? It seems to me, that if a party can take an action today and apply for such an order tomorrow he can take his action and obtain the order at the same time. Indeed, it is obvious that if this could not be done, the remedy would often be nugatory and fruitless.\nThen, here, there could be no action n\u00e9gatoire. What is an action n\u00e9gatoiee? It is, says Guyot ([28]) :\nUne action par lequelle nous d\u00e9nions droit de servitude \u00e0 celui qui le pr\u00e9tend sur notre heritage.\n\"An action n\u00e9gatoire is an action by which we deny a right of servitude that our adversary claims to have our our land.\" Now, there is nothing of the kind here. Morgan et al do not deny that their property is subject to the taxes regularly imposed by the municipal authority; and, then, this could hardly be called a servitude.\nThen in Carter v. Breakey it will be seen that Chief Justice Meredith saw a difference between it and Bourgouin's case, as in the first one, the contestation was purely and entirely between private individuals and on private matters, whilst in the last one, the corporation complained of by Bourgouin was a public corporation, and was sued as such. There also the parties complained of are public corporations, and their officers in the discharge of their public duties.\nI have mentioned Casault and Stuart, JJ., in Pentland v. Corporation d'H\u00e9bertville. Then add Torrance, J., who granted the order in this case. Rainville, J., who dismissed Cot\u00e9 et al's, demurrers, and three judges in appeal, Ramsay, Cross and Monk, JJ. Here are seven judges distinctly holding the proceedings as taken here to be legal and valid. Sanborn, J. ([29]), in Corporation of Sorel v. Armstrong, expressed himself in such a way that he may fairly be taken as having been of opinion that sales for taxes could be stopped as they have been here. Then Loranger, J., in the same case, had maintained the proceedings in the court of first instance. To these must be added the late Judge W. Dorion's judgment in Carter v. Breakey late Chief Justice Bowen in Usborne's case, and late Judge Gauthier in ex parte Paton, cited in Carter v. Breakey, who all three were of opinion that injunction, or an order equivalent to it, could be granted.\nThis makes twelve judges of the province of Quebec, who, either distinctly held that proceedings as taken here by respondents are legal and valid, or that an in- junction, not the writ, perhaps, known under that name in England, but an ordre provisiore to the same effect, did lie in the said province before the 41st Vic, Now on this last point, must be added the four judges of the Court of Appeal in the Bourgouin case I must say that the appellants have failed to make the clear, unmistakable, inevitable case, which, for my part, I would require to see before coming to the conclusion of revising the views and holdings of such an array of Lower Canada judges, more especially upon what, after all, is nothing but a question of practice, with which, as held in many instances by the privy council, and more particularly in Marchioness of Bute v. Mason ([30]) and Board of Orphans v. Kraeglins ([31]), a Court of Appeal ought not, as a general rule, to interfere.\nIt was argued that there was no summons in this case. But surely the writ as issued contained a summons. In fact, it is nothing else, on its very face, but a writ of summons, and it is upon such summons that the appellants appeared and pleaded, having been served with it, not within the shor1 delays authorized on prerogative writs, but within the delays required in ordinary actions. It was said that there is no declaration. But what is the requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, if not a declaration, or rather what is a declaration if not a requ\u00e9te libell\u00e9e? I take the first case I find on my table, Chevallier v. Cuvillier, and if reference is made to the declaration there, it will be seen that it is nothing else than a petition addressed to the superior court, alleging certain facts, and praying the court, petitioning the court, upon the proof of such facts, to grant the petitioner certain conclusions.\nMorgan, et al. the respondents, were perfectly justified in complaining of the most arbitrary and vexatious proceedings of the municipal authorities in the matter. When they instituted their proceedings in this case, no other remedy was available to them They were not obliged to appeal or act in any way when this valuation roll was made, or when these taxes were imposed. They could treat the whole thing as an absolute nullity, as they should have done, and wait till an attempt should be made to levy this unwarrantable taxation before acting.\nEven a judgment of a court of justice, if rendered without jurisdiction, can be so treated as a perfect nullity, as per Attorney General v. Lord Hotham ([32]), where it was held that \"Where a limited tribunal takes upon itself to exercise a jurisdiction which does not belong to it its decision amounts to nothing, and does not create any necessity for an appeal.\" If such is the case for the judgments of the courts of justice, surely, and \u00e2 fortori, it is so for the proceedings of these municipal corporations. The respondents had, in my opinion, a perfect right to treat the valuation roll in question as a complete nullity.\nI am of opinion to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nOn the first of March, 1878, the plaintiffs sued out of the superior court of the district of Montreal what by reference to the original document itself transmitted to this court appears to have been an ordinary writ (of summons), addressed u \u00e0 aucun des hussiers de Ia dite cour,\" whereby they were ordered to summon the defendants that they should appear in the said court in the city of Montreal on the fourteenth day of March then current to answer the demand which should be made against them for the causes mentioned in the requ\u00e9te libell\u00e9e thereunto annexed. This writ (of summons), together with the requ\u00e9te libell\u00e9e or declaration of the plaintiffs, stating their cause of action or matter of complaint was served upon all the defend\" ants named in the writ of summons upon the same first of March.\nThe plaintiffs in the declaration or requete libell\u00e9e so served stated the matter of their complaint to be in short substance, as follows :\u2014that they are proprietors of real property in the village of Woche-Hoche-laga, and assessed and taxed as such \u00b0 that in the year 1876 the corporation of that village, while there was a valid subsisting assessment roll for the municipality made in 1875, which by law was, and continued to be in force for three years and under the false \"pretence that there was no such roll nor any made since 1873, proceeded to make a new assessment roll, which by law could only be made every three years, for which, and other reasons stated in the declaration it was contended that the assessment roll so made in 1876 was wholly null and void as beyond the jurisdiction of the corporation to make. The declaration also alleged, that the school commissioners of the school municipalitv of the village had taken for the base of their roll the said illegal assessment roll, and that the corporation of the village and the commissioners of schools for the school municipality of the village had, illegally and with the object of troubling the. plaintiffs in the peaceable possession of their property, seized the real property of the plaintiffs, and had, through the secretary-treasurer of the municipality, the defendant Cot\u00e9, caused the same to be advertised for sale to realize thereby rates calculated upon the said illegal assessment roll, and the plaintiff therefore prayed that \"un bref de prohibition \" should issue out of the said court addressed to the defendants, enjoining them from selling and forbidding them to sell the real property of the plaintiffs so seized, or to proceed in any manner upon the said assessment roll of 1876 or to collect any taxes in virtue of that roll, and that the proceedings taken against the plaintiff's property might be declared to be illegal, void and of no effect, unless cause to the contrary should he shown by the defendants.\nThe defendants appeared to the writ of summons and filed an exception to the form, and they also by demurrer objected that no writ of prohibition lies in such a case; they pleaded also to the merits, denying the the truth of the allegations in the declaration, thereby raising an issue as to the validity of the assessment roll. The learned judge of the superior court maintained the action to be well founded, and pronounced judgment for the plaintiffs on the demurrers, but in favor of the defentants upon the issue as to the validity of the rolls, thereby holding the roll of 1876 to be valid as an amendment of the roll of 1875 which was admitted to have been duly made. From this judgment upon the merits the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, the majority of which court reversed the judgment of the superior court, holding the assessment roll impugned not to be an amendment of the roll of 1875, but to be a wholly new roll and absolutely null and void. Two of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal however, of whom the learned Chief Justice was one were of opinion that the plaintiff's action should be dismissed, upon the ground that in their judgment a writ of prohibition did not lie in such a case From this judgment the defentants have taken this appeal.\nNow, why the above writ of summons should be called a writ of prohibition, or anything else than an ordinary writ of summons I am unable to see. True it is that on the requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e there is endorsed a fiat signed by a judge, \"Let the writ issue,\" but the writ which did issue in fact was a writ of summons in the ordinary form, and which, both in its form and in the time given therein for appearing and answering the cause of action stated in the declaration served with the summons, conformed to the ordinary writ of summons. It is only in the prayer or conclusions of the requitelibell\u00e9e or declaration that the term \"writ of prohibition is used. In this term so used there is no magic \u2011the prayer or conclusions would be just the same in substance if instead of the words \" writ of prohibition \" had been used the word \" ordre, \" and as if the conclusion had been u that the defentants be enjoined by the order and decree of this honorable court from selling, and be forbidden to sell, &c., &c., or to proceed in any manner upon the said assessment roll of 1876; and that the proceedings taken against plaintiff's property be declared illegal and Void.\"\nIt is admitted, that if an action n\u00e9gatoire be brought the court has jurisdiction to restrain a defendant from disposing of or interfering with the property in respect of which the action is brought pending the litigation. If that can be done in such an action as an auxiliary remedy, the right arises not by reason of any article in the code to that effect, it must exist as a right incident to the court as a court of original civil jurisdiction, which the superior court is, and if such right exists as an essentially necessary instrument m administering justice as auxilliary to an action, upon what principle can it be denied 1o exist as a substantive remedy and as the only one which, when, after hearing of the case upon the merits, the court comes to give judgment, would be effectual? It is the privilege and the duty of every Court of original civil jurisdiction to provide a remedy suitable to the redress of every wrong. Judge Rainville in Bourgouin v. Mdlhiot ([33]), recognizing this principle, says : Under the ancient French law there war no wrong without a remedy, and certainly under the ancient law of France, if any one was about to commit an illegal act against a third person, such third person always had a remedy.\nThis principle pervades everysystem of jurisprudence. Now in the case before us there appears no defect in the institution of the suit. The defentants were served with a writ of summons in the ordinary form, and were thereby given fourteen days to appear and answer the complaint served with the summons in that complaint; the plaintiffs alleged a trouble de droit, for which they asked a suitable remedy and the only one which in the circumstances would be effective namely that the defendants should be restrained from selling the plaintiffs' land for the purpose of realizing a sum of money as taxes rated, not upon the assessment contained in the only legal assessment roll affecting the lands, but upon an amount stated in an assessment roll which is wholly illegal and void and made by the defendant municipality contrary to law, and, in fact, without any jurisdiction under the circumstances to make it Under these circumstances, there is nothing in the objection, as it apears to me unless it be carried to the extent of insisting that, even though in an action properly instituted by writ of summons, with the ordinary delays for appearing, &c, the plaintiffs should establish, upon an exception peremptoire being pleaded, raising an issue upon the validity of the assessment roll that it was absolutely illegal and void, the court is powerless to give by final judgment or decree at the hearing any redress; and that a superior court of original jurisdiction is so powerless I cannot admit.\nIn the Mayor of Sorel v. Armstrong ([34]), the proceeding by writ of prohibition was disallowed upon the ground that the plaintiff alleged no want of jurisdiction in the municipality to make the assessment upon the land there assessed and. the claim for relief which the plaintiff relied upon was in the nature of a complaint for a wrong which he alleged was done him in his property being seized to pay a rate assessed upon land which did not belong to him. That case can be of no authority in a case like the present, unless it be to establish the applicability of the writ of prohibition to a case like the present\u2014a position which I understand to have been asserted from time to time by no less than eleven judges of the province of Quebec.\nSanborn, J , in giving judgment against the maintenance of the writ of prohibition in that case expresses his opinion to be that where municipal councils exercise jurisdiction which is in its nature judicial, and usurp power not given by law, a writ of prohibition may issue to restrain them from proceeding with such usurpation. Now, this is the very thing charged here, namely, that while an assessment roll, which was valid and binding for three years from 1875, was in existence, the municipality in 1876, instead of revising that assessment roll and making alterations therein as they might by law have done, made a wholly new assessment roll, superseding the legally existing one, which they had no jurisdiction or authority by law to make. The whole question in the case is: Was the roll which was made in 1876 a revision or amendment of the roll of 1875? or was it a wholly new and independent rolll If the former it was legal, and the plaintiffs have no cause of action or locus standi in curi\u00e1; if the latter, it was wholly illegal and beyond the jurisdiction of the municipality to make, and if beyond their jurisdiction, then, upon the principle enunciated by Sanborn, J., in the Mayor of Sorel v. Armstrong, the writ of prohibition lies; so that, according to that principle, the question of the validity of the assessment the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in appeal declares.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellants: Mousseau & Archambault.\nAttorneys for respondents: Barnard, Monk & Beau-champ.\n[1] See High on Extraordinary\n[2] P. 536.

This draft was transferred to a bank in Toledo and the amount of it received by W. from the bank, and the corn, having been insured by W. for his own benefit, was shipped by him under a bill of lading, which, together with the policy of insurance, was assigned by him to the same bank. The bank forwarded the draft, policy, and bill of lading to their agents at Belleville, with instructions that the corn was not to be delivered until the draft was paid. The draft was accepted by C. et al., but the cargo arriving at Belleville in a damaged and heated condition, between the dates of the acceptance and the maturity of the said draft, C. et al refused to receive it and afterwards to pay draft at maturity. Thereupon the bank and W, sold the cargo for behalf of whom it might concern, credited C. et al. with the proceeds on account of draft, and W, filed a bill to recover balance and interest. Held, Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, (Strong, J., dissenting), That the contract was not one of agency and that the property in the corn remained by the act of W. in himself and his assignees, until after the arrival of the corn at Belleville and payment of the draft; and the damage to the corn having occurred while the property in it continued to be in W. and his assignees, C. et al. should not bear the loss.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, whereby the decree pronounced in favor of the appellants by the Court of Chancery for Ontario, was reversed with costs, and a decree made in favor of the respondent[1].\nThis was a bill filed in the Court of Chancery for Ontario to recover portion of the amount of a bill of exchange drawn by the respondent on the appellants by their request and accepted by them in payment of a cargo of corn purchased and shipped by the respondent, a commission merchant, residing at Toledo, Ohio, on the order and for account of the appellants, distillers, at Belleville, Ontario. Upon the arrival at Belleville of the cargo, between the dates of the acceptance and the maturity of the said draft, the appellants refused to receive it and afterwards to pay the said draft at maturity, alleging the corn to be heated and useless, and the respondent thereupon sold the cargo for behalf of whom it might concern and for the best price he could obtain, giving the appellants credit for the proceeds on account of their said acceptance, and sued appellants for the balance and interest. The appellants, by their answer, set up that they had contracted with the respondent for the delivery of the corn in good order, at Belleville, and that they had refused to honor their acceptance, as the corn was discovered to be musty and in bad condition on its arrival.\nThe pleadings and facts are fully set out in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Walter Cassels for appellants:\nThe appellants do not admit that there is any evidence showing that they were contracting with the plaintiff as an agent in the matter, and on the contrary, as will be shown hereafter, the conduct of the plaintiff shows conclusively that he was not contracting as a commission agent, but that he was contracting as a principal.\nThe Court of Appeal assume that under the true construction of the contract the defendants were entering into a contract whereby they only agreed to pay for the corn when delivered in Belleville. It is clear from the correspondence and telegrams which passed between the parties that such was the intention on the part of the defendant, and the appellants submit that unless it is determined that a commission agent cannot enter into a contract whereby he binds himself to deliver at Belleville, then the contract must be construed according to its legal effect, and it is of no consequence whether the plaintiff was a commission agent or not.\nThis was the first contract entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants. It appears from the evidence of the plaintiff himself that the ordinary rate of commission which should be charged was one-half cent a bushel. It appears that in this case however, the plaintiff purchased the corn in question from different people. It appears that he purchased from Howe, Son & Co, about 6,600 bushels at forty-one cents. In order to fulfil his contract the plaintiff borrowed the remainder of the corn to make up the cargo from King & Co., and on the following Monday purchased corn at 40\u00bd cents and replaced with the corn so purchased that borrowed from King & Co., therefore in regard to the portion of the corn so purchased the plaintiff so purchased it at a half a cent a bushel less than charged to the defendants these appellants. This difference would, had the plaintiff been acting as agent in the matter, have accrued to the benefit of the defendants, but the plaintiff appropriated this difference for his own use.\nWe submit that it is of no consequence what the amount of the commission retained by the plaintiff was, whether a large or a small sum. It is a cogent and convincing piece of evidence that the plaintiff was not acting as agent in the matter, because if he was, the benefit of the reduction should have gone to the purchaser. The position assumed by the Court of Appeal, viz., that if he had had to pay more to King & Co., than forty-one cents, the plaintiff would have been the loser, demonstrates the force of this contention.\nIn due course, as appears by the evidence, the corn would have reached Belleville within five days after leaving Toledo. If the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct, so soon as the corn reached Belleville it would be the property of the defendants, the present appellants. The plaintiff chose to give ten days time within which the defendants were to pay for the corn, but the plaintiff assigned to the Merchants\u2019 Bank, in Toledo, the bill of lading and the policy of insurance, and this bill of lading and policy of insurance were transmitted to Belleville with instructions that the corn was not to be delivered over until payment of the draft. Therefore, had the vessel not been detained on the voyage the corn would have been at the wharf in Belleville for five or six days before the defendants could have obtained the same, pending the maturity of the draft. Again, when the corn was damaged the plaintiff without reference to the defendants, the present appellants, applies to the insurance company for the insurance due by reason of the damage to the corn. The insurance company and the plaintiff, each appointing an arbitrator, an award is made assessing the amount due. All this is done in the absence of the present appellants and without reference to them. Whereas if the contention of the plaintiff and the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct, the plaintiff had no right to the insurance money, and any loss due by the insurance company was payable to the present appellants. The plaintiff also, without reference to the present appellants, sold the corn in question.\nWe contend, also, that the plaintiff was a vendor. If this be so, the question is one entirely of the construction of the contract under telegrams A & B especially the words \u201cwill you deliver here at 47.\u201d Under this contract the property would have remained vested in the plaintiff.\nIn addition to the authorities referred to in the judgment of the Court of Appeal we would refer to Ireland v. Livingstone[2]; Jenkins v. Brown[3]; Addison on Contracts[4]; Kirchner v. Venus[5]; Lewis v. Marshall[6]; Leake on Contracts[7]; and Bartlett v. Pentland[8]; Parsons on Contracts[9]; Robinson v. Mollet[10]; Sotilichos v. Kemp[11]; Hodgson v. Davies[12]; Rogers v. Woodruff[13]; Inglebright v. Hammond[14]; Hayes v. Nesbill[15].\nAs to the construction of the contract, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have held that the con- tract contended for by these appellants is the correct one. We would refer to Dunlop v. Lambert[16]; Gilmour v. Supple[17]; Leake on Contracts[18]; Story on Contracts[19]; Bundy v. Johnson[20]; M\u2019Giver in v. James[21].\nMr. Bethune, Q.C, and Mr. Machar, for respondent:\nThe evidence establishes that the plaintiff acted in the transaction of the purchase of the cargo of corn in question herein as the agent of the defendants, as was held by the Court of Appeal, and therefore the cargo was at the risk of the defendants from the time it was shipped on board the schooner \u201cAnnandale\u201d\nThe defendants, having, after receipt of advice from the plaintiff of the purchase by him for their account and risk (in terms of the invoice enclosed in plaintiff\u2019s letter of advice) without objection or dissent, accepted the bill of exchange drawn by plaintiff at their request, accompanied by the bill of laiding and other shipping documents, must be held to have thereby adopted the construction of their order in the sense understood and now contended by the plaintiff, and could not afterwards repudiate their engagement under pretence of a different construction, and cannot now be heard to advance a different contention.\nThe defendants at all events by their silence and subsequent acceptance recognized and ratified the plaintiff\u2019s action as in compliance with their instructions.\nThe evidence establishes (and it was conceded by the defendants upon the argument at the trial) that the said cargo when shipped was in good order and condition, and was of the quality or description known as old high mixed corn, and therefore the responsibility for any deterioration or alteration in its condition observable upon its arrival at Belleville was not in anywise due to or chargeable against the plaintiff.\nThe evidence further establishes that the said cargo was really paid for by the defendants, the plaintiff not having advanced any money of his own in order to pay for the same, but the whole price, including commission, insurance, &c., was derived through the draft upon the defendants, which was discounted at the Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Toledo, and was accepted by the defendants upon presentation to them.\nThe learned counsel then referred:\nA.\u2014As to the relation of agency between plaintiff and defendants inter se and construction of orders and ratification of acts: Benjamin on Sales (2nd Am. ed.), p. 476; Story on Agency (8th ed.), ss. 33 (note 3), 34, 74-77, 82, 111, 112, 199 (note 6), 400-401 a.; Paley on Agency, by Boyd, 248, 373, 382; 2 Bell\u2019s Commentaries, \u00a7 799-802.\nEnglish cases\u2014Ireland v.

Mr. Walter Cassels in reply.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff is doing business as a commission merchant at Toledo, in the U.S.A. The defendants are grain dealers, residing and doing business at Belleville, in the dominion of Canada. This was the first business transaction between the parties; defendants had had dealings with plaintiff\u2019s brother, in whose employ-plaintiff was, and to whose business he succeeded. The communications between the parties in reference to the matters in controversy were by means of telegrams, and from these telegrams must be gathered the contract in this case. The first, of which we have any evidence, was from the plaintiff to one of the defendants, and is as follows:\n1 Telegram.\u2014(A.)\u2014Toledo, Sept. 13th, 1878. To H. Corby, jun., Belleville, Ont.: Schooner Annandale obtainable 5c., vessel paying unloading. High mixed costing 47.\nGeo. E. Williams.\nIt is very obvious that this must have been preceded by some inquiry as to the transportation and cost of corn in the Toledo market; if so, it must have been by letter or telegram, the contents of which either party might have shown; as neither did do so, it may be inferred that any communication which did take place would throw no additional light in support of the contention on either side.\nTo this telegram of the 13th, defendants on the same day reply,\n(B.)

E. Williams.\nTo Messrs. H. Corby & Sons, Belleville, Ont.\nThis draft was transferred by the plaintiff to the Merchants\u2019 National Bank, Toledo, and the amount of it realized from them by plaintiff; and with it the bill of lading and policy of insurance were handed to the bank as security for the payment of the draft, the amount of which they had so advanced to plaintiff. The plaintiff thus describes his mode of dealing with the bank:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Whose name was used in the purchase of that corn? A.\u2014The general custom is for us to notify our banks what orders we have, and they supply us with the currency, and we agree to give them a bill of lading. The bank furnishes the money on my promise to give them the bill of lading and draft on our customer when the corn is loaded, and in this case it was on Corby & Son, With this arrangement, it must be borne in mind, the defendants had no connection. Under ordinary circumstances in the usual course of dealing, when payment was made by draft at sight it would no doubt work satisfactorily to all parties, but was in my opinion quite inapplicable to such a case as this, which, as the witness says, \u201cwas out of the usual course, in that time was asked in payment.\u201d The bill of lading was by the Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Toledo indorsed over with the draft and policy of insurance and transmitted to the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada, Belleville, for collection and remittance, with instructions to that bank not to hand over the bill of lading or allow the cargo to be delivered till the draft was paid.\nThe draft was accepted by defendants on the 19th September, 1878.\nThe evidence shows that under ordinary circumstances the voyage between Toledo and Belleville is under five days, so that, as the vessel sailed on the same day the draft was drawn and dated, the cargo ought in due course, without accident, to have reached Belleville eight days before the draft became due; in fact the grain arrived at Belleville several days before the draft fell due, in a damaged condition, having been injured in course of transportation, and defendants refused to have anything to do with it. The plaintiff and the bank took possession of the cargo, disposed of the same and settled with the underwriters and discharged them. On the draft maturing, the defendants allowed it to go to protest, denying any liability to pay for the corn, hence the present action to recover the difference between what the bank and plaintiff received on account of insurance and the amount of the draft.\nThe defendants resist this claim on two grounds. First, that under the contract, as it is to be collected from those telegrams, the plaintiff agreed to deliver the corn in good condition at Belleville for 47 cents, and, not having done so, cannot recover the price; and secondly, that plaintiff, having assigned the bill of lading and policy of insurance to the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Toledo, and the same having been transmitted by them to Belleville with instructions that the corn was not to be delivered to defendants until payment of the draft, no property passed to defendants and the corn continued and was at the time of its injury the property and at the risk of plaintiff or the bank and not of the defendants.\nAs to the first point, had plaintiff in reply to the question in defendants\u2019 telegram of the 13th Sept., 78, \u201cwill you deliver here at 47c.,\u201d simply assented thereto, I should have found it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to put any other construction on the language used than that plaintiff was to deliver the corn at Belleville; but plaintiff does not so answer, his reply is \u201coffer cargo 47 cost, freight, commission, insurance.\u201d I think we have here a clear interpretation of the language of defendants\u2019 telegrams, as understood by plaintiff, viz., that the corn was only to cost the defendants 47 cents at Belleville, including cost, freight, commission and insurance, and the subsequent telegram of the 14th I think supports this view, for there he adds this additional item, \u201cvessel paying unloading expenses.\u201d If plaintiff was to deliver at Belleville at 47 cents, what possible interest had defendants in any of these items, cost, freight, commission, insurance, or unloading expenses? But defendants\u2019 next telegram still more strongly confirms this, and shows it was defendants\u2019 view also, for plaintiff, having, as we have seen, mentioned \u201cunloading expenses,\u201d defendants, in their telegram in reply accepting plaintiff\u2019s offer, seem to have thought that if there might have been a question as to the unloading expenses, there might also be as to the loading expenses. To set that at rest, as plaintiff had already done as to the unloading, defendants still further expressed, or rather make more manifest the meaning of the first telegram (\u201cdelivered here,\u201d) or at any rate of their understanding of plaintiff\u2019s offer, by saying will take 13,000 old high mixed 47 delivered \u201chere, vessel paying loading.\u201d\nIf by 47 delivered here, it was intended that the corn was to be delivered by plaintiff at Belleville, and defendants were to have nothing to do with it till it was so delivered, what concern was it of defendants what the commissions cost, or what commissions and freight were paid, or whether the corn was insured or not; or what matter was it to defendants whether the plaintiff or the vessel paid the expense of loading or unloading? Clearly the stipulations that defendants were to receive the corn free of all these charges must have been based on the idea that the corn was shipped at their risk, and were inserted for the protection of the defendants; and to show that, though the corn was, on shipment and delivery of shipping papers to defendants, and the accepting the draft, to be defendants, it was only to cost them 47 cents at Belleville; if otherwise, and if plaintiff was bound to deliver at Belleville, and until so delivered the corn was to be the property and at the risk of plaintiff, all this as to these expenses would be meaningless. I therefore think the true construction of the agreement between these parties is not, as defendants contend, that plaintiff bound himself to deliver at Belleville this corn to defendants in good condition, and that until so delivered it was to be at plaintiff\u2019s risk.\nI am unable to distinguish this case from that of Tregelles v. Sewell[34]. The principles and reasons that induced the Court of Exchequer and the Exchequer Chamber, (on a contract whereby plaintiffs bought of defendants 300 tons of old bridge rails at \u00a35 14s. 6d. per ton, delivered at Hxrburgh, cost, freight and insurance; payment by net cash in London, less freight, upon handing bill of lading and policy of insurance; a dock company\u2019s weight note or captain\u2019s signature for weight \u201cto be taken by buyers, as a voucher for the quantity shipped,\u201d) to hold that the true construction of the contract was that the defendant did not undertake to deliver the iron at Harburgh, but that when he put it on board a ship bound for that place and handed to the plaintiffs the policy of insurance and other documents, his liability ceased and the goods were at the risk of the purchaser, are applicable, in my opinion, to the facts of this case. When the case of Tregelles v. Sewell was in the Common Pleas, Martin, B., who had tried the cause and who on trial entertained a strong impression that under the contract defendant was bound to deliver the iron at Harhurgh, says on the argument that his view was altered by considering that a document of this kind ought to be construed according to the known practice of merchants in respect of such transactions, and adds:\nThe goods were to be put on board by the vendor, and he was to receive a dock company\u2019s receipt for the weight or the signature of the captain, and he was to take that to the vendors, who were then to pay bim at the rate of \u00a35 14s. 6d. a ton, deducting the amount of the freight. That would be a common and ordinary transaction. Then the question is whether the insertion of the words, delivered at Harburgh, costs, freight and insurance, leads to a different conclusion. It seems to me that their more natural meaning is the true meaning, and that when \u00a35 14s. 6d. was mentioned the parties,, were desirous of ascertaining beyond all doubt what was included in that amount. It is as if they had said: \u201cTake notice the \u00a35 14s. 6d. is to cover the cost of the iron, the freight from London to Harburgh, and the premium on the policy of insurance.\u201d\nTherefore he says:\nOn consideration I think the true meaning of the contract is this: When you, the defendant, have performed what you were bound to do, and put the goods on board a ship destined for Harburgh, and handed me the bill of lading and a policy of insurance, I will pay you \u00a35 14s. 6d. per ton, less the freight.\nIt is true in that case that payment was to be by net cash in London, less freight upon handing bill of lading and policy of insurance, but in what respect in principle does that differ from this case? Here the payment was to be by draft at ten days, and plaintiff was to ship to defendants and clearly was to insure the corn, and when he was in a position to hand over the bill of lading and policy of insurance he was entitled to require acceptance of the draft, but un questionably not before. Had he done so the property would, in my opinion, have passed to defendants and have been at their risk. These telegrams are equivalent to the construction as suggested by Pollock, B.[35]:\nI buy of you; you are to ship and insure the goods, which are to go to Harburgh, (Belleville), and if you do all that, I will pay you for them, (not in London), but by accepting a draft for ten days.\nIf, then, it is not the true construction of these telegrams that plaintiff agreed to deliver the corn at Belleville, then, as to the second point, the only other construction must necessarily be, that in consideration of the acceptance of a draft at ten days, plaintiff bound himself to ship to defendants the corn on boand a certain vessel at Toledo, deliverable to defendants by the vessel on its arrival at Belleville, and to insure it for defendants\u2019 benefit, and on defendants\u2019 acceptance of the draft at ten days, to hand the necessary shipping papers over to defendants to vest the property in them and enable them to deal with and obtain possession of it on the arrival of the vessel at Belleville. The defendants, by accepting the draft, clearly fulfilled their part of the contract Did plaintiff then so fulfil his as to entitle him to recover from defendants the amount of the draft, or rather the price of the corn? or was there a failure of consideration relieving defendants from the obligation of paying the draft to plaintiff, or rather of paying plaintiff for the balance claimed to be due, after crediting the amount received from the insurance company for the price of the corn? It appears to me the plaintiff entirely failed in the fulfilment of his contract. It cannot be gainsaid that the defendants never received the corn and never were placed in a position to receive it, or entitled in any way to deal or interfere with it. When it was agreed that the corn should be paid for by draft at \u00cf0 days, it was no part of the contract that defendants should not be entitled to the corn until payment of the draft; the contract clearly was that the corn should be shipped to defendants, and on acceptance of draft be deliverable to them by the carrier on arrival at Belleville, After shipment and obtaining acceptance of the draft, plaintiff was to retain no property in or right to the corn, except possibly his right of stoppage in transitu. But plaintiff never so shipped the corn, to defendants, never parted with the property or control of the corn and never placed defendants, though they accepted the draft, in a position to demand or be entitled to receive delivery of the corn on its arrival at Belleville; onthe contrary, the plaintiff shipped the corn deliverable to the Merchants Bank of Toledo, and most clearly never could have intended that the property should pass, or the bill of lading be handed to defendants, until they paid the draft. The plaintiff without doubt made, outside of his contract, a conditional appropriation of these goods on payment of the draft, instead of an absolute appropriation on acceptance of the draft. He clearly, to use the words of Cotton, L.J., in Mirabila v. Imperial Ottoman Bank[36]: Made use of the power of disposition which he had under the bill of lading for the purpose of entirely withdrawing the cargo from the contract.\nBy shipping the corn to the order of the bank and transferring to them the bill of lading and policy of insurance, he disabled himself from fulfilling his contract with defendants. For if the bill of lading was to be held by the bank as security till the draft was paid, as we shall see was done in this case, then the result necessarily was that the defendants could not be entitled to receive the goods on the arrival at Belleville, which it was the clear intention, as gathered from the telegrams, he should do, unless indeed he should pay the draft on the arrival of the goods, in which case he would be deprived of the credit of ten days, on which terms he agreed to buy the corn. To say under such circumstances that the property in this corn had passed to defendants and was at their risk, seems to me preposterous. Suppose the corn had arrived at Belleville in due course, eight days before the maturity of the bill, what was to become of the corn? who was to take charge of it? at whose risk was it to be during those days? where is there anything in the telegrams justifying or authorizing plaintiff to transfer this corn to the bank, or authorizing the plaintiff or the bank to hold it after acceptance till the falling due of the draft? The vessel under the bill of lading would be entitled to unload on arrival; to whom was the cargo to be delivered? not certainly to the defendants. The bank held the bill of lading, to them only could the master deliver the cargo, and yet what is there in these telegrams to justify the detention from defendants of the corn for those days, or so detaining the corn, to impose any duty or risk in respect thereof on defendants. It is to my mind abundantly clear that all plaintiffs dealings with the cargo, in transferring it to the bank and subsequently in disposing of the corn after being damaged, and settling with the underwriters in reference to the damage it sustained, are entirely inconsistent with any idea of the property vesting in defendants or being at their risk, and equally so with the contract, as indicated by these telegrams. Plaintiff, instead of shipping the corn to and insuring it for the defendants, reserved to himself a jus disponendi, by virtue of which he, for his own purpose, dealt with the corn in a manner wholly inconsistent with the property vesting in the defendants, and wholly inconsistent with his contract, whereby the property in the corn continued in the plaintiff or his assignee the bank, and so, never having vested in, was never at the risk of, defendants, and therefore the consideration for which the draft was accepted wholly failed. If the plaintiff\u2019s contention could be sustained, it would amount to this, that he was not only not bound to deliver the goods at Belleville, but that he was not bound to ship the goods to the defendants; that he wan not only entitled to the acceptance given in payment of the goods and to use it for his own purposes, but he was also entitled to retain the control over his goods and use them for his own benefit, as in this case, for the purposes of realizing on the acceptance, and in so using them so to deal with them as to put it out of the power of the defendants, though they had fulfilled their contract by accepting the draft, to claim or receive delivery of the goods on their arrival at Belleville, and also so to insure the goods for his own benefit and deal with the insurance company in relation thereto, without reference to the defendants, and still at the same time, while so retaining the property in and the control and disposition of the goods and the insurance thereof, they were to be at the defendants\u2019 risk. Had plaintiff shipped the corn and effected the insurance for defendants\u2019 benefit, as the contract con- templates he should do, and on acceptance of the draft, had handed the necessary papers, that is, the invoice, the bill of lading and policy of insurance, to the defendants, I think there can be no doubt the property in the corn would have passed to the defendants, and it would have been at their risk; the amount of the insurance money would then be received by them, and the plaintiff would be entitled in this case to recover the amount of the draft, the price of the corn. But plaintiffs conduct having been the exact opposite of this, whereby he changed the whole character of the operation, I think he has no right to claim from defendants the price of the corn, inasmuch as he never had parted with the possession or property except to the bank.\nBut that we are reversing the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I should not have deemed it necessary to refer to any authorities to establish that in this case the property never passed to the defendants, and therefore was never at defendants\u2019 risk. I think the following cases, and those therein referred to, will place this beyond all doubt. Benjamin on Sales[37]:\nHowever definite and complete, therefore, may be the determination of election on the part of the vendor, when the contract has left him the choice of appropriation, the property will not pass if his acts show clearly his purpose to retain the ownership, notwithstanding such appropriation.\nThe cases which illustrate this proposition arise chiefly where the parties live at a distance from each other, where they contract by correspondence, and where the vendor is desirous of securing himself against the insolvency or default of the buyer. If A., in New York, orders goods from B., in Liverpool, without sending the money for them, there are two modes usually resorted to, among merchants, by which B. may execute the order without assuming the risk of A\u2019s inability or refusal to pay for the goods on arrival. B. may take the bill of lading, making the goods deliverable to his own order or that of his agent in New York, and send it to his agent, with instructions not to transfer it to A., except on payment of the goods. Or B. may not choose to advance the money in Liverpool, and may draw a bill of exchange for the price of the goods on A., and sell the bill to a Liverpool banker, transferring to the banker the bill of lading for the goods to be delivered to A., on payment of the bill of exchange. Now in both these modes of doing the business, it is impossible to infer that B. had the least idea of passing the property to A., at the time of appropriating the goods to the contract. So that although he may write to A. and specify the packages and marks by which the goods may be identified, and although he may accompany this with an invoice stating plainly that these specific goods are shipped for A\u2019s account, and in accordance with A\u2019s order, making his election final and determinate, the property in the goods will nevertheless remain in B., or in the banker, as the case may be, till the bill of lading has been indorsed and delivered up to A.\nMr. Benjamin says this principle, inter alia, is established by the authorities[38]:\nSecondly.\u2014Where goods are delivered on board of a vessel to be carried, and a bill of lading is taken, the delivery by the vendor is not a delivery to the buyer, but to the captain as bailee for delivery to the person indicated by the bill of lading, as the one for whom they are to be carried. This principle runs through all the cases, and is clearly enunciated by Parke, B., in Wait v. Baker[39] and by Byles, J., in Moakes v. Nicholson[40], and the above two points are approved as an accurate statement of the law by Lord Chelmsford in Shepherd v. Harrison[41].\nThirdly.\u2014The fact of making the bill of lading deliverable to the order of the vendor is, when not rebutted by evidence to the contrary, almost decisive to show his intention to reserve the jus disponendi, and to prevent the property from passing to the vendee[42].\nIn Shepherd v. Harrison[43] Lord Chelmsford says:\nMy Lords, in a book to which my learned friend near me (Lord Cairns) has referred me, and which appears to be very ably written, on the sale of personal property, the authorities on the subject of reservation of the jus disponendi are all collected, and the whole matter is summed up clearly and distinctly in the following passage.\n(quoting the 1st and 2nd.) Loid Westbury[44]:\nThe house at Pernambuco accepted a commission and agency to buy cotton on behalf of Shepherd & Co., the present appellants. They did so, and they paid for that cotton out of their own money. It was expressly agreed that funds which they happened to be in possession of, belonging to Shepherd & Co., should be altogether separated from the transaction, and should not be resorted to for the purposes of the cotton purchase. They shipped the cotton on board the Olinda\u2014I am speaking of the 200 bales\u2014and when they delivered the cotton to the captain of the Olinda, they took from him the ordinary bill of lading to their own order.\nNow, what was the effect of that transaction in law and according to mercantile usage? The effect was this\u2014that they controlled the possession of the captain, and made the captain accountable to deliver the cotton to the holder of the bill of lading. The bill of lading was the symbol of property, and by taking the bill of lading they kept to themselves the right of dealing with the property shipped on board the vessel. They also kept to themselves the right of demanding possession from the captain. They had, therefore, all the incidents of property vested in themselves. Now that was by no means inconsistent with the special terms of the shipment, namely, that the cotton was shipped on account of and at the risk of the buyers. That is perfectly consistent with the property, as evidenced by the bill of lading remaining in the possession of the vendors of the cotton in question.\nLord Cairns[45]:\nThere was an order given to the house at Pernambuco to buy and ship cotton. Two portions of the cotton were shipped in the Capella and the La Plata, and a third portion in the Olinda. In the invoice the goods are described as being shipped on account and at the risk of the plaintiff. But along with the invoice a bill of lading was taken from the captain making the cotton deliverable, not to the plaintiff, but to the shipper on board. It is perfectly well settled that, in that state of things, the entry upon the invoice stating the goods to be shipped on account and at the risk of the consignee is not conclusive, but may be overruled by the circumstance of the jus disponendi being reserved by the shipper through the medium of the bill of lading.\nIn Gabarron v. Kreeft[46] Bramwell, B., thus expresses himself:\nThen there is the case of Falke v. Fletcher[47] in which Willes, J., uses expressions which go to shew that a shipper may ship saying nothing, and then demand a bill of lading in exchange for the mate\u2019s receipt on such form as he pleases. Wait v. Baker[48] is not in point, because there the vendor had a right of lien. But Parke, B., said: \u201cThe delivery of the goods on board the ship was not a delivery of them to the defendant, but a delivery to the captain to be carried under a bill of lading, and that bill of lading indicated the person for whom they were to be carried,\u201d\nHe said the sameo thing in Van Casteel v. Booker[49]. In Moakes v. Nicholson[50] it was held that retaining the bill of lading, though made out in the buyer\u2019s name, prevented the passing of the property. There, however, the vendor had a lien. * * *\nThe cases seem to me to show that the act of shipment is not completed till the bill of lading is given; that if what is shipped is the shippers property till shipped on account of the shipowner or charterer, it remains uncertain on whose account it is shipped, and is not shipped on the latter\u2019s account till the bill of lading is given deliverable to him.\n* * *\nI feel bound by the authorities, which perhaps establish a more convenient state of law than would exist if bills of lading might be got deliverable to one person while the property was in another.\nAnd Cleasby, B.,[51] says:\nBut upon the effect of delivering a cargo contracted for on board the vessel of the vendee, the authorities are too numerous to refer to. I may mention Turner v. Trustees of the Liverpool Docks[52] as an early, one (with Ellershaw v. Magniac[53] in the note in that case) and Shepherd v. Harrison[54] as the last. The effect of these is that the delivering of goods contracted for on board a ship when a bill of lading is taken is not a delivery to the buyer, but to the captain as bailee to deliver to the person indicated by the bill of lading, and that this may equally apply where the ship is the ship of the vendee. In Browne v. Hare[55], in the course of the argument Waite v. Baker being mentioned, Crompton, J., says:\nIn that case the vendor kept his hand upon the goods by not indorsing the bill of lading to the vendee.\nAnd again he says:\nIn Turner v. The Trustees of the Liverpool Docks[56] the Court seem to affirm the proposition, that if a vendor says: \u201cI will send goods so as to be delivered if the vendee pays for them,\u201d it shows that he is shipping to himself.\nErle, J., delivering the judgment of the Court, says:\nThe contract was for the purchase of unascertained goods, and the question has been, when the property passed. For the answer the contract must be resorted to; and under that we think the property passed when the goods were placed \u201cfree on board,\u201d in performance of the contract.\nIn this class of cases the passing of the property may depend according to the contract, either on mutual consent of both parties, or on the act of the vendor communicated to the purchaser, or on the act of the vendor alone. Here it is passed by the act of the vendor alone. If the bill of lading had made the goods \u201cto be delivered to the order of the consignee,\u201d the passing of the property would be clear. The bill of lading made them \u201cto be delivered to the order of the consignor,\u201d and he indorsed it to the order of the consignee, and sent it to his agent for the consignee. Thus the real question has been on the intention with which the bill of of lading was taken in this form: whether the consignor shipped the goods in performance of his contract to place them \u201cfree on board;\u201d or for the purpose of retaining a control over them and continuing to be owner, contrary to the contract, as in the case of Waite v. Baker[57], and as is explained in Turner v. The Trustees of the Liverpool Docks[58], and Van Casteel v. Booker[59].\nIn a note to this case[60], citing Couturie v. Hastie[61], it was said:\nThe goods are either shipped free on board, when they are thenceforward at the risk of the vendee, or they are shipped \u201cto arrive\u201d, which saves the vendee from all risk till they are safely brought to port. In Mirabita v. Imperial Ottoman Bank[62], Bramwell, L.J., says:\nA long series of authorities beginning with Waite v. Baker[63], and ending with Ogg v. Shuter[64] is cited.\nIt is almost superfluous to say that by these authorities I am bound, that I pay them unlimited respect, and I may add that I do so the more readily as I think the rule they establish is a beneficial one. But what is that rule? It is somewhat variously expressed as being either that the property remains in the shipper, or that he has a jus disponendi, Undoubtedly he has a property or power which enables him to confer a title on a pledgee or vendee, though in breach of his contract with the vendor.\nThis appears from Waite v. Baker[65]; Gabarron v. Kreeft[66]; and to some extent from Ellershaw v. Magniac[67].\nAnd Cotton, L.J., in whose judgment Bramwell, L.J., said he entirely agreed, thus states the law[68]:\nUnder a contract for sale of chattels not specific the property does not pass to the purchaser unless there is afterwards an appropriation of the specific chattels to pass under the contract, that is, unless both parties agree as to the specific chattels in which the property is to pass, and nothing remains to be done in order to pass it. In the case of such a contract the delivery by a vendor to a common carrier, or (unless the effect of the shipment is restricted by the terms of the bill of lading) shipment on board a ship of, or chartered for, the purchaser, is an appropriation sufficient to pass the property. If, however, the vendor, when shipping the articles which he intends to deliver under the contract, takes the bill of lading to his own order, and does so not as an agent or on behalf of the purchaser, but on his own behalf, it is held that he thereby reserves to himself a power of disposing of the property, and consequently that there is no final appropriation, and the property on shipment does not pass to the purchasers. When the vendor on shipment takes the bill of lading to his own order, he has the power of absolutely disposing of the cargo, and may prevent the purchaser from ever asserting any right of property therein; and accordingly in Waite v. Baker[69], Ellershaw v. Magniac[70], and Gabarron v. Kreeft[71], in each of which cases the vendors had dealt with the bills of lading for their own benefit, the decisions were that the purchaser had no property in the goods, though he had offered to accept bills for, or had paid the price So, if the vendor deals with or claims to retain the bill of lading in order to secure the contract price, as when he sends forward the bill of lading with a bill of exchange attached, with directions that the bill of lading is not to be delivered to the purchaser till acceptance or payment of the bill of exchange, the appropriation is not absolute, but, until acceptance of the draft or payment or tender of the price, is conditional only, and until such acceptance, or payment, or tender, the property in the goods does not pass to the purchaser; and soit was decided in Turner v. Trustees of Liverpool Docks[72]; Shepherd v. Harrison[73]; Ogg v. Shuter[74].\nSTRONG, J.:\nThis is a bill in equity filed under a practice established by a statute, until lately in force in the Province of Ontario, whereby parties were at liberty to sue in the Court of Chancery in respect of legal rights.\nThe defence is failure of consideration under the following circumstances:\u2014The appellants are distillers at Belleville in Ontario, and the respondent is a commission merchant carrying on business at Toledo in Ohio. On the 13th and 14th Sept., 1878, certain telegrams passed between the parties, which resulted in one sent on the latter day by the appellants to the respondent in the words following:\nWill take 13,000 old high mixed 47 delivered here, vessel paying loading. Draw ten days through Merchants\u2019 Bank here. Send prime corn.\nIn pursuance of this order, which the respondent considered and acted upon as an order by principals to their agent, the respondent purchased a cargo of corn amounting to 12,965 bushels, which he shipped on board the schooner \u201cAnnandale\u201d the price at Toledo being 42 cents per bushel, and the freight, including charge for unloading, making the gross price 47 cents, the limit mentioned in the appellants\u2019 telegram. The vessel sailed on the 16th Sept. The respondent took from the captain a bill of lading, dated the same day, for the cargo to be delivered as \u201caddressed per margin,\u201d the margin being left blank. On the same day he drew on the appellants the bill of exchange, for the recovery of the amount of which the suit is brought\u2014a bill at 10 days after date for $5,492.16. This amount was made up of a charge of 42 cents per bushel to cover price paid for corn and respondent\u2019s commission, and five cents per bushel for freight, with $20 advanced to the captain, and $26.65 interest for 10 days added. This draft the respondent procured to be discounted by the Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Toledo, to whom he at the same time and by way of collateral security for the draft, transferred the bill of lading. The Merchants\u2019 Bank of Toledo immediately endorsed both the draft and the bill of lading to the Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada at Belleville for collection, and sent them forward in order that the appellants\u2019 acceptance of the draft might be procured On the 19th Sept. the appellants accepted the draft. The vessel did not reach Belleville until the 23th Sept., some days later than the usual time of a voyage between the ports of Toledo and Belleville; the cause of the delay being unavoidable detention in the Wetland canal. Upon the arrival of the vessel it was found that the corn, which the evidence shews to have been shipped in good order had become heated in the voyage and was much damaged. Under these circumstances the appellants refused to accept delivery, and it was subsequently sold for the benefit of whom it might concern. The appellants refused to pay the draft which the respondent subsequently retired and then brought this suit for the recovery of the amount for which it was drawn.\nOn the day on which the vessel sailed, the 16th Sept., the respondent also sent to the appellants an invoice of the corn, (exhibit L.) headed as follows:\nAccount purchase by George E. Williams of 12,965 bushels high mixed corn, for account and risk of Messrs. H. Corby & Sons. Shipped schr. Annandale.\nThis invoice was enclosed in a letter of the same date from respondent to appellants, in which he says:\nWe enclose invoice of 12,965 bushels high mixed corn per schr. Annandale, draft as stated made to day.\nThe Court of Appeal, upon this state of facts and upon a consideration of the evidence of usage prevailing among commission merchants in the grain trade at Toledo, reversed the decree of the Court of Chancery by which the bill had been dismissed, and determined that the respondent was entitled to recover.\nIt was decided by the Court of Appeal that the relation between the parties was that of principal and agent, and that the telegram of the 14th Sept., already stated, was to be regarded as an order by the appellants to the respondent, to purchase for them a cargo of corn within the limit of 47 cents a bushel for cost and freight. I entirely concur and adopt the judgment of the court in this respect as well as in their conclusion that the charges made by the respondent were fair and legitimate, and such as he was entitled to make in his character of an agent or commission merchant. It appears to me, however, that the contract of agency was not the only one between the parties, but that there also existed the relation of vendor and purchaser in respect of this corn. A passage in the opinion of Mr. Justice Blackburn in the case of Ireland v. Livingston, in the House of Lords[75], seems to me to afford a very precise definition of the legal effect of the contract between the parties to the present appeal. He says:\nIt is quite true that the agent who in thus executing an order, shipa goods to his principal, is in contemplation of law a vendor to him. The persons who supply goods to a commission merchant sell them to him, and not to his unknown foreign correspondent, and the commission merchant has no authority to pledge the credit of his correspondent for them. * * * The property in the goods passes from the country producer to the commission merchant; and then, when the goods are shipped, from the commission merchant to his consignee. And the legal effect of the transaction between the commission merchant and the consignee, who has given him the order, is a contract of sale passing the property from the one to the other; and consequently the commission merchant is a vendor, and has the right of one as to stoppage in transitu.\nThe decision of the present case, which depends, in my opinion, altogether on the questions whether the property in this corn had vested in the appellants before it became damaged, or whether, if the property in the corn had not passed to the appellants, it was by the stipulations of the parties at the risk of the purchasers, is to be governed by the ordinary principles of the contract of sale. The passing of the property under a contract for the sale of goods is said to be altogether a question of intention\u2014the rules laid down being merely intended as guides for discovering or presuming the intention when the parties have not clearly expressed it There can be generally no stronger evidence of a vendor\u2019s intention not to pass the property to the vendee than the fact that he takes the bill of lading in his own name. In the present case, by the terms of the bill of lading, the goods were deliverable to the person whose name should be inserted in the margin, and the name inserted was that of the bank which discounted the draft for the price, and to whom the bill of lading was delivered as collateral security. The effect of this was clearly to vest a special property in the corn in the bank, and this special property was in the nature of a hypothecation of the goods, designed to secure the payment of the draft, and subject to which the absolute legal property either remained in the respondent or became vested in the appellants[76].\nHad the bill of lading been taken originally in the respondent\u2019s own name and then endorsed by him to the bank, it would be strong evidence, even between parties whose relations were such as those before us, to shew that the vendor intended to reserve the property, subject to the rights of the bank, to himself, at least until by some further act he indicated an intention to pass it to the purchasers. Here, however, the vendor seems to have parted with all power over the disposition of the property, when he handed over the bill of lading to the bank.\nHowever this may be, it seems to me clear, both upon authority and principle, that when, on the same day as that on which the vessel sailed and the bill of lading was handed over to the bank, the respondent sent the letter of advice enclosing the invoice, stating that the goods were for account \u201cand risk\u201d of the appellants, he did an act which divested him of any property in the goods and vested it in the appellants. In other words, when he said the goods were to be at the risk of the appellants he meant what he said. Had the invoice merely stated the goods to have been purchased on account of the appellants, it might not have been so conclusive, but even in that case, I should have thought every presumption ought to be made against any intention on the part of the respondent, a mere factor, whose commission had been included in the bill drawn for the price, to retain the property, and so subject himself to the risk of any loss which the insurance might be insufficient to cover, more especially as he had so dealt with the bill of lading as to authorise its delivery to the vendees upon payment of the draft drawn for the price; but the insertion of the word \u201crisk\u201d in the invoice seems to me to make it unnecessary to resort to any such presumption, and to be amply sufficient to vest the property in the appellants from the date at which the invoice and letter of advice were transmitted\u2014the 16th September,\u2014the day on which the vessel sailed. In the case of Jenkyns v. Brown[77], which I mentioned during the argument of this appeal, the facts were almost identical with those in the present case, and the decision itself entirely warrants the opinion already expressed as to the legal result from those facts.\nIn Mr. Benjqming work on Sales[78], he thus summarises the facts of that case:\nKlin gender, a merchant in New Orleans, had bought a cargo of corn on the order of plaintiffs and taken a bill of lading for it deliverable to his own order. He then drew bills for the cost of the eargo on the plaintiffs, and sold the bills of exchange to a New Orleans banker, to whom he also endorsed the bill of lading. He sent invoices and a letter of advice to the plaintiffs showing that the cargo was bought and shipped on their account and at their risk. Held, that the property did not pass to the plaintiffs, as the taking of a bill of lading by Klingender in his own name was \u201cnearly conclusive evidence\u201d that he did not intend to pass the property to plaintiffs; that by delivering the endorsed bill of lading to the buyer of the bills of exchange he had conveyed to them \u201ca special property\u201d in the cargo, and by the invoice and letter of advice to the plaintiffs he had passed to them the general property in the cargo subject to this special property, so that the plaintiffs right of possession would not arise until the bills of exchange were paid by them.\nI am unable to distinguish this case of Jenkyns v. Brown from the present, and I am therefore of opinion that in the present case the property, subject to the rights of the bank, was vested in and at the risk of the appellants from the 16th of September, the day on which the schooner sailed from Toledo, and as the damage to the corn occurred after that date there was no failure of consideration, and the respondent was entitled to recover. Further, as showing that the terms of the invoice, making the goods as shipped at the buyer\u2019s risk, was a sufficient indication of intention to pass the property, I refer to the cases of Castle v. Playford[79] and Marlineau v. Kitching[80], which are also authorities for the respondent in another view of the case, which I shall hereafter state.\nI see nothing in the fact that the bill was drawn at ten days, whilst the usual length of voyage from Toledo to Belleville was only five or six days, to raise any presumption against an intention to vest. The only difference this would make would be that in case the corn arrived and the vessel unloaded before the maturity of the bill, it would have to be left in store for some two or three days before the appellants, by paying their acceptance and obtaining the bill of lading, would get possession.\nBut even if the property in the corn did not pass to the appellants, 1 should still have been of opinion that there was no failure of consideration. The effect of the contract of sale depends entirely on the intention of the parties, and they may always provide that, though the property is not to pass to the buyer, it shall be at his risk, so that, if it perishes by fortuitous circumstances before delivery, the vendor shall still have the right to be paid the price. That this is the law is well established by the case of Castle v. Playford79, and also by the case of Martineau v. Kitching[81], per Blackburn and Lush, L.JJ, already referred to Then, in the present case, by the express terms of the invoice,\u2014which was retained without objection by the appellants,\u2014it was a term of the contract that the property from the time of shipment was to be at the risk of the purchasers, and this was such a reasonable and natural provision, having regard to the relationship existing between the parties, that it could not have been expected that it would have given rise to any objection, at all events none was ever made, and we have therefore a right to presume it was part of the contract of sale, and if so it constitutes a complete answer to this attempt to throw the loss on the respondent. This conclusion is in accordance with the well understood usage of the grain trade, found by the witnesses called by the respondent at the trial.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with the Chief Justice\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an action brought in the Court of Chancery for Ontario by the respondent against the appellants, and in which a decree was pronounced in favor of the latter. On appeal to the Appeal Court of Ontario, it was reversed and a decree made in favor of the respondent. From the latter it came by appeal to this court. The decision of the matter in controversy depends mainly on the construction to be put on the contract entered into by means of telegraphic communications between the parties.\nThe respondent was a commission agent at Toledo, Ohio, U.S, and commenced the correspondence by a telegram which finally ended in an agreement that he should ship 13,000 bushels of \u201chigh mixed com\u201d to the appellants at Belleville. The telegram is dated the 15th September, 1878, as follows:\nSchooner \u201cAnnandale\u201d obtainable, 5c, vessel paying unloading. High mixed corn 47c.\nOn the same day the appellants answered by telegram;\nDo you not think corn will be lower next month? Will you deliver here at 47c.?\nThe respondent on the same day replied:\nHigher corn predicted by exporting customers. England advancing. October selling here half above cash. We don\u2019t anticipate lower prices. Receipts light. Eoads bad. Good shipping demand. Offer cargo 47 cost, freight, commissions, insurance\u2014prompt acceptance.\nThe latter is a reply to the question\u2014\u201cWill you deliver here at 47c?\u201d\nThe appellants on the 14th telegraphed as follows:\nWill take 13,000 old high mixed (47c), delivered here vessel paying unloading. Draw, ten days, through Merchants\u2019 Bank here, Send prime corn.\nUpon receipt of the latter telegram, the respondents decided to ship the corn, and shortly afterwards did so, and drew on the appellants at the rate of 42c. per bushel, and by letter requested the latter to pay the freight at the rate of 5c. per bushel. The draft spoken of was drawn by the respondent as directed, and was made payable to the order of the National Bank at Toledo. He insured the cargo in his own name, and took a bill of lading for it to be delivered to his own order or assigns. He assigned the policy of insurance and the bill of lading to the same bank. The latter forwarded the whole of the documents mentioned to Belleville, and the draft was accepted. The respondent had obtained advances from the bank, and the latter was authorized by him to hold the corn as security until the draft should be paid, and in default of payment to sell the same to reimburse themselves to the amount of the draft. The corn arrived at Belleville between the time of the acceptance and maturing of the draft, but in such a damaged condition that the appellants refused to receive it, and notified the respondent. It was subsequently sold by him, and he now seeks to recover the difference between the amount it realized and the cost. The respondent contends in the first place that he purchased and shipped the corn as the agent of the appellants; and, secondly, that if that contention be not sustained, that there was such a delivery when it was put on board the vessel as to make it the property of the appellants, and therefore at their risk.\nThe appellants deny both propositions. There is no evidence whatever that the respondent acted as agent of the appellants, but, on the contrary, the telegrams are evidence of a sale by him as principal. The mere fact that he was a commission merchant or broker can have no weight against the clear language of the telegrams. They show also very clearly that the delivery was to be at Belleville at the price named, and the respondent requested the appellants to pay the freight out of the principal sum. The respondent himself took the most effectual means of preventing the appellants from having any property in the corn until delivered. He assigned it to the bank with the policy of insurance, and in case of loss by the perils of navigation, the bank could alone recover for it. The latter were the legal owners, and the appellants had no title whatever to the corn, when it got injured on the voyage. The bank might have sold it to any one they pleased, and the appellants could not have gainsaid their right to do so, and the only redress open to them (if any) would be in the shape of damages from the respondent for not delivering the corn according to the agreement.\nThe respondent seeks to recover from the appellants the balance of the price of the corn which was never delivered to them or at their risk, and which in its damaged state they were not bound to receive. By his own act he prevented too the appellants from having any title to the corn until the draft should be paid. He did not ship it in pursuance of the agreement, and by adding the condition of prepayment, he relieved the appellants from the obligation to take it under any circumstances. I am of opinion, for these reasons, that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the court below reversed, and the decree of the Vice-Chancellor sustained, with costs.\nGWYNNE, J:\u2014\nThis is an action instituted in the Court of Chancery in the province of Ontario, a proceeding authorized by the Administration of Justice Act of that province, for the recovery of a purely legal demand, arising out of a contract between the plaintiff and the defendants; but instead of stating the case, as it would have been in an action at law in the like circumstances\u2014namely, as upon an acceptance by the defendants of a bill of exchange drawn upon them by the plaintiff, the latter, in his bill of complaint, sets out at large what, according to his interpretation and contention, was the contract between him and the defendants out of which the acceptance arose, and he alleges the fulfilment of such contract upon his part and the breach of it by the defendants.\nUpon the evidence, as indeed was admitted in the argument, we must take the fact to be that, although the corn was in good condition and of the quality required by the defendants when it was shipped on board the vessel at Toledo, it did not arrive at Bellville in good condition, and by reason thereof, it was useless for defendants\u2019 purposes; and the questions we have to decide are, what was the true nature and effect of the contract made between the plaintiff and the defendants; and which of them, under the circumstances appearing in the case, should bear the loss arising out of the transaction?\nThe plaintiff, on the one side, contends that even if the contract should be held to be one of sale and purchase, still the property passed to defendants on shipment, and that thereafter all risk was theirs; the defendants, on the contrary, contend that regarding them as purchasers they acquired no property and incurred no liability until delivery at Belleville in pursuance of the contract, and that even if the contract should be held to be one between principal and agent originally, still the plaintiff so dealt with the corn as to retain in himself the property therein in disregard of what would be defendants\u2019 rights as principals, and attached to their getting possession of the corn a condition inconsistent with the plaintiff being merely defendants\u2019 agent, and consistent only with his retaining the ownership of the corn until delivery to the defendants at Belleville, and so, that the plaintiff retained in himself all responsibility and risk, as well as the property in the corn, until the loss and damage had occurred, and thereafter continued to deal with it as his own;\nThis appears to have been the first transaction which the defendants had with the plaintiff. They had had dealings for several years with plaintiff\u2019s brother, to whose business the plaintiff succeeded in April, 1878. The defendants say that they dealt with the plaintiff\u2019s brother, sometimes upon the basis of a contract for the purchase from him of corn delivered at Kingston, and sometimes on the basis of a contract of purchase by him as defendants\u2019 agent of corn at Toledo, deliverable to the defendants f.o.b. there, but that they preferred the former method. The manner in which the defendants may have been in the habit of dealing with the plaintiffs brother has no bearing upon this case, except as explanatory of the defendants\u2019 intention in entering into this contract, and of his bona fides in contending that such intention was to enter into a contract of purchase of corn on delivery at Belleville.\nAs to the manner in which the present contract came about, the plaintiff says\u2014and he does not appear to be contradicted in this\u2014that after commencing business for himself, he no doubt wrote to defendants soliciting their orders; that he received some communications from them in September, 1878, prior to the 13th, but whether it was he or the defendants who started such communications, he cannot say\u2014no such communication is produced. With this information that there had been some prior communications, the correspondence out of which this contract arose, so far as is laid before us, commenced with a telegram from the plaintiff at Toledo dated 15th September, 1878, to the defendant, H. Corby jun., at Belleville, as follows:\u2014\nSchooner \u201cAnnandale\u201d obtainable, 5c, Vessel paying unloading. High mixed corn, 47c.\nIn reply to this upon the same day the defendants telegraph to the plaintiff:\nDo you not think corn will be lower next month; will you deliver here at 47c?\nTo which on the same day the plaintiff replies by telegram:\nHigher corn predicted by exporting customers. England advancing. October selling here half above cash. We don\u2019t anticipate lower prices. Receipts light. Roads bad. Good shipping demand. Offer cargo 47 cost, freight, commissions, insurance\u2014prompt acceptance.\nThis latter appears to be in answer to defendants enquiry, \u201cWill you deliver here at 47 cents?\u201d\nOn the 14th the defendants reply: Will take 13,000 old high mixed, 47 delivered here, vessel paying unloading; draw ten days through Merchants Bank here; send prime corn.\nNow, if it were not for the fact that the plaintiff carried on the business of a commission agent, I should think the natural construction to put upon the correspondence involved in the above telegrams would be\u2014that the defendants only contracted to take, that is to receive on delivery at Belleville, corn of the description specified, namely, prime old high mixed corn, and to pay for it by an acceptance of a draft on ten days credit, but the plaintiff contends that the fact of his being a commission agent makes all the difference, and that he understood the defendants to be authorizing him as their agent to purchase corn for them at such price as should not cost them more, but might cost them less than 47c. at Belleville, to be paid for by an acceptance of plaintiffs\u2019 draft at ten days, and he contends, upon the authority of Ireland v. Livingston[82], that although the defendants\u2019 telegrams may be susceptible of the construction put upon them by defendants, still that they are susceptible also of the construction put upon them by the plaintiff, and that after having, as he contends he has, bon\u00e2 fide acted upon them in that sense, it is not now competent for the defendants to repudiate their order, upon the ground that the plaintiff did not act upon it in the sense intended by defendants.\nThat case decides, that if a principal gives an order to an agent in such uncertain terms as to be susceptible of two different meanings, and the agent bon\u00e2 fide adopts one of them and acts upon it, it is not competent to the principal to repudiate the act as unauthorized because he meant the order to be read in the other sense, of which it was equally capable.\nWhether that principle is applicable to a case in which the question is as to the character in which two parties, who might each have acted in one or other of two characters, did in fact contract, it is not necessary, in the view which I take, now to decide. In such a case, when it may have to be decided, it will have to be considered whether it is not equally incumbent upon both parties to make it clear in what character they are respectively dealing; namely, whether as vendor and vendee, or as principal and agent; or to apply the question to the case here, whether it was not equally incumbent upon the plaintiff, who offered the cargo, to make it clear in what character he offered it, as it was for the defendants to make it clear in what character they accepted the offer. It is not, however, necessary, in the view which I take, to decide that point in this case, for the defendants contend, as I think not without reason, that the acts of the plaintiff have been inconsistent with his having understood the contract assumed by him to be one of agency only, or that the defendants entered into it in the character of principal, employing an agent to purchase for them, and, that he retained the property in himself and transferred it to the bank of Toledo and not to the defendants. The plaintiff says that he procured the money with which he carried on business, and did procure the money with which he purchased the corn, which is the subject of this litigation, under an arrangement made by him with the banks at Toledo, that he would draw upon his consignees through the bank furnishing the funds, endorsing the draft to the bank, and assigning to them also the bill of lading and a policy of insurance upon the cargo. The question, therefore is, after the plaintiff purchased the corn, which is the subject of this litigation, when and to whom did he part with the property therein? and when, if ever, did that property pass from the plaintiff to the defendants? Upon shipping the corn on board the \u201cAnnadale\u201d upon the 16th Sept., he received a bill of lading from the master. He effected, at the same time, a policy of insurance on the cargo in his own name. That bill of lading, the symbol of property in the corn, together with the policy of insurance he assigned to the National Bank, Toledo, and drew through them at ten days upon the defendants, endorsing at the same time the bill of exchange to the bank, all in pursuance of an agreement to that effect, upon which he had procured the money to carry on his business, and for the purpose of vesting the property in the corn in the bank to hold to their use until the bill of exchange should be paid, and in default of payment to sell to reimburse themselves to the amount of the bill of exchange.\nThe corn in due course would ordinarily reach Belleville in four or five days from Toledo, that is upon the 21st or 22nd September. The defendants had contracted for the credit upon a draft at ten days to ensure the arrival of the corn before the draft should become payable. Upon presentation, of the bill of exchange, they accepted, relying as their security upon the arrival of the corn before the bill should be payable on the 1st of October. The corn arrived at Belleville on the 27th or 28th September, and was at once refused by the defendants as being so damaged as to be for their purposes useless. Now, when the plaintiff, as above stated, transferred the property in the corn to the bank, he had nothing that he could transfer to the defendants otherwise than subject to the condition of their first paying the draft, that is to say, looking at the ordinary time for a vessel to go from Toledo to Belleville of seven or eight days in advance of the time which, the defendants (according to the plaintiff\u2019s own view of the contract) had contracted for. The plaintiff thus imposed upon the defendants a condition precedent to their acquiring possession of the corn not warranted by their contract, according to the plaintiff\u2019s own view of it. Property consigned to the defendants, subject to such condition, could not be property forwarded in pursuance of their contract in any view of it, or which they could be obliged to take.\nAfter having transferred the property to the bank, the plaintiff forwarded to the defendants an invoice, wherein the corn is spoken of as purchased by the plaintiff as an agent upon commission, and which speaks of the cost afloat at Belleville, 47c.; whereas, the defendants had contracted for delivery on shore out of the vessel at that price, With the invoice, the plaintiff did not inform defendants of his having transferred to the bank the property in the corn, and that they could only get it upon condition of first paying the draft forwarded for their acceptance. The sending of this invoice to the defendants gave to them\u2014unless and until the latter should pay the draft\u2014no property in the corn, which, and not merely a lien upon it, was what was vested in the bank upon the authority of Jenkyns v. Brown[83]. All that the plaintiff ever gave to the defendants was a right to receive the corn, conditional upon their first paying their draft, which, as appears, wanted three days of maturity when the corn arrived in damaged condition at Belleville. This condition, as I have shewn, was not warranted by the contract, according to the plaintiff\u2019s own construction of it. He had no right to superadd such a condition to the defendant\u2019s contract. The result then is, that the property in this corn remained by the act of the plaintiff, contrary to the terms of the contract, as he alleges he understood it, in the plaintiff and his assignees, the bank, the plaintiff\u2019s creditors, until and after the arrival of the corn at Belleville. The damage to the corn occurred, then, while the property continued to be in the plaintiff and his assignees\u2014the bank. As then the plaintiff, contrary to his own understanding of the contract, as now contended for by him, retained in himself and his creditors, the bank, for their own benefit, the property in the corn until it became damaged, it is but reasonable that they, and not the defendants, should bear the loss. For the above reasons, I am of opinion that the defendants\u2019 contention is well founded; that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the decree of the ViceChancellor should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Blake, Kerr, Boyd & Cassels.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bawden & Machar.\n[1] 5 Ont.

the trustees of the Quebec North Shore Turnpike Trust, appointed under ordinance, 4 Vic., ch. 17, when issuing the debentures in suit, under 16 Vic., ch. 235, were acting as agents of the government of the late province of Canada, and that the said province became liable to provide for the payment of the principal of said debentures when they became due.\nPer Henry and Taschereau, JJ., That the

authorized to be imposed and of other moneys which might come into the possession and be at the disposal of the said trustees, under and by virtue of the. ordinance, and not to be paid out of or chargeable against the general revenue of this province\" the debentures did not create a liability on the part of the province in respect of either the principal or the interest thereof[1].\nAppeal and cross appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (December 2 4, 1879) decreeing that appellant was legally liable to the respondents for the payment of the principal of certain debentures issued by the Trustees of the Quebec Turnpike roads under the authority of 16 Vic., c. 235.\nThe respondents by petition of right set forth in substance:\nThat the province of Canada had raised, by way of loan, a sum of \u00a330,000 for the improvement of provincial highways situate on the north shore of the river St. Lawrence, in the neighbourhood of the city of Quebec\u2014and a further sum of \u00a340,000 for the improvement of like highways on the south shore of the river St. Lawrence\u2014that there were issued debentures for both of the said loans, signed by the Quebec turnpike road trustees, under the authority of an act of the Parliament of the province of Canada, passed in the sixteenth year of Her Majesty's reign, intituled: \"An act to authorize the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads to issue debentures to a certain amount and to place certain roads under their control\"\u2014that the moneys so borrowed came into the hands of Her Majesty, and were expended in the improvement of the highways in the said act mentioned\u2014that no tolls or rates were ever imposed or levied on the persons passing over the roads improved by means of the said loan of \u00a330,000\u2014 that the tolls imposed and collected on the highways improved by means of the said loan of \u00a340,000 were never applied: to the payment of the debentures issued for the said last mentioned loan in interest or principal\u2014that the trustees accounted to Her Majesty, as well for the said loans as for the tolls collected by them\u2014that at no time had there been a fund in the hands of the said trustees adequate to the payment, in interest and principal, of the debentures issued for said loans\u2014that the respondents are holders of debentures for both of the said loans to an amount of $70,072, upon which interest is due from the first day of July, 1872\u2014that the debentures so held by them fell due after the union, and that Her Majesty is liable for the same under 3rd sec. of British North America Act, 1867, as debts of the late province of Canada existing at the union.\nIn his defence to this petition, Her Majesty's Attorney-General did not deny the liability of Her Majesty for the debts of the late province of Canada, but he denied that the debentures in question were debentures of the province of Canada\u2014that the moneys for which they issued were borrowed and received by Her Majesty\u2014that there was any undertaking or obligation in the province of Canada to pay the whole or any part of the said debentures.\nThe questions of law arising out of the defence set up by the Attorney-General and argued at length may be resumed into the following:\u2014\nWhether the debentures in question were or not debentures of the late province of Canada?\nWhether the moneys for which they issued, did or not come into the hands of Her Majesty, and were expended in the improvement of provincial highways?\nWhether there was any undertaking or obligation in the late province of Canada to pay the said debentures?\nAnd whether Canada is or not liable to pay the said debentures under the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867?\nThe case was argued in the Exchequer Court, Fournier, J, presiding, by Mr. Irvine, Q. C, and Mr. Andrew Stuart, on behalf of the suppliants, and Mr. Langelier, Q C., and Mr. Langlois, Q. C., on behalf of the Crown, and the following judgment in favor of the suppliants was delivered:\u2014\nFournier, J: \u2014 [Translated.]\n\"This is a petition of right, by which the suppliants seek to recover from Her Majesty the sum of $70,072, with interest from the 1st July, 1872, in payment of an equal sum loaned on debentures issued by \"the trustees of the Quebec Turnpike Roads\" under the authority of an Act passed by the legislature of the province of Canada, 16 Vic. ch. 235.\n\"The question submitted for the decision of this court is whether the crown can legally be held liable for the payment at maturity of the debentures so issued.\n\"In order to determine this point it will be necessary to refer to the special legislation originally effected in reference to these turnpike roads.\n\"It was by the ordinance 4 Vic. ch. 17, that this mode of improvement of roads was introduced in the late province of Lower Canada, now the province of Quebec. The object and the intention of this legislation, in making the change in the system then followed for the management of the roads, are thus stated in the preamble to the ordinance:\n\"'Whereas the state of the roads hereinafter mentioned, in the neighborhood of, and leading to the city of Quebec, is such as to render their improvement an object of immediate and urgent necessity, and it is therefore expedient to provide means for effecting such improvement, and to create a fund for defraying the expense thereof, and the expenses necessary for keeping the said roads in permanent repair.'\n\"It then proceeded to enact, that the powers and authorities vested by 36 George III., in any magistrates, grand voyer and other officers should cease and determine from and after the time when the trustees, authorized to be named by the ordinance, should assume the management and control of the roads. The governor is authorized by letters patent, under the great seal of the province, to appoint not less than five, nor more than nine persons, to be, as well as their successors in office, trustees, for the purpose of opening, making and keeping in repair the roads specified in the ordinance.\n\"In case of a vacancy in the said trust the governor was to supply and fill such vacancy by the appointment by letters patent of another trustee.\n\"The trustees are then declared to be a corporation to be known by the name of 'The trustees of the Quebec 'Turnpike Roads' and may sue and be sued, and 'may acquire property and estate, movable and immovable, which, being so acquired, shall be vested in Her Majesty for the public uses of the province, subject to the management of the said trustees for the purposes of this ordinance,' and who are given all the necessary powers to cause to be improved and widened, repaired and made anew all the roads and bridges put under their control.\n\"By the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th sections provision is made for expropriation and the payment of compensation for damages.\n\"The trustees are also authorized to levy on each of the said roads, at the turnpike gates or toll bars to be thereon established, the tolls specified in said ordinance.\n\"The trustees were authorized to raise by way of loan, on the credit and security of the tolls, and of other moneys in the possession of the trustees, under and by virtue of this ordinance, 'and not to be paid out of or be chargeable against the general revenue of this province, any sum or sums of money not exceeding \u00a325,000.'\n\"The trustees are authorized to issue debentures in the form contained in the schedule A, bearing interest at six per centum per annum, and redeemable at such times as the trustees may think convenient. With the approval of the governor the debentures may be redeemed before the time they are made redeemable. All arrears of interest were to be paid before any part of the principal sum. In case of deficiency of funds at the disposal of the trustees to pay interest accrued, the governor, by warrant under his hand, may authorize the Receiver General to advance to the said trustees out of any unappropriated moneys in his hands the necessary amount sufficient to pay such arrears of interest, and which sum shall be repaid by the trustees to the Receiver General in the manner specified in the ordinance.\n\"The trustees were also authorized, with the approval of the governor, to raise further sums to pay off the principal of any loan becoming due at a certain time, under the same provisions as the previous loans.\n\"It was further enacted that due application of all public moneys, whereof the expenditure or receipt was authorized, shall be accounted for to Her Majesty through the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's treasury for the time being, in such manner and form as Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, shall be pleased to direct.\n\"The trustees were also bound to lay detailed accounts of all moneys by them received and expended, supported by proper vouchers, and also detailed reports of all their doings and proceedings before such officer, and in such manner and form, and publish the same in such a way, at the expense of the trustees, as the governor shall be pleased to direct.\n\"The ordinance was declared to be a public and permanent ordinance.\n\"All the provisions of this ordinance were put into force by trustees duly appointed, who took the management and control of these roads for the use and benefit of the public.\n\"The late province of Lower Canada borrowed through these trustees the sum of \u00a325,000 for the amelioration of these roads as authorized by the said ordinance.\n\"This amount was employed in conformity with the provisions of the Act\u2014detailed accounts of the same as public moneys were rendered to Her Majesty as ordained by the ordinance, as well as of the tolls collected on said roads.\n\"After the union of Canada, the provisions of this ordinance were extended and made applicable to divers other roads. The legislature and the executive government of the late province of Canada have always exercised over these roads, and other property under the control of the trustees, the most absolute and unlimited powers.\n\"By 16 Vic. ch. 235, the statute under which the debentures now in question were issued, the provisions of the ordinance 4 Vic. ch. 17 which I have just summarized, and the powers of the trustees, are extended and made applicable to a certain number of other roads and bridges therein mentioned, and situated on the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence.\n\"The principal provisions of this Act, which have reference to the point raised in this suit, are contained in the following sections:\u2014\n\"The seventh section authorizes the issue of debentures for a loan of \u00a330,000 for the construction and completion of the works authorized by this Act, and an Act of the preceding session, on the roads on the north shore of the St. Lawrence, and which loan is made subject to the provisions of the ordinance 4 Vic. ch. 17, as follows: 'and this loan, the debentures which shall be issued to effect the same, and all other matters having reference to the said loan, shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance above cited With respect to the loan authorized under it: Provided nevertheless, that the rate of interest to be taken under this act shall in no case exceed the rate of six per centum, and no moneys shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest, and all the debentures which shall be issued under this act, so far as relates to the interest payable thereupon, shall have a privilege of priority of lien upon the tolls and other moneys which shall come into the possession and shall be at the disposal of the said trustees, in preference to the interest payable upon all debentures which shall have been issued under the provincial guarantee, and also to all other claims for the reimbursement of any sums of money advanced or to be advanced to the said trustees by the Receiver General of this province, and the said debentures as respects the payment of the principal and interest thereof, shall rank after those issued under the act passed during the last session of the parliament of the province and hereinbefore cited.\n\"A further sum of \u00a340,000 was by the tenth section of the same act authorized to be raised by way of a loan subject to the conditions in the seventh section for the construction and repairing of the roads on the south shore of the St. Lawrence.\n\"These different loans were made by the issuing of debentures, and the moneys raised thereby were employed by the trustees to pay for the works and improvements specified in the said act.\n[Page 61\n\"Unfortunately for the suppliants the revenues derived from these new roads, as well as from those derived from the roads first made by the trustees, and which constituted the special fund created by 4 Vic., ch. 17, were found insufficient to pay even the interest on the amounts so borrowed. The result has been that the suppliants have not received any interest since 1872, nor have the legislature taken any steps to remedy the present state of affairs by making provision for the repayment of the loans, which matured in part on 2nd March, 1869, and in part on 1st December, 1874.\n\"In answer to this petition Her Majesty avers that all the debentures guaranteed by the ordinance of 1841 were redeemed in 1853, and that since no debentures have been issued guaranteed by the province, but that on the contrary by 12 Vic., ch. 115, 14 & 15 Vic., ch. 132, 16 Vic., ch. 235 and 20 Vic., ch. 125 it was enacted 'that no guarantee for the said debentures should be given by the said late province of Canada, that no money of the said province should be advanced for paying the interest or the principal of the said debentures.'\n\"The facts in issue between the parties to this petition have been settled by a special admission of facts which are sufficient for the determination of the question submitted for decision. It only remains for the court to decide whether the Government of Canada prior to the passing of the British North America Act, was responsible for the repayment of the loans in question.\n\"Before taking this question into consideration, I must acknowledge that I do not do so without great hesitation. In determining this point I have not had the advantage of referring to previous decisions. The learned counsel for the suppliants as well as for respondent, in answer to a question 1 made on the argument, said that, notwithstanding exhaustive researches on their part, they had been unable to find a decision applicable to this question. I have since searched for authorities on this subject, but I must confess with no better success. It is therefore by examining our statutes and comparing them with those passed in England on the same subject-matter, that we will be able to arrive at a solution of this question.\n\"The extracts I have just given of the principal provisions of the ordinance of 1841, and of the subsequent statutes, when compared with the provisions contained in the imperial statutes relating to 'turnpike trusts,' show that there are such essential differences in these institutions in both countries as will justify me in drawing certain inferences useful to the determination of this suit.\n\"Before stating the peculiar provisions of the organization of turnpike trusts in England, I will cite a short passage on their origin: 'A turnpike road is a road across which turnpike gates are erected and tolls taken, and such roads existed previous to the passing of the 13 Geo. III, ch. 84, and independently of that statute altogether. A turnpike road means a road having toll gates or bars on it, which were originally called \"turns,\" and were first constructed about the middle of the last century. Certain individuals, with a view to the repairs of particular roads, subscribed amongst themselves for that purpose and erected gates upon the roads, taking tolls from those who passed through them. These were violently opposed at first, and petitions addressed to parliament against them; and acts were in consequence passed for their regulation. This was the origin of turnpike roads.'\n\"If turnpike trusts in England, in their origin, resemble ours by the opposition which was made to their establishment, they differ essentially by the fundamental principle of their constitution.\n\"The above quotation shows that they Were established by certain persons associated together and subscribing between themselves the amount necessary for repairing certain roads. There were quite a number of turnpike trusts in existence at the time of the passing of the 13 Geo. III, ch. 84, but the statutes which established these trusts were private statutes, and are not to be found in the collection of the imperial statutes. It is easy, however, to ascertain their character by referring to the act of 3 Geo. IV, ch. 126, passed for the purpose of legislating on this subject in a general manner for the whole country. After the 1st January, 1823, the provisions of that act were made applicable to all private acts, before, or which might be hereafter, passed, relating to the construction, repair and maintenance of turnpike roads.\n\"I will now refer to those provisions in the English statute which will obviously show the difference that exists between the laws in force in England and those which are under consideration in this case.\n\"Section 60 of the act enacts: 'that the right, interest and property of and in all the toll gates and toll houses weighing machines and other erections and buildings, lamps, bars, toll boards, direction boards, mile stones, posts, rails, fences and other things, which shall have been or shall be erected and provided in pursuance of any act of parliament for making turnpike roads, with the several conveniences and appurtenances thereunto respectively belonging, and the materials of which the same shall consist, and all materials, tools and implements which shall be provided for repairing the said roads, shall be vested in the trustees or commissioners acting in pursuance of such act for the time being, and they are hereby authorized and empowered to apply and dispose of the same as they shall think fit, and to bring or cause to be brought any action or actions, &c,, &c.' \"Sec. 43 gives power to the trustees to increase or diminish the tolls in accordance to the provisions of the section.\n\"The 62nd section provides that the trustees shall be qualified in real estate to the amount of \u00a3100 and shall take an oath of office.\n\"The 66th section, which has reference to the mode of appointing trustees, enacts that in case of death, insolvency or incapacity of acting, those surviving or remaining in office can elect trustees in their stead in the manner prescribed by that section.\n\"72. The proceedings and decisions of the trustees shall be entered in a book kept open to the inspection of the trustees and the creditors of the trust.\n\"73. Account books shall be kept and be opened to the inspection of the trustees and of the creditors. The eighty-first section empowers the trustees to borrow money and to give a mortgage, in the form given, as a security for the sum borrowed.\n\"86. When a new road has been opened and completed, the trustees can sell the old road, (sec. 89) but giving to the original proprietor or the adjoining proprietors the right of preemption. Section 135 provides for the mode of recovering a sum of money due by the trustees and enacts 'that satisfaction shall and may be levied and recovered by distress and sale of the goods and chattels vested in the said trustees or commissioners.'\n\"The above provisions taken in the English statute compared with those I have before cited taken from our own statute clearly show that the legislatures have given an essentially different character to the trusts in both countries.\n\"By the English statute the trusts are established by private enterprise and he property of the roads, tolls, &c., is vested in the commission or body of trustees charged with the duty of administering it in the common interest, whilst by our statute, the trusts were created by the government and the property of the trust is declared to be the property of Her Majesty for the public use of the province.\n\"The appointment of the trustees belongs to the governor, who appoints by letters patent, under the great seal of the province, persons who shall discharge the duties of their office gratuitously, and without deriving any benefit or profit out of the revenue of the roads they manage. On the contrary, in England, the trustees appoint others to any vacancy, and choose persons who, like themselves, have a personal interest in the revenues of the roads under their control. They have the extraordinary power of increasing or diminishing the tolls. Here the same power could only be exercised by the Governor-in-Council, or by the parliament. The necessary funds to construct and complete the roads were raised here by the sale of debentures issued by trustees under the authority of the law; whilst in England the commissioners or trustees secure the amount by the private subscriptions of persons associated together for that purpose, and who therefore become, not merely creditors, but proprietors of the 'trust.'\n\"The English act enacts that the trustees must keep books of their orders and proceedings, and also cause to be kept, books of accounts open to their inspection and liable to be audited in their interest. None of these privileges were granted by our statutes to the holders of the debentures of our turnpike roads. The accounts to be kept of the moneys expended, which are said to be public moneys, are to be rendered to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, through the Lords High Commissioners of the Treasury of Her Majesty for the time being. \"Under the English statute any goods or property vested in the trustees may be levied against, for the purpose of paying off any liabilities; here they are declared to be the goods and property of the crown, and as such inalienable even for debt. See Anderson v. The Quebec North Shore Turnpike Trust[2].\n\"From all these differences it is clear to my mind, that under the English law turnpike trusts are nothing more than private corporations, whilst in this country they are public corporations, acting as the organs of the state in effecting a great public improvement. The principal features of the organization of the 'trusts' under our system of laws are precisely the characteristic features which constitute a public corporation, as shown by the following text writer[3].\n\"'But where a corporation is composed exclusively of officers of the government, having no personal interest in it, or with its concerns, and only acting as the organs of the state in effecting a great public improvement, it is a public corporation.' Layne vs. North-Western T. Co.[4]. Then the trustees of the university of Alabama were held to be a public corporation, because the state had the whole interest in the institution without being under any obligation of contract with any one[5].\n'\"The commission includes all the elements which are essential to a public corporation. It is composed exclusively of officers appointed by the crown, having no personal interest in administering the things under their control, and only acting as the organs of the state, effecting a great public improvement.'\nThis last expression applied to our turnpike roads may appear exaggerated at the present day, when the country is covered over with a large system of railways and canals, but when we bear in mind that at the time these turnpike roads were contemplated, there were in the province of Quebec only a few miles of railroads and two canals of a few miles in length; that the bad state of roads was one of the great drawbacks to the opening of the country; and if we recollect, not only the indifference, but the opposition of the public to make the slightest sacrifice in order to repair the roads, it will be better understood why the construction of turnpike roads was considered a great public improvement. And that in order to effect it, it was found necessary that a public law should be passed by an irresponsible legislature, and at the time only such a body could have enacted such a law and have it put into force in all its details. If this institution was able to surmount all obstacles at first and has since been able to aggrandize itself, it is solely because nothing was left, in organizing it, to private enterprise, and because its character was such as to make it a public body, empowered by the government to effect loans of money in order to execute for the government certain improvements with which it had been charged.\n\"If one of the peculiar features in the constitution of a public corporate body is that its members are entirely without any personal interest, on the other hand one of the essential elements of a private corporate body is, that its members have a personal interest in the institution. Whatever authority or power is given to the members of a corporate body, or however general may be its object, if the members of the corporation receive a consideration or an emolument to perform the duties imposed upon them, then that corporate body is considered to be a private corporation.\n\"But the most numerous, and in a secular and commercial point of view, the most important class of private civil corporations, and which are very often called \"companies,\" consist at the present day of banking, insurance, manufacture and extensive trading corporations; and likewise of turnpike, bridge, canal and railroad corporations. The latter kind have a concern with some of the extensive duties of the state; the trouble and charge of which are undertaken and defrayed by them in consideration of an emolument allowed to their members; and in cases of this sort there are the most unquestionable features of a contract, and manifestly a quid pro quo[6].\n\"This authority, if applied to 'trusts' as constituted in England, shows that they are private corporations, but the authority I first cited, proves evidently that our turnpike trusts are public corporations. The conclusion I draw from what I have stated is, that the 'trustees' in this case were the agents of the crown, authorized to put into force a public law relating to turnpike roads. This is really what has been decided already in the case of Anderson v. The Quebec North Shore Turnpike Trustees, viz:\u2014'That the Quebec turnpike trustees are the agents of the crown.' It follows, then, that when the trustees, acting within the scope of their authority, enter into a contract, it is the government, who, having delegated their power, are liable, and not the trustees. 'It is clear, also, that a servant of the crown, contracting in his official capacity, is not personally liable on the contracts so entered into[7].\n\"The government would therefore be liable in this case, unless it is shown that the trustees have not acted within the scope of their authority in issuing these debentures, or unless there can be found in 16 Vic., ch. 235, or in some other act, a positive enactment leaving no doubt that the government is exempted of all responsibility. It was not contended that the trustees had exceeded the limits of their authority. The defence in this case consists simply in averring that the crown s not responsible to the holders of the bonds, and the statement of defence is as follows: 'Not only was no provincial guarantee given or provided for in favour of the bonds issued by the said trust, from the said year, 1853, but it was especially provided in by several statutes passed by the parliament of the said province of Canada, and, amongst others, by the act 12 Vic., ch. 115, by the act 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132, by the act 16 Vic., ch. 235, by the act 20 Vic., ch. 125, that no guarantee for the said debentures should be given by the said late province of Canada, that no money of the said province should be advanced for paying the interest or principal of the sums borrowed by the issue of the said debentures.'\n\"By referring to the statutes mentioned in that paragraph of the defence, it will be seen that what is there alleged cannot be sustained.\n\"In 12 Vic., ch. 115, there is no mention of any provincial guarantee. What is there stated is: 'No moneys shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest.' It is different from the 4 Vic., ch. 17, which had provided the means of paying any arrears of interest on the loan authorized by that act, by allowing the Receiver General to advance out of the provincial funds to the trustees the necessary amount for that purpose. But I cannot find in that section anything which limited the responsibility of the government as to the payment of the capital except by declaring that the loan is made subject to the conditions contained in the ordinance of 4 Vic., ch. 17. This provision is also found to be inserted in the act 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 235. In the extract I have before given of sec. 7 of this act, there is no question of any provincial guarantee having been given or refused. All we find is, as in 12 Vic., ch. 115, and in 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132, that 'no moneys shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of said interest;' as respects the principal, it only enacts that: 'As respects the payment of principal and interest thereof,' the debentures shall rank after those issued under the act passed during the last session of parliament of the province, and hereinbefore cited.' In this lengthy provision, no word or expression can be found which would authorize me in coming to the conclusion that there was any repudiation of, or even that it was intended to repudiate, all responsibility with respect to that loan. If the inevitable consequence of that act was not to make the province responsible, why take the trouble of limiting their responsibility as regards interest only by stating, 'no moneys shall be advanced for the payment of the interest on the debentures.' If the intention of the government had been to exempt the province from all liability, why not make the same enactment with respect to the capital as they did with respect to the interest? The absence of such a declaration is a strong argument that the government did not intend to exempt themselves from the liability of paying at least the principal of the loan. This section, in my opinion, instead of supporting the contention made by the respondent, that the crown is not responsible, on the contrary supposes the obligation of reimbursing, necessarily arising out of the loan.\n\"It was also argued, on behalf of the respondent, that the loan effected under the authority of 16 Vic., ch. 235, was subjected to the provisions contained in the ordinance of 4 Vic., ch. 17, and therefore that the principal cannot be paid out of or chargeable against the general revenue of this province. The inference which is sought to be drawn, is that the Crown had incurred no responsibility for the reimbursement of the loan made under the authority of that ordinance, and consequently the loan made under 16 Vic., ch, 235 is in the same position. Nevertheless, we find that the legislature paid the first loan, and the reason no doubt was, because they admitted the obligation to pay was a consequence of the provisions of the law. The law being the same in both cases, the same obligation to pay the amount of the loan for which the present petition was brought certainly remains.\n\"The enactment that the general revenue shall not be held liable for the moneys borrowed, is explained, first, because the tolls levied by the trustees were declared to form a special fund for the purpose of paying off these bonds, then also for this other self-evident reason, because the ordinary expenditure of the government was the first charge upon the general revenue it was not intended to adopt a mode of payment which at that time might have created disorder in the financial arrangements of the year. Moreover, does not the fact of the legislature only stating in the act in question that the general revenue shall not be charged with this debt virtually declare that the legislature shall provide other means to pay with than with the general revenue, which is exempted? The government having still other means of providing for the reimbursement of this loan, thereby contracted the obligation of providing these means, viz: either by increasing the revenues of the special fund, by increasing the tolls, or by creating another fund. This seems necessarily to have-been the intention of the legislature, for it would be impossible to explain their act otherwise than by supposing that they gave the power to the government to borrow money in the name of Her Majesty, at the same time dispensing with the obligation of reimbursing the amount. Such an interpretation of the act being contrary to the dignity and honor of the crown, cannot be entertained for a single moment. \"To say that the provisions of the law contained an obligation to raise a special fund is a much more consistent interpretation, inasmuch as at the time this loan was effected, the government were in the habit of creating special funds. We find that there was the common schools fund, superior education fund, the clergy reserves, the court houses fund, the seigniorial fund, &c., &c. It was no doubt on the establishment of such a fund that the legislature relied to reimburse the principal.\n\"Because the intention has not been carried into effect, is not a reason why there should be any alteration in the legal obligation to reimburse the capital, an obligation arising out of the very terms of the law. It is certainly a matter of indifference to the bondholders to know what mode will be adopted to procure the money.\n\"But if as a matter of fact the statute in so many words enacted, that the government were exempt from all responsibility, then what I have before said would be of no avail. Fortunately for the suppliants this is not the case. For nowhere do I find in the quotations which I have given from 4 Vic. ch. 17, 12 Vic. ch. 115, 14 and 15 Vic. ch. 137 and 16 Vic. ch. 235, the statement put forward in respondent's defence 'that not only was no provincial guarantee given in favor of the bonds issued by. the trust under the authority of 16 Vic. ch. 235, in 1853, but that it was especially provided in and by several statutes that no guarantee should be given for the said debentures by the said late province of Canada; that no money of the said province should be advanced for paying the interest of, or the principal of the sums borrowed by the issue of said debentures.'\n\"The learned counsel were certainly in error when they formulated that general and sweeping proposition, for it cannot be sustained by any of the acts I have just cited. It may be correct in so far as it relates to 20 Vic. ch. 125, for there we find, for the first time, an enactment stating that the provincial government shall not be held responsible for the payment of the principal and interest of the debentures issued under that act.\n\"It was also by this act that the legislature divided the turnpike trust into two different trusts, one for the north shore and the other for the south shore of the St. Lawrence. Sections 8, 9, 11 and 12 authorized these trusts to effect new loans, and it is with respect to these new loans that the following proviso was enacted: 'Provided always that the province shall not guarantee or be liable for the principal or interest of any debentures issued under this act, nor shall any money be advanced or paid therefor out of the provincial funds.'\n\"If this proviso was to be found in 16 Vic. ch. 235 or in the 4 Vic. ch. 17, which is declared by the eighth section to form part of the act, I would not hesitate for a moment and would dismiss the petition on the ground that the government cannot be held liable either for the principal or for the interest of the debentures issued. But as I have already stated, such a provision is not to be found in the previous acts, and it is enacted for the first time in 20 Vic. ch. 125. This must necessarily have been effected in consequence of a change of policy on the part of the government of the day, with respect to turnpike roads, a change which is there enacted for the first time.\n\"I know of no rule of law which would allow me to interpret this provision as being applicable to the previous acts. In order to do so it would be necessary for me to find in the text of the law (what I have not found) a positive declaration stating that such a provision must be considered as forming part of the previous acts. In my opinion, far from helping the respondents' contention, this declaration in this last act seems to me to furnish a strong argument in favor of the suppliants. The only reasonable conclusion to draw seems to me to be that if the legislature had intended in the previous acts to repudiate all guarantee or liability as regards the principal and interest, they would in those previous acts have made use of the same language in order to express the same thing. This provision may be even considered as an interpretation given by the law itself, and declaring that as the government had, up till that time, been liable, henceforth it would cease to be liable for any new loan. This interpretation does not extinguish the obligation previously contracted. The contract entered into legally by the trustees, acting within the scope of their authority, by borrowing the moneys, necessarily implies the obligation to pay back the same. And as the loans were effected by the government through its agents (the trustees) the payment of the same devolves on the government and not on the trustees, who entered into no obligation, as may be seen by the form of debenture which was issued, viz:\n\"NORTH SHORE ROAD LOAN UNDER PROVINCIAL STATUTE OF 1853.\n\u00a3250 Cy.\n\"Certif\u00edcate No. 257. Quebec, 24th March, 1856.\n\"We certify that, under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, passed in the session held in the 16th year of Her Majesty's reign, intituled 'An act to authorize the trustees of the Quebec turnpike road to issue debentures to a certain amount and to place certain roads under their control', there has been borrowed and received from Charles Gethings, Esquire, two hundred and fifty pounds, currency, bearing interest from the date hereof, at the rate of six per cent. per annum, payable half yearly, on the first day of July and on the first day of January, which sum is reimbursable to the said Charles Gethings or bearer hereof, on the twenty-fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord 1871, and is part of the sum to be raised under the said statute to make and complete the roads thereby authorized to be made on the north shore of the St. Lawrence.\nRegistered by J. Porter, Secretary.\nTrustees.\u2014H. Gowen, L. G. Nault, L. T. Macpherson, A. C. Buchanan, John Rowley, Daniel McCallum, Jas. Gibb. \"I am therefore of opinion that the government of Canada became legally indebted to the suppliants, and that under the 111th section of the British North America Act, the Dominion of Canada was made liable for the principal of the debentures issued under the authority of 16 Vic. ch. 235. This interpretation seems to be in accordance with the letter and the intent of the act in virtue of which this loan was effected as well as with the provisions of 4 Vic. ch. 17, incorporated in ch. 235.\n\"The suppliants, however, did not rely so much on the reasons on which I have arrived at a favorable conclusion to them, as upon their argument based on the fact that changes were effected by the legislature in the laws relating to these trusts; such changes, they contend, having virtually destroyed the special fund which was created by means of the levy of tolls, and which was affected to the reimbursement of this loan, are sufficient to render the government generally liable instead of leaving them as theretofore liable only for a limited amount. If this view of the law could prevail the suppliants would, no doubt, benefit by it very much as the government would then be obliged to pay the interest as well as the principal of these debentures.\n\"I will now examine if this contention can be sustained. The act of 16 Vic. ch. 235 did not create any additional revenue in order to pay the interest which would become due on the loan of \u00a330,000 authorized to be made for the Quebec north shore roads, but tolls were to be collected on the south shore roads, for the improvement of which the act also authorized a further loan of \u00a340,000, which sum was expended on the said roads.\n\"Subsequently, four years after, the Quebec turnpike trust was divided into two trusts under the authority of the act I have just mentioned, 20 Vic. ch. 125, viz.; the Quebec north shore turnpike roads trustees and the Quebec south shore turnpike roads trustees, charged respectively with the management of the roads on each shore. By section five of the said act, all debts and liabilities made before the said division, were charged against the trustees of the north shore roads, as follows: 'The north shore trustees shall be liable for the principal and interest of all debentures issued by the \"trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads,\" and for all debts and liabilities of the said trustees, contracted before the day to be appointed as aforesaid for the separation of the trusts.' There is a proviso which declares that should the trustees of the south shore roads have a balance in hand from the roads under their control, they shall, after having paid all expenses, pay over said balance in the hands of the north shore trustees, in order to aid them to pay the principal and interest on the debentures issued prior to the passing of said act.\n\"Amongst the debts and liabilities for which the north shore trustees were declared to be liable was a loan of \u00a340,000, borrowed and expended for the construction of roads on the south shore of the St. Lawrence. \"It is also proved by the admission of facts filed in this suit, that since the separation of the trusts, no moneys levied and collected by the trustees of the south shore were ever employed to pay either the interest or the capital on the said sum of \u00a340,000, and that payments of interest made on account of said sum were so made by means of tolls levied on the north shore roads.\n\"The effect of this legislation has been very disastrous to the bondholders of these two last mentioned sums. By the separation of the trusts they were first deprived of a part of the special fund which was created for the purpose of paying their loans, to wit, the tolls to be collected on the south shore, and then the north shore trust, being constituted in lieu of the old trust, was declared to be liable for the loan of \u00a310,000, which were expended for the construction of the south shore roads and in the interest of the south shore trust.\n\"It cannot be denied, that such legislation has caused great loss to the suppliants. The admission of facts filed in this suit proves it.\n\"But can damages or losses resulting from a law enunciated in clear, precise and unambiguous language be claimed by suppliants? Certainly not. And it is no doubt for this reason that the suppliants have not sought relief on this ground. Their contention is that the legislature, by abolishing, without their consent, a part of the special fund affected to the payment of their bonds, and by declaring to their detriment, that the north shore trust should pay \u00a340,000 expended on the south shore roads, have substituted the government to the first commission, and have thereby contracted a promissory obligation to pay the total amount due. Thus we find the suppliants relying on a contract alleged to be implied from change of legislation, and not on a 'tort,' which can never arise from the passing of a law, nor consequently give a right of action for damages. I think it correct to say that the legislature, by passing this act, have virtually taken upon themselves to dispose of the turnpike trust as being their property, the trust being in reality the property of Her Majesty, as I trust I have before shown it. Had it been the property of the trustees, and not of Her Majesty, the government could not have disposed of it without violating a well known principle of legislation.\n\"The public benefit is deemed a sufficient consideration of a grant of corporate privileges; and hence, when a grant of such privileges is made (being in the nature of an executed contract) it cannot, in case of a private corporation which involves private rights, be revoked[8]. \"This act no doubt passed because the government considered itself, for the reasons I have before given, liable for the debt created by 16 Vic. ch. 235. If such was the case, the government has not changed its position. Then also, the provision contained in the fifth section above cited, for the reasons I have given, can be invoked in support of the contention that the province was responsible for the principal, but there is nothing in that section to show that it was the intention of the legislature to contract a new obligation, viz: the obligation to pay the interest, which they were previously exempted from paying. To gather such an intention, it would be necessary to find words which are not there. Such an interpretation would be in violation of the well known rule of law 'that nothing is to be added or taken from a statute' when you construe it. The change in this legislation cannot therefore be said to have implied a contract to pay the interest, as the statute itself contains an express provision as to interest, as I will show. By separating the 'old trust' into two commissions the 20 Vic. ch. 125 enacted that the previous acts applicable to turnpike roads would remain in force. The third section is as follows: 'And all the provisions of the ordinance and acts hereinbefore mentioned shall apply as they now do, except in so far as they are altered by or may be inconsistent with this act.'\n\"I cannot find anywhere that the following provision with respect to interest, which is contained in the seventh section of ch. 235, 16 Vic., has been revoked, altered or modified: 'and no moneys shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest.'\n\"It is utterly impossible, with such clear and precise words before you, to contend that the government can be made liable for the interest. There is no room for construction in such a case as this. \"When the language is free from doubt it best declares, without more, the intention of the law-giver, and is decisive of it. The legislature, in such a case, must be intended to mean what it has plainly expressed, and consequently there is no room for construction.\n\"The result of this legislation is, in my opinion, that the bondholders' position as to interest since the passing of 20 Vic., ch 125, remains exactly what it was after the passing of 16 Vic., ch. 235, sec. 7, to wit: they cannot in law render the government liable for the interest. Nevertheless it cannot be denied, as I have before said, that the guarantee and sureties which these bondholders had on the tolls to be levied on the south shore roads have virtually been taken away, and that in this respect this legislation has interfered with their vested rights.\n\"However serious may be the pecuniary losses the bondholders will have to sustain in consequence of this legislation, it is quite out of my power to give them any relief. The law not being uncertain, my only duty is to administer it such as I find it. This point is so clear that it ought not to be necessary to cite any authorities, but as it will not add much to this already lengthy judgment, I will quote two or three of them.\n\"'Though vested rights are divested, and acts which were perfectly lawful when done are subsequently made unlawful by a statute, those who have to interpret the law must give effect to it. And they are bound to do this even when they suspect or conjecture that the language does not faithfully express what was the real intention of the legislature when it passed the act, or would have been its intention if the specific case had been proposed to it'[9].\n\"Sedgwick[10] argues that the judiciary have no right whatever to set aside, to avoid, or nullify a law passed in relation to a subject within the scope of legislative authority on the ground that it conflicts with the notions of natural right, abstract justice, or sound morality.\n\"And Kent[11]\u2014where it is said that if a statute is contrary to natural equity or reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the cases are understood to mean that the court is to give them a reasonable construction. They will not, out of respect and duty to the lawgiver, presume that every unjust or absurd consequence was within the contemplation of the law, but if it should be too palpable to meet with but one construction, there is no doubt in the English law of the efficacy of the statute.\n\"Blackstone\u2014'If the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power in the ordinary forms of the constitution that is vested with authority to contest it, and the examples usually alleged in support of this sense of the rule, do none of them prove that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable, the judges are at liberty to reject it for that reason, for that were to assert the judicial power above that of the legislature.'\n\"For these reasons I am forced to reject the proposition propounded that the effect of the legislation of 20 Vic., ch. 125, was to create an obligation on the part of the government to pay any arrears of interest of the debentures issued under the authority of 16 Vic., ch. 235.\n\"In conclusion, I am of opinion that 'the Quebec turnpike trust,' as it was constituted at the time of the passing of the act 16 Vic., ch. 235, was a public corporation charged with the execution, in the interest of the public, of great works of improvement.\n\"That the trustees of that trust, acting within the scope of their authority, did not incur any personal liabilities, but were the agents of the Crown. \"That the roads, bridges and other property put under their control, were not vested in them as their property and were not liable to be levied against, because by the ordnance 4 Vic. ch. 17, they were declared to be the property of Her Majesty.\n\"That the said trustees in issuing, in conformity with the provisions of the act 16 Vic. ch. 235, debentures for the various loans therein mentioned, loans effected for the purpose of ameliorating properties declared to be vested in Her Majesty, and the proceeds of which were in fact employed in said improvements, were in law the agents of the government who thereby become liable.\n\"That independently of the obligation contracted as above by the trustees, under the special provisions contained in the above acts, viz.: 4 Vic ch. 17, 14 and 15 Vic. ch. 115, and 16 Vic. ch. 235, the government of Canada can be held liable for the repayment of the principal of the debentures, which amount is claimed by the present petition.\n\"That the suppliants have suffered losses by the alterations made in the law by 20 Vic. ch. 125, but that the liability of the government remains what it was and cannot be increased in consequence of said alterations, and therefore under the section seven the government should be declared free from all liability as to interest:\n\"That as the loans in question, at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, formed part of the liabilities of the late province of Canada, they have become, by virtue of the 111th section of said act, a debt and liability of the Dominion of Canada.\n\"And lastly, that the suppliants are entitled to the relief sought by their petition of right, to the amount of principal, without interest, but with costs of said petition.\" A motion was made on behalf of Her Majesty for an order calling upon the suppliants to show cause why a new trial should not be granted, or a rehearing or a review of the cause directed, or why the judgment for the suppliants herein should not be set aside and a judgment entered for Her Majesty upon the evidence adduced at the trial upon the following grounds:\u2014\n1. Because it had not been proved that the late province of Canada was ever liable for the amount awarded the suppliants by the judgment in this cause.\n2. Because the said judgment was based upon the ground that the trustees of the Quebec North Shore Turnpike Trust, when issuing the debentures, the amount whereof is claimed by the suppliants, were acting as agents of the government, and that the said late province of Canada was then liable for their acts.\n3. Because the said trustees never were agents of the government of the said late province of Canada.\n4. Because the said trustees never had any authority to pledge the credit of the said late province of Canada to the payment either of the principal or of the interest of the said debentures.\n5. Because the judgment rendered in this case on the 24th December, 1879, should have dismissed the petition herein of the suppliants.\n6. Because the said judgment was contrary to the evidence adduced.\nThe court rejected the motion, and thereupon an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe case was argued in the Supreme Court by Mr. Church, Q. C, and Mr. Langelier, Q. C., on behalf of the crown, and by Mr. Irvine, Q.C., and Mr. Dalton McCarthy, Q. C., on behalf of the respondents.\nThe arguments, authorities and statutes relied upon are fully reviewed in the judgments of the court. RITCHIE, C. J.:\nSo far back as the year 1796, an act, 86 Geo. 3, ch. 9, was passed in the then province of Lower Canada for making, repairing and altering the highways and bridges within that province. By this act it was provided that all the King's highways and public bridges should be made and repaired and kept up under the directions of the grand voyer of each and every district within the province, or his deputy: and the act provides that the occupiers of lands, whether proprietors or farmers, adjoining the King's highways called front roads, should make and keep in good repair the said highways and ditches upon the breadth of their said lands respectively, and also the bridges which are not declared by the proces verbaux of the grand voyers, or their deputies, to be such as ought to be kept in repair at the public expense. The act contained many provisions and regulations, but all were of a purely local character, and power was given to the justices, in their general quarter sessions of the peace, to hear, examine and determine matters and things relating to proces verbaux, that should be made in their districts; the subject of the care, management and regulation of highways being dealt with throughout the act as matter of local and municipal concern, the regulations as to the cities and parishes of Quebec and Montreal being dealt with in a different manner from the districts under the care of the grand voyer, but still as of a local and municipal character. This continued until the year 1841, when the governor of Lower Canada and special council, the then legislative authority of the province, under stat. 1 & 2 Vic., chap. 9, and 2 & 3 Vic., chap. 53, passed a certain ordinance, entitled \"An ordinance to provide for the improvement of certain roads in the neighborhood of and leading to the city of Quebec and to raise a fund for that purpose.\"\nThat ordinance proceeded to enact that all powers, authorities, jurisdiction and control over or with regard to the roads therein mentioned, or any of them, which then vested in any magistrate, grand voyer, overseer of roads, or road surveyor or other road officer, by the said act passed in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of His said late Majesty George the Third, hereinbefore mentioned, or by any other act or ordinance or law whatever, or in any district council, should cease and determine from and after the time when the trustees authorized to be named by the said ordinance should assume the management, charge and control of the said roads; and further, that it should be lawful for the governor of the said province of Lower Canada, by letters patent, under the great seal of the province, at any time after the passing of the said ordinance, to appoint not less than five nor more than nine persons to be trustees for the purpose of opening, making and keeping in repair the roads in the said ordinance specified, and for acquiring property and estate, moveable and immoveable, which being so acquired, should vest in her Majesty for the public use of the province.\nSuppliants allege in section 23 of their petition, that by 16 Vic., chap. 285, of province of Canada, the provisions of this ordinance of 1841 were extended to certain other roads, specifying them.\nAnd by section 25, that the sum of \u00a330,000 was authorized to be raised by way of loan, for which loan trustees issued debentures in the form prescribed by ordinance of 1841.\nAnd by section 31, that the debentures so issued bore date between 22nd March, 1854, and 1st December, 1859, and fell due between the 2nd March, 1869, and 1st December, 1874. And by section 32, that by said 16 Vic, chap. 235, the provisions of the ordinance of 1841 were further extended to certain enumerated roads on the south shore of the St. Lawrence.\nSection 33, that a further sum of \u00a340,000 was by the said last mentioned act authorized to be raised for making, etc., these last mentioned roads on the south side, and trustees were empowered to issue debentures in the form prescribed by the ordinance of 1841.\nAnd by section 34, allege that debentures were issued for \u00a340,000, bearing date between 8th June, 1854, and 9th October, 1858. and fell due between 8th June, 1869, and 9th October, 1873.\nSection 45, suppliants represent that they are bond fide holders of debentures issued for loan of \u00a330,000, to the amount of \u00a39,708 = $38,832 currency; and by section 46, that they are likewise bon\u00e2 fide holders of debentures issued for loan of \u00a340,000, to the amount of \u00a37,810 = $31,240 currency.\nAnd by section 47 they further allege that these debentures having fallen due, no part of principal has been paid and the whole remains due, together with interest from 1st July, 1872.\nAnd by section 48 suppliants allege that there was never any fund created for the payment at maturity of the said bonds and debentures, nor did there exist at any time in the hands of the said trustees (to wit the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads, the Quebec north shore turnpike trustees and the Quebec south shore turnpike trustees) any fund whatever for the payment of the said bonds and debentures, nor does there exist now in the hands of the present trustees any fund or funds whatever for the payment of the same.\nThat the said bonds and debentures were debts and liabilities of the late province of Canada, at the time \"The British North America Act 1867\" came into force and the dominion of Canada came into existence.\nThat it is enacted by \"The British North America Act 1867,\" as follows:\n\"Section 111.\u2014Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union:'' that all debts and liabilities of the province of Canada existing at the union, whether due in connection with the turnpike trust, or from any and every other cause, were thus imposed on her Majesty's government of Canada for payment, and the imperial legislation which nullified the legal and political existence of the suppliants' debtor, the province of Canada, created in their favor a new debtor in her Majesty's government of Canada; which sums, amounting to $70,072, they now seek to recover in this proceeding.\nThe trustees appointed under this ordinance were, in my opinion, constituted a quasi-municipal corporation, not to represent the crown or the province, nor to act as agents for either, but to discharge municipal functions in the improvement and care of certain local roads: and to enable them to accomplish this were clothed with power to raise money by means of debentures on a certain specified security, and so to perform duties which up to the time of their incorporation had been discharged by the grand voyer with funds or means raised directly from the inhabitants of the districts through which the roads passed; and though these trustees may be consideded in the light of a public corporation, it by no means follows that the holders of such debentures have therefore a claim on the crown or on the general revenues of the country for payment of either principal or interest on their debentures. Though a public corporation, these trustees can act only within the scope of their legislative authority; they can bind neither the crown, the legislature, nor the public revenues, nor any person or fund beyond what the statute permits. To the contracts, as contained in the debentures and in the statutes authorizing their issue, must we look to discover the liabilities created and the fund or means which the legislature has provided for meeting such liabilities.\nThe question is not, have these suppliants in a moral or a political point of view a just and equitable claim on the province of Quebec, which should induce its legislature to make provision for indemnifying them for the money advanced, either by imposing the whole burthen on the whole province by granting the money from the general revenues of the province, or by authorizing a local assessment on the inhabitants of the districts more immediately benefited by the expenditure, and upon whom before the passing of the ordinance the legal burthen and liability rested, for the reparation and maintenance of the roads passing through their respective districts, either on the ground that the province or a part of it has practically received the benefit of the expenditure of the money so advanced, or on the ground that by subsequent legislation the security on which the loan was made was impaired, or on any other equitable ground which in foro conscienti\u0153 ought to induce the legislature to protect or indemnify the suppliants, if the suppliants can make it appear that any such ground exists.\nBut the question we have to determine is simply and purely a legal one. Did these suppliants advance their money on the credit of the acts, and on the security of the tolls and means provided by the acts under the authority of which the debentures were issued, and rely on the funds and means so provided for their reimbursement? or was there in addition thereto a statutory contract or obligation (for there certainly was no other duty when the money was advanced) between the debenture holders and the crown or government of the province of Quebec, that the government would guarantee the sufficiency and proper management and distribution of the funds and means provided by the act, and in the event of such funds and means proving inadequate, or by reason of mismanagement or dereliction of duty on the part of the trustees insufficient, that the crown or government would provide the money to make good any such deficiency? For the. liability of the crown must, if the suppliants' contention is correct, be not only a liability to pay in the event of the tolls and revenues being themselves inadequate, but also should there be a misapplication of the tolls and revenues when collected, or a deficiency from a neglect to collect the tolls, or a loss of tolls by exemptions from payment of tolls contrary to express legislative provisions, or from other reasons; because, in this case, it appears there was a misapplication of some of the money and a neglect to enforce the payment of tolls by granting exemptions in direct defiance of legislation to the contrary, and neglect to collect from proprietors the amounts due and payable as provided by law; for we see that while by the ordinance the proprietors are required to commute by means of an annual sum, the book put in, to be used as evidence, states that it does not appear that this provision has ever been put into execution by the trustees. And again, by the 23 Vic. ch. 69, all exemptions are abolished, except funerals, but this same book says that the trustees have not acted on this statute, but have always acted as if this act had not been passed. By the same book \u00a3404 appears to have been misappropriated by the secretary of the trustees, and though judgment was obtained the book says no execution was ever issued or proceedings taken against his sureties. In other words, then, did the crown or government agree, in the event of the debentures not being paid at maturity by the trustees, to pay and discharge them? Did the legislature pledge the crown or the general province for the liquidation of these debentures? Or did the legislature create a fund to which alone the debenture holders were to look for payment of their interest and ultimately for the repayment of the principal sums advanced?\nTo ascertain this we must in the first instance look to 1 and 2 Vic. ch. 9, and 2 and 3 Vic. ch 53, for the authority of the Governor in Council, and to the ordinance of 4 Vic. ch. 17. By these acts it is provided, in 1 and 2 Vic. ch. 9, section 3, that it shall not be lawful by any such law or ordinance to impose any tax, duty, rate or impost, save only in so far as any tax, duty, rate or impost which at the passing of this act is payable within the province may be thereby continued.\nBy section 3 of the 2 and 3 Vic. ch. 53, so much of the 1 and 2 Vic. ch. 9 as provides that it shall not be lawful by any such law or ordinance as therein mentioned to impose any tax, duty, rate or impost, save only in so far as any tax, duty, rate or impost which at the passing of that act was payable within the said province of Lower Canada, or might be continued, shall be and the same is hereby repealed: Provided always, that it shall not be lawful for the said governor, with such advice and consent as aforesaid, to make any law or ordinance imposing or authorizing the imposition of any new tax, duty, rate or impost, except for carrying into effect local improvements within the said province of Lower Canada, or any district or other local division thereof, or for the establishment or maintenance of police or other objects of municipal government within any city, or town, or district, or other local division of the said province; provided also, that in every law or ordinance imposing or authorizing the imposition of any such new tax, duty, rate or impost, provision shall be made for the levying, receipt and appropriation thereof by such person or persons as shall be thereby appointed or designated for that purpose, but that no such new tax, rate, duty or impost shall be levied by, or made payable to the receiver-general, or any other public officer employed in the receipt of Her Majesty's ordinary revenue in the said province, nor shall any such law or ordinance as aforesaid provide for the appropriation of any such new tax, duty, rate or impost by the said governor, either with or without the advice of the executive council of the said province, or by the commissioners of Her Majesty's treasury, or by any other officer of the crown employed in the receipt of Her Majesty's ordinary revenue.\nHere, then, we have the governor and council strictly limited to the imposition of charges for local and municipal purposes.\nBy the ordinance 4 Vic., ch. 17, the governor was, as has been stated, authorized by letters patent to appoint not less than five nor more than nine persons, who, and their successors, should be trustees for the purpose of making and keeping in repair the roads thereinafter specified.\nSection 3 provides that these trustees might sue and be sued by a certain name and take and hold property and estate.\nBy section 9 the roads to and over which the provisions of the ordinance and the powers of the trustees should extend are specified.\nSection 10 provides for the trustees exacting and receiving tolls. Sections 13, 15 and 16 provide for certain exemptions from payment of tolls, and authorize trustees to commute.\nSection 17 authorizes tolls to be let by auction.\nSection 18 provides that the roads are to be under the exclusive control of the trustees; and the powers of grand voyer, magistrates and road officers to cease, and that the tolls shall be applied exclusively to the purposes of the ordinance.\nBy section 19, parties bound by law to perform any labor on any of the said roads must commute by payment of an annual sum, with a proviso lor compelling commutation; and then we have section 21, authorizing the trustees to raise money by loan. That section is in these words:\u2014\nAnd be it further ordained, etc., that it shall be lawful for the said trustees, as soon after the passing of this ordinance as may be expedient, to raise by way of loan, on the credit and security of the tolls hereby authorized to be imposed, and of other monies which may come into the possession and be at the disposal of the said trustees under and by virtue of this ordinance, and not to be paid out of or be chargeable against the general revenue of this province, any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole twenty-five thousand pounds currency; and out of the monies so raised, as well as out of the monies which shall come into their hands, and which are not hereby directed to be applied solely to one special purpose, it shall be lawful for the said trustees to defray any expenses they are authorized to incur for the purposes of this ordinance.\nAnd next sections 22 and 23 provide for the issue of debentures in these words:\u2014\nSection 22.\u2014And be it further ordained, etc., that it shall be lawful for the said trustees to cause to be made out for such sum or sums of money as they may raise by loan as aforesaid, debentures in. the form contained in the schedule A., to this ordinance annexed, redeemable at such time or times (subject to the provisions herein made) as the said trustees shall think most safe and convenient; which said debentures shall be signed in the manner above provided for in the written acts relating to the said trust and shall be transferable by delivery.\nSection 23\u2014And be it further ordained, etc., that such debentures shall respectively bear interest at the rate therein mentioned; and such interest shall be made payable semi-annually, and may, at the discretion of the trustees, and with the express approval and sanction of the governor of this province, and not otherwise, exceed the rate of six per centum per annum, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, and shall be the lowest rate at which the said sum or sums to be loaned on any such debentures, shall be offered or can be obtained by the said trustees; such interest to be paid out of the tolls upon the said roads, or out of any other monies at the disposal of the trustees for the purposes of this ordinance.\nThe form given of the debenture is as follows:\u2014\nCertificate No\nCurrency. Quebec, 18\nCertificate No.\nCurrency\nWe certify, that under the authority of the provincial ordinance of Lower Canada, passed in the fourth year of Her Majesty's reign, and intituled \"An ordinance to provide for the improvement of certain roads in the neighborhood of and leading to the city of Quebec, and to raise a fund for that purpose,\" there has been borrowed and received from the sum of pounds currency, bearing interest from the date hereof at the rate of per cent.\nInterest at per cent. 18\nInterest on this certificate paid\nJan. 18 Receipt No.\nJuly\nper annum, payable half-yearly on the day of and on the day of which sum is reimbursable to the said or bearer hereof on the day of in the manner provided for by the provincial ordinance aforesaid.\nRegistered by ............................\n............................ Trustees.\n............................\nJan. 18\nJuly\nJan. 18\nJuly\nJan. 18\nJuly\nJan. 18\nIt is difficult to understand how any lender or holder of debentures issued under the authority of this ordinance could be in any doubt as to the credit and security on which he loaned his money, or as to the fund to which he was to look for re-imbursement of principal and interest; still less could he have any doubt that he was not to be paid out of, or that his loan was not to be chargeable against, the general revenues of the province, but that his money was to be re-imbursable to him, or to the bearer of his debentures, in the manner provided for by the said ordinance; and these provisions but carry out the intention of the legislature as expressed in the preamble, which recites that:\nWhereas the state of the roads hereinafter mentioned, in the neighborhood of and leading to the city of Quebec is such as to render their improvement an object of immediate and urgent necessity, and it is therefore expedient to provide means for effecting such improvement, and to create a fund for defraying the expense thereof and the expenses necessary for keeping the said roads in permanent repair.\nAnd sections 26 and 27 seem to me to show very conclusively that the province was in no way involved in the transaction either as the principal, or as a surety, or guarantor, but that the legislature deals with the province as it would with an outsider wholly unconnected with the trustees, and in a manner wholly inconsistent with the relation of principal and agent which it is now put forward existed between the province and the trustees, wholly inconsistent with the idea of the government of the province being the borrower and liable for the repayment of the debentures. The sections are as follows:\nSection 26.__And be it further ordained and enacted, that it shall be lawful for the governor for the time being, if he shall deem it expedient, at any time within three years from the passing of this ordinance, and not afterwards, to purchase for the public uses of this province, and from the said trustees, debentures to an amount not exceeding ten thousand pounds currency, and by warrant under his hand to authorize the receiver-general to pay to the said trustees, out of any unappropriated public monies in his hands, the sum secured by such debentures; the interest and principal of and on which shall be paid to the receiver-general by the said trustees, in the same manner and under the same provisions as are provided with regard to such payments to any lawful holder of such debentures, and being so paid, shall remain in the hands of the receiver-general, at the disposal of the legislative authority of the province for the time being.\nSection 27 \u2014And be it further ordained, &c., that if at any time it shall happen that the monies then in the hands of the said trustees shall be insufficient to enable the trustees to make any payment required or authorized to be made by this ordinance, all arrears of interest due on any debentures issued under the authority of this ordinance shall be paid by the said trustees before any part of the principal sum then due upon and secured by any such debenture shall be so paid; and if the deficiency be such that the funds then at the disposal of the trustees shall not be sufficient to pay such arrears of interest, it shall then be lawful for the governor for the time being, by warrant under his hand, to authorize the receiver-general to advance to the said trustees, out of any unappropriated monies in his hands, such sum of money as may, with the funds then at the disposal of the trustees, etc., be sufficient to pay such arrears of interest as aforesaid, and the amount so advanced shall be repaid by the said trustees to the receiver-general out of the sums to be commuted, levied and collected as aforesaid, and being so repaid, shall remain in the hands of the receiver-general at the disposal of the legislative authority of the province.\nAnd sections 25 and 28 likewise show, I think, that the redemption of the debentures was to be by the trustees from the funds collected by them, and not by the government, nor from the provincial revenues.\nThese sections are as follows:\nSection 25.\u2014And be it further ordained, etc., that nothing herein contained shall prevent the said trustees from voluntarily redeeming any debentures, with the consent of the lawful holder thereof, at any time before such debentures shall be made redeemable, if the state of the funds of the said trustees shall be such as to warrant such redemption, and if the said trustees shall obtain the approval of the governor to such redemption.\nSection 28.\u2014And be it further ordained, etc., that over and above the sums which the said trustees are authorized by the preceding sections of this ordinance to raise by way of loan, it shall be lawful for the said trustees at any time, and as often as occasion may require, to raise in like manner such further sum or sums as may be necessary to enable them to pay. off the principal of any loan which they have bound themselves to repay at any certain time, and which the funds in their hands, or which will probably be in their hands, at such time and applicable to such repayment, shall appear insufficient to enable them to repay: Provided always, that any sum or sums raised under the authority of this section shall be applied solely to the purpose herein mentioned; that no such sum shall be borrowed without the approval of the governor of this province, and that the whole sum due by the said trustees under the debentures then unredeemed and issued under the authority of this ordinance shall in no case exceed thirty-five thousand pounds currency; and all the provisions of this ordinance touching the terms on which any shall be borrowed under the authority thereof by the trustees, the rate of interest payable thereon, the payment of such interest, the advance by the receiver-general of the sums necessary to enable the trustees to pay such interest, and the repayment of the sum so advanced, shall be extended to any sum or sums borrowed under the authority of this section.\nI think nothing can be much more apparent than that the money to be raised under this ordinance was to be solely on the credit and security of the tolls and monies which might come into the possession and be at the disposal of the trustees by virtue of the ordinance, and not to be repaid out of or chargeable against the general revenue of the province, that the government was not authorized by the said ordinance to, and could not by virtue thereof, legally raise a loan on the faith and credit of the government or province, nor to pledge in any way the public funds or property of the province, for the repayment of any debentures issued thereunder.\nIf the language of these enactments does not establish this, I am at a loss to conceive language that could make it very much more clear. Looking, then, first at the ordinance, I think it is abundantly clear that the governor and council did not thereby intend to relieve the locality from the burthen of repairing and keeping in order the roads mentioned therein, or to cast the obligation on the province at large, but adopting the turnpike principle in operation in the mother country as affording the means of raising money for the improvement of the roads, as well as the permanent maintenance, simply transferred the management of the roads from the grand voyer to the trustees; and instead of continuing the system by which the proprietors of lands through which the roads passed were bound to keep them in repair, created a fund by imposing tolls on those who should use the roads and by commutation money to be payable by those who up to that time were obliged by law to repair or keep the roads in order, and so on the credit of those tolls and commutation moneys, to borrow for the purposes of the ordinance the moneys thereby authorized, taking care, however, from abundant caution, to declare that any money so borrowed was not to be payable out of the general revenues of the province, no doubt to prevent the possibility of any inference being drawn from the receiver-general being permitted to advance by way of loan to the trustees to pay interest, that the government were to be in any way liable or responsible for the principal; and that, so far as the borrowing and obtaining money was concerned, I think this ordinance was suggested by and based on the principles of the English turnpike acts. In England the trustees or commissioners were authorized to borrow on the credit of the tolls, and to mortgage the tolls as security to persons advancing the money, and the trustees pursuing the form of security prescribed by the statutes, were exonerated from personal liability, and the lenders left to the security of the tolls for their re-imbursement, a security of which, numerous cases on the books show, capitalists have constantly availed themselves. (See 39 Geo. 4, c. 126, sec. 81; 5 Geo. 4, c. 92, sec. 61; 7 and 8 Geo. 4, c. 24.)\nThough from many cases to be found in the English books it is abundantly evident that frequently the revenues of turnpike roads have not only been unequal to the payment of the monies due on mortgage of the tolls, but also unequal to the maintenance of the roads, it has never, that I can discover, been contended that this cast on the government a duty to pay the one or repair the other; but to meet such cases without going into the particular legislation on the subject, it may be said generally, either the common law duty of repairing the roads has been invoked, or legislative provisions have been made, whereby, by assessment, deficiencies have been made up, or failing the security of the tolls or revenues, toll mortgagees have been compelled to sustain the loss of a bad investment.\nThe cases of the Queen v. White[12] and Reg. v. Trustees South Shields Turnpike Road[13], and Reg. v. Hutchinson[14] afford illustrations of the course of legislation in England when tolls were not of themselves sufficient to defray both the expenses of keeping the road in repair, and that of paying interest and principal on monies due and owing on the credit of the Act, the legislative remedy being by assessment, or from local funds. I think the legislature acted on the principle, right or wrong, that the roads and the traffic over them afforded ample security for any money borrowed necessary for their improvement and maintenance, and that capitalists would be found ready and willing to advance, as in England, the necessary means on the security of the tolls and the means provided by the Act.\nIt has been urged that in England the turnpike corporations are generally private companies, while here the trustees are acting not for their own private advantage but for the benefit of the public, and therefore there is no analogy, but this does not, in my opinion, in the least affect the principle on which the money in both cases is to be raised, viz., on the security of the tolls and revenues of the roads, because there as well as here the turnpikes were public highways and the public there derived as much benefit from the expenditure of the money loaned as here.\nA good deal of stress has been laid on sections 29 and 37, as indicating that the improving, care and maintenance of the roads under this ordinance was a public work belonging to the province. The sections are these:\nSection 29.\u2014And be it further ordained, &c., that the due application of all public monies whereof the expenditure or receipt is authorized by the preceding sections, shall be accounted for to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, through the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's treasury, for the time being, in such manner and form as Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, shall be pleased to direct.\nSection 37. And be it further ordained and enacted that the said trustees shall lay detailed accounts of all monies by them received and expended under the authority of this ordinance supported by proper vouchers, and also detailed reports of all their doings and proceedings under the said authority, before such officer, at such times, and in such manner and form, and shall publish the same in such way, at the expense of the said trustees, as the governor shall be pleased to direct.\nBut this is no more than was required by the 36 Geo. 3, cap. 9, which enacts that all the King's highways and public bridges shall be made, repaired and kept up under the direction of the grand voyer of each and every district within the province, and which we have seen is an enactment containing provisions of a purely local and municipal character, and which imposes no burdens or liabilities whatever on the crown or government of the province. By section 74 it is enacted in these words:\nAnd all monies arising by virtue of this act are hereby granted to His Majesty for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned, and the due application thereof accordingly (that is to say, to the repairs of the highways and bridges) shall be accounted for to His Majesty through the commissioners of His Majesty's treasury for the time being, in such manner and form as His Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall direct.\nThese provisions, then, 29 and 37 of the ordinance, were obviously not intended to, and did not, any more than the similar sections in the 36 Geo. 3, impose any pecuniary liability on the crown, or establish any contract between the crown and the debenture holders, or to take the turnpikes out of the category of municipal institutions, but they were, in my opinion, for the protection of the public interested in the proper expenditure of the money on the roads, and also for the security of the debenture holders to ensure, by a direct accountability to a proper authority, the faithful discharge by the trustees of their financial duties to the public and to the debenture holders.\nThen, again, it has been urged that, as the property was vested in the crown by the ordinance, that created a contract, obligation, or duty to repay money borrowed, to be expended in acquiring or maintaining such property. Vesting the property in the crown was doubtless to indicate that the character of public highways was to be preserved. It is said in Regina v. Lordimere[15] \"arguendo\" that \"in many of the local turnpike acts there is an express enactment that the roads, when made, shall be a public highway;\" there was such a clause in the act in Rex v. Netherton[16].\nBut with whatever intent this was done, this of itself could create no liability to repay the sums loaned to these trustees, the ordinance and the debentures issued under its authority constituted the contract between the trustees and the lenders outside of which neither party as against the other, or as against any third party party, governmental or other, had, in my opinion, any claim.\nLet us now examine the 16 Vic., ch. 235, which was passed by the legislature established under the 3 and 4 Vic., ch. 35, an act to re-unite the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada and for the government of Canada, and by authority of which the debentures now in question were issued, to ascertain whether they were placed on any other or different footing than those issued under the authority of the ordinance; to ascertain this it will be only necessary to refer to those sections having reference to the raising money by loan for the purposes of the act. Section 7 provides that:\nIn order to the making and completion of the several roads described and mentioned in the act passed during the last session of provincial parliament (14 and 15 Vic. ch. 132) and also to the improving and macadamizing of the roads hereinbefore meniioned, and the making of the various improvements hereinabove mentioned, it shall be lawful for the said turnpike trustees to raise by loan, a sum not exceeding \u00a330,000 currency, and this loan, the debentures which shall be issued to effect the same, and all other matters having reference to the said loan, shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance above cited with respect to the loan authorized under it: Provided nevertheless, that the rate of interest to be taken under this act shall in no case exceed the rate of 6 per centum, and no moneys shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest; and all the debentures which shall be issued under this act, so far as relates to the interest payable thereupon, shall have a privilege of priority of lien upon the tolls and other monies which shall come into the possession and shall be at the disposal of the said trustees, in preference to the interest payable upon all debentures which shall have been issued under the provincial guarantee, and also to all other claims for the re-imbursement of any sums of money advanced or to be advanced to the said trustees by the receiver-general of this province, and the said debentures as respects the payment of the principal and interest thereof, shall rank after those issued under the act passed during the last session of the parliament of the province, and hereinbefore cited.\nAnd be it enacted: That for the completion of the roads, bridges and improvements mentioned in the two next preceding sections; it shall be. lawful for the said trustees to issue debentures to the amount of forty thousand pounds currency, which debentures shall be wholly subject to the provisions of the ordinance hereinbefore cited, shall take precedence of those issued under the provincial guarantee, and of the claim of the government; to be repaid out of the revenues of the said toll-gates, and shall take order and precedence and rank currently with those to be issued by and under the seventh section of this act.\nHere we see that this act, so far as relates to the borrowing powers of the trustees, embodies the provisions of the ordinance and makes the debentures issued expressly subject to the provisions of the ordinance, except that while in the ordinance permission was given the government to advance by way of loan to the trustees, to aid them in paying interest, in this act it is declared that no money shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of interest.\nI do not think it at all necessary to inquire what debentures were here referred to as having been issued under the provincial guarantee, because, assuming the provincial guarantee to have been given to debentures theretofore issued, that guarantee would not attach to the debentures now in question without express legislative authority, and the fact that this act expressly takes away the right of the government to advance on account of interest, and gives these debentures priority over debentures issued under a provincial guarantee, and so clearly distinguishes between those issued under this act without a provincial guarantee and those that may have been issued under a provincial guarantee, without even referring to the clause of the ordinance declaring that the debentures shall not be payable out of the general revenues, shows as strongly as very well can be, that the legislature never intended that the crown or general revenues were to become liable for the repayment of these debentures. Thus we find that by the 16 Vic., ch. 235, the loans authorized by that act and the debentures which shall be issued to effect the same, and all having reference to such loan, shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance, except that the permissive authority to advance on account of interest is expressly taken away, \"no monies shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest\"; but so far as relates to the interest, the debentures are to have a privilege of priority of lien upon the tolls, in preference to the interest payable on debentures issued under the provincial guarantee and other claims for reimbursement of any sums advanced to the trustees by the receiver-general. As we have seen, the 4 Vic., ch. 17 having allowed the receiver-general to advance out of the provincial funds money to pay arrears of interest, providing at the same time for its repayment by the trustees, as subsequent acts were passed, and loans and debentures made, subject to the provisions of the 4 Vic., ch. 17, we find that this assistance from the provincial funds is not to apply, and therefore 12 Vic. ch. 115, 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132, and the act under consideration, 16 Vic., ch. 235, all provide that \"no money shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest.\" It is asked, why was there no. provision that no money should be advanced to pay the capital? The answer seems very obvious: for the very good reason that in the 4 Vic. the loan is made on the credit and payable out of the funds of the roads, and there is not one word authorizing the advance of a cent from the provincial funds on account of the principal, nor is there one word in that statute directly or indirectly implying a liability on the part of the crown or government to pay the principal or any portion of it. The ordinance which governs this loan expressly provides that it is not to be paid out of the general revenues, and so no necessity or reason for saying that the principal should not be advanced which was never authorized to be advanced; so that when the right to advance on account of interest was ignored the loans simply stood on the security of the act minus the provision for advancing on account of interest. But may it not be much more pertinently asked why, if the crown or government was legally bound to pay both principal and interest as a debt contracted by the agent, as now contended, what possible object could there be in giving the receiver-general a permissive power to advance by way of loan interest, when, if what is now contended for is law, there was a legal obligatory duty growing out of the act to pay both principal and interest; and if the crown or government were legally bound to pay principal and interest, as on a loan contracted by duly authorized agents, upon what principle was it enacted that no monies shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for payment of interest, if the loan was to the government and for the public benefit? Surely the duty and obligation to see the interest paid was quite as great as to see the principal repaid; and if liable for principal and interest, why was there such a provision in the 4 Vic., that any money so advanced for interest should be repaid by the trustees, the agents of the government, to their principals, and if there was really a loan to and a debt due by the crown, why was there a positive prohibition to its payment from the general revenue, and there being no other provision made for its liquidation, how could it possibly be paid by the government?\nBut the suppliants in their petition, section 55, subsection 14, say,\nThe provision in the said ordinance that the loans should be made on the credit and security of the tolls to be imposed on the roads for the improvements of which such loans were contracted and should be payable out of the same and not out of or chargeable against the general revenue of the province, was one entirely in the interests of the lenders and was held out as an inducement to them to lend their money, which makes a contract obligation on the province of Canada to fulfil, of that highly obligatory character attaching to all promissory obligations, and created no exemptions of the general revenues of the province of Canada from liability for the repayment of such loans, except upon the double condition of the said province having created such adequate fund and supplying such fund, in fact, to the payment of such loans.\nIt passes my ability to comprehend and appreciate the propositions here put forward. Upon what principles can a statute, which enacts affirmatively that a loan shall be made on the credit and security of a particular fund, such as the tolls to be imposed on the roads, and should be payable out of the same, and negatively that such loan shall not be payable out of or chargeable against the general revenue of the province, be construed into a contract obligation, binding on the province of Canada, to repay such loans in the event of such fund proving inadequate, and creating in such case no exemption of the general revenues of the province of Canada from liability for the repayment of such loans? In other words, to give to the language of the act a meaning the exact opposite of what the language used conveys, and while the legislature says in plain unambiguous language that the loan shall be made on. the credit and security of one fund and payable thereout, and that such loan shall not be payable out of or chargeable on another fund, we are asked to say that the legislature intended thereby to say that it was to be chargeable on and payable out of both funds\u2014failing one, then out of the other.\nI am therefore of opinion that this, though a quasi public law, was not, under the ordinance, or the 16 Vic., or both, a government loan for repayment of which either the general revenues of the country or the faith or credit of the government of the country were pledged, that is, it was in the nature of a municipal loan, for repayment of which a specific fund was provided, and to which fund the debenture holder was to look for repayment; that the debenture holders advanced their money on the bargain contained in the act 16 Vic., ch. 235, incorporating the 4 Vic., ch. 17; that they must be taken to have full notice of the provisions of those acts, and of the security those acts afforded those who purchased the debentures issued by virtue of their authority and under their provisions, and have no right to look to any other security than those acts provided.\nIf, then, there was no liability fixed on the crown by the combined effect of the ordinance of 1841 and the 16 Vic., ch. 235, has there been any subsequent legislation imposing on the crown a liability to discharge an indebtedness which was not incurred on the faith or credit of the crown, and for which it was not primarily liable, whereby the debenture holders (who, when the money was loaned, advanced it on the credit of the tolls and other resources of the road) became not only creditors on such tolls and resources but creditors of the crown, entitled to judgment against the crown in a proceeding such as this? After a most careful consideration of all that has been urged, and a most critical examination of all legislative and governmental acts, in connection with these turnpikes and the debentures issued in connection therewith, I am constrained to say that I have failed to discover one legislative enactment or one act creating such a liability.\nMy brother Gwynne has kindly permitted me to see the judgment he intends delivering in this case, and he has with so much labor and with such critical skill analysed the legislative and governmental action in connection with these turnpikes, and I so fully concur in the conclusions at which he has arrived in reference to them, that it would be worse than waste of time were I to refer at length to what he will, so much better than I could, say on the subject.\nI will only very briefly notice one or two matters which have been put forward very prominently by the suppliants.\nIn section 43 they say: debentures issued for loans effected under the ordinance of 1841, amounting to \u00a325,000 and the debentures issued under 7 Vic., ch 45, to the amount of \u00a38,882, were paid at maturity by the province of Canada out of the general revenues of that province.\nAnd in section 44\u2014The province of Canada, about 1850, paid out of its general revenues large sums to pay at maturity home district turnpike trust bonds and debentures, issued under acts of the province of Upper Canada, which bonds were not payable by or chargeable against the general revenues of Upper Canada, but out of the tolls levied on the same.\nSection 57 of the 3 and 4 Vic., ch. 35, provides that, subject to the charges on the consolidated revenue fund mentioned in the act, the said fund shall be appropriated by the legislature of the province of Canada for the public service in such manner as they shall think proper. Provided that all bills appropriating any part of the surplus of the said consolidated revenue fund, or for imposing any new tax or impost shall originate in the legislative assembly, and also that it shall not be lawful for the legislative assembly to originate or pass any vote, resolution or bill for the appropriation of any part of the surplus, or of any other tax or impost, to any purpose which shall not have been first recommended by a message of the governor to the assembly during the session in which such vote, resolution or bill shall be passed. From these enactments they claim to fix on the crown a liability to pay these debentures under the 16 Vic., ch 235, and so it has been strongly urged that because the government paid the first loan under the 4 Vic., and the home district bonds, ergo, they became liable to pay this loan, under the 16 Vic This, to my mind, is a pure fallacy. The legislature in its wisdom or or its liberality continually grants money in aid of institutions and undertakings, public, local, or individual, but I know of no principle by which a simple grant of money to one object can be construed into a binding contract to pay other monies, because the parties seeking to set up such a contract are in a position similar to that of those who, by the grants made, benefited by the bounty of the legislature. But it has been much urged that the special fund provided for payment of these debentures having proved insufficient, the government was bound to increase the revenues of the special fund, or to have created another fund. It appears to me this is very easily answered: In the first place, where is any such obligation to be found? I can discover none, statutory or otherwise, and statutory to be obligatory, I think it must be; and in the second place, it was the legislature, not the crown or the government, that created the fund, a fund as I have observed, no doubt in estimation of the then legislature, adequate to the repayment of the loans authorized, and it is very clear the lenders must have thought it so or it cannot be supposed they would have invested their means on its security. If it has unfortunately proved insufficient, what power has the crown or the government to increase the revenues of the special fund beyond what the legislature has authorized, or what power has the crown or government to create another fund? This is all for legislative action.\nIt is also suggested that the legislature, in this act, having stated that the general revenues should not be charged with this debt, virtually declared that the legislature would provide other means to pay with than the general revenue, which is exempted. If this is so, it seems to me most effectually to put the suppliants out of this court, and requires them to resort for redress to the legislature, which alone can give it in such a case. It might be very just and right the legislature should consider the matter and should come to the aid of the debenture holders, but surely if they do not do so there is no legal liability cast on the crown or government, enforceable by petition of right, to provide, unsanctioned by the legislature, for the deficiency of this special fund. There can be no doubt that the investment, depending on repayment from tolls, was, to a certain extent, precarious; but the investor, on lending his money on such a security, assumed the risk, and, as stated in Chatham Local Board v. Rochester Commissioners[17], in England the character of such investments had then greatly changed owing to railways, by reason whereof, it is there said, turnpike tolls do not afford the security they did; but, as I have before stated, in England, when the tolls proved insufficient to pay either the interest or principal loaned on the security and to keep the roads in repair, the remedy was not by suing the Queen, but by seeking from the legislature further powers of increasing the tolls, or by calling on the parish or district to contribute. See 4 Vic., ch. 85, 4 and 5 Vic., ch. 59. So here, if the suppliants are to have any relief, the action of the legislature appears to me indispensable, and as was said in Gibson v. East India Co.[18], relief should be sought for by petition, memorial or remonstrance; not by action in a court of law. In that case it was held that the retiring pension of a military officer of the East India Company, granted by the company, but not by deed, did not, upon his bankruptcy, pass to his assignee, as it could not have been enforced by the officer against the company. Tyndall, C. J., says of the claim put forward:\nAlthough it may differ in some particulars from a grant of half-pay by the crown to the officers of the army or navy upon their retirement from actual service; yet it bears a much stronger analogy to it in the mode of its being granted and in the consequences attending it than to any contract. Now it is clear that no action could be supported against any one to recover the arrears of half-pay granted by the crown, unless the money has been specifically appropriated by the government and placed in the hands of the paymaster or agent to the account of the particular officer, and there is no ground on general principle to hold that an action could be maintained against any one unless under the same circumstances as the present case. He goes on to say:\nThe grant in question, therefore, appears to us to range itself under that class of obligations which is described by jurists as imperfect obligations, obligations which want the vinculum juris, although binding in moral equity and conscience, to be a grant which the East India Company, as governors, are bound in foro conscienti\u0153 to make good, but of which the performance is to be sought for by petition memorial or remonstrance, not by action in a court of law.\nI am therefore of opinion that the relief sought cannot be granted, and that the appeal should be allowed and petition dismissed.\nFOURNIER, J. adhered to the judgment delivered by him in the Court below.\nHENRY, J.:\nI have not thought it necessary in view of the very exhaustive and elaborate judgment of my brother Fournier and that of my brother Taschereau, which I have had the advantage of seeing, to write out a judgment in this case, and thereby add uselessly to the volume of our reports. I entirely concur in the judgment to be delivered by my brother Taschereau on this appeal, except as to interest, for the provision in the 16 Vic., ch. 235, has certainly exempted the province from any liability as to interest, but as to principal I entertain the same views as my brothers Fournier and Taschereau. It is said the roads were under municipal control and that the act created a quasi-municipal corporation, but by the Act 4 Vic., ch. 17, I find that the policy of the government as to these roads was entirely changed. The municipal control which previously existed is taken away and the legislature declares that the government shall take entire control of the roads, and the property, toll houses, the stock and implements, &c., &c., are all vested in the Crown. Here the officers are appointed by the government and no municipal officer or bondholder had any control over them. This is certainly very different from the turnpike roads in England, where although, as said by the Chief Justice, the roads are declared to be public highways, if the officers appointed did not fulfil their duties, the bondholders had some remedy. I have also ascertained that the loan in question has been acknowledged by the legislature as a public debt, as they had power to do.\nMoreover, I find that the government have actually paid previous loans made under the same authority, and having paid them authorized its officers to effect the present loan. If we were to hold now that this is not a public debt, it would be declaring that the government had been guilty of a moral fraud. Then also we are told that the loan is secured by tolls, &c., but it has been decided that a bondholder cannot levy against Her Majesty's property, and surely if a party gives a mortgage, he is nevertheless answerable for the principal. True, the legislature has said that payment of this loan would not come out of the general revenue, but if the liability exists, it still throws upon the government the obligation of providing other means for the payment thereof.\nUnder all these circumstances I think the suppliants are entitled to the judgment of this court for the principal of the overdue debentures, with interest from the date of the fyling of their petition of right.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nBy their petition of right before the Exchequer Court, the respondents alleged:\u2014\nThat the province of Canada had raised, by way of loan, a sum of \u00a330,000 for the improvement of provincial highways, situate on the north shore of the river St. Lawrence, in the neighborhood of the city of Quebec\u2014and a further sum of \u00a340,000 for the improvement of like highways on the south shore of the river St Lawrence \u2013 that there were issued debentures for both of the said loans, signed by the Quebec turnpike road trustees, under the authority of an act of the parliament of the province of Canada, passed in the sixteenth year of Her Majesty's reign, intituled: \"An act to authorize the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads to issue debentures to a certain amount, and to place certain roads under their control\"\u2014that the moneys so borrowed came into the hands of Her Majesty, and were expended in the improvement of the highways in the said act mentioned\u2014that no tolls or rates were ever imposed or levied on persons passing over the roads improved by means of said loan of \u00a330,000\u2014that the tolls imposed and collected on the highways improved by means of the said loan of \u00a340,000 were never applied to the payment of the debentures issued for the said last mentioned loan in interest or principal\u2014that the trustees accounted to Her Majesty, as well for the said loans as for the tolls collected by them\u2014that at no time had there been a fund in the hands of the said trustees adequate to the payment, in interest and principal, of the debentures issued for said loans \u2013 that the respondents are holders of debentures for both of the said loans to an amount of $70,072, upon which interest is due from the 1st day of July, 1872\u2014that the debentures so held by them fell due after the union, and that Her Majesty is liable for the same under 111 sec. of British North America Act, 1867, as debts of the late province of Canada existing at the union.\nWherefore they demanded the payment of the said sum of $70,072 with interest from the 1st day of July, 1872.\nThe attorney general, for Her Majesty, by his plea to the said petition of right, denied that the act of the said trustees, when issuing the debentures sought to be recovered from Her Majesty by the respondents, was the act of the late province of Canada, or that the monies obtained from the respondents had been so obtained for and in the name of the said province, and that there never was any undertaking from the said late province of Canada to pay the whole or any part of the debentures sought to be now recovered by the respondents.\nIt is admitted that under the one hundred and eleventh section of the B. N. A. Act, the Dominion of Canada is liable for the payment of these debentures, if the late province of Canada was responsible for them, and the case is to be considered as being against the said province as constituted before confederation. The question to be determined is, in what capacity did the said trustees act when they issued the said debentures. Were they acting for the province or for a private corporation, and was. there any undertaking on the part of the said province to pay the said debentures? At the hearing it struck me that there was a misjoinder of the suppliants in this case, and that they could not, as they have done, being each of them, without any relation whatsoever to the others, holder, individually and for his sole benefit, of debentures, join in one action for the recovery thereof; not more than four different persons holding promissory notes against a fifth, could join in one action for the recovery of these notes. However, no objection on this ground seems to have been taken on the part of the defense. On the contrary, we were told at the hearing by both parties, that any irregularity of this kind in the record was to be considered as waived so as to have a decision on the merits of the contestation between the parties.\nIt has been contended on the part of the respondents that the trustees under 4 Vic, ch. 17, do not constitute a body in the nature of a corporation. This contention has not been sustained by the Exchequer Court, and rightly so, in my opinion.\nThe words \"corporation\" or \"incorporated,\" it is true, are not used in the statute, but no precise form of words is necessary for the creation of a corporation, and the assent of the legislative power to grant an incorporation may be given constructively or presumptively.\nAldridge vs. Cats[19]; Conservators of River Tone vs. Ash[20]; Dean vs. Davis[21]; Angell & Ames on Corporations[22]. In Standley vs. Perry[23], the commissioners of the Cobourg town trust were held by this court to have been duly incorporated by the Act 22 Vic., ch. 72, though this statute did not, in express words, enact it.\nHere it is still clearer that the intention of the Act, 4 Vic, ch. 17, was to incorporate the said Quebec Turnpike Road Trustees. But are they a private corporation? Undoubtedly no. This has been so conclusively demonstrated by Mr. Justice Fournier in the Exchequer Court, that I deem it unnecessary to dwell on this point at any length. The Quebec Turnpike Roads Trustees are a quasi corporation only, what I might call a state corporation. They have no interest whatsoever in the undertaking authorized and ordered by the act. They are not only officers of the body created, but they are the only members of this body. They and they alone constitute it in its entirety. They cannot own any property, real or personal; everything they acquire belongs to the crown. It is crown property that they have to administer and crown property alone that they control. This 4 Vic., ch. 17 which creates them is clear on this. A reference to two statutes of the very same year, 1841 (4 Vic., chs. 11 and 22), shows the difference between a private turnpike road corporation and the quasi corporation of the Quebec turnpike roads created by the 4 Vic., ch 17. By these two first statutes (4 Vic., chs. 11 and 22) companies are incorporated for the construction of turnpike roads, from the river Richelieu to Granby, and from Montreal to a neighboring parish. And it is precisely because no such company was forthcoming to macadamize the Quebec roads, that the legislative authority had to intervene and take upon itself, for the common weal, to order, as a part of the public works of the country, the construction of those roads. The very preamble of the ordinances establishes this proposition. It cannot be taken as having been enacted in the interest of the landholders of the vicinity for they pay the tolls as the rest of the public when they use these roads, and those bound before this act to perform any labor on any of these roads, have (sec. 19) to pay an annual sum in commutation of such obligation. In their report, filed in this case, the commissioners appointed in 1876 to inquire into the affairs of this trust, state that it does not appear that these commutation moneys were ever levied. This is an error. In statements Nos. 3 and 7, appendix AA, for 1850, and in appendix G for 1852-53, and appendix I for 1854-55, the trustees, in their accounts to the government, acknowledge having received such commutation from a number of persons. However, this is immaterial, the law ordered this commutation, and if the trustees did not do their duty in the matter the crown would be estopped from invoking its own officers' dereliction of duty. But, moreover, this is not put in issue by the crown on this record. There is no plea that the suppliants would have been paid if the trustees had strictly obeyed the law. It is the state then which assumed the burthen of making these roads and of creating a fund for that purpose. When in 8 Vic., ch. 55, sec. 4, for instance, the purchase of the Dorchester bridge, by these trustees, is mentioned, it is called a purchase by the provincial government. It is the state which, through the instrumentality of the body created by the act and by and through its administrators, issued the debentures authorized by the act. The very form of these debentures shows this. Debentures issued by incorporated companies in their name are and have always been in an entirely different form. It is the state which borrowed, from the purchasers of these debentures, the moneys necessary to form the fund required for the purposes of the act, a special fund certainly, but a fund belonging to the state; a fund to be employed as directed by the act certainly, but always in the name of and for the state, acting through its own officers, through its own agent, this quasi corporation, through its own trustees. It is upon the state's property that the \u00a325,000 borrowed from the debenture holders were expended, and it is the state which benefited from this expenditure. A contrary interpretation has been suggested on the part of Her Majesty, but the act itself says so in clear terms. It enacts in so many words that all property whatsoever, moveable or immoveable, in the hands of the said trustees, shall be vested in Her Majesty for the public uses of the province. That the tolls to be levied are included in this enactment admits of no doubt, and is made still clearer by the preamble of 12 Vic., ch. 115. The ordinance adds, it is true, that such property \"shall be subject to the management of the said trustees for the purposes of this ordinance;\" but may I ask if, after paying these debentures and making all. the works ordered by the act, a surplus had remained in the trustees' hands, would not this surplus, would not the surplus of the tolls every year, have belonged to the crown and formed part of the public revenue of the country? May I ask also, could this corporation make an assignment under the bankruptcy laws, or could it be forced into bankruptcy? I find two state corporations of the same kind created by our statutes.\nBy the 7 Vic. ch. 11, \"the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordinance\" are incorporated, authorized to sue and to be sued, and to hold in trust for Her Majesty all Her Majesty's property connected with the defence of the country.\nBy the 14 and 15 Vic. ch. 67, the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland are in the same manner created a quasi corporation, empowered to sue and be sued, and authorized to hold in trust for Her Majesty the property therein described.\nUnder these statutes which are in fact mere re-enactments, for this country, of Imperial statutes to the same effect, the bodies thereby created, can, as the Quebec Turnpike Road Trustees, sue and be sued, but everything in their possession, as also in the trustees' possession, is vested in Her Majesty. A judgment can be obtained, but it cannot be executed against the board of ordinance or against the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral. So it was held by the Superior Court of Quebec for the Turnpike Road Trustees in Anderson v. The Quebec North Shore Turnpike Roads[24]. The plaintiff, in that case, having obtained judgment against the trustees, seized in the hands of the Quebec Bank a sum of $5,386.74 which stood there deposited in their name. The trustees contested the validity of this seizure, on the ground that this sum of money, though deposited by them, belonged to Her Majesty, under the 4 Vic. The plaintiff demurred to this contestation, but the court held that this seizure was null, as these moneys and all property whatsoever in the hands of these trustees belong to Her Majesty. So was in England, the property vested in the board of ordinance by the statute incorporating it, of which I have spoken, declared to continue to be the crown's property, Doe, Leigh v. Roe[25]. In its various clauses and enactments, this ordinance of 1841 demonstrates conclusively that such is the case, for the property under the control of the trustees.\nA reference to the preamble of the 16 Vic. ch. 235 itself, under which the debentures here claimed were issued, demonstrates that the legislature considered these roads as public works and the trustees as government officers. It reads thus: \"Whereas it is expedient * * * to make further improvements in the vicinity of Quebec through the trustees of the turnpike roads established under the said ordinance 4 Vic.\" Is this language used in the statute book, when the legislature gives additional powers to a private company? Certainly not. These improvements that the legislature desires and declares to be expedient, are to be made through the trustees; but by whom and for whom? This preamble does not say in express terms, but I read it as meaning by and for the government, by and for the province through its officers, the said trustees to whom has been given the form of a corporation that they might the more effectually discharge their appointed duties, but, in the performance of these duties, always acting in the name of and for the province.\nNow, if it is the province which borrowed these moneys, it follows, as a matter of course, that the province is obliged to re-imburse them. By the very fact of borrowing, the borrower obliges himself to refund. No express undertaking is required, there is an implied promise to pay. These debenture holders lent money to the province. To the province they look for payment. They had a right to expect an immediate reimbursement. But such is not the case. Since 1872 they have not received a single cent of interest on these loans, and now that the capital is due and overdue, they are refused both. But how are they met? Upon what grounds is it contended that he who borrows has not to re-imburse? Upon a plea of payment? No ! Of prescription? No! Of set off? No ! But upon the most extraordinary contention that the state did not guarantee the repayment of this loan! That the borrower did not guarantee the repayment of this loan ! That the borrower did not guarantee the payment of the money lent to him !\nBut since when is it necessary for the borrower to guarantee the re-imbursement of the loan made to him? Is it not the very essence of this contract that the borrower must re-imburse the lender? Certainly, a stipulation in a private contract that the borrower would not be in any way personally liable for the moneys lent, and that the only recourse of the lender would be against a certain security given, would be lawful; as also, in the case submitted, it would have been in the power of the legislative authority to enact that the province would never be liable for the payment of these debentures, or that they were to be issued without any guarantee whatsoever on the part of the province. But a stipulation, in a private contract, of such a novel, unusual, and I might say startling character, would require to be couched in very clear terms to be sanctioned by a court of justice. And on the same principle, if in this statute the state wants the court to find that it was empowered to borrow upon the condition that it should never repay, I take it that it is incumbent upon its representatives to show a very clear and unambiguous text to that effect, and that the court will not by interpretation or implication find such an enactment if it does not appear upon the face of the statute itself, in so many words. Now, no such enactment can be found in the 4 Vic ch. 17, or the 16 Vic. ch 235. And it is no doubt by inadvertence that in the third paragraph of the plea filed in this case on the part of Her Majesty, it is alleged that the Act 16 Vic. ch. 235 contains such an enactment as to the principal of these debentures.\nThere is not a word in this statute. The only words therein having reference to the nature of the debentures are as follows:\nSection 7: And this loan and the debentures which shall be issued to effect the same, and all other matters having reference to the said loan, shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance above cited with respect to the loan authorized under it.\nNow the ordinance here referred to is the 4 Vic. ch. 17, and the only words therein upon which the state could perhaps contend that it was authorized to borrow and relieved at the same time of the obligation of refunding, are in the 21st section, to the effect that the trustees are authorized \"to raise by way of loan, on the credit and security of the tolls hereby authorized to be imposed, and of other moneys which may come into the possession and be at the disposal of the said trustees, under and by virtue of this ordinance, and not to be paid out of or chargeable against the general revenue of this province, any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole twenty-five thousand pounds currency.\"\nOn the part of Her Majesty it was alleged in the plea on the record and argued before us that the words \"on the credit and security of the tolls\" means on the sole credit and security of the tolls. I do not see how this contention can be sustained, for the simple reason that the word \"sole\" is not in the statute. Upon what principle could we so make an Act of Parliament say what it does not say? If a private individual is said to borrow money on the credit and security of the indorser, for instance, is it meant by this that the lender renounces to his recourse against the borrower personally? Surely not! Can such a renunciation be ever presumed? Is it not the obligation on the borrower to refund that is on the contrary to be presumed. As I have remarked before, a special promise to refund is unnecessary in this contract. By the acknowledgment of a loan, there is an implied promise by the borrower to refund\nAs to the enactment that this loan was not to be paid out or chargeable against the general revenue of the province, I have very little to add to what Mr. Justice Fournier, in the Exchequer Court, has said on this part of the case. The province, by the very preamble of the act, assumes the obligation to make these roads and to create a fund for that purpose. It borrows money so to create this special fund, and says to the lenders \"you shall be paid out of this special fund and not out of the general revenue of the Province.\" But they are not and cannot be paid out of this special fund; does it follow that they will not be paid at all? Does it follow that because a pledge or security given for the payment of a debt proves to be worthless or insufficient to pay the debt the debtor is relieved from all personal liability? I take it that the fair and reasonable construction to be put on these words is:\u20141st, that as the debentures to be issued were to be redeemable only at a remote period, the contingent liability of the province was not to appear, and the amount of these debentures was not to be considered before they matured, as a debt of the province, and 2nd, that it was enacted they were not to be paid out of the general revenue of the province, because it was taken for granted that they would be paid out of the special fund. The contingency of the special fund proving worthless was not provided for. It may be that a finance minister, with these words on the statute book, could not pay the amount of these debentures without a special authorization of parliament, and that he could not, without such authorization, fill up a deficiency in a special fund from the proceeds of the general fund. But this is a matter of administration with which the suppliants have nothing to do. The fact that by the statute which authorizes the loan, parliament did not then provide for the repayment of this loan, in case the special fund created thereby should turn out to be inadequate for that purpose, may so put the executive under the necessity to get an appropriation from the parliament to make this payment, but surely does and cannot relieve the state from the obligation of repaying that loan.\nIf there was any doubt on the construction of these words of this said 21st clause of the ordinance, it seems to me that the lender, not the borrower, should have the benefit of it, and that the presumption in such a case is altogether against the borrower. But whatever doubts there might arise in this case at the reading of this clause by itself, are entirely removed by the interpretation of it given later, by the legislative and administrative authorities of the province itself.\nBy the Act 12 Vic., ch. 5, intituled: \"An act for the better management of the public debt, accounts, revenue and property,\" it is ordered, \"that whereas it is expedient to make better provision for the management of the public debt of this province, it shall be lawful for the Governor in Council to redeem or purchase on account of the province all or any of the outstanding debentures constituting the public debt of the Province of Canada, or all or any of the debentures issued by Commissioners or other public officers, under the authority of the Legislature of Canada or of the late Province of Canada, the interest or principal of which debentures is made a charge on the consolidated revenue fund of the province.\"\nNow, under this act the government has paid (see public accounts for 1853, No. 41, under heading \"statement of debentures, redeemed under authority of 12 Vic., ch. 5 \") \u00a333,882 for the redemption of the debentures issued under this 4 Vic., ch. 17 and the 8 Vic, ch. 55. And though (document No. 47 of 1852 and No. 43 of 1853 public accounts) special statements are given of the debentures for which the government is only partially liable, or is liable for the interest thereof only, the Quebec Turnpike debentures are not included in these statements. Now, if it had been considered that the government was liable for the interest only on those debentures, they would certainly have been so therein included. On the contrary, in document 44 (public accounts) for 1852, all the payments made according to No. 45 thereof, including \u00a311,790 then paid for the Quebec Turnpike Trust debentures are given as made under the 12 Vic., ch. 5, which relates to the public debt of the province and as effected for the construction of public works Is not that acknowledging that these roads are public works? Is not that acknowledging as expressly as possible that these debentures formed part of the public debt?\nNow, in the public accounts for 1854 and those for 1855 there is something showing yet more clearly that the government always considered these roads as public works and these debentures as a provincial debt.\nI have just said that by the public accounts of 1853 the sum of \u00a333,882 was charged as paid by the province for redeeming the debentures in question. Now, if we refer to the public accounts for the year 1854, page 6, (and the debentures held by the suppliants were to a large amount thereof issued subsequently to this), and to the public accounts for the year 1855, statement No. 2, page 6, it will be seen first that nowhere is the province credited (or ever was at any time subsequently credited) for that sum as a creditor of the turnpike trust: and this shows that the payment of these debentures was not made as a loan to the trustees, but entirely as a payment by the province of one of its own debts. Statements are to be found in the documents referred to, headed \"Loans to incorporated companies.\" If the contention on the part of Her Majesty was correct, surely this sum of \u00a333,882 which had then been paid by the government for these debentures, would be found in these statements But not a word of it is to be found therein. Was it an omission? Clearly not, for in the very same statement we find this very same sum accounted for, or charged, and under what heading? Under the heading \"Provincial Works, Quebec Turnpike Trust \u00a333,882,\" in the same list and category as the St. Lawrence Canals, the Welland Canal, the Provincial Penitentiary and such other works and institutions, the character of which cannot be questioned. And in document 40 (public accounts for 1853), headed \"A statement showing the amount of legislative grants towards the construction of public works, and of the outstanding debentures issued under the several acts of appropriation on account thereof,\" (viz., on account of the legislative grants towards the construction of public works), Quebec road trust debentures to the amount of \u00a322,092, paid in 1853, as per statement No. 41 of the said public accounts, are included\nIt has been contended on the part of Her Majesty that those debentures were so paid by the province under the 12 Vic., ch. 5, simply because the interest, and the interest only, thereof was, under the clause of the ordinance which authorized the government to advance it to the trustees, a charge on the consolidated revenue fund of the province.\nBut 1st, this interest was not a charge on the consolidated revenue of the country by this clause of the 4 Vic., which simply authorized a loan for the payment thereof by the government and at its discretion, to the trustees, a loan from the unappropriated funds of the country to a special fund, a loan which undoubtedly the government would have ceased to make, if these debentures had not been its own debt, when those trustees found themselves in the impossibility to refund the advances previously made.\n2nd. If the government had been liable for the interest only of these debentures, they would have been included in the statements, Nos. 47 of 1852 and 43 of 1853, of the public accounts for those years, headed \"A statement of debentures for which the government are partially liable,\" and under which are included debentures for the interest of which only the government is liable; and they are not so included.\n3rd, If the government had not been liable for the principal of these debentures, when it paid it in 1854 it would have included it in the statements of 1854 and 1855, headed \"Loans to incorporated companies;\" and it is not so included.\n4th. The government, if the contention on this point on the part of Her Majesty was correct, would not have included the capital of these debentures in their statements of the public accounts of 1854 and 1855 as paid for one of the public works of the country, crediting the country for the amount thereof as an asset, because these roads, the property of the country, on which this amount had been expended, were to that amount increased in value.\nIt has been said that those Quebec roads were local works, and that we cannot presume that the province intended so to benefit a particular locality at the expense of the public chest. But a reference to the statute book and the public accounts of that period will show that, at that time, the construction of local works of that nature by the province was not an unusual thing. In 1841, for instance, I find that the legislature voted fifteen thousand pounds to macadamize the road between the Cascades and the province line, forty-five thousand pounds to macadamize the roads in the district of Brantford, and thirty thousand pounds for a road from Hamilton to Port Dover.\nIn the public accounts of 1853, for another instance, I find the home district roads, the Chambly roads, the Montreal roads, the Hamilton and Brantford roads, the Queenston and Grimsby road, the Kingston and Napanee road, the York roads, the Yonge street roads, paid for in whole or in part by the provincial government; yet all of them were clearly local works.\nBut I find in the statute book additional evidence that the legislature did not enact, and cannot be interpreted to have enacted, that the province would never be liable for the amount of these debentures.\nBy the 14 and 15 Vic., ch 133 (1851), these trustees are authorized to purchase the Montmorency bridge, and for the payment thereof to issue debentures, but for these debentures the legislature did not want the province to be responsible. Undoubtedly because this bridge was of such a well established value that it was taken as a certainty that the said debentures would be easily negociated without such guarantee. How for that purpose was this statute framed? Does it say that these debentures and the loan made thereby will be subject to the provisions of the ordinance, 4 Vic.? No such words as these are to be found here, and undoubtedly because they would, in the mind of the law giver, have rendered the province liable. Bret it enacts in express terms that \"neither the principal or interest of the debentures to be issued under this act, shall be guaranteed by the province or payable out of any provincial funds.\" Now, when we see this proviso struck out in the very next statute, passed by the same legislature in relation to these turnpike roads, and this only two years later. (the 16 Vic., ch. 235, under which the suppliants hold the debentures in question here) and replaced by one, saying that the loan will be ruled by the provisions of the 4 Vic., have we not clear and unmistakable evidence that the legislature did not intend that these last debentures should not be guaranteed or paid by the province? If this had been intended, would they not have said so in the same clear and express terms of the preceding statute?\nHere is a statute saying in so many words that the province will not be liable, and another and the very next one, on the same subject, in which these words are struck out. Surely the fair and reasonable construction is that these words were left out, because under this one the province was to be liable, if the special fund turned out to be unable to pay these debentures. In 1851 the legislature says debentures shall be issued, but neither capital or interest shall be guaranteed by the province; in 1853 it says: \"debentures shall be issued, but these debentures will be ruled by the provisions of 4 Vic\" It seems to me that the legislature here purposely made a distinction, so as not to exempt the province, the special fund being insufficient from paying the debentures of 1853, as it had done for the debentures of 1851. Otherwise it would have said so in the same terms, and this, I apprehend, the legislature did for the best possible reason. It is evident that the sale of a single one of these new debentures of 1853 would have been utterly impossible if the legislature had enacted that the province would not at all be liable for them. If we consider the circumstances under which the debentures previously issued through these trustees were paid at their maturity by the province, and if we compare the date of this statute 16 Vic., ch. 235, under which the suppliants base their claims against the crown, with this payment, we find why the legislature did not enact that the new debentures of 1853 would not be guaranteed by the province, and why the province did pay the old debentures. In 1853 (public accounts of 1853, statement No. 41) a sum of \u00a322,092 was due to the holders of matured debentures issued under the ordinance and the 8th Vic., ch. 55. In the same year the legislature, by this 16 Vic., ch. 235, authorizes the issue of \u00a370, 000 more of debentures through the said trust. Now how would these \u00a370,000 of debentures have been received on the money market, if the government had repudiated the payment of the \u00a322,092 then overdue by this trust? How could it have been expected that this trust could, on its own credit, obtain a loan of \u00a370,000, when it had at this very time \u00a322,092 of debentures overdue and unpaid, when, in fact, as a special fund, it was and had always been, utterly insolvent? For, though a priority over the claims of the province is given by the act to the new debentures, this priority, in the very words of sec. 7 is only for the interest payable on the said debentures and not for the capital thereof, and there were then on the market, besides the amounts issued under the ordinance and the 8 Vic., \u00a345,000 of debentures not yet matured issued by the trust under the 12 Vic., ch. 115, and the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 182 and 133. Can we not presume\u2014nay, even take as a certainty\u2014that, if the government had not, before these new debentures were put on the market, paid the old debentures then matured, the sale of a single one of these new debentures would have been absolutely impossible. Who would have lent money to an insolvent special fund on the guarantee of that fund alone? To obviate this and to secure the new loan, the legislature strikes out from this statute the enactment that the province would not be liable for the new debentures, which was inserted in the very next preceding statute on the same subject, and the government pay in the very same year the old debentures: they pay these \u00a322,092 overdue, making, with what they had paid previously, \u00a333,882 paid for the redemption of the debentures of this trust. They thus admit the state's responsibility for the debts of this trust, and by so doing secure the new loan and the sale of the new debentures. And they make this payment, not as a loan to this trust, not as if this trust was anything but itself a department of state, but as the province's own debt, as a payment done in the ordinary course of the government business, for provincial public works; as appears by statement No. 2 of the public accounts of 1855, to which I have already referred, headed \"A statement of the affairs of the province of Canada.\" They could not have made a loan or a payment, still less a gratuity, to a private corporation without the authority of the legislature, but for this authority they did not ask a special act, they found it in the 4 Vic. itself. They come before the legislature, they lay before them a statement of this transaction, and of these payments made in this manner. The Legislature ratifies and sanctions them, not only tacitly, but also as expressly as possible, by voting the supplies and the moneys required for the service of the country, according to this statement of its executive department. Were not the suppliants induced, under these circumstances, to lend their monies by the fact that the province having been responsible for the anterior loans would be so for the new loans, declared in express terms by the 16 Vic., authorizing the new loan, to be ruled by the provisions of the ordinance authorizing the old loan. It is a well settled rule of law, that he who holds himself responsible towards the world for the debts of another person cannot later repudiate the debts of this other person, without some notification of his intention not to be any longer so responsible. This principle must rule the governments in their dealing with the individuals, as well as the individuals themselves. Here the case is stronger against the Government, as they paid these old debentures, not as the debt of another, but as their own debt and debentures. In fact it appears to me that, under these circumstances, not only was not this new loan obtained on the sole credit of this trust, but that it was, on the contrary, obtained on the sole credit of the province.\nI find further that in the estimates for 1852 (last document in the public accounts for 1851) it is provided for the interest on these debentures as a permanent charge under the 4 Vic., chap. 17, and 8 Vic, chap. 55, on the public revenue, and that in document No. 16 of the public accounts for the same year, 1851, the interest is charged as paid by the government, not as a loan or advance to the trustees, but as a debt of the province. Now sec. 27 of the 4 Vic., ch. 17 merely authorized the government, at their discretion, to advance as a loan, such sums as would be necessary to enable the trustees to pay the arrears of interest on these debentures. And sec. 23 of this ordinance enacted in express terms that the interest on these debentures was to be paid out of the tolls or out of any other moneys at the disposal of the trustees for the purposes of the ordinance, whilst sec. 21, already referred to, expressly enacted that the loan to be raised by the trustees was not to be paid out of the general revenues of the country, yet in the public accounts and in the estimates for the public service laid before the legislature of the country, the government treats the interest they have already paid and those that they intend to pay thereafter on, these debentures as a debt of the country, as a permanent charge on the revenue, and not due, for which a vote is required; for supplies are not voted for them (16 Vic., chaps. 255 and 156), but one already provided for by law, that is to say, by the 4 Vic., chap. 17, and 8 Vic., ch. 55. Now, here again is a clear and unambiguous admission that these debentures were a debt of the province by the government, which submitted these accounts and estimates to the legislature, and by this legislature which accepted them, and this not only for the interest but for the capital, as it is evident that the province in admitting the payment of the interest under the provisions of the ordinance, not as a loan or advance, but as a permanent charge on the public revenue and as one of the public debts of the country, impliedly admitted its liability to the same extent for the capital of those debentures, authorized by the said ordinance. That the province thus paid this interest because it was its own debt and not as a loan under section 17 of the ordinance, cannot be denied when the public accounts give this payment as a permanent charge on the revenue of the country. And then if it had paid it as a loan, the payment would be inserted under the heading \"Loans to incorporated companies;\" and it is not thus inserted. Moreover, the government had already in 1850 advanced a sum of over \u00a316,000 for the payment of these interests: (Journals of 1851, page 213). Now clearly they would not, in 1851 and 1852, have paid another large sum for these interests as a loan to this trust when this trust was already so largely indebted for amounts previously advanced and Was moreover actually insolvent; but they paid it, not under sec. 17 of the ordinance, as a loan, but as one of the liabilities of the province and as interest on sums borrowed for public works by the country itself. Now, I repeat it, by paying the interest of these debentures, as a permanent charge on its revenue, when the special fund provided is insufficient for that purpose, the province admitted that the capital also of the said debentures was its debt and would have to be paid out of the public funds, at their maturity, if the special fund should then also prove insufficient to pay the said capital.\nI find further that, at the very outset, the legislature itself and the executive of the late province of Canada, considered the statute 16 Vic. ch. 235, and the loan authorized thereby for these roads, as containing an appropriation of public monies.\nBy the 9 Vic., ch. 114, sec 8, of the said province, combined with the 10 and 11 Vic. ch. 71, of the imperial parliament, it was enacted as follows: \"The legislative assembly shall not originate or pass any vote, resolution or bill for the appropriation of any part of the consolidated revenue fund, or of any other tax or impost to any purpose which has not been first recommended by a message of the governor to the said legislative assembly during the session in which such vote, resolution or bill is passed.\"\nIn conformity to this enactment in the journals of 1853, p. 894, after the entry, that the house do resolve itself into committee on the bill relating to these turnpike roads, now the said statute 16 Vic., ch. 235, under which the suppliants hold their debentures, we find the following words; \"The honorable Mr. Hincks, a member of the executive council, by command of His Excellency the Governor General, then acquainted the the house that His Excellency, having been informed of the subject-matter of this motion, recommends it to the consideration of the house.\"\nIn the like manner, when the resolutions introducing the bill, which is now the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132, entitled, \"An act to authorize the Quebec turnpike road trustees to effect a new loan\" were first moved before the house, \"the honorable attorney-general Baldwin, by command of His Excellency the Governor General, acquainted the house that His Excellency, having been informed of the subject of this motion, recommended it to the consideration of the house (Journals of 1851, p. 106).\" Why was His Excellency's recommendation deemed necessary and actually given for the introduction of this bill, now on the statute book, as the 16 Vic., ch. 235, as well as for the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132? Unquestionably, because this loan, and the appropriation of it to these roads, authorized by these acts, were an appropriation of the public moneys of the country. Yet, in these two statutes is to be found the proviso that the interest on the debentures to be issued in accordance thereof, was not to be advanced out of the provincial funds. As to the capital, both of them enact that the debentures to be issued and the loan to be effected thereby shall be ruled by the provisions of the 4th Vic. Now, between these two statutes, another one was passed in relation to this turnpike trust, the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 133, entitled: \"An act to authorize the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads to issue debentures to a limited amount,\" and if we refer to page 186 of the journals of 1851, we find that, for this last statute, His Excellency's recommendation was not obtained and communicated to the house. Why this difference between the two first named statutes and this last one? Why for the two first, have His Excellency's recommendation, and not for the last? Here are three consecutive statutes in relation to the same matter. For the first and third the royal authorization is obtained, but not for the second. Evidently the house and the executive saw a distinction between the last one and the two others. But where is the difference between them? It appears plainly, it seems to me, on the face of them. For this last one, the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 133, the royal authorization was not deemed necessary, because it contains a special proviso that neither the principal or interest of the debentures to be issued under it shall be guaranteed by the province or payable out of any provincial funds, whilst in the two others, 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132 and 16 Vic., ch. 235, this proviso does not appear, and the only words to be found therein concerning the capital of the debentures they authorized, is to the effect that they are to be ruled by the provisions of the 4th Vic. It has been suggested that for these two the royal permission was thought necessary, because they contain enactments relating to tolls and taxes. But this cannot have been the reason for it, because first, bills imposing local tolls and taxes though they are generally introduced in committees of the whole house, never require to be accompanied by the royal recommendation, and then that reason would apply entirely to the other one, which is as much as the other two in relation to tolls and taxes; the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132 more especially authorizing no new tolls on toll-gates\u2014neither can it have been because these two statutes give a priority for the interest of the debentures they authorize over the claims of the province, for the other one contains a clause to the same effect. Nor, because by the 4th Vic., whose provisions were extended to these two statutes, the interest of these debentures was considered to be guaranteed by the province, but not the principal, for as to the interest it is expressly enacted in both of them that the section of the ordinance relating to interest shall not apply to the new debentures. It must have been then, because under the 4th Vic. the capital was considered to be guaranteed by the province in the event of the special fund proving insufficient and because the enactment that the provisions of the said 4th Vic. would rule the new debentures was equivalent to an enactment that the capital of these new debentures would likewise be guaranteed by the government; whilst in the other one the 14 and 15 Vic., ch 133, the debentures to be issued were not so enacted to be ruled by the provisions of the 4th Vic., but on the contrary were especially said to be, either for capital or interest, not payable by the province; this last one not containing an appropriation of public moneys, whilst the other two did so\u2014I fail to see any other reason for the distinction thus made between these statutes.\nAnd, if we refer to the legislation on another trust created at the same time for analogous purposes, the Chambly turnpike roads trust, this is made still more apparent. The construction of these roads is authorized in the very same year as the Quebec roads, by an ordinance on the very next preceding page, the 4 Vic., eh. 16, and under precisely the same provisions and conditions as to the issue of debentures as those for the Quebec roads. In fact one is almost verbatim the copy of the other. Now the government in 1850 and 1851 paid \u00a319,000 of matured debentures issued by the trustees of these Chambly roads (statement No. 45 of public accounts for 1852); here also acknowledging the liability of the province for these debentures, though as for the Quebec roads, the ordinance authorizing them had enacted that they should be issued on the credit of the tolls, and were not to be paid out of the general revenue of the province. But moreover, it being thought expedient, for reasons which do not appear, to take the said Chambly roads from the hands of the trust created by the ordinance or statute, the 13 and 14 Vic ch. 106 was passed for this purpose. And under whose control are the roads then put? Under the control of the commissioners of public works. The statute enacts in a very few words that \"Whereas it is expedient that the turnpike road hereinafter mentioned should be placed under the control of the commissioners of public works, the said road is and shall be thereby transferred from the control of the trustees to that of the commissioners of public works.\"It enacts also that this property shall be vested in Her Majesty; but this was mere surplusage, as, by the express terms of the ordinance, all the property under the control of the said trustees was already so vested in Her Majesty. The evident purport of the statute is merely to transfer a part of the public works of the country from the control of one state department to another. Now if the Chambly roads, under the 4 Vic. ch. 16, were part of the public works of the country, clearly the Quebec roads, under the 4 Vic. ch. 17, are so; this admits of no doubt. And then, though this statute clearly enacted an appropriation of public moneys, as the province is thereby in express words charged with the liabilities of this trust, \u00a319,000 of which appear to have been actually paid out of the provincial chest very soon after, in 1850 and 1851 (public accounts of 1854, statement No. 41). Yet not only was not His Excellency's previous recommendation of it obtained and communicated to the house as required by the 9 Vic. ch. 114, before the house could constitutionally take into consideration any such proposed appropriation of public money, but moreover, the bill originated in the upper house (journals of 1850, page 142). Now all money bills, it is well known, must originate in the lower house. Why, then, though on the face of it, it would at first sight seem to contain an appropriation of the public funds, was this bill so allowed to be originated in the upper house, and why was His Excellency's previous recommendation of it not considered necessary in the lower house? Because the province Was already liable for the debts of this Chambly trust, before this statute, and independently of it, by the operation of the 4th Vic., chap. 16, itself; and consequently, this new statute imposed no additional liability, on the public chest, but merely transferred an existing liability from the control of the Government's agents or representatives to one of the regular departments of state, in respect to one of the public works of the country. Now, if these Chambly roads were a part of the public works and if the ordinance providing for their construction, though not saying so in express words, was to be read as imposing upon the country the cost of that construction in the event of the tolls proving insufficient for it, clearly, the Quebec roads are on the same footing, and the cost thereof must, as the revenues from the tolls have also proved to be insufficient to provide for it, fall in the like manner upon the province. I have referred to the statements in the public accounts of the province concerning the debentures issued by this trust under the 4th Vic., chap. 17, and 8th Vic. chap. 55, after their maturity, and have shewn that these roads, then, were considered as public works, and these debentures, at and since their maturity, as provincial debentures. That they were also held to be, before their maturity, is made apparent by a reference to the public accounts of the province prior to 1850; and it seems to me great weight must be attached to the official interpretation of the first legislative acts on these roads, given by those who were at the head of the affairs of the province at that time, or a very few years after, when the spirit and intent of the legislation could not have been but well known and understood. In statement No. 19 of the public accounts of 1842 (appendix K), in statement E of the public accounts of 1843, in statement No. 23 of the public accounts of 1844-45, in statement No. 25, appendix A, of the public accounts of 1846 (vol. 5, appendix No. 1 of 1846); in statement No. 23 of the public accounts of 1847, and in statement No. 25 of the public accounts of 1849, I find as assets of the province under the heading \"loans to incorporated companies\" as the Quebec turnpike trust, in 1842, \u00a3400 19s. 7\u00bdd; in 1843, \u00a3621,600; 1844, \u00a321,600, and in the said subsequent years, \u00a338,850. Now, the province then had not paid any money in cash to or for this trust. It was the purchasers of the debentures who alone had advanced these amounts. What is it then that the province credits itself for as a loan to this trust? Clearly for the debentures as successively issued under the statutes. Whatever may be said of this perhaps singular mode of book-keeping, do we not find here again as expressly as possible that these debentures were considered to be provincial debentures? The province had loaned its debentures to this trust and credits itself for their amount. The province of course had its recourse against the trust for the repayment of this loan, but the purchasers of the debentures had their recourse against the province for the moneys by them loaned on the said debentures. I have shown that the province, when these debentures matured, did acknowledge its liability therefor, and paid them all in capital and interest. Now there can be no doubt, and it was conceded at the argument, that if the province was liable for the capital of the debentures issued under the 4th Vic., ch. 17, it is liable to the same extent for those issued under the 16th Vic., ch. 235, the amount whereof is claimed by the suppliants in this case; for this last statute, as already stated, positively enacts (sections 7-10) that as to the capital, the debentures to be issued in virtue thereof and all other matters having reference thereto, shall be subject to the provisions of the 4th Vic., ch. 17. It is because, in the same terms the provisions of the ordinance were extended to the debentures issued under the 8th Vic., ch. 55, that the province paid these last debentures.\nThe point was taken on the part of Her Majesty that it being enacted by section 17 of this 16th Vic., ch. 235 that the new debentures should take precedence of those issued under the provincial guarantee, this shows that these new debentures were not issued under such guarantee. Read alone, this provision, which, as I have remarked before, applies to these debentures only so far as relates to the interest payable thereupon, to use the words of the act, would bear that construction. But if it is, as it must be; taken in its entirety and connection with the other parts of the section and the ordinance, it not only does not sustain the contention on the part of Her Majesty on this point, but, it seems to me, that, on the contrary, it repels absolutely the theory relied upon to contest the suppliant's claim that none of the debentures of this trust were ever issued with the provincial guarantee. For there is here an express admission by the legislative authority that debentures had been issued with such guarantee. Now to which debentures does the statute refer, as having been so issued? Clearly to the debentures issued under the ordinance, which the province had then paid to the amount of \u00a311,790. (Public accounts for 1852, statements Nos. 41 and 45.) The legislature, in so many words, admits then, in this section, that the debentures issued under the ordinance were guaranteed by the province. Now, the first part of the section 7 enacts that the debentures to be issued shall be subject to the provisions of the said ordinance. That is saying clearly that as the debentures issued under the ordinance were to be considered as guaranteed by the province, in case the trustees should be unable to pay them, the debentures issued under this new statute would be so guaranteed. And when the statute adds that these new debentures as to the interest shall take precedence of those issued under the provincial guarantee, and of any claims by the government for moneys advanced to the said trustees, this has reference exclusively, and the Act says so expressly, to the special fund and the tolls in the hands of the trustees. The legislature, by this enactment, merely authorizing the trustees to give to the new debentures priority, for the interest, over the old ones on the moneys in their hands, but not providing, as it had not provided in the ordinance for the old debentures, for the contingency of the trustees having no funds to pay the new debentures. Here again the fact that this contingency was not provided for probably would put a Finance Minister under the obligation to get an appropriation from the Parliament before he could pay these debentures, but could not be invoked as relieving the province of a liability which is imposed upon it by the very same clause of the statute, a contingent liability only then, but now, the special fund being exhausted, an immediate and direct liability.\nI may here remark, that it is admitted on the record that all matters of fact which appear by the public accounts of the Dominion of Canada, or of the late province of Canada, or of the late province of Lower Canada, as well as all facts which appear by the journals of the different branches of the legislatures of the Dominion, or of the said late provinces, or by the sessional papers thereof, shall be taken to be proved by reference to the official publications thereof, without it being necessary to specially produce the same in this cause, so that the ruling in Poliny v. Gray[26], that reports of the public departments of state are not admissible as evidence of facts stated therein, does not govern this case. Another view of the case suggests itself to my mind. Leaving aside the ordinance, or supposing that under it, the province would have had the right to repudiate its liability for the debentures then issued and might have refused to pay them, is the said province not precluded now from repudiating the payment of the debentures issued upon the same conditions and provisions?\nI have shown how, as a matter of fact, the province has, before their maturity, treated these debentures as provincial debentures, and credited itself for the loan of them to this trust. Now, at their maturity, the province had paid them as its own debt; how, since their maturity, and since that payment, it had continued to treat the amount paid therefore as a payment of a provincial debt for a provincial work; how the interest on these debentures has been considered in the legislature itself, not as the loan authorized by the ordinance, but as a permanent charge on the revenue of the country; how the legislature, when ordering the issue of the debentures now held by the suppliants, avoided purposely, to my mind, to reproduce the enactment contained in the preceding statute upon identical debentures, that these debentures would not stand guaranteed by the province; all of these were facts amounting to representations, by the province to the general public, of whom the suppliants form part, that these debentures were, as a matter of fact, provincial debentures.\nSee remarks of Blackburn, J., in Swan v. The North British Australasian Co.[27].\nBy these representations, the suppliants have been induced to invest their moneys in these debentures. Now, it is a rule of law that, it any one, by a course of conduct or by actual expressions, so conduct himself that another may reasonably infer an agreement and undertaking by the one so conducting or expressing himself, the party so conducting or expressing himself cannot afterwards gainsay the reasonable inference to be drawn from his words or conduct, even if he never made such agreement or undertaking.\nPer Pollock, C. B., Cornish v. Abingdon[28], or, in other words, when any one, by his expressions or conduct, voluntarily causes another to believe in the existence of a certain state of things, and induces him to act on that belief so as to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded from averring against the latter a different state of things.\nPer Denman, C. J.[29]; see also Stone v. Godfrey[30]; Thane v. Rogers[31]; Newton v. Liddeard[32]; Cairncross v. Lorimer[33]; Carr v. London and North Western Railway Co.[34]; and cases collected in 2 Smith's leading cases[35].\nAccording to these universally admitted rules of law, the province in the case submitted, is estopped, both by statements and by conduct, from now denying its liability for the debentures held by the suppliants, even if it could have done so at first under the ordinance[36].\nI have only one more observation to make. It is with reference to the remark made by one of the learned counsel, heard before us on the part of Her Majesty in the course of his argument, that it would be unjust to make the whole of the province pay for the roads of a particular locality. I have already quoted the public accounts to show that the policy of the government at that time was to so build and improve roads in different parts of the province and do not intend to revert to that. What strikes my mind now is this. These debenture holders cannot be paid by the inhabitants of the locality where these roads have been made, no liability is imposed on this locality by the statutes; and this is admitted, they cannot be paid out of the special fund in the hands of the trustees, for this fund cannot meet their claim; this is also admitted. It follows, that, if the province does not pay them, they will lose every cent of the moneys they have lent for making, these roads, that consequently they, who may not have the least interest in the locality where these roads have been made, who may reside in England or the United States, or in any other part of the world, will be made to pay for making and improving the said roads to the amount of the \u00a370,000 they have so lent, that the province whose property these roads are, would thus have become richer by \u00a370,000 at the expense of the said debenture holders. Now, for states as for individuals \"\u00c6quum sit neminem cum a'lerius detrimento locupletari.\" And would there not be a greater injustice in causing these debenture holders to lose their \u00a370,000, than in obliging the province on whose property this money has been expended to repay it? By the construction I give to this statute, 16 Vic., ch. 235, read in connection with the prior and subsequent acts and proceedings of the province, concerning this trust, not only is such a grave, very grave injustice prevented, but moreover the repudiation of a public debt by the province of Canada as constituted before confederation does not receive the sanction and authority of the courts of justice.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court awarding to the suppliants the capital of the debentures held by them is right, and that the appeal from the said judgment taken on the part of Her Majesty should be dismissed with costs. On the cross-appeal the suppliants complain of that part of the judgment of the Exchequer Court by which they were refused the interest accrued on the debentures held by them.\nThe proviso in the 16 Vic., ch. 235, sec. 7, relating to this part of the case, reads as follows;\u2014\"Provided nevertheless that no moneys shall be advanced oat of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest.\"\nThe point was taken by the suppliants that the enactment that the interest was not to be advanced out of the provincial funds, referred only to the issue of \u00a330,000 made under this seventh section of the act and did not apply to the issue of \u00a340,000 made under the tenth section, but this is an error. This enactment in section 7 applies by its very terms, not only to the debentures issued under the said section, but also generally to all debentures issued under the act, including those issued under section 10, so that they all stand on the same footing, and must be governed by the same rules.\nIt is clear, and I apprehend not contested, that the only thing that the legislature intended by so enacting that no moneys were to be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the interest on these new debentures, was to repeal, quoad the said debentures, the enactment contained in section 27 of the ordinance 4th Vic., ch. 17, by which the Governor General was empowered to authorize the loan to the special fund in the hands of the trustees, of any sum of money necessary to pay any arrears of interest that might be due on the debentures issued by the trust, which loan the trustees were ordered by the same section of the ordinance to repay to the receiver general out of the said special fund. Now, the suppliants here have nothing to do with this loan which was a mere matter of administration between the executive authority and its officers, the trustees. Whether the executive lends money to the trustees and whether the trustees repay this loan is not and could not be the ground of their claim. They ask the amount of the interest on their debentures, not as a loan, but as a debt of the government to them. The government, in their legislature, as I have shown by the public accounts, has considered this interest, when it paid it before, not as a loan to an incorporated company, but as a permanent charge on the public revenues of the country, as a debt of the country. It is as such that the suppliants claim it now. Having come to the conclusion that the province was responsible for the capital of these debentures as one of its debts, it seems to me that it follows as a necessary consequence that the interest of these debentures, which on their face are payable with interest, is likewise a debt of the province. There might be some doubt as to the liability of the province for this interest before these debentures matured. But since their maturity, since they have become a direct liability of the province for their capital, the province, if liable at all, is liable for them as they are, that is to say with interest. The provincial chest has received the interest on these moneys; that interest belonged to the suppliants. If the province was not condemned to repay it to the suppliants as accrued since the maturity of these debentures, it would have derived a benefit, and a very large one indeed, from the non-fulfilment of its obligation to pay the capital when it matured. The only way to cause this interest to cease to accrue after the maturity of these debentures, was to call them in, according to section 24 of the ordinance, and this has not been done. It would be unnecessarily going over the same ground again for me to repeat here at length what I have said on the first part of the case as to the capital, The province heretofore paid the interest of the moneys lent by the debenture holders under the ordinance, and the 8th Vic., as its debt, not as the loan authorized by the ordinance. The suppliants ask the same thing for the debentures issued under the 16th Vic., which are ruled by the same provisions. The fact that this last statute enacts that the loan authorized by the ordinance to be made by the crown to the trustees for the payment of the interest shall not be made for the new debentures cannot affect them; particularly for the interest accrued since the maturity of these debentures, since they have become payable by the province; as, in any case, this enactment would probably be construed to apply only to the interest accruing before the maturity of these debentures, and then, it is not under that clause of the ordinance at all that they here claim these interests but purely and simply as a liability of the province; as an accessory of the capital due to them by the said province, which capital carries interest on the face of the contract. Indeed, even if the interest had not been settled by the contract, I apprehend that, as the detention of these moneys by the province since the maturity of the debentures has been a wrongful detention, the said provinces should be mulcted in interest.\nI am of opinion to allow the cross-appeal of the suppliants with costs and to modify the judgment of the Exchequer Court so as to allow them, in addition to the capital awarded by the said court, the interest at six per cent. on the debentures held by them since the maturity thereof, with the costs in the Exchequer Court.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nThe question which we have to determine in this case is whether or not the amounts, or any part of the amounts, purported to be secured by bonds or debentures issued by the Trustees of the Quebec Turnpike Trust, under the authority of the act of the parliament of the province of Canada, before Confederation, being 16 Vic., ch. 235, constituted, at the time of the passing of the B. N. A, Act, a debt or liability of the province of Canada, existing at Confederation, so as to become imposed upon the Dominion of Canada, by the 111th sec. of the B. N. A. Act. In the view which I take, it appears to me to be free from all doubt that such liability did not then exist, unless it was expressly imposed by the Imperial Act, 3 and 4 Vic., ch. 35, or by some acts or act of the legislature of the province of United Canada, as constituted by that act.\nSuch was the nature of the constitution given to the province of Canada, by 3 and 4 Vic., ch. 35, that no debt or liability could be enforced against the executive government, even in a proceeding by petition of right, or become imposed upon it by any executive officer, or by all the executive officers of the government combined, without the sanction of an act of parliament, or a vote or resolution of the legislative assembly. No contract or obligation, arising by way of estoppel, from statements made by a finance minister or other public servant appearing in the public accounts or elsewhere, or from any conduct of any of the executive officers of the government, can be implied against the government of the province. The doctrine of estoppel in pais, which is recognized in dealings between individuals or corporations, the principle of which is explained in Pickard v. Sears[37], Freeman v. Cooke[38], Swan v. N. B. Australasian Co.[39], Cornish v. Abingdon[40], Carr v. London & N. W. Railway Co.[41], and such like cases, has, in my judgment, no application to the case before us, which must be determined upon the construction simply of the act or acts of parliament, vote or resolution which is, or are, relied upon as creating the debt or liability. I shall, I think, best be able to convey the mode of reasoning, which has led my mind to the opinion I have formed, by dealing with the subject in a chronological order of events from the earliest statute which appears to have any bearing upon the case.\nAt the time of the passing of the Imperial Statute 1 & 2 Vic., ch. 9, whereby the constitution of Lower Canada, as theretofore existing, was suspended, the management and repair of the public highways in Lower Canada were provided for and regulated under the provisions of the provincial statute 36 Geo. 3rd, ch. 9. By the 1st sec. of 1 & 2 Vic., ch. 9, the constitution of Lower Canada were declared to be suspended, from the time of the proclamation of the act in Canada, until the first day of November, 1840. By the second section, provision was made for the constitution of a special council for the government of the province, and by the third section it was enacted: \"that from and after such proclamation, as aforesaid, until the said 1st day of November, 1840, it should be lawful for the governor of the province of Lower Canada, with the advice and consent of a majority of the said councillors present, &c., &c., to make such laws or ordinances for the peace, welfare and good government of the said province of Lower Canada as the legislature of Lower Canada as theretofore constituted was empowered to make, &c, &c., provided always that no law or ordinance so made should continue in force beyond the 1st day of November, 1842, unless continued by competent authority; provided also that it should not be lawful, by any such law or ordinance, to impose any tax, duty, rate or impost, save only in so far as any tax, duty, rate or impost, which at the time of the passing of the act was payable within the said province, might be thereby continued. Upon the 17th day August, 1839, the Imperial Statute, 2 and 3 Vic., ch. 53, was passed in amendment of the act just recited, and the duration of the special council was extended. By the third section of this act it was enacted that so much of the said recited act, land 2 Vic., ch. 9, as provided that it should not be lawful by any such law or ordinance as therein mentioned to impose any tax, duty, rate or impost, save only in so far as any tax, duty or impost which at the passing of that act was payable within the said province of Lower Canada might be continued, should be and was thereby repealed, subject however to this proviso\u2014that it should not be lawful for the said governor and special council to make any law imposing or authorizing the imposition of any new tax, rate, duty or impost, except for carrying into effect local improvements within the said province of Lower Canada, or any district or other local division thereof, or for the establishment or maintenance of police or other object of municipal government within any city, town or district or other local division of the said province; and provided also that in every law or ordinance imposing or authorizing the imposition of any such new tax, duty, rate or impost, provision should be made for the levying, receipt and appropriation thereof by such person or persons as should be thereby appointed or designated for that purpose, but that no such new tax, duty, rate or impost should be levied by or made payable to the Receiver-General or to any other public officer employed in the receipt of Her Majesty's ordinary revenue in the province; nor should any such law or ordinance aforesaid provide for the appropriation of any such new tax, duty rate or impost by the said governor either with or without the advice of the executive council of the said province, or by the commissioners of Her Majesty's treasury, or by any other officer of the crown employed in the receipt of Her Majesty's ordinary revenue.\nNow, it seems to me that by this very precise language, the Imperial parliament, while impressed with the necessity, for the preservation of the peace, order and good government of the province, of temporarily suspending the exercise of its ancient representative institutions, was scrupulously careful to interfere as little as possible with the right of the people to impose upon themselves their own burthens, and that they therefore thus, in what appears to be very plain language, declined to invest the special council, so exceptional in its construction, with power to make any law which could be construed as imposing, directly or indirectly, a new burthen upon the public revenues of the province; and in express terms limited the council's power of imposing any rate, duty, tax or impost, of whatever nature or amount, to matters of a purely local or municipal character, in respect of the levying or receipt of which, neither the Lords of Her Majesty's treasury nor the Receiver-General of the province, nor any other public officer ordinarily employed in the collection and receipt of Her Majesty's revenue in the province, should be in any wise concerned or be accountable.\nThe special council whose powers were thus restricted passed an ordinance upon the 30th day of January, 1841, in the first section of which it was enacted: That it should be lawful for the governor by letters patent under the great seal of the province to appoint not less than five nor more than nine persons to be, and who and their successors, to be appointed in the manner thereinafter mentioned should be trustees for the purpose of opening, making and keeping in repair the roads thereinafter specified. The second section provided for the appointment of successors to the trustees, By the third section it was enacted that the said trustees, for all the purposes of the ordinances might, by the name of \"The Trustees of the Quebec Turnpike Roads,\" sue and be sued, answer and be answered unto, in all courts of justice and might acquire property and estate, moveable and immoveable, which being so acquired should be vested in Her Majesty for the public uses of the province, subject to the management of the said trustees, for the purposes of the ordinance, and might, in the manner which they should deem fit, cause the said roads and each of them, and the bridges thereupon, to be improved, widened and repaired, etc., etc., and might from time to time appoint and remove surveyors, officers and other persons under them as they might deem necessary for the purposes of the ordinance, and pay them such reasonable compensation as the said trustees should deem meet, and might generally do and perform all such matters and things as might be necessary for carrying the ordinance into effect according to the true intent, meaning and object thereof. By the ninth section it was enacted that the roads over which the provisions of the ordinance and the powers of the trustees should extend should be seven in number, covering thirty miles in the whole, as appears by a paper subsequently laid before the legislature of United Canada, but consisting of several short roads varying from one to six or seven miles each in length, radiating in every direction from the city of Quebec.\nBy the 10th section it was enacted that the said trustees might erect toll gates and collect certain specified tolls and rates thereat upon each of the said roads, and that the said trustees might establish the regulations under which such tolls and rates should be levied and collected, and that, with the consent of the governor, they might from time to time, as they should see fit, alter, change and modify the said rates and tolls and the said regulations.\nBy the 14th section it was enacted that the said tolls might be levied by the said trustees on the said roads, or on any of them, or on any part of them, or of any of them, from and after the day when the said trustees should have assumed control and management of such roads or road or part of a road in the manner in the ordinance provided and not before, but that the time of such assumption should be at the discretion of the said trustees and should not depend upon the completion or non-completion of the improvements on the roads, road or part of road of which the control and management should be so assumed.\nBy the 16th section it was enacted that the said trustees might if they should think proper commute the tolls on any road or portion thereof with any person by taking a certain sum either monthly or yearly in lieu of such tolls. By the 18th section it was enacted that the said roads should, respectively, from the time thereinafter mentioned, be and remain in and under the exclusive management, charge and control of the said trustees, and that the tolls thereon should be applied solely to the necessary expenses of the management, making and repairing of the said roads and the payment of the interest on, and principal of, the debentures thereinafter mentioned.\nBy the 19th section it was enacted that from the time when the said trustees should assume the control and management of any part of any road mentioned in the 9th section of the ordinance, every person, body politic or corporate, who might be bound by any law of the province, or any proces verbal, duly homologated (and all such laws and proces verbaux were declared to remain in full force except in so far as they were thereby expressly derogated from) to repair or keep up or to perform any service or labor on or with regard to any portion of such road, should, and were thereby required, to commute all such obligations with the said trustees, for such sum of money as might be agreed upon, by such parties respectively and the said trustees, and that such commutation money should be paid annually on the 1st day of May in each year, and that in default of payment the trustees might sue for and recover the same in any court having jurisdiction to the amount, and that if no such agreement should be effected in any case, the trustees might sue the party refusing to come to an agreement and might recover such sum for such commutation as the court should award.\nBy the 20th section it was enacted that it should be lawful for the governor, at any time, and whenever he should deem it expedient, to appoint the said trustees commissioners for carrying into effect an ordinance of the special council, passed in the same year, intituled \"An ordinance to. declare and regulate the tolls to be taken on the bridge over the Cap Rouge River, and for other purposes relative to the said bridge,\" and that during the time the said trustees should be such commissioners the said bridge should be held to be part of the roads and bridges under the management of the said trustees as if it had been mentioned in the 9th section of the ordinance, and that the tolls authorized to be levied by the ordinance relating to the said bridge, from the persons using the said bridge and collected during the said time, should form part of the funds thereby placed at the disposal of the said trustees, and should and might be applied by them in the same manner as the other tolls authorized to be levied under the ordinance.\nBy the 21st section it was enacted that it should be lawful for the said trustees to raise, by way of loan, on the credit and security of the tolls thereby authorized to be imposed, and of other monies which might come into the possession of, or be at the disposal of, the said trustees, under and by virtue of the ordinance, and not to be paid out of or chargeable against the general revenue of the province, any sum of money not exceeding on the whole twenty-five thousand pounds currency.\nBy the 22nd section it was enacted that it should be lawful for the said trustees to cause to be made out, for such sum or sums of money as they might raise by loan as aforesaid, debentures in the form contained in Schedule A of the ordinance, redeemable at such times, subject to the provisions of the ordinance as the said trustees should think most safe and convenient.\nBy the 23rd section it was enacted that such debentures should respectively bear interest at the rate therein mentioned, and that such interest should be made payable semi-annually, and might, at the discretion of the trustees, and with the express sanction and approval of the governor of the province, and not otherwise, exceed the rate of six per cent per annum, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, and that the interest should be paid out of the tolls upon the said roads, or out of any other monies at the disposal of the trustees for the purposes of the ordinance.\nBy the 26th section it was enacted that it should be lawful for the governor for the time being, if he should deem it expedient at any time within three years from the passing of the ordinance, and not afterwards, to purchase for the public uses of the province, and from the said trustees, debentures to an amount not exceeding ten thousand pounds currency, and by warrant, under his hand, to authorize the receiver-general to pay to the said trustees out of any unappropriated public monies in his hands the sum secured by such debentures, the principal and interest of, and on which, should be paid to the Receiver-General by the said trustees in the same manner and under the same provisions as are provided with regard to such payments to any lawful holder of such debentures, and being so paid should remain in the hands of the Receiver-General at the disposal of the legislative authority of the province for the time being.\nBy the 27th section it was enacted that all arrears of interest, due on any debentures issued under the authority of the ordinance, should be paid by the said trustees before any part of the principal sum then due and secured by any such debenture should be so paid, and that if the. deficiency of the funds then in the hands of the said trustees should be such, that the funds then at their disposal should not be sufficient to pay such arrears of interest, it should be lawful for the governor for the time being, by warrant under his hand, to authorize the Receiver-General to advance to the said trustees out of any unappropriated monies in his hands, such sum of money as might, with the funds then at the disposal of the said trustees, be sufficient to pay such arrears of interest as aforesaid, which being repaid should remain in the hands of the Receiver-General, at the disposal of the legislative authority of the province.\nBy the 28th section it was enacted, that it should be lawful for the said trustees at any time, and as often as occasion might require, to raise in like manner such further sum or sums as might be necessary to enable them to pay off the principal of any loan which they might bind themselves to repay at any certain time, and which the funds in their hands, or which would probably be in their hands at such time, and applicable to such repayment, should appear insufficient to enable them to repay; provided always that any sum or sums so raised should be applied solely to the purpose in this section mentioned, and that no such sum should be borrowed without the approval of the governor of the province, and that the whole sum due by the said trustees under the debentures then unredeemed and issued under the authority of the ordinance should in no case exceed thirty-five thousand pounds currency, and that all the provisions of the ordinance touching the terms upon which any sum should be borrowed under the authority thereof by the trustees, the rate of interest payable thereon, the payment of such interest, the advance by the Receiver-General of the sums necessary to enable the trustees to pay such interest, and the repayment of the sums so advanced should be extended to any sum or sums borrowed under the authority of this section.\nBy the 29th section it was enacted that the due application of all public monies whereof the expenditure or receipt is authorized by the preceding sections should be accounted for to Her Majesty, her heirs and sucessors, through the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury for the time being, in such manner and form as Her Majesty, her heirs and successors should be pleased to direct, and:\nBy the 37th section that the said trustees should lay detailed accounts of all monies by them received and expended under the authority of the ordinance, supported by proper vouchers, and also detailed reports of all their doings and proceedings under the said authority, before such officer, at such times and in such manner and form, and should publish the same in such way at the expense of the said trustees as the governor should be pleased to direct.\nThe true construction of this ordinance, as it appears to me, was to constitute the trustees, when appointed in the manner directed by the ordinance, a body corporate, not, it is true, for purposes of private profit, or for trade, but for a special limited public purpose of a purely local, sectional or municipal character, and not at all of a public character, in the sense of being provincial; composed of persons who were no doubt selected and appointed trustees, in consequence of their having an interest in the contemplated local improvements as residents in the locality; but whether the trustees were constituted a body corporate for a private or for a public purpose seems to me to be of no importance, for the first question which arises for our consideration is: Was that body corporate invested with power to impose, and did it impose, by the debentures issued by it under the ordinance, any burthen upon the public revenues of the province of Lower Canada, for the payment, either of the interest or the principal, secured by those debentures, or was it invested with power to contract, and did the debentures issued by the corporation constitute a contract, entered into for and in behalf of Her Majesty, with the respective purchasers of the debentures? The answer to these questions must be sought for solely within the four corners of the ordinance itself, which alone gives to the debentures whatever validity and effect they had.\nThe ordinance, it is true, in its 3rd section, provides that the body corporate constituted by the ordinance might acquire property and estate, moveable and immoveable, which being so acquired should be vested, as indeed all the public highways are, in Her Majesty, for the public uses of the province, but subject, as is provided by the 3rd and 18th sections, to the exclusive management, charge and control of the body corporate so created, and upon the express trust that the tolls and rates which the corporation was authorized to impose, levy and collect, should be applied solely to the necessary expenses of the management of the trust\u2014the making and repairing of the roads, and the payment of the interest on, as well as the principal of, the debentures which they were authorized to issue. Now, these tolls and rates, which they were authorized to impose, levy and collect upon and from all persons using the roads, or who, by the provisions of the law previously in force, were made liable to contribute to the repair of the roads abutting upon their lands, were in no sense public monies of the province of Lower Canada, nor monies received by Her Majesty either through the Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, or through the Receiver General of the province, or through any other officer employed in the collection or receipt of Her Majesty's provincial revenue, or for the receipt or appropriation of which any of these officers were accountable or with which they had anything to do. This is conclusively established by the terms of 2 and 3 Vic. ch. 53, which alone gave to the special council power to enable the trustees to deal with the work and fund placed under their control as a work and fund of a purely local and sectional and municipal character. It is therefore erroneous to speak of the work as provincial, or the rates, tolls and commutation monies constituting the fund created by the ordinance as being part of the public funds or revenue of the province of Lower Canada. The 37th section of the ordinance must be read as referring to those rates, tolls and other monies coming into the hands of the trustees to be applied by them to the specially prescribed purposes of the trust, its object being to afford evidence of the manner in which they should be fulfilling their trust; and the 29th section, to have any application, must be applied to all such public monies, if any, as should, in the discretion of the governor, be advanced under his warrant out of the unappropriated public monies of the province, as a loan to the corporation.\nIt is, however, to the clauses which alone give to the body corporate any power to raise money by loan upon its debentures, that we must look, to ascertain whether or not any charge or liability for the redemption, either of the interest or principal of those debentures, is imposed upon the public revenues of the province, or is assumed by, or on behalf of Her Majesty.\nNow these clauses in the most express terms exclude and repel all idea of any such charge or liability having been, by the ordinance, imposed upon the provincial revenue or assumed by or on behalf of Her Majesty.\nBy the 21st sec. the power of the trustees is limited to raising the \u00a325,000 currency, thereby authorized \"upon the credit and security of the tolls authorized to be levied, and of other monies; viz. the commutation monies, coming into the possession of, and at the disposal of the trustees under the ordinance, and not to be paid out of or to be chargeable against the general revenue of the province.\"\nThis is an express declaration that the monies so raised shall form no charge or liability upon the general revenue of the province, and there is no warrant or authority for our holding that Her Majesty assumed, or could assume, any obligation in respect of the debentures, otherwise than through the medium of and as a charge or liability upon the provincial revenue.\nThen the 23rd section again repeats that the interest payable under the debentures shall be paid out of the tolls upon the said roads, or out of any other monies at the disposal of the trustees for the purposes of the ordinance.\nThe 26th sec. leaves it dicretionary with the governor for the time being, if he should deem it expedient \"at any time within three years from the passing of the ordinance, and not after wards, to purchase for the public uses of the province and from the said trustees, debentures to an amount not exceeding \u00a310,000, currency, and by warrant, under his hand, to authorize the Receiver General to pay to the said trustees out of any unappropriated public monies in his hands the sum secured by such debentures; the principal and interest of, and on which, shall be paid to the Receiver General by the said trustees in the same manner and under the same provisions as are provided with regard to such payments to any lawful holder of such debentures, and being so paid shall remain in the hands of the Receiver General, at the disposal of the legislative authority of the province for the time being.\" Now by this clause the governor is empowered, in his discretion, to lend to the corporation out of the unappropriated public monies of the province a sum not exceeding \u00a310,000, and to receive therefor debentures of the corporation, which were to be held by the Receiver General, to and for the public uses of the province The province was thereby authorized to become a creditor of the corporation to that amount, and was placed in respect of such loan precisely in the same position as every other creditor of the corporation who should advance money to it, upon the security of its debentures.\nThen, again, by the 27th clause, if the funds at the disposal of the corporation should at any time prove to be insufficient to pay all arears of interest upon the debentures, it was left to the discretion of the governor for the time being, by warrant under his hand, to authorize the Receiver-General to advance to the said trustees, out of any unappropriated monies in his hands, such sum of money as might, with the funds then at the disposal of the trustees, be sufficient to pay such arrears of interest as aforesaid, \"and the amount so advanced shall be repaid by the trustees to the Receiver-General, out of the sums, so to be commuted, levied and collected as aforesaid, and being so repaid shall remain in the hands of the Receiver-General, at the disposal of the legislative authority of the province.\" Now these provisions, enabling the province, in the discretion of the governor for the time being, to become creditors of the trust corporation precisely in the same manner and upon the same terms as any private person becoming a creditor of the corporation, advancing to it money upon the security of its debentures, is so utterly inconsistent with the province being made the debtor to the purchasers of the debentures, or subjected to any obligation or liability as guarantors or otherwise, to redeem the debentures, either as to principal or interest, that we can in my judgment come to no other conclusion than that no charge or liability whatever in respect of the debentures was imposed upon the province by the terms of the ordinance.\nSuch, then, being the true construction to put upon the terms of the ordinance at the time of the re-union of the provinces of Lower and Upper Canada being effected, it is plain that there did not then exist any charge or liability imposed upon the revenues of Lower Canada which could in that character, upon the union, become a charge or liability upon the revenues of United Canada to redeem any debentures which should be issued by the trustee corporation under the authority of the ordinance.\nNow, the Act of Union 3 and 4 Vic., chap. 35, came into operation on the 10th February, 1841, in pursuance of a proclamation to that effect published in Canada upon the 5th February, 1841.\nThere having been no charge or liability, in respect of any debentures which should be issued by the trust corporation under the authority of the ordinance, imposed upon the revenues of Lower Canada, or constituting a debt or obligation of that province before the union, which, in that character, could, by the union, become a charge or liability imposed upon United Canada, we must, as I have said at the outset, look to the Imperial statute, 3 and 4 Vic, chap. 35, and to the legislation of the parliament of United Canada as the only authorities, under the circumstances, competent to impose the charge or liability upon the revenues of United Canada, in order to determine whether or not any such charge or liability has ever been, and if ever when, created and imposed.\nBy the 3rd and 4th Vic., chap. 35, sec. 50, it was enacted that all revenue over which the respective legislatures of the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, before and at the time of the passing of the act, had power of appropriation, should form one consolidated revenue fund, to be appropriated for the public service of Canada, subject to the charges by the act directed.\nThe sections of this act from 50 to 57 inclusive were repealed by an Imperial act passed in the 10th and 11th years of Her Majesty's reign, for the purpose of adopting similar provisions contained in the provincial act, 9 Vic., chap. 149, but I quote from the act of union as it was by it, that the revenues of the two provinces of Lower and Upper Canada as those revenues existed at the union were united into one consolidated fund under the exclusive control of the legislature of United Canada.\nBy the 55th section of this act of union it was enacted that the consolidation of the duties and revenues of the said province should not be taken to affect the payment out of the said consolidated revenue fund of any sum or sums theretofore charged upon the said rates and duties already raised, levied, and collected, or to be raised, levied and collected, to and for the use of either of the said provinces of Upper and Lower Canada for such time as should have been appointed by the several acts of the legislature of the province by which such charges were severally authorized, and: By the 57th section it was enacted that subject to the several payments by the act charged on the said consolidated revenue fund the same should be appropriated by the legislature of the province of Canada for the public service in such manner as they should think proper: \"Provided always that all bills for appropriating any part of the surplus of the said consolidated revenue fund or for imposing any new tax or impost, shall originate in the legislative assembly of the said province of Canada; Provided also that it shall not be lawful for the said legislative assembly to originate or pass any vote, resolution or bill for the appropriation of any part of the surplus of the said consolidated revenue fund, or of any other tax or impost, to any purpose which shall not have been first recommended by a message of the governor to the said legislative assembly, during the session in which such vote, resolution or bill shall be passed.\"\nAs, then, the liability to redeem any debentures which should be issued by the trust corporation, under the ordinance of the special council of Lower Canada, 4 Vic. ch. 17, did not, on the 10th February, 1846, exist as a charge upon the revenues of Lower Canada, and as all those revenues became, by the act of union, part of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada, which was placed under the sole control of the legislature of United Canada, subject only to the charges thereon imposed by the act of union, and as the liability to redeem such debentures was not among the charges so imposed, we must seek in the proceedings of the legislature of Canada, for some vote, resolution, of bill appropriating some part of the surplus of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada towards the redemption of the debentures. From the terms of the 57th section of the Union Act, it, is impossible to say that the liability could ever arise by implication from any state of facts, nor could any court of justice pronounce it to exist upon any authority or evidence, short of the voice of the legislature, expressed in some vote, resolution or bill imposing the charge. Now, that the legislature of Canada, as constituted by the Act of 3 and 4 Vic., ch. 35, recognized a clear distinction between those purely local works, such as those which were placed, by the special ordinance, under the control of the trust corporal ion thereby created, and those public works which, from their provincial character, should be charged up on the consolidated revenue fund of United Canada, appears from two acts passed by the legislature of the province in its first session, namely, 4 and 5 Vic., ch. 28 and 72. By the former of those acts, intituled, \"An Act to appropriate certain sums of money for public improvements and for other purposes therein mentioned,\" there was granted to Her Majesty, the sum of \u00a31,659,682 sterling, to be expended, under the superintendence of the board of works of the province, in the proportions in the Act specified, for the erection and completion of the public works therein enumerated, which, besides canals and other works for improving the navigation of the rivers and lakes, comprehended also certain great public highways which, from their provincial importance, were deemed to be fit to be charged upon the consolidated fund, namely:\n9th. For improving the Bay of Chaleurs road between Perc\u00e9 Point and the Indian Mission, and a portion of the Metis or Kempt road.\n10th. For improving and completing the Gosford road, between Quebec and the Eastern Townships.\n11th. For improving and completing the main northern road, from lake Ontario, at Toronto, to lake Huron, continuing and perfecting the same from the termination of the portion already undertaken by the district of Barrie, establishing toll bars thereon, and improving sundry parts thence to Penetanguishene and on the Cold Water Portage.\n12th. For improving the main province road from Quebec to Amherstburg and Port Sarnia, building certain bridges on the same, between Montreal and Quebec and improving these portions of the line along which the rivers or lakes are not now available for the transport of the mails, that is to say, to macadamize, or otherwise improve that portion between the Cascades and the province line, and to establish toll bars thereon.\n13th. To macadamize, or otherwise complete that portion from the termination of the part already undertaken by the district of Brantford to London, and to establish toll bars thereon.\n14th To drain, trunk, form, and otherwise improve the road thence to Port Sarnia.\n15th. To drain, trunk, form, and otherwise improve the road from London to Chatham, Sandwich and Amherstburg.\n19th. For building bridges over the large rivers between Quebec and Montreal.\n17th. For the completion of the military road from the Ottawa, near L'Orignal to the St. Lawrence, and\n18th. For the formation of a line of road from Hamilton to Port Dover.\nAnd by chapter 72, after reciting that it was expedient to extend the provisions of the ordinance 4 Vic., ch. 17, to the road thereinafter mentioned, it was enacted that the provisions of the said ordinance and the powers of the trustees appointed under the authority thereof, should extend to the road leading from that sixthly mentioned in the 9th sec. of the said ordinance, to Scott's bridge, including the said bridge, and to the main road running along the north bank of the river St. Charles, from Scott's bridge aforesaid, to the bridge over the said river, commonly called the red bridge, or commissioners' bridge, including the said bridge, as fully, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, as if the said roads and bridges had been mentioned and described in the said 9th sec. of the said ordinance, as among those to which the said provisions and powers should extend.\nNow, as regards this act, the most that can be said in aid of the contention of the suppliants is, that it may be construed as an adoption by the Legislature of Canada of those provisions of the special ordinance 4 Vic., ch. 17, which profess to empower the governor, for the time being, to authorize a loan to the trust, corporation, out of the surplus unappropriated revenues of Lower Canada, in the hands of the Receiver-General of that province, so as to make those provisions applicable to any surplus of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada, in the hands of the Receiver-General, or other finance officer of the united province, and so as to authorize the governor for the time being, of Canada, to issue his warrant upon this fund for the special purposes of the provisions so adopted, which, in view of the provisions of the Imperial statute, 3 and 4 Vic., ch. 35, it would not have been lawful for the Governor to do without the special authority of the legislature of Canada for that purpose given; but it is plain that the Act cannot be construed as imposing any other or greater liability upon the consolidated fund of Canada than that purported to be imposed upon the revenues of Lower Canada by the terms of the special ordinance, and as that ordinance was only permissive, in so far as it authorized the Governor for the time being, if he should deem it to be expedient, to lend public monies to a prescribed amount to the trust corporation, upon the security of its debentures, so, likewise, must the 4 and 5 Vic., ch. 72, be construed to have been permissive only; and, therefore, the latter act cannot be construed as imposing any liability to redeem any debentures which might be issued by the trust corporation any more than the special ordinance itself could have been so construed.\nIn the session of parliament commencing on the 8th September and terminating on the 12th October, 1842, and upon the 29th day of September during that session, there appears to have been a petition presented to the Legislative Assembly from the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads praying to be authorized to raise, by way of loan, a sum sufficient to complete the said roads and also for certain alterations in the ordinance constituting the trust. The only action which appears to have been taken upon this petition during the short remainder of the session was, that upon the 10th October, it was resolved that an humble address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General, praying that His Excellency will be pleased to cause to be laid before the house within ten days after the opening of the next session of the provincial parliament, detailed accounts of all monies received and expended by the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads under the authority of the ordinance to provide for the improvement of the roads in the neighbourhood of and leading to the city of Quebec and to raise a fund for that purpose, but in the public accounts laid before the house during that session, accompanying the estimates for appropriations for the public service, in a \"schedule of accounts and statements respecting the public income and expenditure \"for the province of Canada, for the year 1841,\" and in a statement, forming part of that schedule, of warrants issued on the Receiver General, on account of the expenditure of the civil government of that part of the province formerly Lower Canada, for the year 1841, is the entry of a warrant for \u00a3360 17s. 8d. sterling as issued to John Porter, secretary of the Quebec turnpike road trustees, to enable him to pay the interest on loans effected under 4 Vic., ch. 17, to the first of January, 1842, and in another statement, being No. 19 of the same schedule, entitled \"statement of the affairs of Canada, on the 31st of Dec, 1841 and under the heading of 'loans to incorporated companies and commissioners of turnpike loads,' is an entry of \u00a3400 19s 7\u00bdd. currency, as a loan to the Quebec turnpike trust,\" which sum it will be seen precisely represents the sum of \u00a3300 17s. 8d. sterling in the other entry.\nIn similar documents laid before the House in the session held in 1813, for the year ending the 31st December, 1842, is the entry of a payment made to John Porter, secretary to the trustees of the Quebec Turnpike Roads, being for interest to the 31st of December, 1842, of the sum of \u00a31,041 6s 10d. sterling, equal, as it will be observed, to about \u00a31,157 0s. 10d. currency, and in the statement under the head of \"Loans to incorporated companies,\" is the entry of the sum of \u00a321,600 currency as a loan to the Quebec Turnpike Trust. In reply to the address of the legislative assembly in the previous session, there was in the session of 1843 laid before the assembly, a general account of monies received and disbursements made by the trustees of the Quebec Turnpike Roads, from the 1st March, 1841, to the 27th March, 1843. By this account it appears that upon the 1st January, 1842. there accrued due for interest upon debentures to the amount of \u00a312,800 previously issued to divers persons, the sum of \u00a3400,19s. 7d. which was liquidated by the Governor-General's warrant of January 1st, 1842, for that precise amount; that upon the 1st July, 1842, the trustees received by the Governor-General's warrant the sum of \u00a3524 6s. 5d. to pay the interest then accrued due, and upon the 1st January, 1843, by like warrant, the sum of \u00a3632 14s. 5d. to pay the interest which accrued due upon the 31st December, 1842, upon all debentures then issued, which amounted to the sum of \u00a321,600, these two sums of \u00a352 1 6s. 5d. and \u00a3632 14s. 5d., making together the sum of \u00a31,157 0s. 10d. represent the \u00a31,041 6s. 10d. sterling, entered in the accounts laid before the legislature in the session of 1843, as paid out of the consolidated fund. Now, by these returns it appears that the \u00a3400 19s. 7d., the first item which was entered in the accounts laid before the legislature in 1842, as a loan to the Quebec Turnpike Trust, was in fact advanced to the trust corporation to pay interest upon all the debentures then issued, and was correctly represented as a loan to the corporation, but the entry of \u00a321,600 as a loan to the corporation in the accounts laid before the legislative assembly in 1843, does not, it must, I think, be admitted, correctly represent the state of the case, for in fact no such amount had been advanced by the executive government to the trust corporation. It is urged by way of explanation of this entry, that the government officials, whose duty it was to make out the accounts, entered this sum of \u00a321,600 as a loan to the trust corporation, because they regarded the monies obtained upon the trust corporation's debentures, as monies borrowed upon the credit of the Province and to be paid out of the public revenues of the province, but if that was the idea entertained, it could surely have been easily expressed and the account would have been made out so as to show the province to be the debtor to the holders of the debentures and not creditors of the trust corporation for a loan made to the corporation. It is difficult to understand or explain the entry, for before the passing of the Act, 12 Vic., ch. 5, to which I shall have to refer by and by, there was no act of parliament, nor any vote or resolution of the Legislative Assembly which could be construed as subjecting the consolidated fund to the payment of the principal of the debentures issued by the corporation, or as authorizing the loan of such a sum to the corporation; but whatever explanation may be suggested for the entry, it is clear that if any inference is to be drawn from any conduct of the legislative assembly, founded upon the public accounts laid before it, such inference must be drawn from what is stated in those accounts and not from what is not stated therein, but is thrown out in argument by way of suggested explanation of a statement in those accounts which must be admitted to be incorrect; and it is equally clear, as it seems to me, that from the mere statement in the accounts, no inference whatever can be drawn which could impose upon the province any liability to pay the debentures, for payment of them out of the public revenue of the province could be only authorized or sanctioned, or the liability to pay, be imposed only by some vote or resolution of the legislative assembly, or by some bill originating therein being passed into an act of parliament.\nIn the accounts laid before the legislative assembly, in the session which commenced on the 28th November, 1844, and terminated on the 29th March, 1845, there appear to be two entries, the one showing that there was paid by the Governor-General's warrant, between the 1st of January and 31st of December, 1843, to John Porter to pay interest on turnpike trust debentures, the sum of \u00a31183 8s. 5d. sterling, amounting to \u00a31314 18s. 4d. currency, which, at 6 per cent. (which appears to have been the rate of interest at which all the debentures were issued) would pay one year's interest on \u00a321,915 of debentures; and the other shewing that there was paid by a like warrant, to John Porter, secretary, to pay the interest on debentures issued by the Quebec Turnpike Trust, to 1st July, 1844, the sum of $695, 3s. 2d. currency, while the entry, under \"Loans to Incorporated Companies,\" of a loan to the Quebec Turnpike Trust, remains the same in both years 1843 and 1844, namely, \u00a321,600; although, by the trustees' return of monies received and disbursed by them from the 1st January to the 22nd July, 1844, it appears that the sum of \u00a3695 3s. 4d. was paid to the trustees by the Governor-General's warrant, on the 1st July, 1844, which, with \u00a33 0s. 0d. in the hands of the trustees, enabled them to pay, and was applied by them in paying, the interest then due upon the sum of \u00a327,100, for which it appears that the trust corporation had then issued debentures, so that the amount entered under \"Loan to the trust,\" does not purport to represent in those years the amount of the principal of the debentures issued. Now, in this session, there were presented to the House, petitions of divers persons, inhabitants of the county of Quebec, praying for certain amendments in the ordinance relating to these turnpike roads, and praying that the tolls imposed might be diminished, as more beneficial to the revenue to be realized by the trust, and that the rate at which they might be commuted should be fixed by law, and a petition of the trustees praying for authority to raise a further loan of \u00a38,882, to complete the works; all of which petitions, together with the returns of the accounts and transactions of the trustees, were referred to a special committee which reported recommending, among other things, the prayer of the trustees to be granted if recommended by a message from His Excellency the Governor-General, and accordingly a bill was introduced which, adopting the several suggestions made in the report of the committee, was passed into law as 8 Vic., ch. 55. By this act, it was enacted that it should be lawful for the trustees to raise, by way of loan, for the purposes of the ordinance cited in the preamble, a further sum, not exceeding \u00ab\u00a38,882 currency, to which loan and to the debentures issued in consequence thereof, and to the advance of monies out of the provincial funds to pay the interest thereon, if need should be, and to all other matters, incident to the said loan, all the provisions of the said ordinance touching the loan thereby authorized are extended and shall apply, excepting always, that the rate of interest on the loan to be raised under the authority of this act, shall not, in any case, exceed the rate of 6 per centum per annum.\nBy the 4th section, it was enacted that if the bridge, commonly called Dorchester Bridge, should at any time thereafter be acquired by the provincial government, and placed under the control of the said trustees; the toll gate, near the entrance of the road leading to Beauport, should be removed to the end of the said bridge, and the tolls payable at such gate for the use of the road and bridge, should not be greater by more than one half than the tolls which will be payable at any other toll gate, and shall be subject to commutation, and that then the Charlesbourg Road, up to the church of the parish of Charlesbourg, shall come under the operation of the ordinance, as thereby amended, and under the care, control, and management of the said trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads. And, by the 5th section, it was enacted that the provisions of the said ordinance as thereby amended, should also immediately after the passing of the act, extend to the road leading from Champigny Hill, the said hill included, to the bridge commonly called the Red Bridge or Commissioners' Bridge.\nIt seems to be a fair construction to put upon this act that it is a legislative recognition by the province of Canada of the provisions contained in the special ordinance, and of the powers vested in the trust corporation to raise, by way of loan, upon its debentures. the sum of \u00a333,882; and an application by the legislature of United Canada of those provisions, as well as to payment of interest upon the monies secured by the debentures, as to loans to be made by the governor of Canada, for the time being to the trust Corporation, out of the consolidated revenue fund of United Canada, but only upon the like terms and conditions as are mentioned in the special ordinance in relation to the revenues of Lower Canada. In the public accounts laid before the legislature in the year 1846, is entered the sum of \u00a32,445 13s. 11d. to John Porter to pay the interest on debentures issued by the trustees of the Quebec turnpike trust, for the 18 months ended on 31st December, 1845, and in the accounts of the trust laid before the legislative assembly, in reply to an address for that purpose, this sum appears to have been applied as follows: \u00a3720 s8. 4d. to pay the interest on the 1st January, 1845, upon \u00a325,000; \u00a3760 12s. 0d. to pay the interest on the 1st July, 1845, upon \u00a327,500; and \u00a3964 13s. 7d. to pay the interest on the 1st January, 1846, upon \u00a333,850, which sum is that which is entered in the statement of loans to incorporated companies as an amount loaned to the Quebec Turnpike Trust.\nDuring this session also, several petitions were presented to, the legislative assembly, praying for amendments in the act of the preceding session, relating to the trust. The trustees also presented a petition praying for authority to borrow a further sum of \u00a312,000 for the improvement of the roads. These petitions, together with the accounts of the trustees, were referred to a special committee, which committee, among other things, reports that the committee had not yet abandoned the hope that something would be done either to acquire the Dorchester Bridge on the part of the government, or to vest the right of the crown to purchase the same in the trustees, and they suggested that, in the event of the bridge being purchased, the Charlesbourg road should be macadamized to a certain point therein mentioned. They added further that they were informed that if the trustees were authorized to borrow a sum of \u00a320,000 on the guarantee of the province, it would enable them to macadamize the several roads and portions which they have recommended to be improved, and to purchase the Dorchester Bridge from its present proprietors. \"The completion of the said roads,\" they add, \"and the additional tolls that would \"accrue from the bridge would so increase the revenue \"of the trust as to relieve the province from paying in \"future the interest on the loans already guaranteed.\" They further say, \"your committee perceive with satisfaction that the reduction of the tolls effected last year has caused no diminution in the revenue, but on the contrary has increased it, and they suggest a new schedule of tolls.\"\nThis report, having been referred to a committee of the whole house, resulted only in the adoption by the house of that part which recommended a new schedule of tolls, and a resolution was passed and agreed to by the house, \"that it is expedient to amend the act passed in the 8th year of Her Majesty's reign, intituled, &c., &c., Vic. 9, ch. 55, by repealing the schedule of tolls established by the said act, and by substituting the following,\" &c., &c., and leave was given to bring in a bill in conformity with the resolution which was accordingly brought in, and was passed into law as 9 Vic., ch. 68.\nIn the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly, in the session held in the year 1847, there is the entry of a payment to John Porter, secretary, to pay interest on debentures issued by the Quebec turnpike trust, in the year ended 31st December, 1846, of the sum of \u00a32,031 currency, which it will be seen is jus the interest at 6 per cent upon a principal of \u00a333 850 which is the amount entered in the statement of \"Loan to incorporated Companies,\" as loaned to the Trust.\nDuring this session, also, petitions relating to the trust were presented to the legislative assembly, one praying for an enquiry into the conduct of the trustee [Illegible Text] another praying that the Dorchester bridge should be placed under the control of the trustees, another praying that the L'Ormi\u00e8re road might be macadamized, and another praying for a grant to extend the improvements of the Cove road, and to macadamize the route de l'Eglise.\nIn reply to an address for copies of correspondence between the executive government and the trustees of the Quebec turnpike trust, such correspondence was laid before the house, and together with the above petitions was referred to a special committee, which, six days before the house was prorogued, presented their report, wherein among other things, they express regret \"that the government had not thought proper to recommend during the present session, a vote of public credit for the purpose of completing the roads in the neighbourhood of Quebec, and they regret still more that the government had not thought proper to recommend the purchase of Dorchester bridge, with the view of placing it under the control of the Quebec turnpike trustees, according to the recommendation several times made by different committees of your honorable house.\" In the short session of 1848, which commenced on the 25th February, and terminated on the 23rd March, there is nothing which throws any light upon the acts or conduct, either of the executive government or of the legislature in any respect bearing upon the trust. The government, in that session, obtained a vote of credit which may or may not have provided for the interest accruing upon these debentures, but the journals or appendices throw no light upon the subject.\nIn the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly in the session held in the year 1849, there appear two entries of monies said to have been paid to John Porter, secretary, to pay the interest on debentures issued by the Quebec turnpike trust, the one of \u00a32,033 8s. 10d. currency for the year ending 31st December, 1847, and the other of \u00a32032 lbs. 4d., for the interest accrued in the year 1848. And under the head of \"loans to incorporated companies,\" in both years is the entry \u00a333,850 as a loan to the trust, whereas the interest paid in those years represents a capital a little in excess of the \u00a333,882 which was the utmost amount the trust corporation was authorized to borrow.\nDuring this session, also, several petitions were presented in relation to the trust; one praying that the trustees might be authorized to borrow a sum of money for the improvement of the Beauport road; another, that certain roads in the parish of St. Foye be put under the control of the trustees and that they be empowered to raise funds in the usual way to complete and keep the road in repair; another praying a grant of money to improve certain roads therein mentioned under the direction of the trustees; another praying that the road leading from the church of Charlesbourg to Dorchester bridge be placed under the control of the trustees and that aid be granted for macadamizing the same; and another praying that Dorchester bridge should be placed under the control of the trustees.\nOn the 21st May the house resolved itself into committee on the subject of the Dorchester bridge and the roads in the vicinity of Quebec. The committee reported several resolutions, which were agreed to by the house as follows:\u2014\n\"1. Resolved that it is expedient to authorize and enable the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads to acquire and assume the possession and property of the bridge called Dorchester bridge over the river St. Charles near the city of Quebec.\n\"2. Resolved that it is expedient to extend the provisions of the ordinance (passed in the 4th year of Her Majesty's reign, entituled 'an ordinance to provide for the improvement of certain roads in the neighborhood of, and leading to the city of Quebec, and to raise a fund for that purpose,) to the said bridge as well as to certain roads and parts of roads in the vicinity of Quebec;' and\n\"3. Resolved that for the above purposes it is expedient to authorize the said trustees to raise a further loan not exceeding \u00a325,000 currency on the security of the tolls and other monies which might come into their hands, and to give a preference or priority of lien on the said tolls and monies to the interest on the said loan over the interest on all loans already authorized to be raised by the said trustees, as well as over the claims of Her Majesty's government for repayment of advances made by the Receiver General out of the provincial revenues.\"\nThe house having agreed to these resolutions gave leave to the Solicitor General to bring in a, bill to give effect to them, which was accordingly brought in and passed into law, as 12 Vic., ch. 115, whereby the 4 section of 8 Vic., ch. 55, was repealed, and it was enacted that it should be lawful for the trustees to raise, by way of loan for the purposes of the Act, a sum not exceeding \u00a325,000 currency, to which loan and to the debentures to be issued in consequence thereof, and to all other matters incident to the said loan, all the provisions of the, ordinance 4 Vic., ch. 11, touching the loan thereby, authorized, were extended and should apply, excepting always that the rate of interest on the loan to be raised under the Act, should not in any case exceed the rate of six per centum per annum, and \"that no money shall be advanced out of the provincial funds to pay such interest; and all debentures issued under this Act shall, so far as regards the interest payable thereon, take precedence and have priority of lien on the tolls and other monies, which may come into the possession and be at the disposal of the trustees, over the interest payable on the debentures granted or to be granted by the said trustees for any loan already authorized by law, as well as over all claims for repayment of any sums of money advanced or to be advanced to the said trustees by the Receiver General of the province.\" By the second section the trustees were required, as soon as possible after the passing of the Act, to purchase the bridge; and by the 5 section the several roads for which upon different occasions petitions were presented, praying that they might be placed under the control and management of the trustees, were placed under such their control. Now, when the legislature not only declined to adopt the recommendation of the special committee, to grant a sum out of the provincial funds to complete the roads, or to authorize a loan to be effected by the corporation upon the guarantee of the province, or to purchase the Dorchester bridge, but repealed the 4th section of the 8 Vic., ch. 55, which pointed to and provided for the contingency of the province purchasing the bridge and in lieu of the province purchasing it, authorized the trust corporation to raise a further sum of \u00a325,000 upon security of their debentures, for the purpose, among other purposes, of purchasing it, and required them to purchase it and to take control of it under the provisions of the special ordinances, which were re-enacted for the purpose, it seems to me to be very clear that the legislature never contemplated that the bridge, when purchased, should be regarded as provincial property. The provision as to the Governor, for the time being, in his discretion authorizing an advance of monies out of the provincial revenues to pay the interest upon the debentures had been the sole cause and excuse for the government having paid such interest out of the consolidated fund throughout, from the issue of the debentures; and the manner in which, as we have seen from the public accounts, annually laid before the Legislative Assembly, that body dealt with those payments adopting them, as I think we must hold that they did every year upon the occasion of the vote being annually taken for the supply of the civil governments, based upon those accounts, may well be considered to have given to the holders of those debentures a strong moral, if not legal claim to have the interest continued to be so paid to them, and when we find the legislature assuming to give to the newly authorized issue of debentures a preference upon the trust funds, in so far as interest upon those debentures is concerned, over the firstly authorized issue, it may well be held that the legislature gave this preference because they had assumed, or were assuming, the payment of interest upon the first issue, if the trust fund should be insufficient for both; and when in addition to this preference so given to the newly authorized issue, we find the act expressly enacting that no money shall be advanced out of the provincial funds to pay interest upon those debentures, I can come to no other conclusion than that the object of this enactment was to prevent the possibility of any claim upon the province being ever made in respect of the newly authoized issue and to remove the sole foundation for such a claim being made. From this time forth I think it may without impropriety be said (at any rate it may be granted without prejudice to the argument urged before us in this case upon behalf of the Dominion Government) that the holders of the previous issue of debentures to the amount of \u00a333,882 had from this time forth a right to regard the Province of United Canada as guarantors of the payment of the interest upon that amount of debentures, although they had no such nor any claim as yet upon the province for the payment of the principal secured by the debentures, and although, for all payments of such interest then already or thereafter to be made out of the consolidated fund, the province should be creditors of the trust corporation for the amount of such advances. It was, however, enacted by an act passed in the same session, viz: 12 Vic., chap. 5, that it should be lawful for the Governor, by and with the advice of the executive council of the province from time to time, and as the interests of the public service might require, to redeem or to purchase, on account of the province all or any of the then outstanding debentures constituting the public debt of the province of Canada, or of either of the late provinces of Lower or Upper Canada, or all or any of the debentures issued by Commissioners or other public officers under the authority of the legislatures of either of the late provinces of Upper or Lower Canada, or of the legislature of Canada, the principal or interest of which debentures is made a charge on the consolidated revenue fund of this province, and to issue new debentures to an amount not exceeding that of the debentures so redeemed or purchased.\nNow, if the true construction of this act was that it authorized the redemption or purchase on account of the province of the debentures for the \u00a333,882 issued by the Quebec Turnpike Road Trust Corporation, it can only be so upon the ground that the payment of the interest upon those debentures was, or was deemed by the legislature, to be charged upon the consolidated revenue: The past accrued interest had been, as we have seen, in fact, paid annually out of the consolidated fund, and in the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly, as the basis upon which the annual votes of supply were granted, such payments were charged to that fund. This fact, together with the preference given by 12 Vic., ch. 115, in respect of the interest upon the debentures by that act authorized, as well over the interest accruing upon the previously issued debentures, as \"over all claims for repayment of any sums of money advanced or to be advanced to the trustees by the Receiver-General of this province,'' as provided by the last recited act, afforded, as 1 have said, just ground for the holders of the \u00a333,882 debentures, asserting a claim to have all future interest accruing upon those debentures paid, in like manner as the past interest had been, out of the consolidated fund; but whether a strict legal construction of the act if construed by a judicial tribunal before the redemption or purchase by the government of any of those debentures would or not have justified the adjudication that those debentures did properly come within the description of debentures \"the interest of which was made a charge on the consolidated revenue fund\" so as to bring them within the authority by the 12 Vic., ch. 5, conferred upon the government to redeem or purchase them on account of the province, it is not now necessary to enquire; for, certain it is, as I have said, it could only be by reason of the interest having been so charged that the decision could be upheld, there having been no act whatever purporting to have charged, nor before the passing of 12 Vic., ch. 5, purporting to charge upon the province, or its consolidated fund, any liability whatever\u2014or, indeed, purporting to confer any permission or power upon the provincial authorities\u2014to redeem or pay the principal of any of these debentures. But for this act the holders of those debentures would have had no claim whatever upon or against the province for payment of the principal of them which a court of justice could recognize, and it was solely upon the authority of this act, as we shall see, that those debentures were subsequently paid by, or purchased on account of, the province. It was suggested that there was the same liability to pay those debentures as there was to pay those issued in Upper Canada, for what were called \"The York or Home District Roads.\" It is, I think, very possible that the liability which did rest upon the province of Canada to pay those debentures may have operated, as a motive and reason, for the legislature of Canada affirming, authorizing or assuming the payment of the Quebec Trust debentures; but, from their issue, the York Roads debentures stood upon quite a different footing. The acts which authorized their issue were acts of the legislature of the province of Upper Canada, passed before the union of Lower and Upper Canada, viz: 1 Wm. IV, ch. 16; 3 Wm. IV, ch. 37; 6 Wm. IV, ch. 30, and 7 Wm. IV, ch. 76. The debentures issued under the authority of those acts were, and were always considered to be, provincial debentures, issued and signed by the Receiver-General, like all other provincial debentures, and the loans obtained upon them were received by the Receiver-General, accounted for and handed by him to the trustees or commissioners entrusted with the duty of expending them on the roads. The tolls imposed by the acts, when received by the trustees or commissioners, were required to be paid over by them to the Receiver-General, by whom the interest upon the debentures was paid. So that, notwithstanding that those debentures, as the Quebec Trust debentures, were charged specially upon the tolls imposed, it is clear that in form and character they were essentially provincial debentures, constituting part of the debt and obligations of the province of Upper Canada existing at the union, and so quite different from the Quebec Trust debentures which, as I have shewn, were not provincial debentures and did not constitute part of the public debt of Lower Canada existing at the union; accordingly, among the public accounts-laid before the legislative assembly of Canada, in the year 1842, in a paper intituled \"A schedule of government debentures redeemed and outstanding, issued under the authority of acts of the provincial legislature of that part of the province of Canada, heretofore Upper Canada,\" all debentures which had then been issued upon the authority of the above Acts of Upper Canada, are entered. These debentures were also, it is true, redeemed under the authority of 12 Vic., ch. 5, but it is plain that this Act authorized their payment, under the authority given in the Act to-redeem, &c., \"any of the then outstanding debentures constituting the public debt of either of the late provinces of Lower or Upper Canada\" these debentures constituting part of the public debt of Upper Canada, whereas, as I have shewn already, the Quebec trust debentures never constituted part of the debt of the then late province of Lower Canada.\nBy the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly in the session held in 1850, there appears to have been paid out of the consolidated fund, in payment of interest upon the trust corporations debentures, for the year 1859, the sum of \u00a32,032 18s. 4d, in two equal sums, being each for a half year's interest upon the principal sum of \u00a333,882, but in the statement of the affairs of the province under the head of \"loans to incorporated companies\" there is no longer the entry of this or of any sum as a loan to the Quebec turnpike trust.\nDuring this session a petition was presented praying for the passing of an Act to authorize the trustees to continue the Charlesbourg road towards St. Pierre, for seven miles, which was referred to a special committee with power to report by bill. An address from the legislative assembly was also presented to His Excellency, praying that he would be pleased to lay before the house copies of all accounts made and rendered by the trustees, for the years 1848-9, and also copies of all documents and correspondence between the executive and the trustees, upon the subject of the management of the roads, and copies of the proceedings of the trustees and of their correspondence with the proprietors of Dorchester bridge, on the subject of the purchase of the said bridge, in conformity with the Act of the last session of parliament for that purpose. By the papers laid before the house in reply to this address, it appeared that in the month of July, 1849, application had been made to the trust corporation by the holders of some of the debentures for the \u00a333,882, all of which were then overdue, for payment of the debentures, and that the trustees, being unable to redeem them, had applied to the executive government for permission under the provisions of the ordinance to effect a loan at a rate of interest not exceeding 8 per cent. to redeem \u00a32,500 of debentures, the holders of which were very urgent for repayment of their principal, and that His Excellency had declined to give the requested permission; that thereupon the holders of those debentures in December, 1849, petitioned His Excellency to the like effect, and setting forth that they had advanced their money in the purchase of the debentures, relying upon the provisions of the 28th section of the ordinance, which section authorized the trustees, with the approval of the Governor, to raise money by a loan to redeem the debentures fallen due. To this petition His Excellency replied, through the provincial secretary, informing the petitioners that he was advised not to consent to the application which had been made by the trustees and that His Excellency saw no reason to depart from the decision then arrived at, \"as the government does not consider itself pledged to the redemption of the bonds but only to the payment of the interest accruing thereon.\" To this the holders of the debentures replied by a further petition wherein they state that from the terms of the above answer to their former petition, they are persuaded a misapprehension still exists, both with regard to the original application from the trustees and to the prayer of the petitioners, whose object was merely that a loan should be sanctioned at a rate not exceeding 8 per cent. to enable the trustees to pay the overdue debentures, and repeating that they had invested their capital in the debentures upon the faith that they would either be paid at maturity, or that the special powers conferred upon His Excellency by the 28th section of the ordinance to authorize the trustees to borrow money, would be exercised, they again prayed that His Excellency would be pleased to approve of the trustees effecting a loan at a higher rate of interest than 6 per cent., as the petitioners would be likely to remain a long time without a return of their capital unless the trustees should be so authorized, and they urged as a reason in support of the prayer of their petition that the tolls and the commutation thereof on the roads might be fully adequate to the payment of interest even at a higher rate than 6 per cent. although the capital represented by the debentures might not be paid for years out of the proceeds of such tolls.\nTo this petition His Excellency, in like manner, replied through the provincial secretary, that he saw no sufficient reason in the allegations of the petitioners to induce him to depart from his former decision on the subject.\nI have drawn attention to these documents so laid before the legislature, for the purpose of showing that the opinion I have expressed as to the legal position of the executive government, with respect to the debentures, namely, that they were not liable at all for the principal, although, under the circumstances already above detailed, they then were, as the government was ready to admit, responsible for the payment of the interest accruing upon them, was not only the opinion which the executive government then entertained, but that this opinion was concurred in by the holders of the debentures, all of which were then overdue, and for the purpose of drawing attention to the fact that the legislative assembly with those documents before them and with the knowledge of the position in which the executive government claimed to be in respect of the debentures, passed a Bill which became an Act, viz, 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 102, wherein, after reciting that the Act 12 Vic., ch. 115, had not obtained the object the legislature had in view in passing it, which was the speedy purchase of the Dorchester bridge and the speedy completion of the roads mentioned in that Act, it was enacted that if, at the expiration of two months, the trustees should not have purchased the bridge they should immediately proceed with the construction of a new one, and that they should set apart the sum of \u00a310,000 out of the \u00a325,000 they were authorized to borrow by 12 Vic., ch. 115, for the above-purpose, and appropriate the residue towards the improvements of the other roads by that Act placed under their control, thereby compelling the trustees to effect the loan contemplated, upon debentures to be issued under the authority of an Act which, in express terms enacted that no money should be advanced out of provincial funds even for the payment of interest upon the debentures so to be issued. This confirms the opinion I have already expressed that the object of the legislature in that enactment was thereby to remove all possible foundation for any claim being, ever made against the province, in respect of those debentures, as to the interest as well as to the principal. In the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly in 1851 we find the entry of two payments to the trust corporation out of the consolidated fund, the one of \u00a31,016 9s. 9d. to pay interest upon \u00a333,882 debentures for the six months ending June 30th. 1850, and the other for \u00a3848 15s. 2d. to pay interest on \u00a328,292 of debentures, for the 6 months ending 31st December, 1850. and in this year and from this year forward under the head of \"Loans to Incorporated Companies,\" there is no longer the entry of any sum as loaned to the trust corporation. By a return made to an address of the house of assembly praying that His Excellency would cause to be laid before the house a debtor and creditor account, between the provincial government and the trust, from the commencement and the amount of debentures held, and of the interest paid and received by the government from year to year, on account of the trust, it appeared that from 1841 to 1850 inclusive, the government had paid for interest upon the debentures issued by the trust, in all \u00a316,009 6s. 3d on account of which they had received nothing, but were entered as creditors of the trust for that amount. It also appeared that the trustees were in receipt of an annual income from tolls exceeding \u00a33,000, their receipts from that source for the year 1850 being \u00a33,370 13s. 4d., an amount sufficient to pay interest at 6 per cent. upon \u00a350,000. Possessed of this information the legislative assembly passed two bills, which became Acts 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132 and 133, the former to authorize the trust to effect a new loan and to extend the provisions of the Quebec turnpike road ordinance to certain other roads, and the other to authorize the trustees to issue debentures to a limited amount, for the purpose of buying and rebuilding the Montmorency bridge. By the former it was enacted that it should be lawful for the trustees to raise by way of loan a sum not exceeding \u00a315,000 currency, and that such loan and the debentures which should be issued in conformity with the provisions of the act, and all other matters relating to the said loan should be subject to the provisions of the ordinance (4 Vic., ch. 17,) relative to the loan authorized under the said ordinance; Provided, nevertheless, that the rate of interest to be allowed, under the authority of the act, should in no case exceed the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and that no money should be advanced out of the provincial funds for the purpose of paying the said interest, and that all debentures issued under the authority of the act, so far as regards the interest payable thereon, should take precedence and have priority of lien on the tolls and other monies which might come into the possession and be at the disposal of the trustees over the interest payable on all debentures which should have been issued upon the guarantee of the province, or which should thereafter be issued by the said trustees upon the guarantee of the province, as well as over all claims for repayment of any sums of money advanced, or to be advanced, to the said trustees by the Receiver-General of the province. Now, it will be observed, that up to this, the frame and phraseology of the act is almost identical with the frame and phraseology of 12 Vic., ch 115, the only difference at all, in fact, being in the manner of describing the debentures over which the newly authorized debentures were to have precedence as to interest, for that the same debentures were referred to by both acts may be admitted, instead of the words used in 12 Vic., ch. 115, namely \"over the interest payable on all debentures granted, or to be granted by the said trustees, for any loan authorized by law\" are used, the words \"over the interest payable on all debentures which shall have been issued upon the guarantee of the province, or which shall hereafter be issued by the said trustees upon the guarantee of the province.\" I cannot see, I must say, that anything was gained by this difference in expression, for it is plain that it leaves open the question whether there were then any, and if any, what debentures issued upon the guarantee of the province, and what was the extent of such guarantee, if any? I have already shown that although neither the terms of the ordinance 4 Vic., ch 17. nor of 4 and 5 Vic., ch. 72, nor of 8 Vic., ch. 55, had made the province liable as guarantors or otherwise, either for interest or principal, upon the debentures which had been issued, yet that the regular payment annually out of the consolidated fund of the interest upon the \u00a333,882 debentures, statements of which were annually laid before the legislature in the public accounts, upon the vote of supply being taken, together with the action of the legislature in 12 Vic., ch. 115, postponing the payment out of the trust funds of interest upon those debentures to the debentures authorized by 12 Vic., ch. 115, might from that time forth justify the expression that in so far as interest upon the first issued debentures was concerned it was assumed or guaranteed by the province, but that there was nothing to warrant a contention that the payment of the principal of those debentures was assumed or guaranteed by the province. It may therefore be admitted that in this sense the reference in 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132 to those debentures as issued upon the guarantee of the province, such guarantee being limited to the interest upon them, is not in appropriate; but it is really of little importance whether the expression \"issued upon the guarantee of the province, was, or not, appropriate as applicable to any of th debentures previously issued, for the question with which we have to deal is, whether or not debentures issued in virtue of and under the authority of an act subsequently passed, viz., 16 Vic., ch. 235, were issued upon the guarantee of the province to any, and if any, to what extent, and that is a question which must be answered irrespective of any propriety or impropriety in the expression used in 14 and 15 Vic., chs. 132 and 133 as applicable to the previously issued debentures. Now, the 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132, having provided for the precedence which the debentures to be issued under that act should have, as to interest, over all debentures having the guarantee of the province, said nothing as to the rank, order and precedence, either as to interest or principal, between the debentures to be issued under 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132 and those issued or to be issued under 12 Vic., ch. 115, which latter had not the guarantee of the province, therefore ex magn\u00e2 cautela the above clause of 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 132 proceeds to enact, \"and the debentures, issued under this act shall, as regards both the payment of interest and the principal thereof, rank after those issued under the authority of the act last above cited, passed in the 12th year of Her Majesty's reign,\" viz., 12 Vic., ch. 115. This latter sentence does not in any manner affect or relate to the debentures for the \u00a333,882, whether they are properly or improperly referred to in the act as debentures issued upon the guarantee of, the province, and the result is that these debentures as regards the liability of the province to have redeemed them, remained precisely in the same condition as they were prior to the passing of the 12 Vic., ch. 5. The like observations may be applied to 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 133, but with greater force, for the frame and phraseology of that act are totally different from the frame and phraseology of ch. 132, inasmuch as in ch. 133 no reference is made to those provisions of the ordinance which relate to the power of borrowing money on debentures, as there is in ch. 132. By the ch. 133 the trustees are authorized to purhase the Montmorency bridge and to rebuild it, and for that purpose to borrow a sum not exceeding \u00a35,000, at a rate not exceeding six per cent. per annum. Then when they shall have purchased the bridge they are invested with all the rights and privileges vested in the properties thereof, by. virtue of 52 Geo. 3, ch. 17. Then it is provided that the revenue arising from the bridge shall be applied exclusively to the improvement and gradual completion of the high road of the Cot\u00e9 de Beaupr\u00e9, and the only reference to the terms of the ordinance is to place the bridge and the above road when completed under the control of the trustees, subject to the provisions of the ordinance, which plainly means subject to those provisions as to control and management, but in so far as the trustees have any power to borrow under this act, a step necessarily to be taken before acquiring and completing the bridge and road, the provisions of the ordinance are not mentioned, but the act simply authorizes the trustees to borrow a sum of money not exceeding \u00a35,000, to purchase the bridge; it then enacts, as did ch. 132, that the interest of the monies to be borrowed under the act should be privileged over the interest on the debentures issued or to be issued by the trustees with the guarantee of the Province, and should, as regards the interest on those debentures lastly mentioned have priority of lien on the tolls and other monies then in or thereafter to come into the hands of the said trustees, but should rank after the debentures issued or to be issued under 12th Vic., ch. 115.\nNo reference being made in this act to the terms, expressions and provisions of the ordinance, 4 Vic., ch. 17, relating to borrowing, it seems to have been certainly prudent, if not necessary, that some provision should have been made in order to avoid any question arising as to whether the province could be made liable for those debentures, a question not unlikely to have been raised without such provision, as appears by the question raised here; accordingly we find that such provision was made, for it is added in the section here in recital that: \"Neither the principal nor interest on the debentures to be issued under this act shall be guaranteed by the provinces, or be payable out of any provincial funds,\" thus providing, (as appears to me to have been the deliberate determination of the legislature in despite of the recommendation of several special committees) to take special care in every act authorizing the trustees to effect a loan passed subsequently to 8 Vic., chap. 55, that there should be no liability whatever imposed upon the province, nor any pretence or excuse afforded for setting up any claim asserting any such liability, for the payment of the loans which the trust corporation was by such acts authorized to effect; and it is in my judgment impossible to argue (from the fact of the province by this act, chap 133, being exempted from all liability as to principal as well as to interest) that the province is liable for principal, although not for interest, under chap. 132, because in that act so, differently framed, the word principal is not inserted. I have already shewn, 1 think, how unnecessary it was to insert it in an act framed as chap. 132 is. It is to my mind quite an inconclusive argument, because the word principal is inserted in one act and not in another, that for this reason the province is liable for the principal of the debentures issued under the one act and not under the other.\nIn the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly in the year 1852, there appears to have been paid out of the consolidated fund, to the trustees, the sum of \u00a31697. 10s. 4d., to pay twelve months' interest upon \u00a328,292, of debentures issued by the trust corporation for the year 1851, and the sum of \u00a3656. 15s. 2d., to pay interest which accrued due 1st July, 1852. In this year a statement is introduced with the public accounts, intituled a \"Statement of debentures redeemed under the authority of 12 Vic., chap. 5, to 31st January, 1853,\" wherein there is stated to have been redeemed, of the Quebec Road Trust debentures, in 1850, the sum of \u00a35,590; in 1851, the sum of \u00a36,100; in 1852, the sum of \u00a3100, making in all to the 31st January, 1853, the sum of \u00a311,790.\nDuring this session several petitions were presented, praying that divers other roads might be placed under the control of the trustees. The House resolved itself into committee to take into consideration the expediency of authorizing the trustees to effect a new preferential loan and by extending the roads to be placed under their control; the committee reported six resolutions, the first three of which enumerated several roads situate upon the north side of the River St. Lawrence, which the committee recommended should be placed under the control of the trustees, and as to these roads it was in the 4th resolution resolved\u2014\"That in order to provide for the improvements mentioned in the preceding resolutions, and also to complete those mentioned in the act passed in the last session of parliament, 14 and 15 Vic., chap.132, the said trustees be authorized to borrow a sum not exceeding \u00a330,000 currency, and that the loan effected for that purpose be subject to the provisions contained in the ordinances and statutes now in force in that behalf; the rate of interest on which loan shall in no case exceed six per cent. per annum; and that it is expedient, that, while it shall not be lawful to advance any monies out of the funds of the province to pay the interest of the said loan, all debentures issued for the purposes hereinbefore mentioned, shall, as regards the interest payable thereon, entitle the holders thereof, to a priority of privilege on the tolls and other monies which shall come into the hands and be at the disposal of the said trustees, in preference to the interest payable on all debentures which have been issued by the said trustees with the provincial guarantee as well as in preference to any claims for the re-imbursement of any sums advanced or to be advanced to the said trustees by the Receiver General of this province; and that the said debentures so issued as aforesaid shall take order and precedence in respect to the repayment thereof, both principal and interest, after those issued under the guarantee of the Province by virtue of acts passed in previous sessions of parliament and now in force.\"\nThe 5th resolution recommended that certain roads situate on the south side of the river should be placed under the control of the trustees, and as to these, it was in the 6th resolution resolved\u2014\"That in order to provide for the improvements mentioned in the foregoing resolution, the said trustees be authorized to borrow a sum not exceeding \u00a340,000 currency, and that such loan be subject, etc., etc., etc., etc., using the same words as in the 4th resolution to the end. These resolutions were agreed to by the House and leave was given to introduce a bill founded upon them which was accordingly introduced and passed into an act as 16 Vic., ch. 235, by the 7th section of which it was enacted that in order to the making and completion of the several roads described and mentioned in the act passed during the last session of the provincial parliament, chap. 132, and also to the improving and macadamizing of the roads hereinbefore mentioned, and the making of the various improvements hereinabove mentioned (i. e. the improvements mentioned in the first three of the above resolutions of the house), it should be lawful for the said turnpike road trustees to raise, by loan, a sum not exceeding \u00a330,000 currency, and that this loan and the debentures which should be issued to effect the same, and all other matters haying reference to said loan, should be subject to the provisions of the ordinance above cited (4 Vic., chap. 17), with respect to the loan authorized under it, \"provided, nevertheless, that the rate of interest to be taken under this act shall, in no case, exceed the rate of 6 per centum per annum, and no monies shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest,\" (that is the interest accruing under this act) \"and all the debentures which shall be issued under, this act, so far as relates to the interest payable thereupon, shall have a privilege of priority of lien upon the tolls and other monies which shall come into the possession and shall be at the disposal of the said trustees, in preference to the interest payable on all debentures which shall have been issued by the said trustees under the provincial guarantee, and also to all other claims for the reimbursement of any sums of money advanced, or to be advanced to the said trustees by the Receiver-General of this province, and the said debentures, as respects the payment of the principal and interest thereof, shall rank after those issued under the act passed during the last session of the parliament of the province and hereinbefore cited (viz.: 14 and 15 Vic., chap. 132);\" and by the tenth section it was enacted that \"for the completion of the roads, bridges and improvements mentioned in the two next preceding sections\u2014being the roads on the south side of the St. Lawrence \u2014it shall be lawful for the said trustees to issue debentures to the amount of \u00a340,000 currency, which debentures shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance hereinbefore cited, shall take precedence of those issued under the provincial guarantee and of the claim by the government to be paid out of the revenues of the toll-gates and shall take order and precedence, and rank concurrently with those to be issued under the 7th section of this act.\"\nIt will be observed that there is a difference between the provisions of the 7th and the 10th sections of the act and the provisions of the corresponding resolutions of the house, to give effect to which the act was introduced. By the resolutions it was provided that all the debentures to be issued under the authority of the act were to have precedence, as to the payment of interest, over all debentures which had been issued with the provincial guarantee, that is to say, assuming the \u00a333,882 debentures to be those referred to under this description, the debentures to be issued under the 16 Vic., ch. 235, were, as to interest, to have precedence upon the trust funds over the debentures already issued for \u00a333,882; but as to repayment of the principal, the debentures to be issued under 16 Vic., were to take a rank and order \"after those issued under the guarantee of the province, by virtue of acts passed in previous sessions of parliament, and now in force,\" that is to say, after the \u00a333,882 debentures or such of them as had not been already paid under 12 Vic., ch. 5, whereas under the provisions of the act, ail the debentures to be issued under it were to have rank and precedence over all debentures then already, or which thereafter, if any should thereafter be, issued upon the guarantee of the province. That plainly means, the guarantee as to interest, but as to repayment of principal, those to be issued under 16 Vic., chap, 235, were to rank after those which had already been issued under 14 and 15 Vic., chap. 132, which by that act were declared to rank next after those issued under 12 Vic., chap. 115. Taking, however, the expressions contained in the act as passed as what are to govern, there is, I think, no doubt (and in this I concur with the learned judge before whom this case was tried in the Court of Exchequer) that notwithstanding the form of expression used in the 10th sec. all the debentures authorized to be issued by the act, whether for the improvement referred to in the 7th sec. or those referred to in the 10th sec, are alike subject to the provisions of the 7th sec, that \"no monies shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of interest thereon.\" It is quite clear from the 10th sec that the intention of the legislature was that all debentures to be issued under the act, whether for the purposes of the 7th or of the 10th sec, should rank alike, those mentioned in the 10th sec. concurrently with those mentioned in the 7th, both as to principal and interest, and that both alike should have precedence over the debentures referred to as having the provincial guarantee,\u2014then if the debentures for the \u00a333,882 (these being the only debentures to which it is suggested the above description then could apply) should be taken out of the way, by being paid, if they should be paid by the provincial government, until there should be another tissue of debentures, if ever there should be, which should have the guarantee of the province as to interest, the provision in respect of precedence over such class of debentures would become nugatory, and to authorize such further issue there would need have to be another act of parliament: the only construction which, as it appears to me, can be given to the words \"or which shall hereafter be issued by the said trustees under the provincial guarantee\" in this and all previous acts having the same expression, is that the legislature treating the \u00a333,882 debentures as having the provincial guarantee as to interest only, (as we have seen the government to have admitted in reply to the petition of the bond-holders, who prayed that the trustees might be authorized to raise a loan under the provisions of the 28th section of the ordinance, 4 Vic., chap. 17, to redeem the overdue debentures,) had in view the possibility of a loan being authorized and effected under the provisions of that section. It is, however, obvious that the act 16 Vic. draws a plain contrast between two distinct classes of debentures, namely, those which had already been, or which thereafter should be, if any should be, issued upon the guarantee of the province, and the debentures to be issued under 16 Vic., ch. 235. \u00c0 contrast is drawn between these two classes as distinct and diverse, and precedence is given to the one over the other; the same precedence is given to those to be issued for the purposes of the 10th section as to those for the purposes of the 7th section; they rank the one concurrently with the other; they must, then, both belong to the same class, and being contrasted with, and given precedence over, the class designated as being under the provincial guarantee, how can any debenture belonging to a class having precedence over another ever be held to belong to the class over which it has the precedence? The act says that all debentures to be issued by the trust corporation under the authority of this act, 16 Vic., ch. 235, shall have precedence of another class of debentures issued by the same corporation, namely, debentures having the guarantee of the province. Why shall such precedence be given? What is the rationale of its being given? No answer can be given to these questions, but that the reason is because those to be issued under 16 Vic. have not the guarantee of the province. Therefore it is that they, having only the trust funds of the corporation to look to, have not had that fund diminished by being applied to a different class of debentures which have another fund to look to than the guarantee of the province. The act 16 Vic., ch. 235, in the plainest terms, as it seems to me, pronounces the debentures to be issued under its authority to be debentures not having the guarantee of the province. If, then, any one of the debentures issued under its authority can be said to belong to a class of debentures having the provincial guarantee, it must be by reason of something outside of the act 16 Vic., authorizing their issue equally, as the fact of the provincial guarantee having become attached to the debentures for \u00a333,882, was to be found, not in the terms and provisions of the acts which authorized their issue, but in proceedings and dealings outside of those acts. In the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly in the session held in 1854-5, there was presented to the assembly \"a statement of debentures redeemed under the authority of 12 Vic., ch. 5, to 31st January, 1855,\" wherein, besides the debentures of the Quebec turnpike trust already mentioned as having been redeemed prior to the 31st December, 1852. there is the entry of \u00a322,092 more of such debentures, redeemed in the year 1853, making, with the \u00a311,790 previously redeemed, the whole principal of \u00a333,882 debentures, which sum is thenceforth entered as charged on the consolidated funds. As it is not pretended that the government ever paid any part of the interest accruing on debentures issued under. 16 Vic., ch. 235, and as therefore there could be no such returns in the public accounts laid before the legislative assembly in respect of those debentures, as there were in relation to the debentures for \u00a333,882, it becomes unnecessary to make any further reference to the journals and appendices of the legislative assembly. The question, therefore, is to be determined upon the construction of 16 Vic., ch. 235, as if prior to the issues of any debentures under it the question had arisen whether the province would be liable by the terms of the act for the payment either of interest or principal of the debentures, if issued. I have already, I think, shown that if the construction of the ordinance had come up for adjudication immediately after the passing of 4 and 5 Vic., ch. 72, and before the issue of any of the first class of debentures, and the question had been whether the terms of the ordinance had imposed a charge or liability upon the province for the payment of interest or the principal of the debentures there authorized to be issued, the answer must have been in the negative. I think I have also shown that it was the fact of the payment of the interest by the Governor-General which was permitted but not made compulsory by the provisions of the ordinance, and the dealings of the legislature, upon such payments being annually shown in the public accounts, which in progress of time caused the payments of interest on those debentures to be recognized as a charge upon the consolidated fund. I have shown, also, that as regards payment of principal, the terms of the ordinance did not only not impose any charge or liability upon the province, but that they did not authorize or permit the appropriation of any part of the provincial funds towards payment of principal. If, then, the terms of the ordinance had been adopted verbatim et literatim by the act 16 Vic., without the prohibition as to the application of any provincial funds towards the payment of interest, there would have been no charge or liability whatever imposed upon the province in respect of the principal of the debentures to be issued under 16 Vic., ch. 235; neither would any such charge or liability have been imposed upon the province in respect of interest on those debentures. There would only have been conferred a permission or power upon the Governor-General, which, in his discretion, he might have exercised or refused to exercise, as seemed to him best. Now, as the terms and provisions of the ordinance are adopted by the act 16 Vic., subject only to the qualification that no monies shall be advanced out of provincial funds for the payment of interest, the permission and power vested in the Governor-General to pay, in his discretion, such interest out of provincial funds is taken away; so that the effect simply is that whereas it was permissible and lawful for the Governor in his discretion, but not compulsory upon him, to pay the interest upon debentures issued under the provisions of the ordinance, it is not now permissible or lawful for the Governor, much less compulsory upon him to pay or authorize payment of interest upon debentures, issued under 16 Vic.; and as by the provisions of the ordinance it was not permissible or lawful for the Governor to pay or to authorize payment of the principal out of the provincial funds, much less was there a charge imposed upon those funds for such payment, so neither can payment of the principal of the debentures issued under 16 Vic., ch. 235, be a charge imposed upon provincial funds; nor is such payment out of such funds permissible or lawful, by the terms simply of the act. Therefore, such charge to be imposed at all must be imposed by some other act, in like manner as the charge and liability to pay the principal of the other debentures for \u00a333,882 out of provincial funds became imposed only, if at all, by 12 Vic., ch. 5.\nThere is only one act more to which there appears to be any occasion to refer, and that act confirms rather than shakes my view of the construction of 16 Vic., ch. 285; it is 20 Vic. ch. 125; the act which divides the old Quebec trust corporation into two corporations, the one for the north shore and the other for the south shore of the St. Lawrence. That act puts an end to all doubt which may have before existed by reason of the language of the ordinance upon the question whether the property of the trust was vested in Her Majesty or in the corporation, and vests it in the corporations carved out of the old one, if it was not already vested in the old one: and the act seems to be declaratory that it was; for in the 4th section it provides that all property, moveable or immoveable vested in the Quebec turnpike road trustees and being on the north shore of the river St. Lawrence, should be transferred to and vested in the Quebec north shore turnpike trustees; and all such property lying on the south shore of the said river should be transferred to and vested in the Quebec south shore turnpike road trustees, and that each of the said corporations should have full power and authority to receive or recover from any former trustee or any other person or party wheresoever any property \"hereby\" vested in it. The 5th section then provides that the north shore trustees should be liable for the principal and interest of all debentures issued by the trustees of the Quebec turnpike road, and lor all debts and liabilities of the said trustees contracted before the division into two corporations, provided always that whenever the south shore trustees should have any balance remaining in their hands out of the revenues arising from the roads and works under their control, after paying the expenses of completing, maintaining and managing the said roads and works and the interest upon the debentures they shall have issued under the authority of this act, and the principal thereof, they shall pay over such balance to the said north shore trustees, as an aid towards enabling them to pay the interest and principal of the debentures issued by the said trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads before the passing of this act. Now, it is impossible to conceive that the legislature would thus have imposed this burden upon the north shore trustees and have taken also the pains exhibited in this section to relieve the south shore trustees and their property from all liability in respect to the \u00a340,000, which 16 Vic., ch. 235 authorized to be borrowed for the south shore roads, if, as is contended, it was the province that, in fact and in reality, was subject to the charge and liability of redeeming these debentures upon whichever side of the river the money raised upon their security was expended. Much was said about the injustice of this provision; with that we have nothing to do; that was a point to be urged in the legislature. But after all,the provision was not perhaps so unjust as was contended, when we consider that the legislature had already sanctioned the gift out of the public funds to the amount of \u00a333,882 principal, and about \u00a320,000 interest in creating a property for the corporation upon whom the burthen objected to was cast; which property by the papers laid before the legislature at the time of the passing of the Act 16 Vic., ch. 235, and before the monies thereby authorized to be raised were raised, or the improvements thereby authorized were made produced an annual income exceding \u00a38,000. Then the south shore corporation being by this act, 20 Vic., authorized to borrow \u00a312,000 on their debentures, provision is made for this purpose, not in the form that provision is made in the 7 sec. of 16 Vic., ch. 235, for the loans by that act authorized, but in a short form closing with the provision that the province shall not be guarantor or liable for the principal and interest of any debentures issued under this act, nor shall any money be advanced or paid therefor out of the provincial funds, thereby carrying out what appears to me to be the determination of the legislature as apparent in 12 Vic., ch. 115, and in every act passed subsequently thereto. It was urged that as the word \"principal\" as well as \"interest\" is inserted here, and \"interest\" only in 16 Vic., ch. 235, that therefore the province is responsible for the \"principal\" although not for the \"interest\" of the debentures issued under 16 Vic., ch. 235. I have already dealt with this contention when treating of 14 and 15 Vic., ch. 133, but I may add that the contention raises a collateral point, which is the contention expressly raised under 16 Vic., namely, was the insertion of the word \"principal\" absolutely necessary to relieve the province from liability in respect of the debentures authorized by 20 Vic., ch. 125? That it was not necessary to relieve the province from liability in respect of the principal of debentures issued under 12th Vic., ch. 115, the frame and provisions of which are identical in that respect with 16 Vic., ch. 235, I think I have already shewn. The provision as to the exemption of the province from liability upon debentures issued under the latter act is precisely the same as in the former, and such exemption as regards those issued under 12 Vic., ch. 115, as I think I have shewn could not be questioned successfully.\nThe contrast also which in 16th Vic., ch. 235, is drawn between the debentures to be issued under the authority of the act and debentures having the provincial guarantee, and to which I have drawn attention, is to my mind conclusive, that the debentures issued under 16 Vic. cannot themselves have that guarantee; and there is no vote or resolution of the legislative assembly of Canada, nor any act of its legislature which subjected that province to the payment of them in whole or in part, unless that liability is to found in the act itself, which authorized their issue.\nUpon the passing of the B. N. A. Act, the property and civil rights of the corporation which issued the debentures, and the rights of their creditors, became under the exclusive control of the legislature of the province of Quebec, under the 91st section of the act, while certain bonds, issued by the corporation to the amount, as appears, of \u00a39,000, which constituted assets of the late province of Canada, were by the 113 sec. made the joint property of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. It is impossible for us to hold that bonds of the trust corpo- which in the hands of the executive government of Canada were assets of the province, were when in the hands of another creditor liabilities of the province.\nIt is to the government of Quebec that the creditors of the corporation should apply, if the corporation are unable to pay their debentures as they fall due, to procure action to be taken under the 28th sec. of the ordinance, which is adopted and enacted as part of the act 16 Vic., chap. 235, under which the debentures have been issued; and if, as I understand it to be contended that, but for mismanagement on the part of the trust corporation, the revenue from the roads would have been sufficient to have created a fund to redeem the debentures, complaint upon that head should be made to the legislature, or the courts of the province of Quebec, as the competent authorities to afford redress for such a wrong. .\nUpon the whole it appears to me to be clear that at the time of the passing of the B. N. A. act, there was no charge or liability whatever existing upon the late province of Canada, or which subjected it to the payment of any part of the interest or principal secured by the debentures, authorized to be issued by the Quebec turnpike trust corporation, under 16 Vic., chap. 235, and that therefore the Dominion of Canada is subject to no such liability, and that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for appellant: F. Langelier.\nAttorneys for respondent: Stuart & Stuart.\nThis case was appealed to the Privy Council and the Lords of the Judicial Committee reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada. The following is the judgment:\u2014\nJudgment of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the appeal and cross appeal of the Queen v. Belleau and others, and Belleau and others v. the Queen, from the Supreme Court of Canada; delivered 20th June, 1882.\nPresent:\nSir Barnes Peacock,\nSir Montague E. Smith.\nSir. Robert P. Collier.\nSir James Hannen.\nSir Richard Couch.\nThis is a petition of right against the crown, by the holders of certain debentures issued by \"the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads,\" for payment of the principal and interest of their debentures.\nNo question has been raised as to the form in which the suppliants seek to have the question in dispute determined, which is, whether the late province of Canada was liable to pay the principal and interest of the debentures sued on. By \"The British North America Act, 1867,\" the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the union were transferred to the Dominion of Canada, and it is conceded by the crown that if the debentures created a debt on the part of the province, the suppliants are entitled to a decision in their favor.\nThe debentures purport on their face to be and were in fact issued under the authority of an act of parliament of the province of Canada (16 Vic., c. 235), intituled \"An act to authorize the trustees of the Quebec turnpike roads to issue debentures to a certain amount, and to place certain roads under their control.\" The debentures are in form certificates by the trustees, that under the authority of the said act there had been borrowed and received from the holder a certain sum bearing interest from the date of the certificate, which sum was reimbursable to the holder or bearer on a day named.\nThe act, after reciting that it was expedient to extend the provisions of a certain ordinance (4 Vic., c. 17) to certain roads other than those to which they then extended, and to such further improvements through the trustees of the roads established under the said ordinance, and that in order to the construction and completion of the roads then undertaken by the trustees, it was expedient to provide for the raising of the necessary funds by the issue of debentures by the said trustees, enacted that the provisions of the said ordinance, and the provisions of all acts and statutes in force amending the said ordinance, and the powers of the trustees appointed under the said ordinance, should extend or apply to the roads in the said act mentioned, in the same manner as if the said roads had been mentioned and described in the said ordinance.\nBy the 2nd and subsequent sections down to and inclusive of the 6th, the trustees were required to execute certain works, and were authorized to execute others, and the roads are enumerated to which the provisions of the ordinance were to be extended.\nBy the 7th section it is enacted that, in order to the making and completion of certain roads, described in a previous act, and the making of the various improvements above mentioned: \u2014\nIt should be lawful for the trustees to raise by loan a sum not exceeding \u00a330,000 currency, and this loan and the debentures which shall be issued to effect the same, and all other matters having, reference to the said loan, shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance above cited with respect to the loan authorized under it.\nThis is followed by a proviso which it will be necessary to refer to hereafter. Thus we are obliged, in order to see what were the obligations created by the debentures issued under the 16th Vic., and now sued on, to examine the provisions of the ordinance 4 Vic., c. 17.\nBy that ordinance the governor was empowered to appoint not less than five nor more than nine persons to be and who and their successors should be trustees for the purpose of opening, making and keeping in repair the roads thereinafter specified.\nBy section 3 it was enacted that the said trustees might, by the name of the trustees of the Quebec turnpike road, sue and be sued, and might acquire property and estates moveable and immoveable, which being so acquired should be vested in Her Majesty for the public use of the province, subject to the management of the said trustees for the purposes of the ordinance.\nBy the 18th section it was enacted that the roads should be and remain under the exclusive management, charge and control of the said trustees, and the tolls thereon should be applied solely to the necessary expenses of the management, making and repairing of the said roads, and the payment of the interest on and the principal of the debentures thereinafter mentioned.\nThe 21st section is the most important, and is as follows:\u2014\"21. And be it further ordained and enacted that it shall be lawful for the said trustees, as soon after the passing of this ordinance as may be expedient, to raise by way of loan on the credit and security of the tolls hereby authorized to be imposed, and of other moneys which may come into the possession and be at the disposal of the said trustees, under and by virtue of this ordinance, and not to be paid out of or chargeable against the general revenue of this province, any sum or sums of money not exceeding in the whole \u00a325,000 currency.\" Unless, therefore, it can be shown that some qualification of these words is to be found expressed or implied in the ordinance or the statutes amending it, it is clear that the suppliants lent their money on the credit and security of the tolls, \"and not to be paid out of or chargeable against the revenues of the province.\"\nTheir contention is that, notwithstanding these words, the province was bound to pay the debentures.\nThe trustees, it is said, were the agents of the province, and in that character they borrowed money for the province, to be applied to provincial purposes; thus the province became the principal debtor, and the tolls are to be regarded only as a first source of repayment of the debt of the province.\nThese general propositions cannot afford assistance in the consideration of the question we have to determine. It is of no avail to call the trustees agents of the province if it is admitted, as it must be, that the extent and limits of their agency must be sought in the act of the legislature which gives them existence. To make the trustees the agents of the province, it must be shown that, by their constitution, they have authority to act for the province, and to create obligations binding upon it. But this has not been shewn. The trustees are a corporate body, the absolute creation of the legislature, and their rights, duties, and powers are exclusively contained and defined in the instrument by which they were incorporated. Such corporations are well known to the law as well of this country as of Canada. They are created for a great variety of purposes, some of local, others of general importance. In the present instance the corporation is created for the local object of improving the roads round Quebec, and to this end the trustees are empowered to borrow money on certain specific terms, for the purposes of the trust as defined in the ordinance. The benefit which the province may be supposed to derive from the expenditure of the money borrowed no more imposes a liability on the province to repay it than it imposes such a liability on the adjoining landowners, the value of whose property may be increased by the construction of the roads authorized to be made.\nIn order to ascertain the powers of the trustees we must examine the provisions of the ordinance.\nBy the 21st section it appears that the loan is to be raised on the credit and security of the tolls authorized to be imposed, and other moneys which may come into the possession, and be at the disposal of, the trustees under and by virtue of the ordinance. On this it is observed that it does not say the \"sole\" credit and security of the tolls, &c., but, in the absence of any other credit or security defined by the ordinance, those only can be looked to which are expressly mentioned. It is, however, evident that it was for the very purpose of guarding against the possibility of the present claim that, in addition to the affirmative words already quoted, negative words were introduced that the loan is \"not to be paid out of or be chargeable against the general revenue of the province.\"\nIt does not appear possible to use language more carefully framed to exclude from the minds of proposed lenders the idea that they were in any case to look to the province for repayment of the moneys advanced by them.\nThe only criticism which has been offered upon this passage is that it does not negative the contention that the loan is to be paid out of revenue other than the \"general\" revenue of the province. But no other revenue can be suggested.\nThe government has no power to raise or apply revenue in any other way than is authorized by law. It is obvious that revenue already appropriated to particular objects cannot be diverted from them, and, when it is forbidden to apply the unappropriated or general revenue to the payment of the loan, all possible sources of reimbursement out of revenue of the province are excluded. It is a contradiction in terms to say that that which the province is by express enactment forbidden to pay out of its revenue remains nevertheless a liability of the province.\nThe 26th section enacts that it shall be lawful for the Governor, if he shall deem it expedient, at any time within three years from the passing of the ordinance, and not afterwards, out of any unappropriated public moneys in his hands to purchase for the public uses of the province and from the said trustees debentures to an amount not exceeding \u00a310,000 currency, the interest and principal of and on which shall be paid to the Receiver General by the said trustees in the same manner, and under the same provisions, as are provided with regard to such payments to any lawful holder of such debentures.\nThus the Governor is enabled to purchase, on behalf of the province, debentures, and so to become the creditor of the trustees, but this power is limited to three years.\nThis is wholly inconsistent with the idea that the province was already the debtor for the whole amount of the loan.\nThe province cannot stand in the relation both of debtor and creditor to itself; and if the process be regarded as a means of redeeming the debt of the province, no reason can be suggested why this power of purchasing debentures should be limited in amount and to a period of three years.\nThe 23rd section enacts that the debentures shall bear interest, and concludes thus:\u2014\nSuch interest to be paid out of the tolls upon the roads, or out of any other moneys at the disposal of the trustees for the purposes of this ordinance.\nHere there are no negative words excluding the liability of the province, but the obligation to pay interest primarily follows that of paying the principal, and it lies upon the party asserting that it is imposed elsewhere to establish it.\nSo far from there being anything in the ordinance to support the contention that the interest is to be paid by the province, everything on the subject of interest tends strongly in the opposite direction.\nBy the 27th section it is enacted that all arrears of interest shall be paid before any part of the principal sum:\u2014\nAnd if the deficiency be such that the funds then at the disposal of the trustees shall not be sufficient to pay such arrears, it shall be lawful for the Governor for the time being, by warrant under his hand, to authorize the Receiver General to advance to the trustees out of any unappropriated moneys in his hands such sum of money as may, with the funds then at the disposal of the trustees, be sufficient to pay such arrears of interest as aforesaid, and the amount so advanced shall be repaid by the trustees to the Receiver General.\nThis provision, empowering the Governor General to authorize a loan to the trustees to enable them to pay interest, is inconsistent with the idea that the province was already under an obligation to pay the interest.\nIf then the case had rested upon the effect of the ordinance alone, their lordships are of opinion that no liability on the part of the province for payment of. either the principal or interest could be established; but it has been argued that by subsequent legislation and conduct the province of Canada has recognized its liability to pay the principal and interest of the debentures issued under the authority of the ordinance of 4 Vic.\nThe first Act which is relied on is the 12th Vic., c. 5, by which it was provided that it Should be lawful for the Governor to redeem or purchase on account of the province all or any of the debentures constituting the public debt of the province of Canada, or such or any of the debentures issued by commissioners or other public officers under the authority of the legislature of Canada, or of the late province of Canada, the interest or principal of which debentures is made a charge on the consolidated revenue fund of the province.\nIt is said that the government, under the authority of this act, paid off the debentures issued under the ordinance.\nIt appears highly probable, as is stated in the very able judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, that the power given to the Governor by the 27th section of the ordinance to advance, by way of loan, money to the trustees to pay arrears of interest did, in fact, lead to the idea that the province was under a legal liability to pay the interest, and it would seem, though the manner in which the transaction was carried out is very obscure, that the debentures issued under the ordinance were, in fact, redeemed under the powers supposed to be conferred by the 12 Vic., c. 5.\nAll that need be said upon this subject is that, if the Governor did suppose himself to be acting under the authority of this statute, he mistook his powers. The debentures issued under the ordinance did not constitute part of the public debt of the province, and neither the interest or principal of them was made a charge on the consolidated revenue fund of the province.\nBut, whatever considerations may have led to the redemption by the government of the debentures issued under the ordinance, it is clear that they cannot affect the construction of the 16th Vic., c. 235, under which the debentures now in suit were issued.\nThe 7th section of that act authorized the trustees to raise a loan, which\nLoan, and the debentures which shall be issued to effect the same, and all matters having reference to the said loan, shall be subject to the provisions of the ordinance with respect to the loan authorized under it;\nBut this important proviso is added\u2014\nProvided nevertheless that the rate of interest shall not exceed 6 per cent., and no moneys shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest.\nThus the power to make advances out of provincial funds for payment of interest which was given by the 27th section of the ordinance as to the debentures issued under it, and which had possibly led to misconception as to the liability of the province, is expressly taken away by the 16th Vic. as to the debentures now in question.\nThey must therefore be treated as issued not merely on the express condition that they were not to be paid out of or chargeable against the general revenues of the province, but with the further express condition that no moneys should be advanced out of provincial funds for the payment of interest.\nAnd again, as though for the purpose of guarding against the possibility of the debenture holders contending that the debentures issued under the 16th Vic. had the provincial guarantee, the proviso to the 7th section enacts that\nAll the debentures which shall be issued under this act, so far as relates to the interest payable thereupon, shall have a privilege of priority of lien upon the tolls, &c., in preference to the interest payable upon all debentures which shall have been issued under the provincial guarantee, or which shall hereafter be issued by the said trustees under the provincial guarantee.\nWhat debentures had been or could be issued under the provincial guarantee does not appear, but this at least is clear, that the debentures issued under the act, and now sued on, have no provincial guarantee, since they have a preference given to them over all that have, and are thus distinguished from them.\nIt remains only to consider some general arguments which have been advanced on behalf of the suppliants. It has been urged that the government of the province, by redeeming the debentures issued under the ordinance, induced the belief that the same course would be pursued with regard to the debentures issued under the act of 16 Vic., c. 235, and that without such belief the debenture holders would not have lent their money on the security of the tolls, &c., which had proved entirely insufficient even to pay the interest of the former loan.\nTheir lordships do not desire, by any observations, to diminish the force of these arguments, if addressed to the proper tribunal. It may be that the legislature of the province of Canada or that of the Dominion may see reason to listen to the prayer of the suppliants to be relieved in whole or in part from the loss of their money, which has been expended for the benefit of the province. But this tribunal cannot allow itself to be influenced by feelings of sympathy with the individuals affected. Its duty is limited to expressing its opinion upon the legal question submitted to it, and upon that their lordships entertain no doubt.\nAnother argument of a similar kind has been based upon a subsequent statute of the province of Canada, 20 Vic., c. 125, by which the Quebec turnpike roads were divided into two parts, and by which it is contended some of the debenture holders have been deprived of a part of the special fund created for the payment of their loan.\nAssuming the correctness of this contention, it might have been made a ground for opposing the later enactment, or it may now be used by way of appeal to the legislature for redress, but it cannot supply a reason for putting a construction on the obligations created by the 16th Vic., c. 235, different from that which must have been put upon them immediately after the passing of that statute.\nSome minor points have been relied on by the learned judges who have held that the suppliants were entitled to succeed on this petition. It is from no disrespect to those learned judges that these points have not been particularly dealt with, but from a belief that, however they may tend to fortify the general argument in support of which they are used, they do not by themselves afford a basis upon which their lordships' judgment can be founded.\nFor these reasons, their lordships are of opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, as well as the judgment of the Supreme Court confirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court so far as it decided that the respondents were entitled to the principal of their debentures, but varying the same by declaring that the respondents were entitled in addition to the principal to interest from the date of filing the petition of right, are erroneous, and their lordships will humbly advise Her Majesty that they should be reversed and judgment entered for the crown.\nTheir lordships are further of opinion and will advise Her Majesty that the cross appeal of the respondents asserting the liability of the crown to pay interest on the debentures from the date of their falling due should be dismissed, and that the costs of the appeal and of the cross appeal and of the proceedings in the courts below should be paid by the respondents.\n[1] The judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada was reversed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the holding of the minority of the court was affirmed.
