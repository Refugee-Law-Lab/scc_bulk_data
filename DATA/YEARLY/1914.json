Shortly after the outbuilding was seen to be on fire. The fire was extinguished and W. brought out badly burned, from the effects of which he died the next day. In an action on the policy the trial judge found as a fact that W. had been seized with a fit and in that condition caused the fire. This finding was concurred in by the two provincial appellate courts. The trial judge held that the company was liable for one-tenth only of the insurance. The Divisional Court reversed this ruling (26 Ont. L.R. 55, 3 D.L.R. 668), but it was restored by the Appellate Division (28 Ont. L.R. 537, 13 D.L.R. 113).\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the injuries causing the death of W. happened from a fit within the meaning of the clause in the policy diminishing the indemnity to be paid. Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co. (6 Q.B.D. 42), and Lawrence v. Accidental Ins. Co. (7 Q.B.D. 216), distinguished.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014The clause diminishing the indemnity payable is not an exempting clause but one of the three separate contracts between the insurers and insured as to amount of liability.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014It does not create a new liability, but is a clause of limitation in favour of the company and to be strictly construed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2], by which the amount awarded to the plaintiff at the trial was increased.\nThe substance of the material portions of the policy held by appellant\u2019s husband and sued on in this case is stated in the head-note. The clauses thereunder are set out in full in the opinions of the judges given on this appeal.\nThe insurance company in defending the action claimed to be liable for one-tenth only of the principal sum insured, on the ground that the injuries causing the death of the insured happened through a fit. The trial judge agreed with this contention and gave judgment accordingly. The Divisional Court held that the fit was a remote, and not the direct, cause of the injuries and awarded the principal sum for which deceased was insured. The Appellate Division restored the judgment given at the trial.\nAylen K.C. and R.V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant. The decision of the courts in England strongly support the view of the Divisional Court that the fit was only a remote cause of the injuries. See Pink v. Fleming[3]; Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co.[4]; Lawrence v. Accidental Ins. Co.[5], and the reasoning in Manufacturers\u2019 Accident Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Dorgan[6], at pages 947 and 954. See also Canadian Casualty and Boiler Co. v. Boulter, Davies & Co.[7]\nThe appellate courts are not bound by the finding of the trial judge that the insured caused the fire while in a fit. That is not a finding of fact, but merely an inference from the evidence and, we submit, an unwarranted inference. See William Hamilton Mfg. Co. v. Victoria Lumber and Mfg. Co.[8]\nHellmuth K.C. and McConnell for the respondents referred to Mendl v. Ropner & Co.[9], and contended that the finding of the trial concurred in by both appellate courts below must be accepted, and being accepted the judgment in appeal must stand.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In December, 1907, the respondent company entered into two contracts to insure the husband of the appellant each in the principal sum of $5,000\nagainst bodily injuries caused solely by external violent and accidental means, as specified in the following schedule (subject, however, to the terms and conditions hereinafter contained).\nIn October, 1910, Wadsworth dies.\nThe finding of the trial judge was that deceased took a fit, that while in that fit, he either dropped or knocked over a lantern, the lantern exploded or was spilled or broken in the fall. The result was that the oil escaped, and there was almost immediately a very extensive flame which enveloped the deceased and inflicted the very serious injury from which he died. That finding has been concurred in by both courts below.\nThis appeal turns upon the question whether the injuries sustained by the deceased causing his death happened from fits within the meaning of the policies (clause G). The parts of the policies most material are parts C, G. and H. Part C reads as follows:\u2014\nIf such injuries are sustained while riding as a passenger in a passenger steamship or steamboat, or in any steam, cable or electric passenger railway conveyance, or in a passenger elevator, or are caused by the burning of a building in which the insured is therein at the commencement of the fire, the amount to be paid shall be double the sum specified in clause under which the claim arises.\nPart G.\u2014\nIn case of injuries happening from any of the following causes, viz: intentional injuries inflicted by the insured, or any other person (other than burglars or robbers), fits, vertigo, sleep-walking, duelling, war or riot, exposure to unnecessary danger, engaging in bicycle, automobile or horse-racing, or while under the influence of intoxicating liquors or narcotics, causing death, loss of sight or limb as stated in Part \u201cA,\u201d the company will pay one-tenth of the amount payable for bodily injuries as stated in Part \u201cA,\u201d under which claim arises; or if such injuries result in total or partial disability as provided in Part \u201cB,\u201d the Company shall pay one-tenth of the amount payable for weekly indemnity as stated in said Part \u201cB,\u201d under which claim arises.\nPart H.\u2014\nIn case of the happening of injuries mentioned in Special Indemnity Clauses D, E, F and G, claims shall be made only under said clauses, and the amount to be paid under said clauses shall be the full limit of the Company\u2019s liability, and such claim will not be entitled to double benefit as provided in Part \u201cC.\u201d\nThere are a number of cases in which accidental insurance policies have been construed by the courts, and they are practically all dealt with in the various judgments below and here. In every policy, however, which has been construed in those cases, the excepted clause was construed as a clause exempting from all liability. Here the respondents argue: the policy is based on the hazard of the risk and provides a schedule of indemnities first, for bodily injuries caused solely by external violent and accidental causes (Part A): second, for injuries sustained in the circumstances enumerated in Part C, and third, if the injury is fairly attributable to some constitutional defect in the insured\u2014fits, vertigo or sleep-walking\u2014or the assumption by him of some extra risk, such as duelling, then the indemnity is fixed by clause G at \u201cone-tenth of the amount payable for bodily injuries, as stated in Part A under which claim arises.\u201d In such case, the liability of the company varies. If the death is caused solely by external violent and accidental means, then the capital sum of $5,000 is due under each policy (Part A). If the death occurs in the circumstances enumerated in Part C double payment is provided for, and finally if the injury is fairly attributable to some constitutional defect, then the indemnity is fixed at one-tenth, as provided for by clause G. The case turns upon the meaning of this clause. It is not an exempting clause, but is one of several clauses fixing the liability of the company at different sums according to the different risks, and making the sum in each case proportionate to the risk run. The words to be construed are:\u2014\nIn case of injuries happening from any of the following causes * * *\nI construe them to mean that the company undertakes, in case the injury, as in this case, comes to pass by chance or otherwise as a result of the fact that the insured had a fit, to assume an obligation to pay one-tenth of the amount which would be payable for bodily injuries under Part A, as it would be obliged to pay double the amount of the capital sum if the injury was sustained in any one of the cases enumerated in Part \u201cC.\u201d In other words, if the bodily injuries are not caused solely by external violent and accidental means, but arise as a result of any one of the causes mentioned in Part \u201cG,\u201d the liability is fixed at one-tenth. Shortly stated, the proximate cause of the death was the injuries received from the burning oil which was set on fire as a result of the fit with which the deceased had been previously seized, and this brings the claim within Part \u201cG.\u201d\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by the widow of her deceased husband who had been insured under a policy issued by the company defendant\nagainst bodily injuries caused solely by external violent and accidental means as specified in the following schedule.\nThat the death of the assured was within the terms of the policy was not denied. The substantial question in dispute was as to the amount of the company\u2019s liability, and the company\u2019s contention was based upon Part G of the schedule, which provided that:\u2014\nIn case of injuries happening from any of the following causes, viz.: Intentional injuries inflicted by the insured or any other person (other than burglars or robbers), fits, vertigo, sleep-walking * * * causing death * * * the company will pay one-tenth of the amount payable for bodily injuries as stated in Part \u201cA.\u201d\nThere was no dispute as to the amount payable in case it was held that the death of the assured came within this clause G, as having been caused from injuries happening from fits.\nThe findings of the trial judge on the facts were as follows:\u2014 Now this was an injury happening from a fit which this unfortunate man had. He took a fit when he was in the closet, and I think the proper finding of fact is that while in that fit he either dropped or knocked over the lantern, the lantern exploded or was spilled or was broken in this fall\u2014the result was that the oil escaped and there was almost immediately a very extensive flame which enveloped him and inflicted the very severe injuries from which he died, and I think it is the very kind of case that falls within this clause.\nThese findings of fact were concurred in by the Divisional Court, and also by the Appellate Division, and I think are amply sustainable from the evidence. I fully agree also with the conclusions that the injuries which the deceased received and which caused his death were not caused by the burning of a building at all and that the double liability of the company provided in Part C does not arise in this case. The question to be determined by us is whether under these findings of fact the case is one within Part G of the policy.\nThere has been much conflict of judicial opinion upon the point. The learned trial judge held that\nit was the very kind of case that falls within this clause.\nA majority of the Divisional Court (the Chief Justice with much hesitation) reached the conclusion stated by Mr. Justice Riddell that\nthe injuries which caused the death are the burns,\nand that\nthe burns were caused primarily and immediately by the fire,\nthe fire was \u201cthe proximate cause,\u201d or as Chief Justice Falconbridge put it, that\nthe injuries happened not from the fit but from the fire.\nHodgins J. dissenting in the Appellate Division based his judgment on the same grounds, namely, that the injuries \u201chappened from a flame.\u201d\nA majority of the Appellate Division held with the trial judge and Mr. Justice Latchford of the Divisional Court that the case was one clearly within Part G of the policy, and that a fit was the proximate and efficient cause of the happening of the injuries causing death.\nI have read carefully all the cases cited by the learned judges in their judgments, but I cannot find that any of them afford us much assistance in the construction of this clause G. In those cases the question under the special terms of the assurance policies was: What was the cause of the death of the assured? Here that is not the main or controlling question, which is: What was the cause of the happening of the injuries which caused death?\nIt is not then a question as it was in the two English cases cited: Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co., in 1880[10], and Lawrence v. Accidental Ins. Co., in 1881,[11], where the cause of death was considered. It is a question of the cause of the happening of the injuries which caused death.\nThe cause of the happening of these injuries is found explicitly stated in the findings of fact of the trial judge accepted by all the courts as sustainable under the evidence. The fit was the efficient cause of the injuries received by the deceased assured and from which he died. I agree with the judgment of the Appellate Division stated by Meredith J.A. that this fit was the predominate and proximate cause of the injuries, the scorchings or burnings of the body of the assured, which caused his death, and that\nthe fit set the fire free and bound the man while it burned him.\nIt does seem to me that to hold such a case as this not to be within Part G of the policy would be to disregard its plain words and leave it practically meaningless. Construing the policy as a whole, it seems clear that no liability arises under it at all except in those cases of\nbodily injuries caused solely by external, violent and accidental means.\nThe plaintiff brought herself within that risk and satisfied the onus which lay upon her when she proved that the death of her husband was caused by the burning of his body from the upset lamp. Now, if she had proved that her husband had died simply from a \u201cfit\u201d and had failed to prove any\nbodily injuries caused solely by external, violent and accidental means\nwhich in themselves caused his death she could not have recovered under the policy at all. It was common ground that this onus had been satisfied.\nThen comes the next question as to the amount recoverable. It seems to me it was just such cases as this of bodily injuries caused by fits and in turn themselves causing death that this clause G was intended, to cover.\nTo my mind the language of the clause itself is not ambiguous. If it was so the court might be justified in straining the language used against the company which, of course, prepared the policy. It appears to me the clause clearly expresses and limits the company\u2019s liability in cases of injuries happening from fits and causing death. With great respect I think it is putting a forced construction upon the clause to say that the injuries of burning and scorching of his body were not \u201cinjuries happening from fits.\u201d Of course, the \u201cflame\u201d or the \u201cfire\u201d caused the injuries, but they none the less \u201chappened\u201d from the fits which were in my judgment the proximate and efficient cause of the injuries from which death resulted.\nThe clause did not limit or affect the company\u2019s liability in cases of death arising directly from fits and without any \u201cexternal, violent and accidental means.\u201d Such a death was not covered by the policy at all which was one of accident insurance simply. It did, however, cover, and was intended to cover, cases of death caused by bodily injuries happening from fits which in my judgment is the case before us.\nThe object, purpose and intent of the clause can be gathered from reading the collocation of other causes than \u201cfits\u201d mentioned in it. Such purpose was to provide a limited liability only in cases of injuries happening to the person assured from any of the several causes mentioned and causing death. Once that conclusion is reached as to the object and intent of the clause, then it follows, to my mind at any rate, that not only are the cases relied upon by the appellant on policies which raised the question of the \u201ccause of death\u201d irrelevant, but that the findings of fact of the trial judge bring the case directly within clause G.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014After the most anxious consideration the view at which I have arrived is that the respondent has failed to shew that this case is governed by Part G. In order to bring the case within that part the respondent must make it appear that the injuries which led to the death of the appellant\u2019s husband come within the description,\ninjuries happening from any of the following causes * * * fits.\nQuestions of legal causation, to use a very loose phrase, commonly give rise to marked differences of judicial view; and this case is no exception. When the term \u201ccause\u201d is used in common speech one does not, of course, use the word in any strictly logical sense, but (abstracting from the totality of the conditions) one indicates some class of facts or some relation brought into prominence by the practical interest of the moment; and such terms as \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cproximate cause\u201d when employed by lawyers in denoting the grounds for assigning legal responsibility or in defining the conditions of such responsibility ought to be interpreted in light of the known meaning usually attached to such phrases and their equivalents in similar circumstances. And, indeed, speaking more generally, in the case of insurance policies\u2014prepared by professional men on behalf of an insurance company\u2014where phrases that have been construed in well known cases are made use of, it may be presumed that the insurance company so employing them had such decisions in view.\nNow it so happens that stipulations which, in my judgment, ought to be considered as in all relevant respects equivalent to that in question here have been interpreted by very high authority in reported decisions which have since been applied in other cases without a doubt as to the correctness of them; and adopting as I do the principle of construction above indicated, the real point for determination seems to be whether the circumstances of this case are so different from the circumstances of the cases in which the decisions referred to were pronounced as to require us to hold that this case falls on the other side of the line.\nThose decisions have this in common; that the insured having, as the immediate consequence of being seized by a fit, been exposed to a noxious agency which destroyed his life, it was held that the injury that was the immediate cause of death was not \u201ccaused\u201d by the fit within the meaning of the insurance policy. In the first of these cases, Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co.[12], the court held that the insured having been drowned as a result of falling into a stream while in a fit, the \u201ccause\u201d of death was not the fit. This decision was followed in Lawrence v. Accidental Ins. Co.[13], and in Manufacturers\u2019 Accident Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Dorgan[14], and was referred to seemingly with approval in Accident Ins. Co. v. Crandal[15], at page 532.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in this last mentioned case, Mr. Justice Gray discussing the case of suicide committed while in a state of insanity said:\u2014\nIf insanity could be considered as coming within this clause, it would be doubtful, to say the least, whether, under the rule of the law of insurance which attributes any injury or loss to its proximate cause only, and in view of the decisions in similar cases the insanity of the assured, or anything but the act of hanging himself, could be held to be the cause of his death. Scheffer v. Railroad Co.[16]; Trew v. Railway Passengers\u2019 Assurance Co.[17]; Reynolds v. Accidental Ins. Co.[18]; Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co.[19], affirmed12; Law- rence v. Accidental Ins. Co.[20]; Scheiderer v. Travellers\u2019 Ins. Co.[21]\nI cannot satisfactorily distinguish in principle the Winspear Case[22] from the present. Accepting the trial judge\u2019s finding that the breaking or explosion of the lantern was in some way connected with the onset of an epileptic seizure, still the immediate cause of the injuries was the fire coming into contact with the insured or the insured coming into contact with the fire. The fall that led to the drowning of the insured in the one case seems no more remote from the suffocation that ensued than was the fall which it may be assumed in the case before us directly or indirectly brought the fire into contact with the body of the unfortunate victim. If the deceased being overtaken by a seizure had fallen into a fire and been burned in such a manner as to cause his death, the analogy with the facts of the Winspear Case22 would be obviously complete. The analogy would not be less obviously complete if it had appeared that as the immediate result of falling upon the lantern or if in some other way as the immediate and direct consequence of the fit the clothing of the deceased had been brought into direct contact with and had caught fire from the flame of the lantern itself. It appears to me to be plainly impossible to affirm, upon the facts in evidence, that the burning of the insured\u2019s body from which he died was not solely attributable to some part of his clothing being brought into direct contact with the flame of the lantern by some movement which followed immediately upon his seizure. Holding this view, the decision of the case appears to me to be governed by the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Winspear Case22.\nI am not overlooking the argument that this construction of Part G deprives some parts of that stipulation of all meaning, for example, in the application of the provision to \u201cinjuries happening from sleep-walking.\u201d I am not convinced that this is so. And a comparison of Part C with Part G shews that in framing the policy the distinction between injuries suffered while in a given situation and injuries attributable to a situation or a condition as a \u201ccause\u201d was not overlooked. At all events my view is that in dealing with the subject of injuries arising from fits it was easily possible for the insurance company to make it clear by apt language that the construction acted upon in the Winspear Case22 was to be excluded. And the respondents having not only failed to do so, but having, on the contrary, used the words as I think indistinguishable in effect from the phrases construed in that and subsequent cases the considerations which prevailed in those cases ought to be given effect to here.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The material facts and the relevant portions of the insurance policies sued on are sufficiently set out in the judgments of the provincial courts\u2014particularly in the very careful opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Riddell in the Divisional Court.\nThat the injuries sustained by the injured were not\ncaused by the burning of a building, etc., was a conclusion accepted in both the provincial Appellate Courts, and, in my opinion, is the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence. This disposes of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to recover double payments under Part C of the policies.\nThere is no doubt that the death of the insured was caused by burns. It is a legitimate inference from the evidence that the fire from which these burns were received was ignited as the result of a lantern being either dropped or knocked over by the insured owing to his loss of self-control while in a fit. As put by Latchford J., who dissented in the Divisional Court:\u2014\nMrs. Wadsworth was obliged to establish, and did establish that external, violent and accidental means caused injuries to her husband and that injuries caused by such means caused his death.\nWhile the case is, therefore, covered by the policies, the question for determination is whether the burns, which caused death, sustained under these circumstances, were\ninjuries happening from any of the following causes, viz., * * * fits\nwithin the meaning of Part G of the policies, so that the plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be limited to one-tenth of the amounts which would be payable if death had been due to some accident wholly disconnected with fits or any of the other special matters included in Part G. Five judges\u2014Middleton and Latchford JJ., and Garrow, Meredith and Magee JJ.A., have held that they were\u2014and this was the opinion of the majority in the Appellate Division; while four judges, Falconbridge C.J., Riddell J., and Maclaren and Hodgins JJ.A., have held that they were not\u2014and this view prevailed in the Divisional Court. Did the injuries, i.e., the burns, which caused the death of the injured, happen from the cause\u2014fits? Were fits in law the cause of these injuries?\nTwo opposite views of the construction of clause \u201cG\u201d are presented\u2014both of them supported by cogent arguments. In one view the clause is dealt with without reference to canons of legal construction, and an effect is given to it which it may be supposed the insurers had in mind, although they may not have sufficiently expressed their intention. In the other view, the language employed is assumed to have been used in the light of rules laid down by the courts for the construction of insurance contracts\u2014and only the expressed intention to be gathered from the terms used when given the meaning thus put upon them is taken into account.\nIf in construing these insurance policies we might assume that neither the insured nor the insurer was aware of the well-known legal rule embodied in the maxim in jure non remota causa sed proxima spectatur, or of its constant and special application in insurance law (17 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 567, 437, 530; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims (11 ed.), p. 179, et seq.), a very formidable argument could be made for the defendants that it must have been just such an occurrence as that now before us that they meant to cover by clause (G).\nFits, sleep-walking and several of the other \u201ccauses\u201d mentioned in clause (G) do not, as a general rule, per se produce injuries. They often occasion and give rise to other secondary causes from which injuries result. Therefore, it is contended, it must be to injuries immediately produced by such secondary causes themselves resulting from the enumerated causes that clause (G) was meant to apply. This aspect of the case is forcefully presented in the opinion delivered by Meredith J.A., concurred in by Garrow and Magee JJ.A.\nBut in construing the language of an insurance policy it is impossible to ignore a principle, of which the application is so well established in insurance law as is that embodied in the maxim now under consideration. To do so would be to introduce uncertainty in regard to the construction of contracts in daily use\u2014a consequence to be avoided. Thames and Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, Fraser & Co.[23], at page 490; Philips v. Rees[24], at page 21. The application of this maxim sometimes makes against the liability of the insurer: Taylor v. Dunbar[25]; Livie v. Janson[26]; it sometimes makes for it; Walker v. Maitland[27]; Redman v. Wilson[28]. In either case, whether he is contracting for liability or is providing to exclude, limit or reduce it, the insurer, when he refers to the cause of loss, injury or death, must be taken to mean the proximate and immediate cause: Fenton v. Thorley & Co.[29], at pages 454-5; In re Etherington and The Lancashire and Yorkshire Accident Ins. Co.[30], at pages 601-2; Waters v. Merchants Louisville Ins. Co.[31], at pages 223-4; unless he uses language which will clearly cover a remote cause and thus preclude the application of the ordinary canon, as was done in Smith v. Accident Insurance Co.[32] No doubt the present case is distinguishable from two English cases much relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff\u2014Winspear v. Accident Ins. Co.[33], and Lawrence v. Accidental Ins. Co.[34] In neither of these cases did the epileptic fit bring into activity the instrument which proximately caused the injuries or death. It was rather in the nature of a cause sine qua non. In the present case the fit was undoubtedly, though not the immediate cause of the injuries from which death ensued, a causa caus\u00e6 causantis. Meredith J.A., says that the fit was in a double sense the predominative and proximate cause of these injuries\u2014it caused the fire and it prevented the escape of the victim. In the Winspear Case34, and also in the American case, Manufacturers\u2019 Accident Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Dorgan[35], cited toy Riddell J., the fit undoubtedly prevented the escape of the assured quite as much as in the present case, yet in neither instance was the fit on that account regarded as the efficient or proximate cause of the injuries. See also Reynolds v. Accidental Ins. Co.[36] In Taylor v. Dunbar, already referred to, as in Busk v. Royal Exchange Assce. Co.[37], at page 80; Walker v. Maitland[38], at page 174, and Bishop v. Pentland[39], at page 223, cited by Riddell J., and in Pink v. Fleming[40], cited at bar, the causes relied upon to found, or to exempt from, liability were undoubtedly in the direct chain of causation; they were not merely caus\u00e6 sine quibus non; they were caus\u00e6 causarum causantium; but because they were remote and not the immediate causes of the losses, they were deemed immaterial and were held insufficient in some of the cases to support liability, in others to exclude it. As put by Watkin Williams J., in the Lawrence Case[41]:\u2014\nIt is essential * * * that it should be made out that the fit was a cause in the sense of being the proximate and immediate cause of the death before the company are exonerated.\nHe quotes from Lord Bacon\u2019s Maxims of the Law:\nIt were infinite for the law to consider the causes of causes and their impulsions one of another; therefore it contenteth itself with the immediate cause.\nMy conclusion from these authorities is that upon a proper construction of clause (G) the injuries which caused the death of the insured did not happen from the fit which he suffered. The fit was a remote cause; the proximate cause was the fire.\nI do not rely on the decision of this court in Canadian Casualty and Boiler Co. v. Boulter[42], because of the stress placed in the judgments in that case on the word \u201cimmediate\u201d which was used in the policy.\nI do not read clause (G) as creating a new and distinct liability. The injuries with which it deals are the\nbodily injuries caused solely by external, violent and accidental means\nto which the application of the entire contract is at its outset confined. The indemnity for such injuries when they happen (inter alia) from fits is by clause (G) reduced to one-tenth of the sum which would be payable under clause (A) if they happened from other causes. Clause (G) is a clause of limitation introduced by the company in its own favour and, like a clause of exception, is to be given a strict construction.\nMoreover, as is pointed out by Taft J., in Manufacturers\u2019 Accident Indemnity Co. v. Dorgan[43], at page 956:\u2014\nPolicies are drawn by the legal advisers of the company, who study with care the decisions of the courts, and, with those in mind, attempt to limit as narrowly as possible the scope of the insurance. It is only a fair rule, therefore, which courts have adopted to resolve any doubt or ambiguity in favour of the insured and against the insurer. Fitton v. Accidental Death Ins. Co.[44]\nIn view of the great divergence of judicial opinion as to its proper construction it would savour of temerity to insist that clause (G) of the policies before us is wholly free from ambiguity. While of the opinion that, when construed according to well established legal principles, clause (G) does not cover the present case, I am not prepared to say of those who hold the contrary view (adapting the language in which Meredith J.A. refers to the Divisional Court) that \u201cit is easily demonstrated that (they) err and how.\u201d I appreciate the force of the argument in favour of the defendant company\u2019s contention. But, if I should be wrong in the view which I have taken as to its proper construction, I agree with Hodgins J.A., that the ambiguity and uncertainty of the clause, which the defendants invoke, should be resolved in favour of the assured. In re Bradley and Essex and Suffolk Accident Indemnity Society[45], at pages 422, 430; In re Etherington[46], at pages 596, 600.\nWith all proper respect for the learned judges who think otherwise, I am, for these reasons, of the opin- ion that the correct conclusion was reached in the Divisional Court and that its judgment should be restored. The appellant should have her costs in the Appellate Division and her costs of the appeal to this court. The cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am in favour of dismissing this appeal for the reasons given by Sir Louis Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.V.

[1896] c. 41\u2014\u201cSenior officer * * * present at any locality\u201d\u2014Military district\u2014Right of action\u20144 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 86\u2014Statute\u2014Retrospective effect.\nBy sec. 16 of the \u201cMilitia Act\u201d (R.S.C. [1896] ch. 41) Canada is divided into military districts of which the Province of Nova Scotia is one. By sec. 34 \u201cthe senior officer present at any locality\u201d may, on requisition from three justices of the peace, call out the troops in aid of the civil power wherever a riot or disturbance of the peace has occurred or is anticipated.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the \u201csenior officer present at any locality\u201d is not necessarily the senior officer of a corps stationed at the place where the riot occurs or is likely to occur. The justices, in their discretion, may requisition the senior officer of any available force.\nBy sec. 34, sub-sec. 6, of the above Act the officer commanding the troops so called out may, in his own name, take action against the municipality in which the riot occurred to recover the amount of the expenses thereby incurred which are to be paid to His Majesty when recovered. By 4 Edw. VII. ch. 23, sec. 86, this right of action was vested in His Majesty.\nHeld, that the latter being a procedure Act is retrospective and an action was properly brought in the name of the Attorney-General of Canada to recover the expenses of calling out the troops on the occasion of an industrial strike in the City of Sydney, part of which expenses were incurred before, and part after, the last mentioned Act came into force.\nJudgment appealed from (46 N.S. Rep. 527), reversed, Brodeur J. dissenting. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe two questions of law raised on this appeal are stated in the above head-note. The material sections of the \u201cMilitia Act\u201d will be found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nNewcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nFinlay Macdonald for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action to recover the sum of $5,309.09 advanced by the Crown out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada to defray the expenditure incurred in connection with the pay and allowances of the militia force called out to aid the civil power to suppress a riot or disturbance within the municipality of the City of Sydney.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts. They are all found in favour of the Crown.\nIt appears that in July. 1904. there were riots and civil disturbances in Sydney, and the local authorities, unable to cope with them, found it necessary to summon a large military force to their assistance. Requisitions were accordingly made upon three separate military officers. Colonel Irving, the officer commanding at Halifax. District No. 9, which comprises the Province of Nova Scotia, was the only one who brought his forces to Sydney and performed the services required.\nThe trial judge maintained the action except as to one item of $20 for legal expenses. On appeal, this judgment was reversed on the sole ground that Colonel Irving was not\nthe senior officer of the active militia present at any locality\nwithin the meaning of section 34 of the \u201cMilitia Act.\u201d Mr. Justice Ritchie, who delivered the judgment of the court, substitutes for this expression by interpretation, the words\nthe senior officer at or nearest the place where the riot has occurred or is anticipated.\nAnd upon the assumption that there was an officer at Sydney or nearer to Sydney than Halifax, the claim is disallowed.\nIt appears to me obvious that, speaking generally, the statute contemplates real and effective proceedings to put down disturbances by aid of the militia power when the forces under the control of the local civil authorities are insufficient, and the section in question provides that the initial step must be taken by the civil authorities. It is for those authorities to judge of the magnitude of the disturbance, the necessity for aid and, in the first instance, the strength of the force required to quell it. The section properly provides, therefore, that the requisitions must be made by those who are immediately associated with the locality where the trouble has arisen and in which the services of the militia are required. They are in a moment of urgency authorized to impose a heavy tax upon the ratepayers; hence the words used in that section authorize the senior officer to act \u201cwhen thereunto required in writing\u201d by the chairman.\nThese authorities, charged with the duty of maintaining order in the localities where the disturbances have arisen apply to the senior officer of the active militia at \u201cany locality.\u201d Here there are no qualifying words as in the case of the civil authorities for the obvious reason that there may not be in the locality in which the riot occurs any active militia, or there may be serious reasons why in a local disturbance the local militia should not be called upon to interfere. Hence, the necessity for leaving a wide discretion with the local civil authorities.\nThere must have been in this case a serious and wide-spread disturbance, because the magistrates considered it necessary to summon assistance from three different quarters and the senior officer of the active militia who was in command, as I have already said, over the whole district, answered that summons and directed his subordinates to await his further orders.\nI do not wish to be understood as saying that the municipal authorities might not have limited their requisition to the officer commanding the militia force at Baddeck or in Sydney. My point is that the statute confers a power upon the local authorities responsible for the maintenance of the peace which they exercise at their discretion in view of the necessities of the situation and they may requisition any officer in the province, and if the outbreak is sufficiently serious, they might go to headquarters and put the general officer commanding in a position to call out the whole militia force of the country.\nThe word \u201clocality\u201d as used in the section is perhaps somewhat indefinite, but it must be interpreted in such a way as not to unduly limit and possibly destroy the discretion which is undoubtedly conferred upon the civil authorities, and they having, in the exercise of their undoubted discretion, called upon the senior officer of the active militia for the district which included the scene of the disturbance, it was for him to determine how that requisition was to be met. This is made abundantly clear by reference to section 78 of the Act, which gives the officer commanding any military district authority, upon any sudden emergency, to call out the whole or any part of the militia within his command.\nThe \u201cInterpretation Act,\u201d section 31, paragraph (e), provides that\nif a power is conferred or a duty imposed, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed from time to time as occasion requires.\nThe active militia may be called out for service either within or without the municipality in which it is raised (sec. 34, sub-sec. 1).\nThe respondents contend that the action should have been brought in the name of the commanding officer of the corps because the militia were called out under the provision of chapter 41, section 34, R.S.C. 1886, sub-sec. 5, which provides that the pay and allowances are to be recovered by the commanding officer. There are many answers to this objection in the circumstances of this case, but the most effective is given by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIt appears by the particulars that the disbursements were all made by the Government during the period from August 6th, 1904, to February, 1905, and this action was brought iu. 1910. At that time, the statute of 1904 (4 Edw. VII., ch. 23) was in force and sections 86 and 87 provide that such sums, as are in question here, may be recovered as a debt due to the Crown by the municipality. This is a mere question of procedure. In Gardner v. Lucas[2], Lord Blackburn said at page 603:\u2014 For instance, I think it is perfectly settled that if the Legislature intended to frame a new procedure, that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should proceed in another and a different way; clearly there bygone transactions are to be sued for and enforced according to the new form of procedure. Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there is some good reason or other why they should not be.\nI entertain no doubt that the City of Sydney is a separate and distinct municipality from the County of Cape Breton and, as such, obliged to pay for the services of the militia duly requisitioned (sec. 3, ch. 70, B.S.N.S. 1900).\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The claim made herein is to recover from respondent, which is a municipality, payment for services rendered by the active militia called out in aid of the civil power under section 34 of the \u201cMilitia Act.\u201d\nI am unable to construe that section as the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has in support of its judgment allowing the appeal from the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nWith great respect it seems to me rather narrow ground to proceed upon the possible meaning to be found in the words of part of one sub-section out of half a dozen such sub-sections and especially so when those words are at best of dubious import.\nI think we must look at the scope of the whole of this section and see if there has been a substantial compliance with its meaning and whether or not the action taken has been an illegal or legal proceeding.\nFor if illegal then if those men so engaged or any one of them in suppressing a riot or disturbance had happened to take human life, a charge of manslaughter or worse might have lain against those responsible for such result.\nSuch like considerations may well arrest our attention in determining whether or not this calling out of the active militia fell within the meaning of what\nthe statute prescribes. For if by the reasonable interpretation of this section the legality of the action of Lt.-Col. Irving and the magistrates making the requisition upon him cannot be maintained assuredly no action will lie for the recovery of the payments made.\nAnd on the other hand if what was done can be justified under and by virtue of the statute as legally done, it seems to me the recovery sought must be allowed.\nIt is admitted that Lt.-Col. Irving was, during the time in question, District Officer commanding No. 9 Military District within which the City of Sydney lies.\nThere were other officers each commanding a regiment in the district, upon each of whom a requisition was made by the magistrate at the same time as the requisition made upon Lt.-Col. Irving. These other commanding officers were, I take it, under the command of Lt.-Col. Irving.\nThe first sub-section of section 34 provides that:\u2014\nThe active militia, or any corps thereof, shall be liable to be called but * * * in aid of the civil power in any case in which a riot, disturbance of the peace, or other emergency requiring such service occurs, or * * * whether such riot, disturbance or other emergency occurs, or is so anticipated within or without the municipality in which such corps is raised or organized.\nSub-section 2 declares that:\u2014\nThe senior officer of the active militia present at any locality shall call out the same or such portion thereof as he considers necessary for the purpose of preventing or suppressing any such actual or anticipated riot or disturbance, etc., * * * when thereunto required in writing by\nthe several judicial personages defined, etc.\nSub-section 3 provides that every such requisition shall express on its face the actual facts or the anticipation thereof\nrequiring such service of the active militia in aid of the civil power for the suppression thereof.\nSub-section 4 provides that:\u2014\nEvery officer and man of such active militia, or any portion thereof, shall, on every such occasion, obey the orders of his commanding officer, etc., etc.\nThen sub-section 5 provides that:\u2014\nWhen the active militia, or any corps thereof, is so called out in aid of the civil power, the municipality in which their services are required shall pay them, etc., etc., etc.\nSub-section 6 provides for Government advancing expenses, etc.\nI have only quoted the parts of the language used that are material to test the correctness of the judgment here in question which seems to put the entire application of the section upon the meaning of the words quoted from the second sub-section. Such an interpretation would, if followed to its logical consequences be apt to reduce the whole section to a most impotent absurdity.\nIf the only person who may be requisitioned is as suggested, the senior officer nearest to the scene of the disturbance, then the captain of a company might be the only one answerable to such requisition, and his company not even all within reach of his summons and all the rest of the active militia be miles away.\nCounsel for respondent when asked how more remote forces were to be brought in if needed suggested that the local officer could call for them. By what authority he was unable to tell us. It is quite clear he would have no such authority. And no one else would until duly and properly requisitioned by the civil authority.\nAccording to the construction adopted by the court below in reversing the learned trial judge, the civil authority could not direct anyone but the senior officer nearest the scene of disturbance.\nThe language I have quoted is express in imposing the duty not only upon a single corps, but upon the \u201cactive militia\u201d and to my mind demonstrates that the contention made by respondent is untenable and unworkable.\nAll that the language of section 2 on which stress is laid to maintain this contention indicates is that magistrates and officers should each act in a reasonable and due orderly manner.\nThe locality is not defined, but the closing language of the first sub-section clearly shews that the corps need not be within the municipality.\nAnd the word \u201clocality\u201d must be given a reasonable and common sense construction.\nThe magistrates of the county of whom one may be mayor or other head of the municipality concerned are alone entrusted with the power, and they are neither confined to their own county nor to a single corps. They would certainly be expected from the language used to exercise common sense. But they are entrusted with a high duty carrying with it great power and responsibility and I do not think we can supervise their action much less reduce them to the impotent state contended for. Indeed, we have no such evidence before us as would warrant us in criticising their conduct in the premises. I presume it was what respectable men thought was reasonable and necessary to meet the emergency presented to them.\nCounsel for respondent, as he was entitled to do, raised the question of the right of the Attorney-General to sue instead of the commanding officer suing as was provided by the Act as it stood at the time in question.\nIn view of the amendment making provision for the Attorney-General suing I do not think the objection is now tenable.\nIndeed, I cannot get rid of the impression that the money being ultimately payable to the Crown it was always competent for the Attorney-General to have sued so far as the facts established that the Crown was ultimately entitled to recover.\nThe case of Crewe-Read v. Cape Breton[3] only decides that the officer suing by virtue of the statute, having died, his administratrix could revive and continue the action he had begun.\nNor can I find that the action should have been brought against the county.\nAnd if the company most directly interested in the protection of the militia are, as the factum alleges, free from taxation, I suspect that must be a situation created by respondent and not by the county.\nThe protection of property outside the city was no doubt because that was connected with the city and something the county derived no benefit from.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the Attorney-General of the Dominion to (recover a sum of $5,309.09 advanced by the Dominion Government to pay the expenses of certain militia forces requisitioned in aid of the civil power under the provision of sec 34, ch. 41, of the Revised Statutes of 1886. I think the only points that require discussion are two: first, it is said that the magistrate who professed to act under the authority of section 34 had no authority to requisition the troops that were requisitioned; and, secondly, that if they had such authority that the Attorney-General has no status to sue for the advances made. As touching the first point the facts appear to be that the magistrate requisitioned Col. McRae, of Baddeck, and Col. Irving, who was district officer commanding at Halifax for the district of Nova Scotia; troops were sent by Col. Irving from Halifax, but the troops at Baddeck, although mobilized, were not sent forward. The argument appears to be that the power of requisitioning troops given by sec. 34 applies only to troops in the locality in which the disturbance occurs or in some adjacent locality. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that locality in the second sub-section of section 34 means the locality nearest the seat of disturbance. The effect of this construction would be that the requisition to Col. Irving at all events was beyond the power of the magistrates.\nI think with great respect that it is impossible to support this view of the statute. The language of the introductory clause of section 34 is general, and whether some limitation may or may not be justified by the context or the subject-matter of the section I think it is impossible to read it in the restricted sense in which it was read in the court below. The effect of that construction would seriously limit the operation of these provisions. It would make it impossible for the magistrates to call in more than a strictly limited number (generally not more than one) of bodies of troops, no matter how inadequate such forces might be, no matter how clearly undesirable the employment of those particular forces, or any of them might be in the particular circumstances. The argument that the provisions construed as the Government contends are liable to abuse is one that no doubt deserves consideration, but, on the other hand, Parliament may have well felt that it was better to rely upon the good sense of the magistrates and the military authorities than to impose restrictions which, in easily conceivable cases, might entirely neutralize these provisions.\nThe facts bearing upon the second point are these. The \u201cMilitia Act\u201d to which I have already referred was superseded, in 1904, by a statute which was chapter 23 of the statutes of that year. That Act came into force on the 1st of November. Of the advances sued for a considerable proportion were made prior to that date. As to these advances it is contended that chapter 41 of the Revised Statutes, 1886, applies and if so the proper person to sue for them is the commanding officer and not the Attorney-General. I think this contention must be rejected for the reason advanced by Mr. Newcombe, viz., that the commanding officer, in suing for the recovery of advances under sub-section 6 of section 34 of the earlier Act, sued as trustee for the Crown, and that, consequently, the provision of the later Act, section 87, which authorizes an action on behalf of and in the name of the Crown is strictly a provision relating to procedure only.\nThis is a sufficient answer to the objection, but there is another answer which would be equally effective. There appears to be nothing in the practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to prevent the commanding officer now being added as a party (The \u201cDuke of Buccleuch\u201d[4]), and the suggestion that his claim would be barred to the Statute of Limitations, falls to the ground when one remembers that the right of action asserted by him is not on his own behalf, but on the behalf of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In the circumstances it would not be proper to impose any terms as to costs as a condition of such amendment.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below; there should be judgment for the Attorney-General with costs of the action.\nAnglin J.\u2014The court en banc, reversing the trial judge, dismissed this action on the ground that the officers on whom the requisitions calling out the militia were made were not then present at the locality of the riot or disturbance, actual or anticipated. With respect, I think the court has placed a wrong construction on the words \u201cpresent at any locality\u201d in sub-section 2 of section 34 of chapter 41 of the R.S.C. 1886. This adjectival phrase qualifies either \u201cthe senior officer\u201d or \u201cthe active militia\u201d\u2014I think the latter\u2014but it is not very material which. The \u201clocality\u201d referred to is not that where the riot or disturbance occurs\u2014there might be no active militia whatever there; the available force might be quite inadequate\u2014but that where the officer requisitioned or the body of active militia which he commanded is stationed. The phrase \u201cat any locality\u201d was used advisedly. The words which immediately follow,\nshall call out the same or such portion thereof as he considers necessary,\nobviously refer to the body of active militia under the command of the \u201csenior officer\u201d requisitioned. The contrast between the words \u201cpresent at any locality\u201d and the words,\nthe municipality or county in which such riot, or disturbance or other emergency occurs or is anticipated,\nfound in the same section, I think removes any possible doubt that the application and meaning which I give to the words \u201cany locality\u201d is what Parliament intended they should have. It follows that the requisitions addressed to Colonel Irving and Colonel McRae were within the authority conferred by section 34 of chapter 41.\nThe respondent further insists that the right of action was, by the statute in force when most of the payments were made, given exclusively to the commanding officer, who was required to sue in his own name, although payment had already been made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, R.S.C., 1886, ch. 41, sec. 34, sub-secs. 5 and 6. But by an amendment of 1904 the right to sue for the recovery of money so expended was given to His Majesty (4 Edw. VII., ch. 23, sec. 86). That right is exercisable by the Attorney-General. No new right of action was created by this amendment; no new liability was imposed. Under the former statute when the money had been paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the commanding officer who sued was bound to pay the amount recovered over to His Majesty. The statute of 1904 merely effects a change in the procedure to be followed in the recovery of the money. It was in force when the action was brought and as a statute regulating procedure applied to it. I think the right of the Attorney-General to maintain this action is clear.\nAs to the small item of expenditure incurred in protecting the source of supply of the waterworks of the Dominion Steel Company ($36) there is a little more difficulty. The source of supply of these waterworks is outside the town limit; but the works of the steel company are within the City of Sydney, and the danger to the water supply arose from rioting and disturbance within the city. It was to prevent injury likely to arise out of that rioting and disturbance that the services of the militia were required. I do not think that it is beyond the scope of the statute that the municipal corporation of the City of Sydney should be required to pay for the services rendered under such circumstances at the source of the water supply.\nI would allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the court en banc, and would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Ritchie.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.

M. MacDonald for the appellant.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 I agree, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin, that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an action brought in the name of the King, on the information of the Attorney-General, against the defendant as owner of the gasoline launch \"Thelma\" for the condemnation of the launch, a foreign vessel, her tackle and apparel, for fishing within the three-mile limit off the coast of British Columbia in contravention of the \"Customs and Fisheries Act\" of Canada.\nIt is unnecessary, in the view I take of the case, to deal with the question whether, even if within the limits, the launch when seized was engaged in fishing\u2014 the substantial question on which I rest my judgment and which gives rise to so much doubt, and difficulty is whether the \"Thelma,' when so seized, was or was not within the prohibited limits.\nThe weather on the day and at the time of the seizure was, by common consent, thick and foggy and the shore or land was not visible until the vessels were brought in quite close to it, say about a quarter of a mile.\nFishery-officer Ledwell, who made the seizure, described the weather as\nvery inclement, very dirty.You could not call it a fog, a heavy misty rain.\nHe also says that, when he boarded the \"Thelma\" and charged Captain Carlson with being within the threemile limit, the latter replied that he was not aware of it. Mr. Ledwell frankly admits that land was not in sight and that you could not form a true estimate of the location of the \"Thelma\" by the courses and distances followed by the cruiser \"Newington\" from the time she left port till the seizure took place. What he and the captain of the \"Newington\" relied upon to fix the true location of the \"Thelma,\" when seized, was the course and distance run towards the shore after the cruiser took the launch in tow and the time and speed of the vessel while so running. These, I agree, are the determining factors and the chief one is the time.\nThe location of the launch, when seized, was not buoyed for further testing and whether or not it was within the three-mile limits depends entirely upon the distance traversed by the cruiser \"Newington\" after taking the launch in tow and while she ran at full speed towards the shore.\nThe contention on the part of the Crown was that the steamer ran straight towards the shore from the time she took the launch in tow for a period of sixteen minutes, running at the speed of about eight miles an hour, and that when the captain stopped at the end of the sixteen minutes he sounded with the lead and found he was in fifteen fathoms of water, and was then about a quarter of a mile from the shore.\nUnder the weather conditions there was no other means of judging how far the \"Thelma\" was from the shore when she was seized than the test made by running the cruiser at full speed towards the shore, determining at what speed she was running, and ascertaining, as nearly as possible, the time taken to make the run.\nThe whole question depends upon the correctness of this time. If, as the Crown contends, it was sixteen minutes only, and the rate the steamer was running at was eight miles an hour and there were no distances run towards the shore after the cruiser started with the launch in tow and before the log was thrown over and also after it was read and taken in before the fifteen fathoms were sounded when the vessel was judged to be within a quarter of a mile of the shore, then it would be tolerably certain that the Crown's contention was correct and the launch, at the time she was seized, was, at any rate, not more than about two and a quarter or two and a half miles, at the outside, from the shore.\nBut, if the time during which the cruiser ran at full speed, judged to be at the rate of eight miles an hour, was twenty minutes, and not sixteen, then, making reasonable allowance for the distance the cruiser ran with the launch in tow. before the log was thrown over and also after it was taken in and the vessel slowed down and the fifteen fathoms sounding was made, at which moment Captain Halgreen judged himself to be a quarter of a mile from shore, I think the conclusion must be that, when seized, the \"Thelma\" was not within the three-mile limit. In determining whether the cruiser ran with the. \"Thelma' 'in tow for sixteen minutes or twenty minutes at full speed towards the land we are not left altogether to the conflicting judgment or memories of the witnesses.\nCaptain Ledwell, the Fishery-officer, who was, however, aboard the launch, and not in the cruiser \"Newington,\" states that he took the time with his watch in hand and that they ran in sixteen minutes at therate of eight miles an hour as he judges and, at the close of his examination, says:\u2014\nI might say that, when we started to tow the boat in, I took my watch out like.that; just as the \"Newington\" started her propeller, started to go ahead, I took my watch out and I held it in my hand until we got close in to shore then and the captain (Carlson) was standing alongside. I don't know whether he saw it or not, but I told him the time and distance.\nCaptain Carlson's account differs somewhat. He says that after the tow line was made fast to his launch the cruiser went ahead and got them under a little head-way and then went ahead \"a few hundred yards any way,\" then stopped, and then got the log ready, started again and threw the log overboard. He says, at page 95, that he was at the wheel wiith Captain Ledwell holding his watch in his hand alongside of him, and he (Carlson) looking at the clock in the pilothouse from the second time they started. He goes on to say:\u2014\nThat was just exactly half-past eleven. And, when we were going in the neighbourhood of fourteen or fifteen minutes, well, I had pretty near fifteen minutes at the time, somebody asked Mr. Ledwell how lonsr we had been going. He said, \"fourteen minutes,\" and I looked at the pilot-house clock and I had pretty near fifteen minutes. Well, after then it seemed as though the speed of the \"Newington\" became slackened up, she commenced to go slower, and at the end of seventeen minutes she was going, I should judge'under half-speed, or something like that, and I says to Mr. Ledwell, I says, \"It ought to be three miles now; we have been going nearly twenty minutes.\" So he simply looked at his watch; he didn't say how many minutes it was, and he kind of smiled, and he went across the deck and he says, \"Work under slow bell,\" and the like, and \"We are inside the headland and it would not make any difference whether you are five miles off shore, as we measure a line from, headland to headland, and you have got to be three miles outside that line.\" I said, \"I never heard of that before,\" and he said, \"That is the way we are taking measurements.\"\nHe then goes on to speak of the lowering of speed and the throwing out of the lead two or three times and then the turning of the ship towards the eastward parallel with the shore, and that, up to that time when the ship turned eastwards, they had been towing altogether twenty minutes.\nCaptain Halgreen professes to speak of the time run from a memorandum made at the time. At first I gathered that this memorandum was made by himself, but later on he explains that it was put down by the wheelsman who was in the wheelhouse while the captain was outside on the bridge in his oilskins telling him what to put down, and that the man made a mistake in his entry of the hour the steamer stopped which he, the captain, afterwards corrected.\nExhibit \"E\" reads as follows:\u2014\nExtract from daily journal, 1912, of \"Newington.\"\nWednesday, 24.\nMorning, thick fog and rain.\nLeft 7.7 a.m. and proceeded west under half speed; 9.46 spoke launch \"Vera\" of U.S.; sighted launch \"Emma,\" U.S., and warned her to keep outside 3 mile limit.

The original sheet was not produced. The copy produced was, as the captain explains, taken from the original sheet, as he says:\u2014\nI wrote it down on account of it was so wet and. the sheet I would write it on got so soiled I took it from that copy that day. You can see it was so dirty.\nThe captain put in the figures \"42\" below the figures \"39\" which had been entered by the man in the wheelhouse because the entry was wrong, but what time of the day he did this is not explained.\nI dwell upon this as showing that the captain was not relying upon any contemporaneous memorandum or entry made at the time, but upon a corrected entry made some time later in the day, no doubt honestly made, but, possibly, after conference with Captain Ledwell and others. He made the entry conform to what, in his honest belief, it should have been. Captain Halgreen states that he went by his judgment and the log; that, of course, he could not say how the engines were going; that he looked afterwards at the log and it read the ship had run just two miles; that he stopped the engines at the end of sixteen minutes, took soundings, found fifteen fathoms, and then judged himself to be within a quarter of a mile of the coast.\nHe says, at page 57:\u2014\nWhen I stopped her I stopped her from full speed ahead to stop\u2014 see.\nHe says that when the lead was hove and showed fifteen fathoms he turned the ship E.S.E. for a quarter of a mile. He does not say how far the ship ran after he gave the order to stop her before the soundings were successfully taken, remarking, however, that the quarter-mile run after he turned her was run while the ship was from full speed to stop, and that \"you can't stop a ship dead still like you stop a waggon.\"\nIt is quite plain, however, that, after the ship was stopped from \"full speed ahead\" to \"stop,\" or as the chief engineer put it, to \"half-speed,\" she continued running on her course towards the shore until the soundings had been successfully taken. James McKay, the seaman who took the soundings, explains that, at the time he took the fifteen-fathoms soundings, the vessel had stopped or slowed down, and that the shore was in sight then and, he judged, about, a quarter of a mile away. Later he explains that you could not take soundings while the vessel was going full speed and that he had taken four soundings before he got bottom. How far the vessel ran towards the shore between the order which stopped her engines, or put her at half-speed, and the first successful soundings, after three unsuccessful attempts, is not stated, but it obviously must have been some considerable distance.\nApart, however, from the evidence of the chief engineer, to which I will refer later and which seems to have been entirely overlooked by the trial judge in his oral judgment, I confess that, while entertaining much doubt, I would not have felt justified in interfering with his finding, confirmed as it was on appeal, as to the launch having been captured within the three miles from the shore.\nBut, unless this evidence of the chief engineer is to be entirely disbelieved, and there has not been a word said to throw discredit upon this officer, I cannot see how we can affirm such a finding.\nChief Engineer Wilson was in the discharge of his duty in the boiler-room all the morning of the day of the seizure, and up to 12 o'clock. It was his watch. It was his duty to make correct entries in his log kept there of the speed at which the engines were, from time to time, running, and of the moment when any changes were made in that speed, pursuant to orders from the captain. He swears he never left the engine-room at all during the whole of his watch and that he had made the entries in his log as produced by him. The custom was to make the entries on a slip kept for the purpose and copy them into the official log-book each evening. He says he did so with respect to these entries on the day in question. He knows, of course, nothing of what is taking place on deck, or can be seen from the deck, but whether his vessel is going at \"full speed,\" or \"half-speed\" or \"slow,\" or his engines are \"stopped\" altogether, it is his duty not only to know, but to record.\nI make the following extract from his evidence. After asking permission to refer to his log and saying that\nall the movements in the engine-room were placed on this paper by myself,\nhe says, in response to the question:\u2014\nQ. Give us your movements that morning?\nA. Then I can give you the whole thing. We ran full speed until five minutes past ten o'clock. At 40 past 10, we stopped to speak to the launch \"Emma.\"\nQ. What does that mean?\nA. I am referring to this because it will have some bearing upon the pressure of steam I was carrying at the time of the seizure. At 10.44 we were running at fall\u2014speed; at 11 we were running at full speed, and to orders. The orders came so quickly between 11 and five minutes past 11 it was almost impossible to give the variation of time, there were so many orders. At five minutes past 11, we were running at full speed and stopped at 11.20. At 11.25 we were running at full speed again, and at 11.45 at half-speed. We ran at half-speed until 1.45. Later, replying to the vital question:\u2014\nQ. Then, tell us how your engines were from 11.25 to 11.45?\nhe answered:\u2014\nWe were moving at full speed.\nQ. And from 11.45 to 1.45?\nA. Half speed.\nIn reply to Mr. Ritchie, he further said that he had more than 185 head of steam on between 11.25 and 11.45, and that his highest was 195.\nNow, the entry in the captain's log is that at 11.26 he took the vessel in tow and stopped at 11.39\/42. But it is somewhat indefinite as to the precise moment he meant when he \"took her in tow.\" The captain's starting time in takling her in tow is one minute later than the engineer's time when the engines were started at full speed, while the time when he says he \"stopped\" \u2014 11.42 \u2014 is three minutes before the chief engineer says he Stopped the engines at full speed. One or the other has made a grave mistake. The 'chief engineer is speaking of the actual movements of the engine and the screw and the moments of each and every change as recorded by him in his engine-room at the time. The captain speaks from a memorandum entered by the wheelsman and, some time afterwards, corrected by himself.\nFull speed for twenty minutes, from 11.25 to 11.45, would mean, at the rate the officers estimated the steamer's speed, two and a half miles. Making reasonable allowance for the distance the cruiser with the launch in tow sailed before the patent log was thrown out and began to record, and also for the distance she sailed after the \"stop\" order was given, and while the three unsuccessful attempts in throwing the lead to get bottom were being made, and the fourth successful one was made and announced, after which only the course of the vessel was changed, and adding to these distances the estimated distance of one-third of a mile from the shore, I would conclude that the \"Thelma\" was, at least, three miles from the shore when she was taken, or, at least, so very near to the three miles that it would be unsafe and unjust to condemn her.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the information with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the officer directing the seizure in question was acting in good faith and took the proper attitude to be taken in all such cases; that, if there should be found a doubt as to the distance of the fishing-vessel from the shore, the owner thereof should get the benefit of the doubt.\nAll parties concerned knew what was involved in starting for the shore to measure the distance, and, if the appellant did not take more care than he seems to have done to guard against mistakes in doing so, it must be because he assumed due and proper methods were, before his eyes, being adopted.\nLoose expressions are used which might, if standing alone, cast a doubt on the accuracy of the test applied, but the officer directing the proceedings, if in good faith, could hardly be mistaken with watch in hand, and experienced in the use of the appliances, in the result.\nThe questions involved are merely of fact, and I do not see how, if even I had great doubt, to reverse such findings.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014In such a case as this, where condemnation involves the forfeiture of the property of an alien friend and the fundamental question, though a question of fact, is that upon the answer to which depends not only the conclusion as to the acts alleged to constitute the offence charged, but the jurisdiction of the court to award the condemnation and of the legislature over the locus of the defendant's acts, I think the judgment against the defendant ought to rest upon something more solid than a measure of probability barely sufficient to sustain a verdict in an ordinary civil action in which none of these exceptional elements of controversy are present. I think, with respect, that this principle has not been kept in view; and I am constrained to the conclusion, after an examination of the evidence, that the allegations of the Crown have not been satisfactorily established.\nI agree with the judgment of my brother Davies.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although I entertained little doubt at the close of the argument that if I had been presiding at the trial of this action I should have felt obliged to hold that the Crown had not sufficiently established its case, I was not then satisfied that the conclusion of the trial judge, affirmed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, should be reversed here. But, on further reflection and study of the evidence, I have become convinced that the judgment of condemnation should not be sustained.\nThe provincial courts held that the defendant had incurred the penalty of confiscation of his 15-ton gasoline fishing-boat, the \"Thelma,\" his nets, etc., on the ground that, when the boat was arrested, he was illegally engaged in fishing within three miles of the Canadian shore. That the defendant was engaged in fishing, was, I think, a proper conclusion from the evidence under the authorities. The \"Frederick Gerring, Jr.\" v. The Queen[1]. But that the boat was, when seized, within the three-mile limit has not, in my opinion, been established with that accuracy \"and complete certainty\" which is properly required in cases where such a penalty as confiscation is the result of an adverse judgment. The \"Kitty D.\" v. The King[2].\nTo discharge the burden of establishing the location of the defendant's boat at the time of the seizure, counsel for the Crown adduced evidence on three distinct lines. First, he sought to trace the route of the Government boat, the \"Newington,\" which made the seizure, from her departure from the harbour of San Juan to the point of seizure; secondly, he endeavoured to prove the distance of the point of seizure from the coast by showing the time taken to tow the \"Thelma\" in to a point which the Crown witnesses estimate to have been a quarter of a mile from the shore and the speed at which the run towards the shore was made; thirdly, he relied upon the record made by the patent log used on the \"Newington\" while towing the \"Thelma\" in.\nAt the outset of the trial, counsel for the Crown, in his examination of the first witness, fishery officer Ledwell, endeavoured to establish the course which the Government vessel had taken in reaching the point of seizure. He must have very soon realized that in that effort he would not succeed. But, as a result of his examination of this witness and of the cross-examination both of this witness and of the next witness, Captain Halgreen of the \"Newington,\" we have laid down upon a chart what purport to be approximately the courses taken by the \"Newington\" and the point of seizure. According to what is thus laid down the Government vessel would, at the time of the seizure, have been more than three miles distant from the shore. For the Crown it is now said that the laying down of these courses is quite unreliable. Although the trial judge states that Captain Halgreen figured them out deliberately, there is no doubt that both the witnesses spoke of them as being only approximate at best, and stated their inability to locate on the chart the precise position of the Government vessel either at the time when they sighted the \"Thelma\" or when they came up with her and arrested her. I would regard this evidence as of little value in itself and something to which no attention should be paid were it not for the fact that the point of seizure thus shown on the chart agrees with what the defendant's witnesses maintain to have been the location of the point of seizure and also, approximately, with what the log of the engineer of the \"Newington\" and other evidence in the record indicate to have been the distance of that point from the shore as will be presently explained.\nThe weather at the time of the seizure and during the shoreward run which followed was foggy or misty. The \"Thelma\" was sighted when about half a mile from the \"Newington.\" Fishery officer Ledwell says that on that morning\nyou could not distinguish anything more than about half a mile.\nCaptain Halgreen says,\nJust about three-quarters of a mile, that is about all you could see ahead. Of course, neither the shore nor any landmark was visible from the place at which the seizure was made. There could be nothing in the nature of cross-bearings to assist in locating it. The spot was not buoyed as was done in the caes of the \"Kitty D.\"[3]. Perhaps it was not practicable to do so in this case. But that is not shown: and, since the failure to buoy the spot precludes all possibility of subsequently ascertaining it, the necessity for absolute accuracy and precision in making the test to determine the distance by running in to the shore was all the greater.\nWhen confronted with the difficulty that the point of seizure, as marked by him, is over 3 1\/2 miles from the shore, Captain Halgreen endeavoured to meet it by stating that the \"Newington,\" when the \"Thelma\" was sighted, in order to come up with her had run in towards the shore about 3\/4 of a mile. He evidently forgot that both he and officer Ledwell had already said that when sighted the \"Thelma\" was only half a mile off the \"Newington's\" starboard bow, and that she had not moved while the \"Newington\" was bearing down on her. The course of the \"Newington\" until the \"Thelma\" was sighted had been about parallel to the shore-line. This discrepancy rather shakes one's faith either in the reliability of Captain Halgreen's estimates of distances, on which so much depends in this case, or in his trustworthiness as a witness. Then again, in the particulars delivered on behalf of the Crown the point of seizure is stated to have been\nabout 2 1\/4 miles off shore from the mouth of the Nattinat River and about seven miles in shore from the Swift Shore light ship.\nThe point of seizure, as marked by officer Ledwell on the chart, is 4 1\/2 miles from the mouth of the Nattinat. At the trial Ledwell thought the Swift Shore light ship was about seven miles from the shore. He said he had often measured it. It is shown by the chart, however, to be 8 1\/2 miles from the shore. Yet the Crown case largely depends on the testimony of these witnesses as to distances measured by the eye.\nAccording to the log of the captain of the \"Newington,\" after she came up to the \"Thelma\" both boats lay to for 31 minutes (10.55 to 11.26) before the \"Newington\" started to tow the \"Thelma\" in towards the shore. During the first part of this period the net or seine of the \"Thelma\" was at least partly out and the current would affect the boat more on that account. The oral testimony also establishes that the boats lay to for about 30 minutes while the crew of the \"Newington\" were making preparations for the towing. Captain Halgreen makes this period 36 minutes or possibly 41 minutes. While the tide was slack at this time, according to the evidence of Captain Churchill (which is uncontradicted), there was a current at the place of seizure of which the general tendency was towards the shore, and Captain Carlson says that about the time of the seizure the wind was also blowing towards the shore, though not strongly or steadily. This evidence is also uncontradicted, although both officer Ledwell and Captain Halgreen were called in rebuttal. The \"Thelma\" was drifting shoreward during all this time. The defendants claim that there should be an allowance of three-quarters of a mile for this drifting. In the calculations of the Crown no allowance whatever is made for it. Upon the whole evidence I should be disposed to think that an allow- ance for drifting, during this 31 minutes, of one-third of a mile would not be excessive.\nThe \"Newington\" started in towards the shore with her tow-line slack. She tightened it and ran, the defendants' witnesses say, for a few minutes, and then stopped to adjust the line \u2014all this before the real start for the shore was made \u2014 before the 16 minutes run in at full speed of which the Crown witnesses speak, had begun, and, of course, also before the patent log had been put out. The defendants' witnesses estimate the distance covered during this preparatory movement variously \u2014 Captain Carlson at several hundred yards, Torrisdal at one-quarter of a mile, and Tideman at from 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The two latter witnesses probably include in their estimate the distance covered after the second or true start for the shore was made and before the patent log was thrown out. The Crown witnesses do not dispute that the \"Newington\" stopped to adjust the tow-line, but they maintain that no appreciable headway was made as a result of the first start. On the whole evidence the Crown cannot, I think, complain of an allowance being made for the distance covered in this way of about 120 yards, say one-fifteenth or .066 of a mile. Indeed, that is probably considerably underestimating it.\nAfter the tow-line had been adjusted the \"Newington\" made her real start for the run towards shore. The Crown's evidence is that, after this second start, she ran in towards shore under full speed for 16 minutes and then stopped. There is some question, however, whether the 16 minutes was not counted from the moment when the patent log was thrown into the water, which was not until the vessel was well under way. It is noteworthy that on this crucial point as to the length of time occupied in the full speed run in, on which the oral evidence is conflicting, the wheel-house log of the \"Newington\" is unreliable. The original entry is not produced. In explanation Captain Halgreen says that it was wet and soiled. What is produced purports to be a copy of the log made by the captain from notes, he says at a later hour on the day of the seizure. It shows that the towing in began at 11.26 and ended at 11.39\/42. The original entry made by the man in the wheel-house was 11.39. The captain in his evidence says that he did not write the notes himself because he was out on the bridge, that the man in the wheel-house made a mistake in putting down 11.39 instead of 11.42, which he (the captain) told him to enter. It is a little difficult to understand how such a mistake could be made. The captain adds that he himself afterwards corrected the entry by putting the 42 below the 39. He also states that the figures \"11.26,\" as they now appear in the log, were written \"11.36.\"\nThis is a little mistake here, I think that is 36. It should be 26 though.\nThis evidence requires no comment. Asked by counsel for the Crown as to the rate of speed maintained during the run in at full speed, fishery officer Ledwell says \"about 8 miles an hour, I guess,\" and Captain Halgreen, \"Well, I should judge about 8 miles an hour.\" Assistant-engineer Morrison, in answer to a question by counsel for the Crown, \"Well, give us a minimum?\" says,\nWell, I should say she ought to make 8 knots on that run.\nAccording to the evidence of inspector Ledwell, during a run on the following day, while towing the \"Thelma\" to Victoria, they made a test to determine the rate of speed which the \"Newington\" would make with the \"Thelma\" in tow. But the head of steam during the test is not given nor is there any evidence that the conditions of tide, wind and current were the same. Captain Halgreen bases his estimate of the speed, while towing the \"Thelma,\" on his experience in towing scows; Tideman, a seaman for twenty-nine years, and Torrisdal, who had been seventeen years fishing, think the \"Newington\" made 10 miles an hour while towing the \"Thelma.\" The evidence of Wilson, the chief engineer of the \"Newington,\" who was called as a Crown witness and gave his statement after making a careful scientific estimate, is that, allowing for a slightly reduced head of steam and for the drag of the tow, the \"Newington\" went towards the shore during the full speed run at the rate of 9 miles per hour-On all this evidence it would not seem to be unfair to fix the rate of speed at 8 1\/2 miles per hour. At 9 miles per hour the vessel would cover 2.4 miles in 16 minutes, at 8 miles per hour, 2.133 miles, and at 8 1\/2 miles per hour, 2.266 miles. McKay, a Crown witness, says in his direct examination that the towing in of the \"Thelma\" lasted \"about half an hour as near as I can say.\" The engine-room log, produced and vouched for by chief engineer Wilson, who made the entries himself, contains this item:\u2014\nAt 11.25 we were running full speed again, and at 11.45 half-speed.\nand the word \"Thelma\" is written under the figures 11.25, which Wilson says means \"we have taken the 'Thelma' in tow,\" as was reported to him by a man whom he had sent on deck to ascertain that fact, which indicates that he was aware of the necessity for ac- curate and careful observation. He also says that from 11.25 to 11.45 the engines were running at full speed. This evidence is given in direct examination by counsel for the Crown. If the chief engineer's entry and testimony are reliable and if his estimate of the rate of speed should be taken, the \"Newington\" towed the \"Thelma\" three miles in towards the shore before she changed from full speed to half-speed. It should be observed, however, that according to the engine-room log there was no stop of 31 minutes (10.55 to 11.26) during which, according to the captain's log and the oral testimony, the \"Newington\" lay to beside the \"Thelma.\" The engine-room log says \"full speed, and to orders 11.05 stopped 11.20.\" But the defendant has a right to expect, where so much depends upon it, that the Crown case shall be borne out by the engine-room log as well as by the captain's log and shall not rest merely upon unrecorded statements of witnesses' recollection of events and periods of time as to which there is a conflict of evidence. Both logs are in this case unreliable. One of them confirms the defendant's version of the time occupied in the run in. Captain Carlson of the \"Thelma\" says his boat was towed in towards shore for 20 minutes; and he adds that he said so to fishery officer Ledwell at the time. Earlier in his evidence he had stated that the \"Newington\" had slackened speed, after 15 minutes and, at 17 minutes, was running at half-speed. Peter Tideman, cook on the \"Thelma,\" says that he kept watch during the run in by the clock in the pilot-house; that they went at full speed for 16 minutes and then at slackened speed for between five and six minutes, at the expiration of which they could see the shore, and he adds that the 16 minutes at full speed elapsed after the patent log was thrown out. The log was not thrown out, he says, until four or five minutes after the \"Newington\" had started, when she was from 1,500 to 2,000 feet from her starting point. Torrisdal, a seaman, corroborating Captain Carlson, says that when the \"Newington\" stopped towing the \"Thelma\" in towards the shore, Captain Carlson remarked to inspector Led-well, who was standing beside him, \"We have been towing 20 minutes now.\" Upon all this evidence it is, I think, not possible to say that the time occupied in towing the \"Thelma\" in to shore at full speed was established with the precision and accuracy requisite in penal proceedings at the 16 minutes claimed by the Crown. There is the further uncertainty whether the 16 minutes, if accepted, should be computed from the moment when the \"Newington\" started shorewards the second time, or from the time when the patent log was thrown overboard. The Crown certainly cannot complain if the distance covered under full speed is calculated on the basis of a 16 minutes run at 8 1\/2 miles per hour - 2.266 miles. Making a deduction for loss in getting up speed, and no addition for the interval which elapsed between the start and the throwing out of the patent log, if the 16 minutes should be computed from the latter moment, it would seem that the distance covered in the full speed run may be fairly fixed at 2.15 miles.\nIt is also reasonably clear that, after the run in at full speed, whether it occupied 16 minutes as sworn by Carlson and stated by Ledwell and Halgreen, or 20 minutes as shown by the engineer's log, the \"Newington\" continued to move towards the shore for several minutes at slower speed. If she ran in for from four to six minutes at half speed, as Tideman says, she would cover in that time about one-third of a mile. He says she went \"about close to half a mile.\" Officer Ledwell says that, after running under full speed for the 16 minutes, the \"Newington\" stopped and the lead was then cast. McKay, the man who cast the lead, called by the Crown, says he cast it four times before he got bottom and that on the fourth cast he got it at 15 fathoms. Of course, the vessel was moving in towards shore while these soundings were being taken, though at a reduced rate of speed. Up to the time of the soundings McKay says she had been going at full speed. Captain Halgreen says that in slowing down from \"full speed\" to \"stop\" the vessel would cover a quarter of a mile. McKay, who cast the lead, says that when he got 15 fathoms on the fourth sounding the \"Newington\" had stopped. Ledwell says that after the soundings were taken the \"Newington\" again started to go ahead and that he then told the captain to stop because he thought it dangerous to take the \"Thelma\" any further towards shore. This was clearly after the 16 minutes had elapsed. Ledwell and Tideman both say so, and Captain Halgreen also says the lead was cast after the 16 minutes had expired. Taking into account what McKay says as to the four soundings made after the full speed run had been completed and while the vessel was proceeding under slow speed, what Captain Carlson says on the same point, and what officer Ledwell says as to the start to go ahead towards the shore after the soundings had been made, a movement which continued until he called out to go in no further, I would be disposed to make an allowance of one-quarter of a mile for the distance thus covered at reduced speed after the 16 minutes, or whatever longer period the full speed run occupied, had expired.\nHow far was the \"Newington\" from shore when, in obedience to officer Ledwell's order, she ceased towing the \"Thelma\" in and turned east? This point was not buoyed and no cross\u2014bearings were taken to fix it. Nor was the distance measured accurately as might have been done by sending a small boat in to the shore. No reason is given why these measures were not taken. No suggestion is made that it was not practicable to have thus ascertained with certainty and precision at what distance from the shore the towing in of the \"Thelma\" ceased. On this very important point the Crown case depends on eye measurements made in a fog by Captains Ledwell and Halgreen, assistant-engineer Morrison and sailors Kraemer and McKay, who all agree (mirabile dictu) in stating that the distance was \"about a quarter of a mile\" \u2014 modifying that statement, however, by such expressions as \" as nearly as I can judge.\" Tideman says that at the end of the full speed run he could \"see the high land\" on the shore. Kraemer, a Crown witness, says that when the \"Newington\" \"stopped,\" when they \"read the log, the two miles\" they \"could just make out the shore line\"; and he adds that they could only see a quarter of a mile that day. Now the evidence of other Crown witnesses is that they could see half a mile. They saw the \"Thelma\" at that distance. Captain Halgreen says he could see threequarters of a mile ahead. This evidence casts grave doubt on the reliability of the estimate of a quarter of a mile as the distance from the shore \u2014 made by \"optic observation,\" to quote officer Ledwell. Captain Halgreen says that, after running in, the \"New- ington\" turned along the coast at 11.42 and ran easterly for 12 minutes during which, he maintains, she covered only one-quarter of a mile ! His story is that the \"Newington\" turned east immediately upon the expiry of the 16 minutes. He excludes from consideration the four or five minutes that Tideman and Carlson say the course shoreward continued at slow speed. He ignores, if he does not contradict, Led-well's statement that after taking the soundings they again started towards the shore and turned east only when he, Ledwell, called out an order not to go further in. The log shows that the \"Newington\" stopped abreast of Tsusiat Village at 11.54. Twelve minutes \u2014 from 11.42, when the 16 minutes expired, to 11.54 \u2014 are, therefore, to be accounted for as well as the admitted registration of 2 1\/4 miles on the patent log when it was taken in, the captain says abreast of Tsusiat Village. He maintains that during that 12 minutes his boat made this quarter of a mile, at a speed of 1 1\/4 miles an hour, and suggests that the additional quarter of a mile shown by the patent log was registered during this eastward run, although his own evidence shows that the patent log will probably not register when the speed is under 2 1\/2 miles an hour. In explanation of thus moving along the coast only at the rate of 1 1\/4 miles per hour Captain Halgreen says,\nthis quarter of a mile run (was) while the ship was from \"full speed\" to \"stop.\" You can't stop a ship dead like a waggon.\nThat is quite inconsistent with officer Ledwell's evidence, confirmed by Tideman, and it scarcely accords with Kraemer's evidence. The four soundings were taken after the \"stop\" order was given and while the speed was lessening. Captain Halgreen himself says that it was after the taking of these soundings that he turned the \"Newington\" east. To take these soundings must have required several minutes \u2014 no doubt the four or five minutes to which Tideman deposes \u2014 the three or four minutes of which Carlson speaks \u2014 during which the vessel made headway towards the shore. Then there was the third start of which Led-well tells. All this occupied part of the 12 minutes period from 11.42 to 11.54 \u2014 probably nearly half of it \u2014 leaving about seven minutes for the quarter of a mile run down the shore to Tsusiat. Much the greater part, if not the whole of the last quarter of a mile of the 2 1\/4 miles shown by the patent log when it was taken in would appear to have been recorded before the \"Newington\" turned eastward.\nSpeaking of the position of the \"Newington\" when, after going this quarter of a mile, she had reached a point abreast of the village of Tsusiat, Captain Halgreen says:\u2014\nThat is the nearest we got to the coast * * * just about a quarter of a mile, I should judge, from shore.\nHow much farther out had the \"Newington\" been when she turned east? Pressed by Crown counsel on reexamination, Captain Halgreen says they were as close to the shore at the beginning of the quarter mile run to the east as they were at the end of it. He thus seeks to avoid the effect of the statement that \"the nearest point we got to the coast\" was at the end of that quarter of a mile. Captain Carlson estimates the distance from the shore when the towing in ceased at one-third of a mile. He says the shore line was visible only for a half mile, but the woods up high on the mountain in the rear could be seen a mile off. Torrisdal and Tideman say that when the \"Newington\" stopped her shoreward course they were still three-quarters of a mile from the shore. Tideman had seen the high land at the end of the full speed run. It was at the end of the run of four or five minutes at reduced speed that these witnesses say the shore was still three quarters of a mile off. It was then that the captain said they were close enough in. It was then they turned down the coast to the east. On all this evidence it can scarcely be said to have been satisfactorily established that the \"Thelma\" was towed on a course at right-angles to the coast to within a quarter of a mile from the shore. On the story of Kraemer that they could just make out the shore line, taken with Captain Halgreen's statement that they could see three-quarters of a mile and the statement of Halgreen and Ledwell that they saw the \"Thelma\" when half a mile away, and on Captain Halgreen's admission that they were nearest the shore after making the quarter of a mile easterly run, the defendants would seem to be entitled to claim that half a mile, or, at all events, the one-third of a mile which Captain Carlson estimates, should be fixed as the distance from the \"Newington\" to the shore when the run in at right-angles to the coast ended. But for the purpose of estimating the distance of the \"Thelma\" from the shore at the time of seizure I place this distance at the quarter of a mile claimed by the Crown.\nTo sum up the result of all the evidence in a manner of which I think the Crown cannot reasonbly complain we have as the outcome of the time and speed test the following:\u2014 Miles\nDrifting allowance while boats lay to for 31 minutes\n333\nPreliminary movement adjusting the towing line, etc\n066\nFull speed run \u2013 16 minutes at 8 1\/2 miles per hour, 2.266,less allowance for loss in getting up speed\n2.150\nRun at slow speed during soundings, etc\n250\nDistance from shore at stop\n250\nDistance from shore of point of seizure\n3.049\nIndeed, the defendant may have reason to complain that none of these allowances is made on a sufficiently liberal scale. For instance, he may well claim that the distance from the shore when the \"Newington\" turned east should be placed at one-third of a mile at least; that engineer Wilson's estimate of the rate of speed during the tow should be taken; and that the allowance for distance covered in preliminary movements before the 16 minutes' run began should have been at least one-eighth of a mile instead of one-fifteenth.\nThe learned trial judge did not base his judgment on the time and speed test, but he held himself bound to accept as conclusive the record of the patent log. He could \"see no evidence to offset it.\" As already stated, the patent log was put out only after the \"Newington\" had made her second start towards the shore. The allowances for drifting during the 31 minutes that the vessels lay to and for the distance covered as a result of the first start and during the adjusting movements must, of course, be made in considering the result of the patent log records as in the case of the time and speed test. To these must be added something for the distance covered from the moment of the second start until the log was thrown over. Crown counsel speaks of this as \"a short distance on\"; Captain Halgreen as an interval which \"might have been the time of 45 seconds\"; Torisdal \"about a quarter of a mile\"; and Tideman four or five minutes \u2014 1,500 to 2,000 feet. (These two latter witnesses may be including the distance covered as the result of the first start.) Tideman, however, adds:\nThey did not throw out the log until after we got a good speed.\nThe learned trial judge says that he does not discredit the evidence of the defence witnesses as untruthful, but deems it unsatisfactory because they had not the necessary skill and information to give reliable testimony. The latter part of that observation is scarcely applicable on this point. Then Captain Halgreen says:\u2014\nYou cannot count on the patent log registering when the speed is under 2 1\/2 to 3 miles an hour. * * * At four miles it will register true, but under three miles I would not be very positive of it.\nKraemer, the man in charge of the patent log, says that\nwhen the vessel is going under five or six miles, you cannot say it is registering accurately.\nThe log evidently cannot be relied upon to register fairly either while the vessel is getting up speed in starting or while it is slowing down in stopping. It would seem to be proper, therefore, to make an allowance, either for distance covered during the interval between the second start and the moment when the log was cast over, or for distance covered before a registering speed was obtained, or partly for one and partly for the other; and one-tenth of a mile would seem to be reasonable.\nThe Crown evidence is that at the end of the 16 minutes full speed run the patent log registered two miles. The accuracy of this registration is challenged. The line of the log appears to have been long enough to bring the fan or rotator at times under the \"Thelma\" and at times alongside her. There is evidence that this would make the registration slower. But I shall assume that, while the vessel was running at full speed, the log recorded accurately. When it was taken in it registered 2 1\/4 miles. Captain Halgreen says that this was after he had run one-quarter of a mile along the coast, but he also says that to run that quarter of a mile took twelve minutes \u2014 that is, at the rate of 1 1\/4 miles an hour, and at that speed, according to his own evidence and that of Kraemer the log cannot be relied on and probably would not register at all. Kraemer says that the reading of 2 1\/4 miles was \"very shortly after the reading at two miles.\" Captain Carlson says that only ten seconds elapsed between the announcement of the reading of two miles and that of 2 1\/4 miles. Kraemer says that the log was taken in after the \"Newington\" turned east, but he does not say that it was when she had stopped opposite Tsusiat. Upon all the evidence there is not the slightest doubt that after the order to slow down or stop had been given at the expiration of the 16 minutes, when the log was read and showed two miles, the \"Newington\" continued to move shoreward slowing down. During this time the soundings were taken. During at least part of it the log was recording. This fact goes far to substantiate the defendant's claim that an addition must be made to the distance covered during the 16 minutes and recorded on the patent log at 2 miles, for the further run in at slow speed. The same allowance should be made as in the previous test, viz., one-quarter of a mile. On the patent log test, therefore, we have the following result:\u2014 Miles.\nAllowance for 31 minutes drifting\n333\nPreliminary movement\n066\nWhile log not in water, or not registering\n100\nLog record during full speed run\n2.000\nRun in at slow speed during sounding and start after before Ledwell called far enough in\n250\nDistance from shore at stop, or turn\n250\n2.999\nIn regard to these allowances the defendant, as already pointed out, may well claim that some of them are not made on a sufficiently liberal scale.\nI do not wish to be understood as expressing the opinion that the evidence clearly establishes that the \"Thelma\" when seized was outside the three mile limit. That is not proved, although the balance of probability seems to be in favour of that view. On the other hand, I think it is satisfactorily demonstrated that the evidence does not establish that the \"Thelma\" was clearly within the three mile limit when seized, certainly that it fails to do so with that precision and conclusiveness which are properly demanded in a penal proceeding such as this. It may be said that the various allowances which I suggest are mere guesses. As to the quantum of each allowance that is no doubt the case. But that some such allowances should be made seems to be quite clear and the Crown has left matters in such uncertainty that I do not think it possible to say that those which I suggest are excessive. For these reasons I think judgment of condemnation should not have been pronounced. I would allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the British Columbia Court of Appeal and would direct the entry of judgment dismissing the action with costs. BRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia confirming the decision of the trial judge.\nThe questions at issue are questions of fact on which we have the unanimous findings of the courts below.\nThe contention of the respondent is that the appellant, who is a United States citizen, was fishing contrary to law within the three-mile limit of Vancouver Island.\nThe appellant claims that his vessel was outside of territorial waters. The evidence shows that, in order to ascertain which of those claims were right, the Canadian Government vessel towed the fishing launch straight to a point as close to the nearest shore as it could safely get, and measured the distance by a patent log.\nThe evidence is somewhat conflicting as to what then occurred. The learned trial judge's finding was that the \"Thelma,\" the seized vessel, was within the three-mile limit at the time she was apprehended.\nThat finding having been concurred in unanimously by the Court of Appeal, I feel that, relying on the constant jurisprudence of this court, those decisions of two courts below on a question of fact should not be disturbed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacNeill, Bird, MacDonald & Darling.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser, Reid & Wallbridge.\n[1] 27 Can.

On 26th November, 1910, R. gave C. a memorandum respecting the sale of his land, as follows: \"In consideration of a payment of $10, I agree to give to Major A. B. Carey the option of my quarter section \u2014 N.E. \u00bc of 20, Tp. 12, Medicine Hat, at the rate of $25 per acre. Balance to be paid \u2153on the last day of January of each year till paid.\" On the 20th of January, 1911, a letter was written, by C.'s solicitor, to R., as follows: \"Major Carey is prepared to make payment of one-third of purchase price, and we are anxious to close the matter out at once. We would suggest that, rather than give an agreement for sale, you execute a transfer of the land in favour of our client and take a mortgage back for unpaid balance. We would be obliged if you would let us hear from you at once. We would be pleased to prepare the necessary documents, and you can submit same to your solicitor at Medicine Hat.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (5 Alta. L.R. 125), Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the memorandum constituted an offer requiring acceptance; that the letter of the solicitor was not an unqualified acceptance of the terms of the contract such as was called for in the circumstances, and that C. was, therefore, not entitled to a decree for specific performance.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], by which, Simmons J. dissenting, the judgment of Stuart J.[2] was affirmed. The memorandum and extract from the solicitor's letter above quoted, constituted, in effect, the evidence in support of the plaintiff's claim for specific performance of an alleged agreement for the sale of the lands in question. The trial judge decided in favour of the plaintiff and ordered a decree as prayed for. This judgment was affirmed, Simmons J. dissenting, by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the appellant.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action for specific performance of an alleged contract for sale. The question is: Was there a concluded agreement between the parties ? It appears by the evidence, written and oral, that on the 26th of November, 1910, the appellant gave to the respondent a memorandum in writing, in the following terms:\u2014\nIn consideration of a payment of $10, I agree to give to Major A. B. Carey, the option of my quarter section \u2014 N.E. \u00bc of 20, Tp. 12, Medicine Hat, at the rate of $25 per acre. Balance to be paid \u2153 on the last day of January of each year till paid.\nThis written instrument contains no date, nor does it say when the first cash instalment is to be paid, but the respondent admits, in his evidence, that the first payment was to be made on the 31st of January, 1911. I read the memorandum as an offer which, to become a contract, required to be accepted, and nothing appears to have been done by the respondent to manifest any intention to accept until the 20th of January, 1911, when his solicitor wrote to the appellant to say:\u2014\nMajor Carey is prepared to make payment of one-third of purchase price, and we are anxious to close the matter out at once. We would suggest that, rather than give an agreement for sale, you execute a transfer of the land in favour of our client, and take a mortgage back for unpaid balance. We would be obliged if you would let us hear from you at once.\nThe suggested modification of the terms of the option required the assent of the appellant. No answer was given to this communication, although acknowledged to have been received within the time, and no tender of the cash payment was made until the 20th of March following.\nI cannot find in the solicitor's letter evidence of such an unqualified acceptance of his offer as the appellant was entitled to in view of the speculative character of the market in which the transaction took place, and there is no justification of the respondent's failure to pay the first instalment when it fell due.\nBriefly, my opinion is that, in the absence of unqualified notice of acceptance within the time (en temps utile), and in view of his neglect to pay or tender the money at the date fixed for the first payment, the relation of vendor and purchaser was never established between the parties and, as there was no concluded contract of sale, the foundation of an action for specific performance fails.\nI would allow the appeal.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting) agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent claims to be entitled to specific performance of an alleged contract of sale and purchase which rests upon the following memorandum written by him in his note-book and signed by the appellant Roots:\u2014\nIn consideration of a payment of $10, I agree to give to Major A. B. Carey the option of my \u00bc section, N.E.\u00bc of 20, Tp. 12, Medicine Hat, at the rate of $25 per acre. Balance to be paid \u2153 on the last day of January each year till paid.\nE. H. Boots.\nThis remarkable document, it may be observed, can only be made operative and given some sensible meaning by virtue of the implications therein.\nTo begin with, it does not express that the option is to be one of pre-emption. That may be (implied in the phrase \"at the rate of $25 per acre.\" No time is expressed for its acceptance. That also must be supplied toy implication. Is it to be taken as within a reasonable time ? Or is it to be determined by acceptance on the part of the respondent on or before the 31st of January then next, or acceptance and payment of a cash instalment before that date ?\nIt is clear from the evidence of the respondent that the transaction took place in a speculative market. And that being the case, if a reasonable time is taken as a test, I think that the respondent was too late on the 20th of March following with his then tender of the cash instalment and a binding agreement signed by himself accepting the proposal.\nIf it is, however, to be taken that an acceptance and payment of the cash instalment on or before the 31st of January are implied as conditions precedent, then, clearly, the respondent is out of court, for no money was offered till the 20th of March. Looking at the surrounding circumstances, I incline to the opinion that such payment on or before the 31st of Janu- ary, or tender thereof and acceptance of the proposal, were implied.\nThe parties were entire strangers to each other, and the nominal payment of ten dollars on a transaction of such magnitude suggests, in such case, that it was within the reasonable expectation of the appellant (Boots) that he should not be long bound until something more was forthcoming than mere acceptance by one who might, for aught he knew, be a man of straw.\nBut, even if this be not quite clear, surely Boots was entitled, at least, to an absolute acceptance before he could be held bound by the establishment of the relation of vendor and purchaser between him and the respondent. Such relationship has always been held as necessary before the offer can be treated as a concluded dealing to which to apply the principle and authorities upon which courts have proceeded in holding that non-payment on the days named was not necessarily fatal.\nIf the 31st of January is to be taken as the time fixed for the cash payment, then it clearly would be implied that before any such principle can be resorted to enabling waiver or postponement of such fixed date, there must have been ere that an unconditional and absolute acceptance.\nBut it may be said that this phrase:\u2014\nBalance to be paid \u2153, on the last day of January each year till paid\nhas no relation to the cash payment and that, for this, no time was fixed.\nI, however, interpret this language so used, under the surrounding facts and circumstances, as clearly pointing to the cash payment of one-third on the 31st of January as being intended thereby. And, although the interpretation of the writing cannot be affected by the respondent's opinion, it is satisfactory to find from his evidence that this interpretation does him no injustice. He says:\u2014\nQ. You were to pay the money by the 31st of January ?\nA. Yes; but there was no discussion about that in that way. * *\nQ. When was your money to be paid over ?\nA. On the 31st of January.\nIt may also be fair to infer such was also the understanding of Roots.\nIn the case of Morrell v. Studd & Millington[3], at page 658, Astbury J. points out that when a written instrument contains no date parol evidence may be given to shew when it was written and from what date it was intended to operate.\nIn short, I conclude that, in any case, the appellant, Boots, was undoubtedly entitled to an absolute unconditional acceptance on or before the 31st of January, or to be thenceforward released from his offer.\nAll he got was the following letter:\u2014\nCalgary, Canada, Jan. 20, 1911\nR. Roots, Esq.,\nMedicine Hat, Alta.\nRe Major A. B. Carey and yourself \u2014 our file 9,588.\nDear Sir,\u2014We are acting for Major A. B. Carey who secured an option from you on the north-east quarter of section twenty (20), Township twelve (12), Range five (5), West of the 4th Meridian.\nAccording to the terms of option, Major Carey has to pay one-third of the purchase price on the last day of January each year till the purchase price is paid in full, the purchase price for the land being at the rate of $25 per acre.\nMajor Carey is prepared to make payment of one-third of purchase price and we are anxious to close the matter out at once.\nWe would suggest that rather than give an agreement for sale, you execute a transfer of the land in favour of our client and take a mortgage back for unpaid balance. We would be obliged if you would let us hear from you at once. We will be pleased to prepare the necessary documents and you can submit same to your solicitor at Medicine Hat.\nYours faithfully,\nH.A.A.\/A.M.C. H. A. Allison.\nThis was received by Boots within the time, but never answered. Can it be said that this forms an acceptance of the offer ? Let us test it by seeing how Roots could have availed himself of it in any way.\nCould he have acted upon this and succeeded in an action by him against the respondent for specific performance of the contract ?\nIt seems to me it would have been impossible for him to have succeeded in such an action; apart altogether from any question of the Statute of Frauds.\nThe letter is framed in such equivocal terms that it could not be said to evidence a contract, sought to be specifically performed, such as Lord Hardwicke said when remarking that\nevery agreement of this kind ought to be certain, fair and just in all its parts. See Fry on Specific Performance (5 ed.), part iii., ch. 3, p. 165.\nIt may have been the purpose of the solicitor writing this letter, in the event of the non-acquiescence of Boots in all he suggested therein, to recede. It may have been that he intended the perfectly proper suggestion he made to be only tentative. How could any court reading the letter say otherwise ?\nHow could any court say that the respondent intended thereby, if and when he found this modification impossible, to submit to the obvious risks and embarrassments of carrying out this contract as set forth in the meagre terms of the option.\nThis letter was, evidently, an effort to extricate the respondent from the consequences of his foolish form of contract.\nIt seems to me clear that no action for specific performance would lie in such a case; even if the requirements of the Statute of Frauds were waived and merely the question of a contract or no contract raised.\nI have not only considered the cases cited to us, but also a great many more, in the hope of meeting something like this case. I have failed to find one where such an acceptance has been found effective on such a basis as rested upon herein.\nNumerous cases can be found wherein mere notice of acceptance of an offer has been held sufficient.\nBut, in all these the terms of the contract, either expressly or impliedly, when read in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances, including in many cases the actual dealings of the parties, clearly pointed to notice of acceptance as all that was required to make effective the establishment of the relation of vendor and purchaser as between the parties.\nThis peculiarly ambiguous form of option now in question does not lend itself to such a method of dealing.\nI think it called for an express and absolutely unconditional acceptance of the proposal to make it effective.\nAnd it is to be observed that the solicitors of the respondent in this case, when it came to a question of closing the matter, adopted, by tendering an agreement executed by the respondent, this very method.\nThe tender thus made was, I must hold, too late.\nIt is not necessary to decide whether or not the acceptance must, in such a case as this, comply with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds and bind the acceptor in that sense. I incline to think the acceptance in such a case as this should so comply. All I am, however, holding is that a contract is needed and here there was none.\nI have purposely abstained from heretofore entering upon the conduct of the appellants in going through the form of Roots selling to Brown.\nIt seems to me that this cannot have anything to do with the disposal of the merits of the case.\nI can conceive of such conduct having influenced one in the position of the respondent, and thus become an element to consider.\nBut the respondent frankly says, in regard thereto, as follows:\u2014\nQ. When did you discover that the defendant Brown had intervened ?\nA. It was after the last day of January, but I cannot give you the date without reference to correspondence.\nCertainly he was not influenced, within the time limit in question herein by such transactions as the appellant entered into.\nIt appears that the respondent had, on 3rd December, after getting this option on the 26th of November, registered a caveat to protect it. And, on the 26th of January, Brown's solicitor mailed to the respondent's solicitors a notice calling upon them to proceed to enforce same.\nSo far from that toeing an excuse for not acting more promptly, it seems to me it ought to have operated, if properly heeded, as an incentive to take steps to make the acceptance of the option by respondent fall within the time which I hold he was limited to.\nThe conveyance to Brown was subject to the rights of the respondent, A tender of acceptance of the option and of the cash payment ought (as best answer to Brown's solicitor) to have been made to Roots and, possibly, as a precaution, also to Brown as his assignee. There was ample time (if mail, as is to be presumed, in due working order) to have done something on or before the 31st of January, but nothing was done. And there is no evidence that the respondent's solicitors knew of the transaction between the appellants. For aught that appears, the claim by Brown might have rested on an independent title altogether.\nWe may surmise they searched the registry, but, if so, they acted rather as if abandoning any claim for their client than otherwise. In this whole phase of the matter we are left entirely to conjecture.\nI submit, therefore, we are bound to look to the actual knowledge of the respondent and the time thereof relative to any contention on his behalf founded upon the conduct, or misconduct, if you will, of the appellants, as dispensing with anything implied in the contract. That, I repeat, was after the respondent's rights had ceased. I am unable to see what right any one can rest upon the misconduct of another unless by way of clear proof that it has misled him.\nI may respectfully observe that the judgment providing for interest or possession seems to savour of making a contract and not that exercise of discretion the court has in such cases.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the rights of the respondent lapsed on the 31st of January, 1911, for non-compliance with the conditions of the memorandum signed by the appellant in November, 1910. From the beginning the respondent has put forward and acted upon the view that this memorandum constituted an offer by the appellant which was to be open for acceptance until the end of January, 1911; and the basis of his case is that this offer was accepted by a letter addressed to the appellant on the 20th of January. As his case was presented both in the courts below and here it must fail, if that letter was not an unqualified acceptance of the appellant's offer. The memorandum of November is in the following terms:\u2014\nExhibit 1.\u2014In consideration of a payment of $10 I agree to give to Major A. B. Carey the option of my \u00bc section, N.E. \u00bc of 20, Tp. 12, Medicine Hat, at the rate of $25 per acre. Balance to be paid \u2153 on the last days of January each year till paid.\nE. H. Boots.\nConstruing this memorandum as the respondent construes it, as expressing an offer to enter into a contract of sale and purchase on the terms stated, it seems to me that the letter of the 20th of January was not an acceptance of that offer. I take it to be indisputable that an acceptance, in order to be effective, must be an unconditional acceptance in the sense that the person to whom the offer had been made declares his intention presently to enter into a contract with the offeror in the terms of the offer.\nNow, the last paragraph of the letter in question is in the following terms:\u2014\nWe would, suggest that rather than give an agreement for sale, you execute a transfer of the land in favour of our client and take a mortgage back for unpaid balance. We would be obliged if you would let us hear from you at once. We will be pleased to prepare the necessary documents and you can submit same to your solicitor at Medicine Hat.\nYours faithfully,\nH.A.A.\/A.M.C.\nH. A. Allison. This paragraph seems clearly enough to amount to a statement that the writer considers Something more must be clone before any of the purchase money is to be paid. It implies very plainly indeed that Boots is to be called upon to execute an agreement for sale. And there can be no manner of doubt that this was entirely in accordance with the expectation of Carey and with the advice which Mr. Allison, the writer, had given to Carey already. It is stated by Carey in his evidence in the most unmistakable way that he did not expect any part of the purchase money to be paid until some further document had been signed by Roots. The memorandum in his possession, he says, was not, as evidence of his interest, sufficiently complete for the purpose of enabling him to dispose of that interest with facility, and he was, of course, as he admits, buying the property only with the object of selling it again at a profit in the immediate future. Carey saw Mr. Allison the day after the memorandum was signed and the subsequent correspondence between them shews that Carey's views, were understood by Allison at the time and shared by Him. In a letter written on the 21st of January, Allison says:\u2014\nExhibit 10.\nJanuary 21, 1911.\nMajor A. C. Carey,\n209 Lendrum St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\u2014Referring to your letter of the 11th inst. and my reply thereto, I beg to say that I infer from your letter that you do not desire to pay for land in full, especially as option does not say anything in regard to interest, and that you only desire to pay one-third of the purchase price and enter into an agreement for sale, or accept title and give a mortgage for unpaid balance.\nThe subsequent proceedings shew that Mr. Allison fully realized the importance of getting from Roots a document more precise and more serviceable for Carey's purposes than the one he already had.\nTo return to the letter of the 20th of January: The last paragraph being such as it was, let us read the preceding paragraph in connection with it.\nMajor Carey is prepared to make payment of one-third of purchase price and we are anxious to close the matter out at once.\nThe writer, in this paragraph, does not declare in terms that he accepts the offer or that he there and then binds himself to a contract in the terms of the offer. Then, is an acceptance of the offer necessarily implied in the statement that Carey is prepared to pay one-third of the purchase price, and that the solicitors are anxious to \"close the matter out\" at once ? There seems to be no such implication. The letter is not accompanied by a cheque for the instalment of the purchase money which, assuming the offer accepted, would be payable on the 31st of January, and the letter does not appear to have reached its destination until the 24th of January. In the circumstances \"we are anxious to close the matter out at once,\" especially when, taken with the paragraph to which I have just referred, would seem calculated to\" convey an intimation that, in the view of the respondent's solicitors, the payment of one-third of the purchase money to which the letter refers was a part only of some operation described as \"closing out the matter,\" which operation would involve the execution of some additional document. In a word, I do not think this letter does express unequivocally an intention to assume simpliciter the obligations involved in the acceptance of the offer, viz., to pay the residue of the purchase money according to the terms stated; and, looking at all the circumstances, I think the proper inference is that it was not intended to do so.\nOn this ground alone, I think the appeal ought to be allowed.\nThere is, however, another possible construction of the memorandum of November on which, perhaps, something ought to be said. It seems capable of being read as intended to embody a present agreement in consideration of the payment of ten dollars on the part of Roots to convey to Carey the lands mentioned, on the payment of the purchase price according to the terms stated. According to this view, the document would express the terms of a concluded bargain under which Carey had assumed no obligation for the future. On this construction of the document, punctual performance by Carey of the conditions as to payment according to the letter of the agreement would be an essential condition of his right to demand a conveyance; and as the payment due on the 31st of January was not made, it would he incumbent upon the respondent to establish facts precluding the appellant from insisting upon the strict performance of the condition. The learned trial judge appears to have held that, inasmuch as Roots had, in December, conveyed the land to the defendant Brown, he had thereby disabled himself from carrying out the contract and that this would be sufficient to excuse the respondent from the strict performance of the condition. It may very well be that on discovery of the conveyance to Brown, the respondent could have treated the execution of the conveyance as a breach of the contract embodied in the memorandum of November and have sued for damages; but the respondent comes into court declaring that he has a subsisting and binding agreement of sale and purchase; and non-performance of one of the essential conditions of his rights under that contract must be fatal to him unless he can establish some valid ground of dispensation. The fact that the appellant has made default in the performance of his obligations even though it should be of such a character as to entitle the respondent to treat the agreement as rescinded, does not afford such a ground unless the respondent can also shew that he was thereby prevented from performing the condition in respect of which he is in default himself. The respondent has made no attempt to shew that. We do not know even that he was aware of the fact of the conveyance having been made before the 31st of January. If he did, as Chief Justice Harvey appears to assume, receive notice of the conveyance, there was nothing to prevent him paying the money to Brown, as he clearly would have been entitled to do. Ex parte Rabbidge[4], at p. 370; Re Taylor[5], at page 573. If he was not aware of it, then there is no explanation of his failure to pay Roots which would have been perfectly safe, of course, in absence of any intimation from Brown that he had become the owner of the property. In my opinion, the truth is, as I have already intimated, that, on the 31st of January, when the first instalment of the purchase money (became due, the respondent had no intention of taking up the option unless he obtained some further instrument which would afford entirely satisfactory evidence of a concluded agreement of sale and purchase, having regard to the object he had in view, viz., a re-sale of the property at the first favourable opportunity. It ought further to be observed that the respondent does not by his pleadings allege that he was prevented from performing his condition by the act of the appellant or that the appellant's conduct was such as to preclude him from alleging non-performance of the condition. He alleges a contract concluded by the acceptance (so called) of the 20th of January. The paragraphs of the statement of claim bearing upon this point are paragraphs 4, 5, and 6, as follows:\u2014\n4. Prior to the 31st of January, A.D. 1911, the plaintiff duly accepted the said option or agreement.\n5. The said defendant Roots refused to carry out the terms of the said option or agreement, and, by transfer bearing date the 3rd day of December, A.D. 1910, transferred said land to the said defendant Brown, which said transfer was registered in said land titles office on the 17th day of December, at 12.40 p.m., as 1,659 AF., and the defendant Brown thereby became and still is the registered owner of said land.\n6. On the 21st day of March, A.D. 1911, the plaintiff tendered the defendant Roots an agreement for sale and purchase in duplicate, covering the said lands and embodying all the terms of said option or agreement, both copies of which said agreement for sale and purchase. were duly executed by the plaintiff, and, at the same time, tendered to the said defendant Roots the sum of $1,347.19 and demanded execution of said agreement for sale and purchase, and the said defendant Roots thereupon refused to execute said agreement and to accept the said sum of $1,347.19.\nNo amendment was asked for at the trial and I am unable to find, from a careful perusal of the record, that it was suggested at the trial that any act done by the appellant had prevented the performance of the condition by the respondent. It is important to note this for this reason. In the court of appeal, the learned Chief Justice appears to have considered he was justified in inferring that the notice sent by Brown to the respondent was the cause of the failure on the part of the respondent to pay the purchase money. I have already said that, in my opinion, such is not the proper inference from all the evidence. What I now desire to emphasize is that no such inference ought to be drawn unless it were clear that all the material evidence was before us, as the point was neither pleaded nor was the evidence directed to it at the trial.\nIn these circumstances I think the appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014I regard the plaintiff's solicitor's letter of the 20th of January, 1911, as an unconditional acceptance of the option given to the plaintiff by the defendant. The mere suggestion that the transaction should be carried out by the exchange of a deed and mortgage did not make the acceptance conditional. The contention that it did is purely an afterthought.\nIt was not so regarded at the time. As the defendant, Roots, himself admitted on his examination for discovery, he proceeded, on a statement of Brown, to whom he had resold the land before the 20th of January, that the option given Carey was no good, and he adds that his sole ground for repudiating his contract with Carey was that he was obtaining $1,000 more for the land from Brown.\nPayment of the money due on the 31st of January, 1911, was not a condition of a valid acceptance under the terms of the option. From the time of the receipt by the defendant of the letter of the 20th of January, the relation of vendor and purchaser subsisted between the parties.\nTime was not expressly made of the essence of the agreement so constituted. But if, for any reason, it should be deemed to be so, I am of the opinion that the defendant waived tender of the instalment due on the 31st of January. He handed over to Brown the plaintiff's letter of the 20th of January telling him that it was his business to attend to it. Brown, on the 26th of January, caused a notice to be sent by mail to Carey requiring him to take proceedings within sixty days to establish his right to maintain a caveat which he had lodged. The Chief Justice, sitting in full court, expressed the view that Brown's notice reached the plaintiff's solicitors on or about the 28th of January. That notice informed the plaintiff that Roots had transferred his interest in the land to Brown and that the plaintiff's rights under his own option were contested. It was tantamount to a repudiation of Roots's contract with the plaintiff and, under the circumstances, may well be regarded as the act of Boots himself. I think the plaintiff's right of action accrued immediately upon this notice being given and that he was not obliged to make tender before bringing it. Tender was in fact made on the 20th of March. The reason for the delay is not explained though it is more than suggested that an explanation might have been given by they plaintiff's solicitor, who was, unfortunately, ill and not available as a witness.\nIn my opinion, there was a binding contract, and no good reason has been shewn why it should not be carried out.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 5 Alta.

In the subordinate lodge of which C. was a member it had for some time been the practice of its financier to receive such payments fifteen days later than the thirty days so limited and, if then paid, members were not reported as having been in default and, ipso facto, under suspension according to the regulations provided by the constitution and by-laws incorporated in the certificate whereby the indemnity was secured. For several years the financier of the subordinate lodge had habitually received these payments from C. at his residence, on or about the last day of this extended term. Seven days after the expiration of the thirty days for payment of the last assessment, and while it was still unpaid, C. died and, on the following day, the overdue assessment was paid to the local financier and a receipt therefor granted by him. The Grand Treasurer of the Society refused to accept this payment on the ground that C. was then under suspension and was not a member in good standing at the time of his death. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 21 K.B. 541), Duff J. dissenting, that by the course of conduct in the subordinate lodge, of which the Grand Lodge was aware, the condition as to prompt payment had been waived, that C. remained in good standing until the time of his death and that the death indemnity was exigible by the beneficiaries.

Wolfe (95 U.S.R. 326); and Redmond v. Canadian Mutual Aid Association (18 Ont. App. R. 335), referred to.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Brodeur J.\u2014As no place of payment had been indicated, according to the law of the Province of Quebec (art. 1152 C.C.), assessments were payable at the domicile of the assured; consequently, owing to the practice which had prevailed as to the receipt of payment at C.\u2019s domicile and because no demand for payment had been made at such domicile, there had been no default on the part of C. and he had not become suspended at the time of his death.\nPer Duff J., dissenting.\u2014Neither the Grand Lodge nor the subordinate lodge or their officials had power to waive the conditions as to payment prescribed by the constitution and by-laws and the certificate of membership of C.; these instruments constituted the contract of insurance and sufficiently designated the office of the financier of the subordinate lodge as the place where payment of the assessments was to be made; even if article 1152 C.C. applies, no notification was given or proof made conformably to article 1164 C.C., and consequently, failure to make payment of the assessment due within the thirty grace days, at the office of the subordinate lodge, worked a default and, ipso facto, the suspension of membership, and, therefore, C. was not in good standing at the time of his death so as to entitle the beneficiaries to the indemnity according to the regulations of the society. Held, further, per Duff J.\u2014As the member must be presumed to know the limitations of the authority of the Grand Lodge, the subordinate lodges, and the officials of each of them, as determined by the constitution and by-laws, the ostensible authority of officials cannot, for any relevant purpose, be of wider scope than the actual authority which is defined specifically and exhaustively by the constitution.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Dunlop J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was maintained with costs.\nThe action was brought by the beneficiaries named in a beneficiary certificate issued by the defendants, a mutual benevolent society, the late Joseph P. Clarke, deceased, a member of a subordinate lodge, constituted by the Grand Lodge of the defendants, which was formerly known as \u201cThe Ancient Order of United Workmen of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces,\u201d the certificate in question, together with the Constitution and by-laws of the society, being, in effect, a contract of life insurance securing to the beneficiary an indemnity of $2,000 payable upon the death of the member provided he was in good standing in the order at the time of his death.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nT. P. Butler K.C. and E. Lafleur K.C. for the appellants.\nR. C. McMichael K.C. and R. O. McMurtry for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The contract here is to be found in the certificate and the application for membership and both make it a condition that, if the assessments are not paid the policy lapses; the payment of the premium is made a condition precedent to the continuance of the liability, or, in other words, to be entitled to the benefits on the policy a member must be in good standing at the time of his death. Clarke, the beneficiary, died on the 7th of September, 1908, and the question is: What was his position at that time with respect to the society? It is admitted that the assessments for August, 1908, were not paid, and it was argued on behalf of the society, that, in consequence, he was not in good standing, and his heirs are not entitled to collect the benefits sued for. This is a good defence, unless, as found in the courts below, Clarke was not in default, because it was usual and customary for the financier of the various lodges to receive from their members payment of their monthly dues and assessments after the expiration of the days of grace prescribed by the certificate. There are concurrent findings to that effect in both courts below and those findings are fully borne out by the evidence. Leroux, the financier, testifies that the larger proportion of the members\u2019 assessments were paid after the expiration of the thirty days and within the first fifteen days of the following month. It is admitted that the settled practice was not to send in the financier\u2019s report, as required by the conditions of the certificate, at the end of the month for which the assessments were due, but fifteen days later, and it is explained that this practice arose out of the fact that the members were usually in arrears in the payment of their assessments. Mr. Patterson, who describes himself as the \u201cGeneral Manager of the Society,\u201d admits the existence of this practice and will not deny that it is attributable to the cause assigned by the financier, i.e., to the prevailing custom of extending the days of grace within which members might pay their assessments. Patterson\u2019s letter to the financier, written after he heard of Clarke\u2019s death, is not to be explained on any other assumption. Clarke died within the extended period of grace.\nThere is this additional fact to he considered: there is no provision in the contract with respect to the place of payment of those assessments, in which case they should be collected from the beneficiary at his domicile under the law of Quebec where the contract was made and the society carried on its operations under a charter or licence obtained in the province. (Art. 1152 C.C.) It was proved beyond all doubt that the practice was to collect the assessments from the members, in which case the insured had the right to rely on that practice. It is also clear, on the evidence, that Patterson, the \u201cGrand Recorder,\u201d received those assessments as they were paid, after the expiration of the delay with, I am satisfied, knowledge of all the circumstances. I do not think the Society can now be heard to deny that the financier, the agent, whose special duty was to collect the assessments, had the authority to extend the delay: Nicholson v. Piper[2]. In the course of business, as carried on with the knowledge of those in authority, Leroux had the power to do what he did. I am of opinion that, in this case, the Society must be held to have adopted his act: Wing v. Harvey[3]. It is the law that when the practice of collecting the assessments in insurance matters is well established, the beneficiary is entitled to rely upon it, and there can be no default or forfeiture if a demand is not made on him. Planiol, vol. 2, No. 2159, says:\u2014\nLa r\u00e9siliation ou la suppression de l\u2019assurance n\u2019ont lieu qu\u2019au cas o\u00f9 la prime arri\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e9tait portable, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire qu\u2019elle devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par l\u2019assur\u00e9 au domicile de l\u2019assureur ou de ses agents. D\u2019ordinaire les compagnies stipulent que les primes seront portables, mais comme elles ont l\u2019habitude de faire encaisser les primes \u00e0 domicile par leurs agents, pour \u00eatre plus s\u00fbres de leurs rentr\u00e9es, la jurisprudence d\u00e9cide que cette circonstance change la nature de la prime qui, de portable qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019apr\u00e8s la police, devient qu\u00e9rable (tr\u00e8s nombreux arr\u00eats depuis plus de cinquante ans: Cass. 21 ao\u00fbt, 1854; D., 54.1.366; S.V., 54.1.359; Cass. 31 janvier, 1872; D., 73.1.86; S.V., 75.1.113). Cette jurisprudence a \u00e9t\u00e9 pendant longtemps tr\u00e8s \u00e9nergiquement combattue par les compagnies; elle n\u2019est plus discut\u00e9e aujourd\u2019hui. Vide Laurent, vol. 16, No. 182, page 245; Fuzier-Her-man, vo. \u201cAssurance,\u201d nos. 697 et seq.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants are a fraternal society carrying on a life insurance business. They were, as many of these societies, constituted by a constitution which vested the supreme authority in a Grand Lodge which was enabled thereby to charter subordinate lodges with definite powers.\nThe members of these subordinate lodges managed the details of their business by acting within the powers so granted. These members were in this instance enabled to obtain life insurance by different plans, of which the one now in question provided for monthly payments of a fixed sum according to the age of the members; to be advanced, however, at the end of each successive period of five years during the life of the member.\nThe payments were made to the officer of the local lodge called its \u201cfinancier.\u201d No place of payment was fixed though, according to the practice in many instances, they were made at the lodge-room.\nThe monthly payments are spoken of as assessments and as having been levied. This seems to me rather an inapt way of expressing the substance of the transaction.\nI rather think there are insurance societies or companies which proceed upon the basis of making good the losses sustained by a varying payment commensurate with the loss to be made up, and in such cases these terms might be apt ones to use.\nBut when the monthly payment was fixed and to be progressively increased by a mere mathematical rule, as here, other considerations are applicable to such a system than those carried on upon the basis I have just suggested as possible.\nThe Grand Lodge officers, each month, published in a paper called \u201cThe Protector,\u201d mailed to each member, a list of these monthly dues, by way of reminding the members of their respective amounts of dues.\nThese monthly dues became payable on the first of each month and, according to the term of the constitution, should have been paid within thirty days thereafter.\nThe Grand Recorder of the Grand Lodge was, to use his own language,\npractically you might say the manager of the institution in the Province of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces.\nThis Grand Recorder tells us a practice grew up of his sending out, about the twentieth or twenty-fourth of the month, to each of the financiers of the local lodges a form on which was entered the list of the members in each lodge with the amount payable by each for that month.\nOn this form the financier was expected to fill in the respective amounts paid him by each member, and such facts as the suspension or death or withdrawal of any member, and when so completed, to return it with the money collected to the Grand Recorder. The system was simple and, if acted upon promptly, brought under the eyes of this manager of the institution exactly how each member stood.\nIn the local lodge now in question there were some thirty to forty members, no doubt slightly varying from time to time.\nThe number ran up into the hundreds in some of the local lodges.\nBut, in any case, there does not seem to have been any large amount of clerical work involved in completing the return after the payments were made. So far as I can see there was nothing involved, in all this but a few hours\u2019 labour next day after the end of the month, yet, for some reason or other, as much as fifteen days was allowed for it, at other times ten days, and at the time of the trial of this case, eight days was fixed for such returns. At the time we are concerned with, it was fifteen days.\nI will advert to the bearing of all this presently.\nThe late Mr. Clarke had entered \u201cColumbus Lodge, No. 26,\u201d on the 15th of December, 1896, and continued as a member till death, save one or two suspensions which are now out of the case or at least are not made part of the defence herein\u2014and the alleged suspension of September, 1908.\nHe died, suddenly, on the 7th of that month and a friend paid, next day, the sum due by him for the month of August to a person acting for the financier in his absence. The appellant, the Grand Lodge, refused to accept this money from the financier, or recognize payment, claiming that the insurance had ceased under and by virtue of the terms of article 98 of the Constitution, which was as follows:\u2014 98. Unless otherwise announced by the Grand Recorder, either in the official organ of Grand Lodge, or by special notice, it is understood that an assessment is levied and it is hereby declared that an assessment is due and payable to the financier of his lodge by each member of the Order on the first day of each month unless he be notified to the contrary and any member making default for thirty days to pay the same, shall ipso facto be deemed suspended from all privileges of the Order, and his beneficiary certificate shall thereby lapse and become void.\nThe learned trial judge and the court of appeal have held that by virtue of a long course of dealing adopted by the parties this cannot furnish a bar to recovery.\nIt has been argued, with great force, before us that the language of this rule is so explicit and the limitation of the authority of the financier of the Columbus Lodge, No. 26, so clear that neither could this term of the constitution be varied nor the authority of the financier be so extended as to justify its variation.\nI may observe that this Constitution, of which we have heard so much, seems to me nothing more nor less than a contract which the association and those applying for membership therein each undertook to observe.\nAnd I would further observe that the association, acting by and through its duly constituted officers, may by its course of conduct in its relations with its members as their insurer or with other persons in any of its dealings with them vary the terms of any contract not requiring by law to be written or may vary the mode of carrying same out; so long as not departing from the ordinary lines of conduct necessary to the success of its business as an insurer or not in absolute violation of the organic terms of the instrument under which it is operating. Let us, therefore, see just what this article 98 says and implies.\nIt expressly provides for the possible case of a \u201cspecial notice\u201d and the case of a member being \u201cnotified to the contrary\u201d of the general rule that payments were to be made as specified in the rate table.\nSurely if anything ever can be implied, it is implied in this very article, that the Grand Recorder may so notify and that If lie did, even if in excess of authority I submit, those insuring and relying upon his express notice are entitled to have his notification observed.\nNay, more, I submit it is implied thereby that in some such cases it is to be presupposed that he had authority for so acting.\nI am not concerned with reconciling all the terms of this instrument. I am only concerned to know that it clearly never was intended that the hands of all the officers acting under it were so tied that they could not, for what seemed to them good and sufficient reasons, change the terms of the time of payment.\nOnce we thus, by the manifest implication that some of the administrative officers had such powers, get rid of the need of all or a majority even of the members of the association sanctioning such proposals we have the very ordinary case of the conduct of the executive alone to consider.\nThat an executive so empowered can bind by their conduct those it represents in carrying out its contracts and its contractual relations with others, does not seem to me to need argument. Now let us see how little there was to do or be left undone herein as between appellants and those it insured.\nThe two last lines sound very formidable to one who does not stop to consider. They admittedly mean that a man may become ipso facto suspended at midnight, and next morning pay a trifling sum and be ipso facto restored.\nThis is not the case of requiring to consult anyone or ask his leave or be examined by a medical man or, in short, anything but the awakened will of him most concerned. It is not the case which article 107 is evidently aimed at.\nIts whole purpose is evidently to hold the lash over the laggard\u2014nothing more\u2014unless he actually wishes to withdraw. To say that the waiver of such a term of this contract is something beyond the competence of the executive, seems to me idle.\nThe grave question is whether or not the executive did in fact waive it and to the extent claimed and in such deliberate fashion by their long course of conduct as to preclude them from setting up herein the contrary.\nAlthough Patterson, the Grand Recorder, was acting with and under the directions of an executive committee, we must not lose sight of the fact that he was \u201cpractically the manager of the institution.\u201d\nHe, on the morning of Clarke\u2019s death being announced, telephoned to one Gilbert, acting for Leroux, the financier of Columbus Lodge, No. 26, to know if Clarke had paid his dues of last month, and followed this up toy the following letter:\u2014\nJ. Leroux, Esq.,\nFinancier, Columbus Lodge, No. 26.\nDear Sir and Bro.\u2014Be good enough to give the date of last payment made by the late Bro. J. P. Clarke and amount of same. Please be particular to give this exact as you may be called upon to attest same under oath. i beg to warn you not to accept any money on his behalf for assessments. Kindly reply at once.\nYours fraternally,\n(Signed) A.T. Patterson,\nGrand Recorder.\nIt is not often honest men furnish such cogent evidence against themselves as this conduct of Grand Recorder Patterson does, in my judgment, against him relative to the knowledge of the course of dealing now in question, when read in light of all the previous history and surrounding facts and circumstances.\nWhy this feverish haste and urgency a week or more after the books had been forever closed if he honestly believed this clause of the constitution had been observed\u2014and did not know that it had been more honoured in the breach than in the observance?\nAs the evidence he gave is full of that sort of equivocation, and apparently mental reservation, regarding which we need the eyes and ears of the learned trial judge to guide us in appeal, I accept that which his report indicates as being conclusive so far as it goes.\nI shall, therefore, not deal at length with the details of the evidence bearing upon the question of the knowledge of the executive, by and through Patterson, of almost all, and in substance all, that Leroux, the financier, tells us. And assuming the Grand Recorder knew or had good reason to know the substance of what Leroux tells we need not doubt the conclusion to be reached.\nI must observe, however, that it seems impossible to me for any man of the alert mind of Mr. Patterson, as shewn in the course of his evidence, not to have appreciated the full meaning of the financial secretaries\u2019 need for more time to make their returns on any other hypothesis than that the moneys had not always come in just as quickly as the threatening rule required.\nI have outlined the nature of these returns and the little to he done if money all in and ready to complete the business. Why was fifteen days needed? There is no explanation. Why was the period varied from time to time? Who took the side of the laggards in all the discussions leading to these changes? Who was afraid to cut them off? Who was to profit by their business? Who was to lose if they were cut off?\nIs it not plain as if written that, while keeping in the constitution a plea for urgency, the executive was anxious to do business? Is it not equally plain that all this course of dealing was saying to the members, though the letter says thirty days we mean you have forty-five days if you cannot pay?\nIn doing so they were but conforming by acts and conduct to the actual language of the policy in the case of Tattersail v. The People\u2019s Life Insurance Co.[4], which I suppose is a usual provision.\nEven fraternal societies have to observe the trend of competitive exigencies in the insurance business and act accordingly.\nI think appellants\u2019 conduct in this instance, and so many others in the same matter of time, was tantamount to extending the time of payment and should be treated accordingly.\nThe remarkably clean slate that the reports for months produced do shew, regarding the lapses of the kind now in question, though shewing others more serious in import certainly, did not pass unnoticed unless it was just what this manager from his knowledge of the situation expected.\nWhen we consider the frame of the Grand Recorder\u2019s approved form which has a column for \u201csuspended, etc.,\u201d under heading \u201cmembership deceased\u201d and another column for \u201carrears,\u201d and find, in practice, that it was under this latter and not under the former that such defaults as in question were put when the report was made to conform to what the Grand Recorder approved in this very instance, surely we must conclude there was a distinction in his mind between actual suspension and merely being in arrears with a \u201csusp\u201d added.\nHowever that may be, it seems suggestive.\nAs to the local law requiring the demand of payment from the debtor I do not say more than that such doubt as created thereby lent aid to this way of looking at the business in hand.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff j. (dissenting).\u2014I shall first state what appear to me to be the relevant facts, that is to say, the facts upon which, as it seems to me, the rights of the parties to this litigation must be determined. Other facts upon which the respondent largely rests her case, but which seem to me, for reasons I shall state, to be beside the point, may be considered later. On the 15th day of December, 1896, the deceased, Joseph P. Clarke, became a member of the Columbus Lodge of the Ancient Order of the United Workmen of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces and received a beneficiary certificate, the material provisions of which are as follows: The Grand Lodge op the Ancient Order of United Workmen of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, Dominion of Canada.\nThis Certificate cannot be assigned or hypothecated.\nThis Certificate issued by the authority of the Grand Lodge of the Ancient Order of United Workmen of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, witnesseth that Brother Joseph P. Clarke, a Workman Degree member of Columbus Lodge, No. 26, of said Order, located at Montreal, in this jurisdiction, is entitled to all the rights, benefits and privileges of membership in the Ancient Order of United Workmen of the Jurisdiction of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces and to designate the beneficiary to whom the sum of Two Thousand Dollars, without use or interest of the Beneficiary Fund of the Order at his death, be paid.\nThis Certificate is issued upon the express condition that said Joseph P. Clarke shall in every particular while a member of said order comply with all the laws, rules and requirements thereof.\n* * * * * *\nEndorsement.\u2014\u201cAssessment System.\u201d\nBesides the terms and conditions appearing in the body hereof, this Certificate is issued upon the following further terms and conditions which are to be read as forming a part of this contract, viz.:\u2014\n(1) That the member to whom this Beneficiary Certificate is granted is bound not only by the Constitution, Laws and Amendments of the Order now in operation, but also by any Amendments that may subsequently be made thereto.\n(2) That only persons entitled under such Constitution, Laws and Amendments, to become beneficiaries can be named as such by the member to whom this Certificate is granted.\n(3) That this Grand Lodge shall not be liable to pay any sum under this Contract, if * * * he is not a Member of this Order in good standing.\n(Sig. of Member) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Attest \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.

Lodge, No. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nThe Ancient Order of United Workmen appears to have been organized, in 1868, in Pennsylvania. The Order comprised a Supreme Lodge by which Grand Lodges of inferior jurisdiction were established, the Grand Lodge of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces being first constituted in 1894. In 1898, this Grand Lodge was registered under the Benevolent Associations Act of the Province of Quebec and, thereby, became a body corporate. In September, 1907, the Grand Lodge for Quebec and the Maritime Provinces seceded from the parent order and became an entirely independent body. In 1908, the name was changed by the authority of an order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of Quebec to \u201cThe Royal Guardians\u201d and in May, 1910, after the commencement of this action, the Royal Guardians were incorporated by an Act of the Parliament of Canada. The constitution of the order and the laws governing the Grand Lodge and the members of the order subject to its jurisdiction, as adopted in 1906, are in evidence and (with certain changes not material to any question on this appeal made necessary in consequence of the secession from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Lodge of the parent order) are admitted to have been the constitution governing the Grand Lodge in 1908, when Clarke died, and the suspension was alleged to have arisen which is the principal subject in controversy before us. The constitution provides, article 2:\u2014\n2. The following Constitution, as hereinafter set forth, subject to such changes as may be ordained by the Supreme Lodge, shall govern this Grand Lodge and the subordinate lodges and members of the Order in this jurisdiction, and no amendment or alteration shall be made in the said Constitution by this Grand Lodge except at a stated or special meeting of Grand Lodge, nor unless notice of such amendment shall have been given to the Grand Recorder sixty days prior to session of Grand Lodge and a copy thereof sent by him to each subordinate lodge thirty days previous to such meeting, and that a two-thirds majority of votes of the members of G. L. present at such meeting of Grand Lodge shall be cast in favour of such amendment or alteration.\nBy article 4, the Grand Lodge was to consist of certain officers and representatives from subordinate lodges within the jurisdiction.\nBy article 78:\u2014 The following rules (arts. 78-113) are prescribed for the government of this Grand Lodge Beneficiary Jurisdiction in the collection, management and disbursement of the Beneficiary Fund.\nBy article 79: The. Grand Lodge guarantees payment of the amount mentioned in the beneficiary certificate to the members named, provided:\u2014\nThat said member shall fully comply with each and all requirements of the hereinafter specified conditions, with the Constitution, and the general laws governing the Order and shall at his death be a member of the Order in good standing.\nThe provisions as to the manner of assessment, the period of grace allowed for the payment of the sums levied and as to suspension for non-payment and reinstatement are set out in articles 96-110 inclusive. The parts of these provisions which are immediately material are these. Article 97 provides that (in certain circumstances mentioned in the article indicating that the beneficiary fund of the Grand Lodge needs replenishment in order to provide funds for the payment of benefits),\nit shall be the duty of the Grand Recorder to call upon the subordinate lodges to forward the beneficiary funds in their respective treasuries and at the time of making such call to make an assessment upon each member of the Order who shall have received the Workmen Degree prior to the date of the last assessment.\nSections 98, 99 and 100 (pp. 51 and 52) are as follows:\u2014\n98. Unless otherwise announced by the Grand Recorder, either in the official organ of Grand Lodge, or by special notice, it is understood that an assessment is levied and it is hereby declared that an assessment is due and payable to the Financier of his Lodge by each member of the Order on the first day of each month unless he be notified to the contrary, and any member making default for thirty days to pay the same, shall ipso facto be deemed suspended from all privileges of the Order, and his Beneficiary. Certificate shall thereby lapse and become void.\n99. Every call made upon subordinate lodges to forward Beneficiary Funds shall be made upon the first day of the month that is not Sunday or a legal holiday, shall contain a list of deaths officially reported to the Grand Recorder prior to the last day of the preceding month, and not included in the preceding call, and all necessary instructions relative to forwarding the funds called for. The notice of such call is given by the Grand Recorder having it printed in the official organ of Grand Lodge, or by mailing a special notice to the Recorder of each Lodge.\n100. Any member not receiving the said official organ or official notice before the fifteenth day of any month shall write the Financier of his Lodge to ascertain whether an assessment has been made and shall also by registered letter, give notice to the Grand Recorder of the non-receipt of such official organ or notice: otherwise default to pay an assessment within the required delay shall not be excused on any plea of want of notice.\nThe two remaining sections which are material are sections 106 and 107 which are in these terms:\u2014\n106. The Grand Recorder is hereby instructed, so soon as he receives the Subordinate Lodge\u2019s report to give notice to any member reported as having failed to pay to the Financier of the Lodge of which he is a member, on or before the expiration of thirty days after an assessment has been made for the Beneficiary or other Funds, and who, if under the Level Rate Plan, for a period of three years has not sufficient money to his credit in his reserve to cover the amount of such assessment, that his interest and benefit, and those of all claiming through him, from and after said date, and such member shall not be reinstated except as hereinafter provided. Such notice to be delivered or sent by mail (registered) to the last address of such member known in the Grand Recorder\u2019s office.\nThe above notice by the Grand Recorder is, however, only a matter of courtesy, and failure to give or to receive the same cannot be pleaded by a defaulting member, as in any way avoiding the suspension caused by his default.\nPayment to the Financier of his Subordinate Lodge within thirty days from date of such suspension shall be for the purposes of this clause considered as payment to the Grand Lodge.\n107. Any suspended member who has forfeited all his rights by reason of non-payment of assessments for the Beneficiary or other Funds, may be reinstated, if he be living, at any time within a period of three months from the date of such suspension, upon the following conditions, and none other, that is to say: He shall pay all assessments that have been made during that time, including the one or more for the non-payment of which he had become suspended, together with his dues to date, and if thirty days have passed since such non-payment, he shall at the same time furnish a certificate, by a duly qualified medical practitioner, that he is in good health. The Financier shall report the same to the Lodge at its next stated meeting and the fact of the reinstatement shall be entered on the minutes; such report, however, is not to be a condition precedent to the reinstatement. But it is hereby expressly declared that the death of a member while so suspended, and during the said three months, shall debar him from being restored into good standing or from being reinstated, by payment of any assessments, either of the one or more for the non-payment of which he became suspended, or those that shall have been made against him during the said period; it being an absolute condition that all membership rights are forfeited by such non-payment, and the Beneficiary cannot claim any rights in case the member should die before complying with all the above conditions and before being reinstated as provided in this constitution and payment or tender by his personal representative or representatives during said period, shall in no case be held to restore the said member into good standing in the Order.\nOn the 1st of August, 1908, a call was made upon the subordinate lodges under the provisions of article 97, and, at the same time, an assessment was made and notice of it was given in the official organ of the Grand Lodge. The assessment and the notice are as follows:\nOfficial Notice of the Beneficiary Fund Assessment, No. 8, for August, 1908.\nOffice of the Grand Recorder,\nFraternal Chambers, A.O.U.W. Building,\nCor. Sherbrook St. and Park Ave.\nMontreal, Que., August 1st, 1908.\nTo the Members of the Ancient Order of United Workmen,\nJurisdiction Grand Lodge of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces.\nYou are hereby notified of the following deaths, necessitating the levy of one assessment:\u2014\n* * * * * *\nIn order to provide for payment of death losses, Assessment No. 8 is hereby levied upon each Workman Degree member who has taken the degree prior to the 1st of August, 1908, according to Tables of Rates in adjoining column.\nThe said assessment is now due, and must be paid to the Financier of your Lodge on or before the 31st instant. Failing to comply within the above stated dates, you will forfeit all your rights, benefits and privileges, by becoming suspended. Should you change your address notify your Financier, also the publisher of \u201cThe Protector,\u201d giving name and number of your Lodge.\n* * * * * *\nA. T. Patterson,\nGrand Recorder.\nNote (section 97, Grand Lodge Constitution, amended 1907).\u2014 Unless otherwise announced by the Grand Recorder, either by the official organ of Grand Lodge, or by special notice, it is understood that an assessment is levied and it is hereby declared that an assessment is due and payable to the Financier of his Lodge by each member of the Order on the first day of each month, and any member making default for thirty days to pay the same, shall ipso facto be deemed suspended from all privileges of the Order, and his beneficiary certificate shall thereby lapse and become void.\nClarke died on the 7th of September, 1908, without having paid this assessment. After his death the amount was paid by some friends to the financier of his lodge, who accepted it but the responsible officers of the Grand Lodge taking the position that Clarke had incurred suspension by reason of the non-payment of his assessment on the 31st of August, refused to recognize this payment and declined to pay the benefits to which the respondents would have been entitled had Clarke been a member of the order in good standing.\nThe rights of the beneficiaries under Clarke\u2019s certificate rest upon the condition, which is an essential condition of them, that he shall have been a member of the order in good standing at the time of his death and that the beneficiary named shall be entitled to demand payment under the provisions of the constitution and laws of the order in force at the time of his death. Articles 97, 98,100,106 and 107, above quoted, provide in the most explicit terms that the failure to pay an assessment at the expiration of thirty days after it is made (and, by article 98, an assessment is deemed to have been made on the first of each month unless notice to the contrary is given) shall ipso facto involve the suspension of the delinquent member with the consequence of the lapsing of all rights under that member\u2019s beneficiary certificate; and section 107, moreover, contains a specific declaration to the effect that on the death of a member while under suspension the provisions of the constitution as to reinstatement cease to have any application and all potential rights under the beneficiary certificate irrevocably disappear.\nI have been forced to the conclusion, very much indeed to my regret, that there is nothing in the circumstances of this case affording any way of escape from the operation of these provisions which I think have the construction and effect contended for by the appellants and that the claim of the respondent fails. The grounds upon which the respondent rests her case are two: 1st, it is contended that, giving the articles referred to the legal effect assigned to them by the law of Quebec, the assessment was payable at the domicile of the member, that, consequently, it was the duty of the creditor to make, demand at the member\u2019s domicile and that its failure to do so had the effect, in law, of excusing non-payment. The second contention, I am obliged to say, I have some difficulty in stating with precision; the general effect of it is that the Grand Lodge is precluded, because of certain alleged practices connected with the collection and receipt of assessments, from setting up the articles of the constitution upon which it relies.\nFirst, then, of the legal effect of these articles as touching the place where the payment of the assessments is exigible.\nA question suggests itself in limine which it may be worth while to indicate although in my view it is unnecessary to pass any opinion upon it; and it is this: Is the legal effect of Clarke\u2019s contract necessarily ruled by the law of Quebec?\nThe Grand Lodge of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces was when first constituted an unincorporated association having members and subordinate lodges in the Maritime Provinces as well as in Quebec. The Grand Lodge was affiliated with other lodges all under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Lodge of the order which had been organized in Pennsylvania.\nThe contract governing the rights of the members of the order in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces was expressed in the constitution of the Grand Lodge, subject, however, to the provisions of the constitution of the Supreme Lodge in case of conflict. It might, I think, be suggested with some shew of plausibility, that, in the matter\u2014the vital matter\u2014of the payment of assessments, the constitution itself affords conclusive internal evidence, of an intention that the obligations of the members, whether in Quebec or in the three Maritime Provinces, should be governed by a single law and, moreover, having regard to the origin of the order and of the constitutional provisions upon this subject and to the actual circumstances of this particular Grand Lodge itself, that these provisions contemplate in this respect the application of the common law rule according to which, reasonably, the debtor seeks his creditor rather than the rule of the French law.\nIn this matter of the law to be applied, the principle of the law of Quebec seems to be the same as the principle of the law of England, viz., that the actual or presumed intention of the parties as ascertained from the instrument and the circumstances must, in the last resort, govern.\nI pass over this question because, according to the law of Quebec, I think the respondent\u2019s contention on this point fails.\nThe relevant provisions of the Civil Code do not seem to leave the rule of law in doubt.\nArticles 1152 and 1164 are as follows:\u2014\n1152. Payment must be made in the place expressly or impliedly indicated by the obligation.\nIf no place be so indicated, the payment, when it is of a certain specific thing, must be made at the place where the thing was at the time of contracting the obligation.\nIn all other cases payment must be made at the domicile of the debtor; subject, nevertheless, to the rules provided under the titles relating to particular contracts.\n1164. If, by the terms of the obligation or by law, payment is to be made at the domicile of the debtor, a notification in writing by him to the creditor that he is ready to make payment has the same effect as an actual tender, provided that in any action afterwards brought the debtor make proof that he had the money or thing due ready for the payment at the time and place when and where the same was payable.\nThe provisions of this constitution, above quoted, when read with the other provisions relating to the making and collection of assessments seem to imply that the member shall seek out the financier and not the financier the member.\nIn articles 165,166 and 167, which define the duties of the officers of the subordinate lodges, there is no provision for the taking of active steps by any of these officers for the purpose of collecting assessments. One sees further that no provision is made for the payment of these officers. The lodges are organized with a view to economical administration and the constitution seems to contemplate that the offices shall be honorary and filled by persons who in the ordinary course are largely occupied with their own vocations. That seems hardly consistent with the notion that the assessments are intended to be in point of law payable at the domicile of the member.\nBut the arguments advanced involve the proposition that the making of the demand at the domicile is a condition which must be complied with to put the member in default. Assuming for the moment that this view is consistent with article 1164, above quoted, is seems clear enough that you cannot give effect to this view without doing violence to the intentions of the framers of this instrument as expressed in sections 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, and 106. Article 98, for example, says that an assessment is due and payable on the 1st of each month by each member unless he is notified to the contrary and any member making default for thirty days shall suffer the consequences therein mentioned. According to the argument of the respondent default would never take place until demand at the domicile of the member, from which time only the period of thirty days would begin to run. That would necessitate a demand at the domicile of each member on a given day for which no sort of provision is made and which cannot be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the constitution; or demands on successive days with the effect of giving different delays to different members in violation of the principle of equality which obviously pervades the constitution. The other articles are open to similar observations. The application of the rule suggested would throw the whole scheme into confusion. I think the proper conclusion is that, upon this point, the rule to be applied is that above indicated.\nBut, assuming the effect of article 1152 C.C. is to make the assessment payable at the member\u2019s domicile, the failure to demand payment there is not in itself sufficient to excuse the failure to pay. Article 1164 C.C. seems conclusive upon that point; and the evidence, unfortunately, does not bring the appellants within the protection of that article.\nI come now to the second ground which is that, for certain reasons, the appellants are precluded from alleging Clarke\u2019s non-performance of the conditions of his contract.\nBefore stating the facts upon which the respondents rely in support of this contention it would be convenient first to refer to section 115 of the Constitution. That section is as follows:\u2014\nIt shall be the duty of each Subordinate Lodge to make a monthly report to Grand Lodge, which report shall be closed on the last day of each month, signed by the Financier and Recorder, and at once sent to the Grand Recorder.\nThis report shall be in the form provided by Grand Lodge, and contain the information thereby demanded.\nShould said report fail to reach the Grand Recorder on the fifteenth day of any month, it shall be his duty to call upon the Recorder of each delinquent Lodge, by telegram or otherwise, to forward said report forthwith. In months in which no assessment is called, a report shall be made as if there were an assessment, except that the blank for current assessments shall not be filled.\nThis section was construed, not unnaturally\u2014I think, indeed, it is probably the proper construction of it\u2014as giving to the officials of the subordinate lodge a delay of fifteen days to make up and forward the report referred to. The forms provided for by the Grand Lodge referred to in the section, called for a statement of the assessments paid for the month to which the report related, by the members of the lodge, and of the names of the members suspended for non-payment. By section 166(c), it was the duty of the financier of the subordinate lodge to notify the Grand Recorder of all members who stand suspended on the last day of each month. The practice was to treat the report provided for by section 115 in which this information ought to be contained, as being a sufficient notification under section 116 (c). According to the strict letter of these provisions, therefore, members failing to pay an assessment due, on the first of a given month, within the thirty days of grace allowed by the rules should be marked suspended in the report under section 115. On the other hand, the effect of this would obviously be in some cases to give rise to what would very naturally appear to the officials of such an organization as this as quite useless trouble, not only to the officials themselves, but to the members, and at the same time involve the members in some, it is true, very slight expense. I am dwelling on this because it seems to be necessary to consider the practicable working of section 115 and section 166 (c) from the point of view of the member and the official of the subordinate lodge in order to appreciate the contention I am about to consider.\nThe constitution requires this report to be made up as of the last day of each month. But consider the case of a member having failed to pay during the given month his assessment for that month, but paying it a day or two after the end of the month to the financier. What is the position of that member? During the period which elapsed after the expiration of thirty days from the first day of the month when his assessment became due and the day on which the assessment was paid to the financier the member was, according to the provisions of sections 98 and 107, suspended. If he died during that period (on this point section 107 is most explicit) no rights could arise under his beneficiary certificate. But, if living, on payment at any time within thirty days after the date on which the suspension accrued he became by virtue of the payment ipso facto restored to his status as a member. That is the construction and effect attributed to section 107 by the Grand Lodge, and that, in my view, is the proper construction of that section. The requirement that the member who has become suspended\nshall pay all assessments that have been made during that time\nhas been construed and, in my judgment, rightly construed, as requiring the payment of such assessments in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, viz., within the period of grace allowed; and it follows that where the member pays prior to the expiration of the thirty days following the accrual of the suspension he is obliged to pay the assessment in respect of which he has made default and that assessment only, in order to obtain re-instatement. Section 107 requires that where the conditions of re-instatement have been satisfied, which in the case we are considering are limited to the payment of the overdue assessment, the fact of the re-instatement is to be reported to the next meeting of the lodge, but this declaration is added,\nsuch report, however, is not to be a condition precedent to the reinstatement.\nSuch then being the position of a member who, having failed to pay his assessment within the month for which it is levied, pays it within the first few days of the next month and, thereby, recovers his status as a member of the order in good standing and becomes reinvested with the rights under his beneficiary certificate which had suffered a temporary lapse during the period of suspension, one understands how the inutility of reporting such a member as suspended would impress itself upon the financier and recorder of his lodge. The reporting him as suspended would necessitate a formal notice by the Grand Recorder under section 106 and the entry of the suspension in the records of the Grand Lodge, the payment of a small fine by the defaulting member, and would involve, it may be, some discredit for the lodge itself.\nThe result was that a practice appears to have grown up, certainly in Columbus Lodge, and probably this practice was general, of not reporting as suspended members who paid their assessments at any time before the report was sent forward under section 115; and this practice, while irregular and involving a violation of section 115, could not, in itself, prejudicially affect the rights of the Grand Lodge, vis-\u00e0-vis the holders of beneficiary certificates, provided the provisions of section 107 were observed and no assessment was received on behalf of a defaulting member who had died while under suspension.\nIt is this practice which is in the main relied upon as constituting the foundation of the respondents\u2019 contention that the appellants are precluded from setting up Clarke\u2019s default\nThe contention is put in two ways: First, it is said that the provisions of the constitution quoted above became superseded by a practice or custom which extended the period of grace from thirty days to the date not later than the fifteenth of the month following the making of the assessment when it became necessary for the officers of the subordinate lodge to forward their report in time to reach the Grand Recorder by the fifteenth of that month. Secondly, it is said that, in effect, by this practice members were treated as being in good standing so long as their assessments were paid in time to be forwarded with the monthly report, and that the practice was known and acquiesced in by the Grand Lodge and that this acquiescence precludes the Grand Lodge from asserting that Clarke was not in good standing at the time of his death.\nBefore analysing this contention I should summarize the features of the evidence bearing upon it which must be kept in view. There is no evidence that, except in Clarke\u2019s case, an assessment was ever accepted by any financier of a subordinate lodge on behalf of a member who had died while under suspension. Leroux, the financier of Columbus Lodge, says that he had never done so. And the effect of the evidence seems to be that if such a thing had occurred it had not come to the knowledge of the officials of the Grand Lodge. Then it is not denied that in each month in which an assessment was levied a notice was sent through the official organ of the Grand Lodge, the newspaper \u201cProtector,\u201d in the form of a notice for August quoted above in full\u2014a notice specially emphasizing the consequences of failing to pay within the month, and quoting verbatim the section 97 in which these consequences are declared. This notice was mailed to every member as required by the rules, and by the great majority of members, no doubt, was received. In the case of Columbus Lodge, it appears to have been a common thing for members to delay the payment of their assessments until after the expiration of the month, but it was by no means universal. Columbus Lodge seems to have been in a state of disorganization for a number of years; Leroux states that for four years there had not been a meeting of the Lodge. As to the other lodges there is really no evidence to justify the inference that there was any general practice of delaying the payment of assessments beyond the time allowed by the rules. Patterson, the Grand Recorder, says that he had his suspicions that assessments were received after expiration of the days of grace, and forwarded without any report of the default. But he, denies any knowledge of such cases and, according to his statement, at all events, his evident belief that such cases did exist was simply an inference founded upon the probabilities, and the fact that the reports were sometimes delayed beyond the fifteenth. Brady, the Grand Master Workman, denied any knowledge of any such practice, although he too had his suspicions.\nThere is, however, no evidence and there appear to be no facts upon which an inference could properly be based that delinquent members who allowed themselves the indulgence of falling into default were under any delusion as to the provisions of the constitution applicable to such a case, or as to the nature of the risk they were running. Larkin, who was called as a witness on behalf of the respondents, and says he considered himself in good standing if he paid before the forwarding of the monthly report, admits that he was acquainted with the provisions of the constitution, requiring payment before the thirtieth of the month. The members who indulged in this practice seem to have been aware of the importance of concealing the facts from the officials of the Grand Lodge. In Columbus Lodge the pass books of the members in which the financier receipted the payment of the assessments did not shew the date of payment, but only the month to which the assessment was attributed. In lodges in which the practice was to give the date of payment the receipts in such cases were antedated. The friends who paid Clarke\u2019s assessment were evidently impressed with the necessity of doing so at the earliest moment; obviously they did not entertain the idea that Clarke was legally entitled to postpone payment until the report was forwarded. It is nowhere suggested that any act of the Grand Lodge or of any of its officials or any of its records or any communication made or published under its authority had justified or created in any way a belief amongst the members that sections 98 and 107 were no longer in force or that the provisions of the constitution were in any respect other than those which are now produced in this litigation. On the contrary the monthly notice, as I have already mentioned, pointedly called the attention of members to the terms of section 98 and the effect of non-compliance with them.\nNow, it is a term of every beneficiary certificate that the member shall observe the conditions of the by-laws and constitution and amendments thereof.\nAmong these are, of course, the rules prescribed (articles 78-116) for the collection, management and disbursement of the beneficiary fund and in particular, the rules governing rights of the Grand Lodge in the levying of assessments and the consequences of non-payment.\nWhile each member is bound by these rules himself he is entitled to have them observed by others, that is to say, by the members in their dealings with the Grand Lodge and by the Grand Lodge in dealings with members.\nArticle 2. \u201cThe constitution\u201d * * * shall govern this Grand Lodge and \u201cthe subordinate lodges and all members of the Order\u201d; and the rules just referred to \u201care prescribed\u201d in the words of article 79 \u201cfor the government of this Grand Lodge beneficiary jurisdiction.\u201d These rules, in a word, constitute, in effect, a single contract to which the Grand Lodge and all beneficiary members are for the time being parties. It follows, of course, that they cannot be altered except in accordance with some provision of the constitution, i.e., the contract itself or by the consent of all parties.\nThe constitution makes provision for amendment by the Grand Lodge by a two-thirds vote after certain notices have been given. The Grand Master Workman has power to grant dispensations not inconsistent with the Constitution and the Grand Lodge may adopt standing regulations not inconsistent with the constitution for the purpose of carrying the same into effect.\nBut it is clear enough that the Grand Lodge would have no authority, except by means of an amendment of the Constitution, to change the provisions of articles 97, 98, 100, 106 and 107, already quoted providing ipso facto suspension of members who fail to pay their assessments within the thirty days of grace provided for. An express resolution to that effect would, in itself, be inoperative.\nAnd still less would the Grand Lodge have power to provide for the exemption of particular members or particular lodges from these provisions for giving, for example, to the members of some lodges forty-five days of grace instead of thirty days, the period allowed the other members. Equality is the fundamental principle of every such constitution as this.\nThere could, therefore, be no such thing as an amendment of these rules by the operation of \u201ccustom.\u201d It is conceivable that a practice might become established by the acquiescence of every member of the order the validity of which everybody would be estopped from disputing; but that would be a very difficult case to maintain where new members are constantly being added. No such case is suggested here.\nAlmost as difficult would it be to make out that the Grand Lodge is by reason of some practice precluded from setting up the provisions of these rules, for example, sections 98 and 107.\nAny such contention when analysed must come to this\u2014that the Grand Lodge in permitting the practice relied upon had led the members to believe that these provisions would not be enforced and that the courts would compel the Grand Lodge to give effect to this expectation in favour of members acting upon it in good faith. In the case of the specific provisions now under consideration the contention being that in permitting the particular practice already described, the Grand Lodge encouraged the members of Columbus Lodge to act upon the assumption that these sections in so far as they provide for suspension on non-payment within the prescribed delay, would not be enforced provided the monthly assessments were paid in time to be forwarded to the Grand Lodge on the 15th of the month following that in which they became due. But the Grand Lodge having no authority to exempt lodges or members by express declaration from compliance with these provisions of the constitution, it seems obvious that it could not so do by mere acquiescence in a course of conduct. Such a course of conduct, so long as there should be members entitled to insist upon the provisions of the constitution being observed, could not prevent the Grand Lodge insisting upon compliance with the provisions of the constitution.\nThen a decisive answer to this argument on behalf of the respondent appears to be this, viz., that no member or person seeking to enforce rights under a beneficiary certificate can be heard to say that he did not know the provisions of the constitution which are made part of his contract. I exclude, of course, cases in which a member has been misinformed as, for example, of some amendment of the constitution through some communication made by some official or agency under the proper authority of the Grand Lodge or by means of some error in the record of the Grand Lodge itself. Knowing the rules as to the payment of assessments and the consequences of nonpayment as prescribed by the rules, and knowing that the Grand Lodge has no authority to exempt lodges and members from the observance of these rules or from the consequences of non-observance, it must be taken that when he, alone or in concert with others, departs from them he does so at the risk of having to suffer the consequences pointed out by the constitution.\nComing to the case art bar, in addition to the knowledge of the rules which must be imputed to Clarke there are the circumstances mentioned above\u2014the monthly notice, in view of the terms of which it is impossible to suppose that there could have been anything like a general belief in the order that the provisions of sections 98 and 107 would not be enforced, the fact that there is no evidence of a single instance in which a defaulting member, dying while in default within the meaning of sections 98 and 107, was recognized as having died in good standing, the fact that the conclusive proof that no such case had occurred in the history of Columbus Lodge, at all events since the year 1903, that the practice, even such as it was, was obviously a clandestine practice\u2014it seems impossible to conclude as a fact that members generally were really misled into a belief that they could fall into a default without suffering the consequences pointed out in sections 98 and 107. What they did understand doubtless was this: That they would not be reported to the Grand Recorder as being in default, or as being suspended, if they paid their assessments in time to enable their financier to forward them with his monthly report; and that they would not suffer the inconveniences, whatever they might be, arising from being reported as defaulters. But there is no solid basis disclosed by the evidence upon which one can fairly found the conclusion that the members of Columbus Lodge, and still less the members of the order generally, did not understand that in failing to pay within the prescribed thirty days they were making default within the provisions of the constitution which remained in full force. Again even assuming that there may have been members who in fact were ignorant of the constitution who never read the notices they received who having before their minds a sort of impression that in order to avoid obvious and immediate inconvenience an assessment must be paid by the fifteenth of each month at the latest and without thinking of ulterior and more serious consequences paid only at the last moment\u2014Is there anything in the circumstances of this case which can fairly be said, on legal principles, to cast upon the Grand Lodge the responsibility for such ignorance and neglect? The answer, it seems to me, must be in the negative if only for the simple reason that the whole pith of the complaint against the Grand Lodge rests upon the members\u2019 supposed ignorance of the provisions of the constitution. Take away this supposition of ignorance and there is nothing left. The Grand Lodge cannot be responsible for that, as I have already said, for the reason that a person who enters into a contract such as that expressed in these beneficiary certificates, and constitutional rules and bylaws, cannot excuse himself from non-performance of conditions on the ground that he does not know the provisions of his contract. It is his duty to know them. He must be held to know them. It is impossible to work out such a system as this upon any other principle. Then again, assuming ignorance in fact, on what ground is the Grand Lodge to he held responsible for it? There is nothing in the circumstances of this case to shew that the officials of the Grand Lodge had reason to suspect any general ignorance of the provisions in question. As I have already said, the evidence shews, on the contrary, that there was no such ignorance. Everything that could reasonably be suggested was being done by the Grand Lodge to induce members to pay promptly by keeping before their eyes the consequences of default; and the officials had, apparently, every reason to believe, what I think was the fact, that these provisions were generally understood. Default, where there was default, they doubtless attributed to reasons other than ignorance. Clarke\u2019s case unfortunately illustrates my meaning. He was a persistent defaulter, being recorded again and again as suspended, making default no doubt with a full knowledge of the consequences. Indeed, there seems to be grave reason to doubt whether, strictly speaking, he was a member in good standing during the month of August. I mention this, of course, not for the purpose of insisting upon a point that the appellants have quite property refused to take, but for the purpose of pointing out the difficulty of inferring that Clarke\u2019s default was due to a lack of appreciation of the consequences of default. Leroux\u2019s evidence, moreover, shews that, notwithstanding a reprimand administered to Columbus Lodge for the looseness of its methods, no change has since taken place, and, notwithstanding the position the Grand Lodge has taken in this litigation, the former practice is apparently continued.\nThen the respondent says that the practice of the financier in sending for her husband\u2019s assessment on the fifteenth of every month established a course of business by which the Grand Lodge is bound. Now, first, it is perfectly clear that neither the financier nor Columbus Lodge had any authority to exempt Clarke from the operation of sections 98 and 107, yet the contention must come to this, if it is to have any force, that the financier by his conduct had relieved Clarke from the operation of those provisions of the constitution. The contention appears to assume that the financier having no actual authority, had ostensible authority to bind the Grand Lodge by such a course of conduct. The argument seems to be that the Grand Lodge must have had notice through the financier of what was going on and receiving the assessnient, with notice of the facts, ratified the acts of the financier. The contention, unfortunately, is compounded of fallacies, even leaving aside the fatal objections that the Grand Lodge itself had no authority under the constitution to exempt Clarke from these provisions except by amending the constitution.\nClarke must be taken to have known the limits of the financier\u2019s authority, and the, limits of the constitutional power of the Grand Lodge itself, with respect to these provisions of the constitution. Again, as Clarke was entitled to pay the financier when he did pay and to be treated thereafter as a member in good standing notwithstanding any pre-existing suspension, the acceptance of the assessment ratified nothing. The receipt by the financier must be presumed to be a rightful one, not a receipt in violation of the constitution. And, still again, the reasonable explanation of the financier\u2019s conduct, considered as a matter of fact, in sending his messenger to collect Clarke\u2019s assessment, is that he did it out of kindness for Clarke who, unfortunately, seems to have had a very hard struggle to keep up his payments. It is not good policy to interpret such kindly acts of indulgence as establishing a course of business, in breach of the duty of the agents doing them, unless it is quite clear that such is the proper construction of them. It has been pointed out again and again that such extreme interpretations have a tendency to compel people to stand on their strict rights for their own protection rather than follow the more natural human kindly way, and for that reason they should be avoided except where there are really solid grounds for them. In this case the evidence utterly fails to begin to make a case shewing that Clarke was misled by the kindness of the financier.\nWhat I have already said will make it clear that, apart from numerous other grounds of distinction which become obvious when one keeps the facts of this case in view, the cases cited, of which Wing v. Harvey[5] is perhaps the type, can have no bearing upon any question before us on this appeal, for this short reason: That, as the member is conclusively presumed to know the limits of the authority of the Grand Lodge, the subordinate lodges and the officials of each (which are defined specifically and exhaustively by the constitution and by-laws), the ostensible authority of the officials cannot for any relevant purpose be of wider scope than the actual authority.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal. The evidence establishes that the financier of Columbus Lodge, to which the deceased Clarke belonged, was in the habit of collecting assessments from members, including Clarke, at their residences after the period of thirty days during which, under the bylaws of the society, they might pay without incurring suspension, had expired, i.e., he collected up to the 15th day of the month following that on the first of which the assessment became due. It was then that the financier was required to make his return to the Grand Lodge. His custom was, to return, on the 15th day of the following month, the moneys so collected after the expiry of the month in which they were payable as assessments paid in the ordinary course and not as moneys received from suspended members. This practice had continued for at least five years before Clarke\u2019s death. It appears to have prevailed also in other lodges. The learned trial judge drew the inference from the evidence that the Grand Lodge officials were aware of what was going on. That inference has been accepted by the Court of Appeal and I am not prepared to hold that it is erroneous.\nUpon this state of facts it has been held by the provincial courts that the provision for forfeiture for non-payment of the assessments during the month in which they were levied was waived and that the time for payment was extended at least until the 15th day of the following month prior to which payment might be made without suspension being incurred.\nThe deceased died on the 7th of September leaving his August; assessment unpaid. It was paid on the following day. I accept the conclusion reached in the provincial courts that the practice above stated, known to the officials of the Grand Lodge and not repudiated by them, constituted a waiver of the provision for forfeiture which the defendants invoke. The assessment was not in default and Clarke had not incurred suspension at the time of his death. At least the defendants are estopped from contending that he had. To the authorities cited in the judgments of Mr. Justice Dunlop and Mr. Justice Cross I would merely add a reference to Buckbee v. The United States Insurance and Trust Co.[6]; Insurance Co. v. Wolff[7], at page 333; and Redmond v. Canadian Mutual Aid Association[8], at pages 341-342. The course of dealing by the society with Clarke was such, in my opinion, as to induce his failure to make payment within the thirty days prescribed by the by-laws and it would operate as a fraud upon his representatives if the Society were now\nallowed to disavow its conduct and enforce the condition.\nNeither can I see any distinction in principle, such as has been suggested, between mutual-benefit insurance societies and joint-stock insurance companies in regard to the effect of the conduct of high officials in creating a waiver or estoppel. In the management of its business these officials in the case of mutual-benefit societies represent the members of the society, who are its owners and presumably have entrusted the management of its affairs to such officials because they repose confidence in them, quite as much as the directors and high office holders in the joint-stock company represent its owners, the shareholders. Shareholders and participating policy-holders in the latter are quite as much interested in the strict observance of provisions respecting forfeitures and lapses as the members of the former. The shareholders and participating policy-holders in the joint-stock company reap the benefit of forfeitures and lapses in the form of profits. Members of the mutual-benefit society reap a like advantage in reduction of assessments either in number or amount. In either case the management of the business is entrusted to officials who are its representatives and agents. With them the insured must deal. I cannot see that it makes any difference whether the conditions of the risk are expressed in the contract of insurance itself or are contained in a constitution or by-laws incorporated with the contract. Conduct, of officials which will render it inequitable for the insurer to set up a condition entailing forfeiture in the one case will be equally effective in the other.\nAnother answer made by the plaintiffs to the claim of forfeiture is that, according to the civil law of the Province of Quebec, where the contract in question was made and the insured lived, in the absence of a contrary stipulation\u2014the policy contained none\u2014 the creditor must seek his debtor. The financier of Columbus Lodge had by his practice recognized this rule as applicable to the insurance contract sued upon. His custom was to go himself or to send some person to collect the assessments from the assured. He had not demanded the August assessment. Therefore, it is contended, the assured was not in default when he died. I do not wish to be understood as rejecting this answer of the respondents. Finding the ground first stated sufficient for the disposition of the appeal, it is unnecessary for me to deal with this further contention.\nBrodeur J\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: T.

On the completion of the works, but prior to the dates when the corporation was obliged to make payment, a promissory note was obtained from the municipality which was indorsed by the contractor, delivered to the mayor as collateral security for the amount owing to him, and, by the latter, was discounted at a bank. The mayor retained the proceeds of the note for the purpose of satisfying the amount of the bonus promised to him and some other charges which he claimed in connection with his services in financing the contractor. In an action by the contractor to recover the funds,\nHeld, that the arrangement so made had the effect of giving the mayor an interest in the contract incompatible with his duty as a member of the municipal council, contrary to public policy and in violation of the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of the Quebec statute, 58 Vict. ch. 42, and that he was not entitled to retain the moneys.\nHeld, also, that, in the circumstances of the case, the plaintiff\u2019s right of action was not affected by the illicit nature of the agreement and that he was entitled to recover the amount so retained in an action for money had and received to his use by the defendant, or under the provisions ofk section 11 of the Quebec statute, 58 Vict. ch. 42.\nJudgment appealed from reversed.

S.C.R. 244) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, by which the judgment of Bruneau J., in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal was varied.\nIn the circumstances stated in the head-note, the plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant the sum of $11,136.24 with interest from 17th September, 1908. With his plea the defendant tendered the sum of $5,122.25 as the whole amount of the balance due by him to the plaintiff, after deduction of the amount of the bonus and other charges mentioned in the head-note. In the Superior Court Mr. Justice Bruneau declared that the amount so tendered was insufficient and entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff for $10,519.25 with costs. By the judgment appealed from the Court of King\u2019s Bench reduced the amount of the Superior Court judgment by the sum of $3,000, the amount of the bonus claimed by the defendant.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nSir Auguste Angers K.C. and A. E. deLorimier K.C. for the appellant.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and R. Monty K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec, varying a judgment of the Superior Court which had maintained the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThat action was brought to recover from the defendant a sum of money alleged to be illegally retained by him out of a larger sum received from the plaintiff. The facts are susceptible of simple, statement and the differences in the versions given by the parties of the circumstances out of which this suit arose are perhaps more apparent than real. Where they differ, the trial judge says that he accepts in preference the plaintiff\u2019s story.\nThe undisputed facts are: In the year 1907, the defendant was mayor of the municipality of the Village of DeLorimier, and in the month of September of that year the plaintiff was awarded a contract for the building of sewers in some of the main streets of the village. The terms of the contract are fully set out in notarial deeds executed on the 26th of the same month.\nAt that time the parties were apparently strangers to one another. On or about the 26th of October following, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for financial assistance to enable him to carry on his work, and it is admitted that without that assistance the contract could probably not have been executed. There is some dispute as to what occurred at the time and the trial judge apparently believes the plaintiff, but, so far as the issue to be determined on this appeal is concerned, it is not material to say more than this. The parties after some negotiations agreed that the defendant would assist the plaintiff to obtain the advances he required in consideration of the payment of a bonus of $3,000 for which a promissory note was then given. The contract was proceeded with vigorously, the defendant made the necessary advances amounting in all to $12,201.30 and the work was completed in the summer of 1908, the defendant being still in office as mayor of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provision in the agreement that the contract price was to be paid in five equal annual instalments, the first falling due one year after the works were completed and accepted, on the 15th August, 1908, a pro-misssory note, payable at six months, was given for the total value of the work done. The corporation gave the note to the contractor on his undertaking to renew at maturity, but he indorsed it over at once to Messier, the mayor. No importance seems to have been attached below to this serious departure from a term evidently inserted in the agreement for the protection of the municipality. It was quite in the interest bf the mayor, creditor of the contractor, that the contract price should be paid at once, and evidently his interest prevailed against that of the ratepayers which he was supposed to protect.\nThere is some dispute as to what occurred at the time the note was given to the mayor. The plaintiff says that it was given as collateral security for his then existing indebtedness, the defendant is assumed below to have said that it was in payment of that indebtedness. What he really says is at page 26 of the case. The trial judge believes the plaintiff.\nBe this as it may, the defendant refused at the time, under one pretext or another, to account to the plaintiff for the note against which he, the defendant, had obtained an advance of $17,797.95 from the bank, i.e., to the extent of his own claim for advances, commission and interest. There is some dispute here as to whether the note was discounted or merely given to the bank as collateral security for an advance then made. The defendant says in his examination on discovery:\u2014\n1. R. Monsieur Lapointe aurait voulu avoir la diff\u00e9rence et je lui ai dit:\u2014Si je ne peux pas l\u2019escompter je ne pourrai pas vous donner la diff\u00e9rence maintenant.\n* * * * * *\n20. Q. Vous ne lui avez pas cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 ce billet \u00e2 son compte?\nR. Je l\u2019ai cr\u00e9dit\u00e9 le montant de $17,597.95 par le billet de la Corporation, du moment que je l\u2019eus escompt\u00e9.\n* * * * * *\n40. R. Je ne pouvais pas lui cr\u00e9diter si je ne l\u2019avais pas en mains.\nAgain, I do not think, in my view of the ease, that the difference is important; the result was that the plaintiff took out of the advances made by the bank on the note of the municipality the amount of his claim against the plaintiff including the bonus of $3,000 which is in dispute here.\nOn these facts two questions arise: Was the promissory note for $3,000 given for an illegal consideration, and if so, is the defendant entitled to retain that sum out of the proceeds of the note given by the municipality in payment of the work done under contract?\nI am quite satisfied that although there was no concert between the parties at the time the contract was awarded, the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent undertaking to pay a bonus of $3,000 for the advances which the defendant undertook to make was, in the circumstances, within the mischief of the Act hereafter cited and come within the words of the enactment, because it gave the mayor an interest in the contract which made him liable to the penalty prescribed by 58 Vict, ch. 42, sec. 2, which reads:\u2014 Any member of a municipal council who knowingly during the existence of his mandate has or had, directly or indirectly, through a partner or partners, or through the agency of any other person, any interest, commission or percentage (in a contract) with the municipal council of which he is a partner, or knowingly during the existence of his mandate has or had derived any pecuniary remuneration from any contract for work performed or to be performed, shall, upon a judgment obtained against him under this Act, be declared disqualified from holding any public office in the said council or under the control thereof for the space of five years.\nWhat is an interest sufficient to disqualify? See cases collected in 19 Halsbury, Laws of England, No. 627, p. 304, also Miles v. McIlwraith[1]; Mayor of Salford v. Lever[2]; Norton v. Taylor[3]; In re Campbell[4]; Burgess v. Clark[5]; Hunnings v. Williamson[6].\nI have looked at the case of Le Feuvre v. Lankester[7], much relied upon at the argument and, if still binding as an authority, it can be distinguished from this case. There the defendant sold the contractor certain ironwork which was used in carrying out the contract. No attempt was made to shew fraud or any interest which would affect the price of the goods or the manner in which they were to be paid for. Here the bonus of $3,000 was to be paid at the expiration of the contract out of the profits, which the contractor expected to make, and the defendant admits that if the contract was unprofitable, he stood a chance to lose not only his bonus, but also his advances. So that, if we take the view which is most favourable to the defendant, there is no doubt that by reason of that agreement he had a pecuniary interest in the result of the contract and he was therefore, in a position where he had necessarily to choose between that interest and his duty towards the municipality. I entirely agree with what is said by Arnold, Law of Municipal Corporations, pp. 26, 27. The members of a council should have no interest to bias their judgments in deciding what is for the public good. Members of a town council should be advised to keep themselves absolutely free from the possibility of any imputation in this respect.\nThis case affords a striking illustration of the necessity of strictly interpreting the section above quoted. As evidence, I refer again to the way the interests of the municipality were, to say the least, put in jeopardy by the payment of the contract price before the time fixed to ascertain if the work had been satisfactorily executed.\nAs to the second question\u2014the right to recover \u2014it has been argued that the old Roman maxim nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans applies, and much reliance is placed, and very properly so, upon the opinion of Pothier, Obligations, No. 45. But it must not be overlooked that the legislature had the opinion of Pothier brought to its notice when the Civil Code was enacted and that opinion was deliberately departed from. If the undertaking to pay a bonus gave the mayor an interest in the contract, then the statute makes that undertaking unlawful and the payment was without consideration. The right, therefore, to recover exists. There was no debt and the defendant received a sum that was not due him. (See arts. 1047-1048 and 1140 C.C.) Neither was there a natural obligation. (16 Laurent 164; Marcad\u00e9 4, p. 399.) It is quite evident here that the defendant took an unfair advantage of the financial necessities of the plaintiff, and the latter cannot be said to have been a party to the illicit agreement. His promise to pay the bonus was not made to give the defendant an interest in the contract, although that was the effect of it, and as Planiol puts it, vol. 2, No. 846:\u2014\nIl semble que cette action (en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition) devrait toujours \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, car si l\u2019obligation illicite or immorale est condamn\u00e9e par le droit, il importe que le cr\u00e9ancier ne soit jamais autoris\u00e9 a conserver ce qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u, quand le d\u00e9biteur s\u2019est volontairement acquitt\u00e9; lui laisser l\u2019argent en privant le d\u00e9biteur de son action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, ce serait donner effet \u00e0 un acte illicite, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 1131 qui dit que ces obligations n\u2019en doivent produire aucun.\nIt would be a curious result, if, under the statute, a briber could withhold from the bribee, in a case like this, the money paid when an innocent party would be obliged to suffer his loss.\nIt is said in the respondent\u2019s factum that Consumers Cordage Co. v. Connolly[8], decided in this court, is based upon modern French jurisprudence, but that is not the case. As far back as 1839, the French courts began to restrict the application of the Roman maxims nemo auditur, etc., and quod nullum est nullum producit effectum. (S.V. 33, 1, 668; S.V. 44, 1, 584; S.V. 90, 2, 97; Meynial\u2019s note and Marcad\u00e9, vol. 4, at page 399), and to-day it is universally admitted that they do not apply where the obligation is based on an illicit, as distinguished from an immoral, cause. (Vide Fuzier-Her-man, vo. \u201cPaiement,\u201d No. 451. All the cases on this subject are collected in \u201cLa Revue Trimestrielle,\u201d 1913, at page 553 et seq.)\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs. idington J.\u2014Whilst respondent was mayor of DeLorimier, a municipal corporation, appellant tendered for the work of constructing some sewers and his tender was accepted and contract let accordingly.\nIt seems the appellant, who was not a man of much financial substance, then applied to respondent to finance him through the execution of these works.\nThere were proposals and counter proposals between these men, which ended by appellant giving respondent his promissory note for three thousand dollars, which is the note referred to in the following receipt given by respondent:\u2014\nMontr\u00e9al, 26 Oct., 1907.\nRe\u00e7u ce jour de M. M. Lapointe un billet \u00e0 trois mois pour valeur re\u00e7u il est entendu que le dit billet sera renouvable jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin des travaux comprenant les canaux des rues Chabot, Simard et Gilford.\nCe billet est renouvable sans int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nC. Messier.\nSeeing that the total amount earned under said contract and owing by the corporation in respect of these works when finished was the sum of twenty-two thousand seven hundred and twenty dollars and fifty cents ($22,720.50), for which the corporation gave its promissory note, on the 18th of July, 1908, and that th\u00e9 entire advances of the respondent to the appellant between the dates of his getting the remarkable document above quoted and the acquisition of this promissory note of the corporation was never more than nine thousand four hundred and fifty-nine dollars and twenty cents ($9,459.20), one is surprised at the audacity which can claim that the transaction truly represents interest or compensation of that sort for making such advances and means nothing else.\nThe appellant says that the respondent proferred a partnership in the contract on the basis of sharing equally in the profits, that he (appellant) did not assent, but, after several interviews that the respondent preferred it should be put in the shape of giving him the promise above set forth of three thousand dollars, and that when he discounted the corporation\u2019s note or renewal thereof (broken into four notes spread over a term of years) and wanted him to settle up, he claimed two thousand dollars in addition to this three thousand dollars, besides an item of three hundred and ninety-six dollars and sixty-five cents, for interest, which together would so closely represent the half of the actual profits admittedly made on this small contract, that I think it quite clear the respondent never let the proposal of partnership out of his mind. In truth, I infer, he was determined on the double advantage of securing at least three thousand dollars and, if the results should so turn out that he would find half the profits to be still better, to claim that as he did, in the mode he did.\nThe item of three hundred and ninety-six dollars and sixty-five cents ($396.65) for interest, the respondent says was interest computed up to the 22nd of May, 1908, at 7% or 8% on the actual advances made up to that date, and, in the witness box claimed he ought to get interest on later advances, but indicates that was overlooked by reason of the disputes that followed.\nIf all this does not indicate that he had in mind the idea that he intended to be and was interested in the profits, I am puzzled to know what his process of reasoning was.\nIt is quite clear he claimed he intended he should get five thousand dollars over and above the usual bank interest.\nIf it could not be called anything else, it certainly was a lavish commission coming to him out of a transaction in which the corporation of which he was mayor was concerned, and, I think, unless the statute prohibiting such officers from taking commission or other interests on its contracts is to be frittered away or repealed by judicial interpretation and construction, it is a violation thereof.\nThere are, besides the plain import of the transaction, several things in the respondents\u2019 evidence, such as his attempt to represent there were two contracts, when clearly only one, between the appellant and the corporation, and the erasure in the respondent\u2019s books, which, when taken with his evidence, shew or tend to shew a possibly false and fraudulent purpose on the part of the respondent and colour the whole story as against him.\nThe section 1, of 58 Vict., ch. 42 (Que.), relied upon is as follows:\u2014\n1. Any member of a municipal council who knowingly, during the existence of his mandate, has or had, directly or indirectly, by himself or his partner any share or interest in any contract or employment with, by or on behalf of the council, or who knowingly during the existence of his mandate, has or had through himself or his partner or partners, any commission or interest, directly or indirectly, or who derives any interest in or from any contract with the corporation or council of which he is a member, shall, upon a judgment obtained against him under the provisions of this Act, be declared disqualified from holding any public office in the said council or under the control thereof during the space of five years.\nSection 2 puts the matter thus:\u2014\n2. Any member of a municipal council who knowingly, during the existence of his mandate, has or had, directly or indirectly, through a partner or partners, or through the agency of any other person, any interest, commission or percentage, (in a contract), with the municipal council of which he is a member, or knowingly, during the existence of his mandate, has or had derived any pecuniary remuneration from any contract for work performed, or to be performed, shall upon a judgment obtained against him under this Act, be declared disqualified from holding any public office in the said council or under the control thereof for the space of five years.\nI have quoted these sections to shew how clear the purpose of the legislature was to prevent any member of the council from entering into any transaction which should place his personal interest in conflict with his duty to the corporation.\nFrom the moment the respondent accepted the document I have quoted above from a man whose financial position was such as to induce him to give it, he (respondent) was no longer fit to sit in council and effectively discharge his duty. The restrictive interpretation pressed upon us of this statute is not in harmony with the rules laid down in Heydon\u2019s Case[9] as applicable to penal as well as other statutes.\nThe duty of the judge relative to statutes and their interpretation can never be better defined than as expressed therein. And, if we are ever tempted by reason of a case presenting a want of \u201chonour among thieves\u201d or such like cause, to forget this, let us read the rule again.\nThen it is argued that the three thousand dollars by the discounting of the corporation\u2019s note or notes were paid and cannot be recovered back.\nHad the parties so proceeded as to bring this about, an arguable question might have been raised. But the best evidence they did not is that the respondent held on to the document quoted above and was driven to a tender thereof in answer to the demand of the appellant to settle by paying the balance of the proceeds of the corporation\u2019s notes.\nHis rapacity was such that he insisted on retaining the whole five thousand dollars and the interest he claimed and shews how and what he thought of the question of payment. It was still an unsettled thing and so remained, has herein been in substance and effect claimed by him in his pleadings as his due, and asserting that as his right he has never so pleaded as to raise the question his counsel now seeks to raise as a matter of law.\nThe issue has been fought out on such contentions at the trial and the suggestion now made is the thought of the able and ingenious counsel, who was not at the trial. There is no room left for arguing that this is a suit to recover back that already paid. If there were I should have to consider the effect of 58 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 11, cited in the appellant\u2019s factum.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court of appeal and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014In September, 1907, the appellant entered into a contract for the construction of certain municipal sewers. Finding himself unable to obtain the necessary advances from his bankers he applied to the defendant for assistance, who agreed to lend his credit in consideration of a bonus of $3,000. This term of the arrangement was evidenced by a promissory note for the sum of $3,000 and a contemporaneous acknowledgment in writing by the appellant of the receipt of the note which was declared to be renewable until the municipal works in question should be completed. The respondent was the mayor of the municipality and on behalf of the municipality, had executed the contract to which the appellant was a party. In August, 1908, the works in question having been finished, the appellant received from the municipality a promissory note for $22,720.50 (the sum due to him under his contract), payable in six months, the understanding being that the note was to be renewable at maturity. This promissory note, indorsed by the appellant, was delivered to the respondent; and one of the controversies at the trial related to the terms of the arrangement under which that was done. On this point it is sufficient for the present to observe that the appellant himself admits that the note of the municipality was transferred to the respondent \u201cen garantie of the notes which I owed him.\u201d\nThe respondent discounted the municipality\u2019s note at the Merchants Bank. In September, the appellant offered to repay the respondent the sums actually advanced by the respondent to him, with interest, demanding at the same time the return of the promissory note just referred to. This the respondent refused, alleging that he was entitled to retain a sum of $17,500 out of the proceeds, offering at the same time to return the difference between that sum and those proceeds. The appellant then procured possession of the note by paying the amount due upon it at the Merchants Bank; and this action was brought to recover the difference between the amount so paid and the advances made by the respondent.\nThe dispute concerns the amount nominally payable in respect of the promissory note already referred to by way of bonus. The position taken by the appellant is this. He says that this note was the outcome of an arrangement which in effect gave to the respondent an interest in his contract with the municipality. And such an agreement he says is void as offending against public policy. The respondent meets this by denying that the arrangement gave him any interest in the appellant\u2019s contract and by asserting that, in any event, the note was paid and that, consequently, the appellant is in the position of being obliged to rely upon an agreement which he alleges was unlawful to which he himself was a party.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention is based upon the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of 58 Vict. ch. 42 (Que.), which are as follows:\u2014\n1. Any member of a municipal council, who knowingly during the existence of his mandate has or had, directly or indirectly, by himself or his partner, any share or interest in any contract or employment, with, by or on behalf of the council, or who knowingly during the existence of his mandate, has or had through himself, or his partner or partners, any commission or interest, directly or indirectly, or who derives any interest, in or from any contract with the corporation or council of which he is a member, shall, upon a judgment obtained against him under the provisions of this Act, be declared disqualified from holding any public office in the said council or under the control thereof during the space of five years.\n2. Any member of a municipal council, who knowingly during the existence of his mandate has or had, directly or indirectly, through a partner or partners, or through the agency of any other person, any interest, commission or percentage (in a contract) with the municipal council of which he is a member or knowingly during the existence of any mandate has or had derived any pecuniary remuneration from any contract for work performed or to be performed, shall, upon a judgment obtained against him under this Act, be declared disqualified from holding any public office in the said council or under the control thereof for the space of five years.\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that it was understood between the appellant and the respondent in September, 1907, that the bonus of 13,000 should be paid out of the proceeds of the appellant\u2019s contract. Such being the understanding it appears to me that the respondent acquired an interest in the contract within the meaning of this statute, and that an agreement having that as its effect and one of its direct objects must, in view of the statute, be held to be an agreement contrary to public policy and void as such.\nThe substantial point in issue appears to be whether or not the appellant is precluded from recovering the amount of the note in question on the principle that the court will not assist a party to an illegal contract to recover moneys paid or property delivered under it where, at all events, the illegal purpose of the contract has been completely performed.\nThe appellant disputes the application of this principle, first, on the ground that, in the circumstances, there was no payment. This particular contention, I think, misses the mark. As I have already pointed out the note was delivered, by the appellant\u2019s own admission, to the respondent as collateral security for the promissory notes held by the respondent. It is not suggested that any exception of this note of $3,000 was made and, if the arrangement under which the note was given had not been tainted by illegality, it seems indisputable that the respondent would have been entitled to retain the note received from the municipality until the bonus note had been discharged. Assuming that the respondent committed a wrongful act in negotiating the municipality\u2019s note, the appellant would still only be entitled to recover, all question of illegality put aside, the damages suffered by him which would be measured by the difference between the value of the municipality\u2019s note and the amount for which the respondent was entitled to retain it as security. In either view the appellant must impeach the bonus note as given for an illegal consideration and could, therefore, succeed only through setting up the illegality of his own contract. The question comes squarely to be decided whether, according to the law of Quebec, such an action can succeed on such grounds. The respondent\u2019s counsel largely rests upon the decisions of the English courts, and, since the argument was mainly devoted to a discussion of these decisions, it is worth while, perhaps, going through them, although they do not appear to me to be strictly relevant to the point to be determined.\nIn applying the English law it may be observed the same principles apply as if the amount of the bonus note had been paid in money. Taylor v. Chester[10].\nThe general rule of the English law is stated in the judgment of Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson[11]:\u2014\nThe objection that a contract is immoral or illegal as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed, but it is founded in general principles of policy, which defendant has the advantage of contrary to the real justice as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may say so. The principle of public policy is this: ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If from the plaintiff\u2019s own stating or otherwise the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi caus\u00e2, or the transgression of a positive law of the country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage \u201cof it; for where both are equally in fault, potior est conditio defendentis. There are, however, apparent exceptions to this rule and the question is whether or not the present ease comes within any of those exceptions. These exceptions have been stated in two text-books of high repute and in two comparatively recent judgments. And before considering the scope of them in their application to this case it will b\u00e8 convenient to reproduce the passages:\u20141st, Pollock on Contracts, pages 404, 405:\u2014\nMoney paid or property delivered under an unlawful agreement cannot be recovered back, nor the agreement set aside at the suit of either party\u2014unless nothing has been done in the execution of the unlawful purpose beyond the payment or delivery itself (and the agreement is not positively criminal or immoral);\nOr unless the\u2019 agreement was made under such circumstances as between the parties that, if otherwise lawful, it would be voidable at the option of the party seeking relief.\u2014Note b. This form of expression seems justified by Harse v. Pearl Life Assurance Co.[12].\nOr in the case of an action to set aside the agreement, unless in the judgment of the court the interests of the third persons require that it should be set aside.\nSecondly, Anson on Contracts, p. 253-4:\u2014\nBut there are exceptional cases in which a man may be relieved of an illegal contract into which he has entered; cases to which the maxim just quoted does not apply. They fall into three classes: (1) The contract may be of a kind made illegal by statute in the interests of a particular class of persons of whom the plaintiff is one; (2) the plaintiff may have been induced to enter into the contract by fraud or strong pressure; (3) no part of the illegal purpose may have been carried into effect, before it is sought to recover the money paid or goods delivered in furtherance of it.\nThe first of the judgments is in Kearley v. Thomson(2), where Lord Justice Fry says (pp. 745-6):\u2014\nTo that general rule there are undoubtedly several exceptions, or apparent exceptions. One of these is the case of oppressor and oppressed, in which case usually the oppressed party may recover the money back from the oppressor. In that class of cases the dictum is not par, and, therefore, the maxim does not apply. Again, there are other illegalities which arise where a statute has been intended to protect a class of persons, and the person seeking to recover is a member of the protected class. Instances of that description are familiar in the case of contracts void for usury under the old statutes, and other instances are to be found in the books under other statutes, which are, I believe, now repealed, such as those directed against lottery keepers. In these cases of oppressor and oppressed, or of a class protected by statute, the one may recover from the other, notwithstanding that both have been parties to the illegal contract.\nI do not think the transaction in question here could be brought within the exceptions as stated by Lord Justice Fry, by Sir Frederick Pollock, or by Sir William Anson. Take first the judgment of Fry L.J. The transaction, as I view it, is not one prohibited by a statute passed for the protection of a class of persons\u201d of whom the appellant is one. It is a statute merely intended to disqualify from occupying certain positions of trust in relation to municipalities persons who bring themselves within the provisions of the Act. The object is to protect the municipalities and the public generally against the evils of corruption in municipal office. I do not think there is any ground for saying that this statute was passed with the object of protecting the interests of persons who engage in contracts with municipalities. The statute has nothing material to the present purpose in common with the class of statutes to which Lord Justice Fry refers\u2014to the \u201cUsury Acts\u201d and the statutes against lottery-keepers.\nThen, is this a transaction between \u201coppressor and oppressed\u201d as the phrase is used by Lord Justice Fry? It will be convenient to expand this phrase a little. Sir William Anson puts it in a slightly different way. He speaks of contracts procured \u201cby strong pressure.\u201d And Sir Frederick Pollock sums up the exceptions as consisting of agreements made in\nsuch circumstances as between the parties that, if otherwise lawful, they would be voidable at the option of the party seeking relief;\nin other words, all cases in which illegal agreements completely executed may be set aside by a person who is a party to them and in the interests of such persons alone are cases in which on substantive grounds, independently altogether of illegality, the transaction would be voidable by and for the benefit of such persons according to the general principles of law or according to the true intendment and effect of the statute which forbids it. The author cites in support to his proposition the following passage from the judgment of Collins M.R. in Harse v. Pearl Life Ass. Co.[13], p. 563:\u2014\nUnless there can be introduced the element of fraud, duress, or oppression, or difference in the position of the parties which created a fiduciary relationship to the plaintiff so as to make it inequitable for the defendants to insist on the bargain that they had made with the plaintiff, he is in the position of a person who has made an illegal contract and has sustained a loss in consequence of a misstatement of law, and must submit to that loss.\nWhether or not this view of the law on this point be open to criticism, it is clear enough when one comes to consider the decisions referred to in the text-books mentioned illustrating the attitude of the courts towards such plaintiffs, that one cannot bring the present transaction within the class of cases referred to by Fry L.J., as being cases of \u201coppressor and oppressed\u201d or by Sir William Anson as contracts procured \u201cunder strong pressure.\u201d In Reynell v. Sprye[14] it was held that the champertous agreement was obtained by fraud and that alone was sufficient ground for setting it aside. In Osborne v. Williams[15] the court had to consider a transaction between a father and son, the transaction itself being unfair and the son being at the time wholly within the father\u2019s control. In Atkinson v. Denby[16] the defendant had taken advantage of the plaintiff\u2019s situation to force him into an unfair bargain.\nThere is no evidence in this case of any such fraud or undue influence or unconscientious taking advantage of the appellant\u2019s situation. The appellant had a valuable contract; he approached the respondent, not as mayor, but as a person of capital in a position to assist him. The respondent was able to dictate terms quite independently of his position as mayor, and I think there is no adequate ground for holding that in fact the appellant was intimidated by the circumstance that the respondent held that office. The appellant had not entered upon the performance of his contract; if he were unable to get the necessary assistance to carry it out there is no reason to suppose that the municipality would not have permitted him to abandon it.\nIt was suggested that public policy would be better served by compelling the respondent to refund. That may be so; but I do not think the law of England on this subject leaves it to the judge or the court to determine in each particular case whether or not public policy will be best served by allowing moneys paid or property delivered under an executed contract void as against public policy to be recovered back by the party paying. On the contrary the general principle of the law is that stated by Lord Mansfield in the passage quoted above. The person seeking to recover must bring himself within one of the recognized exceptions to that principle or lie must fail. I think in this case the appellant has not done so, and that if his right to recover were to be determined according to the law of England he could not succeed.\nIt remains to consider the question whether according to the law of the Province of Quebec the appellant is precluded from recovery because of the unlawful character of his agreement with Messier.\nThe present case, I think, is not a case of payment of money. The appellant affirms that the respondent had no authority to discount the note; and, in view of the conduct of the respondent in the litigation and the discredit cast upon him by the trial judge, the appellant\u2019s story should, I think, be accepted. However, as I have already pointed out, the appellant can only make out his case by alleging the illegality of his contract and on principle he appears to be in the same position as if payment had been made; and, moreover, as I have already said, it was, no doubt, understood that the bonus was ultimately to be paid out of the proceeds of the contract. The general question is dealt with very elaborately in the judgment of the late Mr. Justice Girouard in Consumers\u2019 Cordage Co. v. Connolly[17], with which Mr. Justice Sedgwick and Mr. Justice King concurred. The authorities cited appear to shew that according to the more modern view the effect of section 989 of the Civil Code, a plaintiff in the situation of the appellant is entitled to relief on the ground that the illegal contract being without effect the defendant ought not to be permitted to retain that to which he never had any legal right.\nAlthough it may be doubtful whether that decision is strictly binding upon us in view of the subsequent course of the litigation, yet I think I ought to give effect to the opinion of the majority of the court which was not overruled by the Judicial Committee.\nAnglin J.\u2014The evidence, in my opinion, clearly discloses that the defendant had a share or interest in the plaintiff\u2019s contract with the municipal corporation of the Village of DeLorimier which falls under the penalizing provisions of articles 1 and 2 of the Quebec statute, 58 Vict. ch. 42. I am, with respect, unable to understand how the Court of King\u2019s Bench reached the conclusion that the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant was not \u201cillegal, prohibited or against good morals or public policy.\u201d But the case, in my opinion, is not within the purview of section 11 of the statute. There is no evidence that the defendant either performed or agreed to perform any service in his official capacity for the plaintiff in consideration of the $3,000 note given him.\nIf I could read the evidence as warranting a conclusion that the plaintiff had never authorized the defendant to retain out of the proceeds of the note of the municipal corporation, the amount of the $3,000 note now in question, the disposition of this case would be comparatively simple. The plaintiff would, in that event, be suing to recover money had and received to his use by the defendant, and the latter would be compelled to invoke the illicit contract as his only justification for retaining it. In such a defence he certainly could not succeed. I feel constrained, however, to take the view that, in directing the defendant to retain out of the proceeds of the note of the municipal corporation the sums due him, the plaintiff intended that he should pay to himself the amount of the $3,000 note which represented his illicit share of the plaintiff\u2019s profits on the contract with the municipality, and that this should be deemed a payment of this sum of $3,000 by the plaintiff to the defendant. It is, I think, a fair inference from the evidence that \u201cit was understood\u201d that the defendant was to pay himself the amount of the $3,000 note out of the proceeds of the discount of the note of the municipality.\nI agree with the view which has prevailed in the provincial courts in regard to the $2,000 kept by the defendant on the pretext that he was entitled to it for financing a second contract\u2014that he has neither right nor colour of right to retain it. There was no second contract.\nTwo objections are urged against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the sum of $3,000: 1st, that it was paid voluntarily, and, if in mistake, that the mistake was of law, not of fact; and 2ndly, that, in order to recover, the plaintiff must invoke the illegality of the contract under which this money was paid. Notwithstanding these objections, under the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec, the right to recover appears to exist.\nArticle 1047 of the Civil Code provides that:\u2014 He who receives what is not due to him through error of law or of fact is bound to restore it.\nMoney voluntarily paid in mistake of law is, therefore, recoverable, as has been held in many cases: Leprohon v. Le Maire de Montr\u00e9al[18]; Leclerc v. Leclerc[19]; Bain v. City of Montreal[20], at pages 265, 285.\nThere appears to be no doubt that under the system which prevailed before the adoption of the Civil Code full effect was given in French courts to the maxim of the Roman law, ex turpi caus\u00e2 non oritur actio, and the action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l\u2019indu did not lie to recover moneys paid under illegal contracts, save in cases of the sale or cession of public offices, which were treated as exceptional. It suffices to cite Pothier in support of this statement. But, by article 989 C.C., it is declared that\na contract without consideration or with an unlawful consideration has no effect.\nModern commentators, as well as modern decisions, appear to agree that, by this article, it was intended to do away with the operation of the Roman rule in so far as it precludes actions to recover back moneys paid under illicit contracts. Otherwise, it is said, some effect would be given to the illicit contract in contravention of the article of the Code. And it is pointed out that, while the Code was based largely upon the views of Pothier, in this particular his ideas were deliberately departed from. The right to recover moneys illegally paid is now the accepted rule, at all events where, as in the present case, the contract under which the payment has been made is merely illicit or contrary to public policy and not in se immoral or criminal. With this latter class of contract we are not now called upon to deal.\nThis subject was carefully reviewed by the late Mr. Justice Girouard in Consumers\u2019 Cordage Co. v. Connolly[21], at pages 298 et seq. His conclusion was that, under the Civil Code, money paid upon such an illicit contract is recoverable. I regard this authority as binding and I follow it without hesitation both as to the principal sum of $3,000 and as to the interest, 1396.65, which the provincial courts disallowed.\nIn such a case as we have now before us, if the difficulty as to voluntary payment did not exist (Wilson v. Ray[22]), the money illegally paid to the defendant would be recoverable in an English court. Although ordinarily money paid upon an illegar contract is not recoverable in a court administering English law, because nemo allegans suam turpitudinam est audiendus, and the maxim potior est conditio defendentis is applied\nwhere the parties to a contract against public policy or illegal are not in pari delicto (and they are not always so) and where public policy is considered as advanced by allowing either, or at least the more excusable of the two, to sue for relief against the transaction, relief is given to him as we know from various authorities of which Osborne v. Williams[23] is one. Reynell v. Sprye[24], at p. 679.\nAs I have already said, the principle of the decisions in such cases as Osborne v. Williams23, and Morris v. M\u2019Cullock[25], appears to have been accepted in France in regard to the sale of public offices even when it was held that the action en repetition did not lie to recover payments under illegal contracts.\nWhere, as here, there is a statutory prohibition of the contract under which the money has been paid and a penalty imposed on only one of the parties, they may be regarded as not in pari delicto; and, where public policy requires it, the party who is not penalized may have relief. 15 Am. and Eng. Encyc. (2 ed.) 1005.\nIt is very material that the statute itself, by the distinction it makes, has marked the criminal. For the penalties are all on one side; upon the office keeper.\nBrowning v. Morris[26], at page 793, per Lord Mansfield; Williams v. Hedley[27]. Here the penalties are imposed only on the municipal office-holder. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure, for the protection of the public, whom the office-holder represents, that he shall not have interests which may conflict with his duty to them. Public policy requires that he shall not be allowed to retain profits made out of contracts which give or may give him such a conflicting interest. In such a case public policy demands the intervention of the court. The guilty party to whom relief is granted is simply the instrument by which the public is served. 7 Cyc. 750.\nIt is upon grounds of public policy that similar relief is granted by English courts of equity in marriage brokage cases. Hermann v. Charlesworth[28]; Hall v. Potter[29].\nThese references to English law are probably quite superfluous in the present case, since I dispose of it on the authority of Consumers\u2019 Cordage Co. v. Connolly[30]. I make them merely to indicate that, in courts in which the maxim ex turpi caus\u00e2 non oritur actio ordinarily precludes relief where the plaintiff is obliged to set up illegality in which he has participated, such a case as the present would, on grounds of public policy, be deemed an exception to the general role and the public official would not be permitted to retain the fruits of his illicit bargain.\nWhile the plaintiff\u2019s conduct may savour of ingratitude and may appear to be such as not to entitle him to assistance of a court of justice, it must be borne in mind that he succeeds, notwithstanding his own demerit, solely because of the supreme importance, in the public interest, of frustrating attempts on the part of public officials to enrich themselves by forbidden means.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and that the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer dans cette cause:\u2014\n1. Si le maire d\u2019une municipalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans un contrat qu\u2019un entrepreneur a fait avec cette municipalit\u00e9;\n2. S\u2019il peut r\u00e9clamer le paiement d\u2019un billet promissoire qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour son int\u00e9r\u00eat dans ce contrat.\nNous avons aussi \u00e0 examiner en troisi\u00e8me lieu si le billet promissoire ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou compens\u00e9 il y a lieu \u00e0 une action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la part de l\u2019entrepreneur signataire du billet.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur a vu avec un soin jaloux \u00e0 ce que les conseils municipaux soient compos\u00e9s d\u2019hommes d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s qui, en acceptant de devenir membres du conseil, doivent se laisser guider exclusivement par l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nIl peut arriver sans doute que la d\u00e9cision de certaines questions affecte particuli\u00e8rement un ou plusieurs membres du conseil. Par exemple, s\u2019agit-il d\u2019un chemin ou d\u2019un cours d\u2019eau dans lequel des conseillers municipaux pourraient \u00eatre int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, ils doivent alors s\u2019abstenir de si\u00e9ger ainsi que le d\u00e9clare l\u2019art. 135 du code municipal qui dit:\u2014\nNul membre d\u2019un conseil ne peut prendre part aux d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations sur une question dans laquelle il a un int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel.\nLa question de savoir s\u2019il est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 ou non, doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par ses coll\u00e8gues sans qu\u2019il puisse voter sur cette question.\nNombre de d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues par nos tribunaux annulant des proc\u00e8s-verbaux ou des r\u00e8glements parce que les conseillers qui les avaient adopt\u00e9s \u00e9taient personnellement int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nQuand il s\u2019agit de contrats avec la municipalit\u00e9, non seulement ils ne peuvent pas voter sur ces contrats mais ils ne peuvent pas \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s membres du conseil ni agir comme tels (art. 205 du Code Municipal).\nDans le cas actuel, Lapointe, l\u2019appellant, avait le 26 septembre, 1907, fait un contrat avec le municipalit\u00e9 de DeLorimier pour la confection d\u2019\u00e9go\u00fbts. Il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, g\u00ean\u00e9 dans ses affaires, et il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 au maire, l\u2019intim\u00e9, Messier, pour qu\u2019il lui aide \u00e0 financer son entreprise. Ce dernier acc\u00e9da volontiers \u00e0 sa demande, mais exigea en retour que Lapointe lui donn\u00e2t la moiti\u00e9 de ses profits. Lapointe a trouv\u00e9 que les exigeantes de Messier \u00e9taient trop fortes et ils se sont entendus pour une somme de $3,000. Et Lapointe donna son billet pour ce montant le 26 octobre, 1907.\nMessier avan\u00e7a alors, dans le cours de l\u2019automne 1907 et du printemps 1908, l\u2019argent n\u00e9cessaire, savoir environ $12,000, pour payer les mat\u00e9riaux et la main d\u2019\u0153uvre en prenant des billets promissoires de Lapointe qu\u2019il escomptait dans une banque ou qu\u2019il gardait en sa possession.\nL\u2019entreprise fut termin\u00e9e au commencement de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1908. Tous comptes tir\u00e9s, la municipalit\u00e9 devait \u00e0 Lapointe $22,720.50, et comme il n\u2019avait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 qu\u2019environ $12,000, il se trouvait avoir fait un profit de $10,000.\nIl \u00e9tait convenu par le contrat entre Lapointe et la corporation que les paiements devaient se faire par cinq versements annuels et cons\u00e9cutifs dont le premier devenait d\u00fb un an apr\u00e8s l\u2019acceptation des travaux.\nLe premier versement serait donc devenu d\u00fb au commencement de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1908. Messier, le maire, a-t-il trouv\u00e9 que les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances \u00e9taient trop \u00e9loign\u00e9es, ou bien est-ce le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une erreur de la part des autorit\u00e9s municipales? Le conseil municipal, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser son maire \u00e0 signer au nom de la municipalit\u00e9 un billet promissoire qui serait payable en janvier, 1909, pour tout le montant.\nC\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une faveur consid\u00e9rable qui \u00e9tait faite \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur mais qui en m\u00eame temps permettait au maire de rentrer dans ses fonds sans plus de d\u00e9lai.\nLa preuve ne nous dit pas les circonstances qui ont motiv\u00e9 ce changement dans les termes de paiement. Mais il est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019y a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 absolument \u00e9tranger. D\u2019ailleurs il a sign\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame le billet qui allait lui permettre de se rembourser de suite des avances qu\u2019il avait faites \u00e0 Lapointe.\nLe billet est endoss\u00e9 par Lapointe et remis \u00e0 Messier qui en fait faire l\u2019escompte et en touche le montant.\nMessier, qui n\u2019avait avanc\u00e9 qu\u2019environ $12,000 \u00e0 Lapointe, aurait d\u00fb remettre \u00e0 ce dernier environ $10,000. Mais il exigea d\u2019abord $3,000 pour le billet qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait fait donner le 26 octobre, 1907, et il r\u00e9clamait en outre environ $2,000 pour l\u2019avoir aid\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un autre contrat avec la municipalit\u00e9. La cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement d\u2019opinion que Messier n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 ces $2,000.\nLa cour d\u2019appel cependant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Messier pouvait garder les $3,000, montant du billet du 26 octobre, 1907.\nCe billet de $3,000 repr\u00e9sente-t-il une convention l\u00e9gale?\nJe n\u2019h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que non.\nLe maire d\u2019une municipalit\u00e9 ne peut pas avoir directement ni indirectement un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans un contrat avec sa corporation (art. 205). Cette prohibition du code municipal a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e en termes encore plus s\u00e9v\u00e8res dans la l\u00e9gislation contenue dans le chapitre 42 de 58 Vict.\nLe section 2 dit:\u2014\nTout membre d\u2019un conseil municipal qui a sciemment, pendant la dur\u00e9e de son mandat, directement ou indirectement, par un associ\u00e9 ou des associ\u00e9s, ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019une autre personne, quelque int\u00e9r\u00eat ou commission dans un contrat avec le conseil municipal dont il est membre, ou qui a sciemment, pendant la dur\u00e9e de son mandat, retir\u00e9 de ce contrat quelque avantage p\u00e9cuniaire pour travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s ou a ex\u00e9cuter, sera, sur jugement obtenu contre lui, en vertu de cette loi, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inhabile \u00e0 remplir une charge dans le dit conseil ou sous le contr\u00f4le du dit conseil durant l\u2019espace de cinq ans.\nNous relevons \u00e0 la section 11 du m\u00eame statut la disposition suivante qui autorise dans certains cas Faction en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition et qui dit:\u2014\nQuiconque a pay\u00e9 quelque somme d\u2019argent, commission, honoraire ou r\u00e9compense \u00e0 un membre du conseil municipal pour services rendus ou \u00e0 rendre par tel membre en sa qualit\u00e9 officielle, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de services rendus par tel membre lui-m\u00eame, directement ou indirectement ou par l\u2019entremise d\u2019un tiers, et pour s\u2019occuper d\u2019une affaire devant le conseil du devant un comit\u00e9 du conseil, peut, en tout temps, recouvrer cette somme par action ordinaire devant une cour de juris-diction comp\u00e9tente.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident pour moi que la consid\u00e9ration du billet de $3,000 en question \u00e9tait pour la part de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du d\u00e9fendeur intini\u00e9 dans les travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s pour la corporation.\nCette consid\u00e9ration \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale parce qu\u2019elle est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public et aux bonnes m\u0153urs.\nL\u2019article 990 du Code dit:\u2014\nLa consid\u00e9ration est ill\u00e9gale quand elle est prohib\u00e9e par la loi, ou contraire aux bonnes moeurs ou \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public.\nLes bonnes m\u0153urs et l\u2019ordre public requi\u00e8rent que les municipalit\u00e9s soient administr\u00e9es par des personnes d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9es, que les membres du conseil n\u2019aient pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats ni directement ni indirectement dans aucun contrat municipal.\nIls sont les mandataires des municipes et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public doit \u00eatre leur seul guide. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de disposition formelle dans nos lois statutaires contre la mauvaise foi du mandataire infid\u00e8le, sa responsabilit\u00e9 serait la m\u00eame sous la loi commune. Toute convention qu\u2019il fait contrairement \u00e0 cela, viole les principes de la loi naturelle et elle est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public et aux bonnes m\u0153urs.\nLe billet du 26 octobre, 1907, est donc nul et de nul effet. Je trouve dans la jurisprudence am\u00e9ricaine la d\u00e9cision suivante qui peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause: Smith v. City of Albany[31]: \u201cWhere by the charter of a city the members of the common council were prohibited from being interested in any contract for which payment must be made under any ordinance of the common council and a member of the council, by a secret arrangement with a contractor, became interested in such a contract, it was held that a note given by the contractor to such member for his share of the profits of the contract was void and, being void, an assignee thereof could not recover\u2019 upon it.\u201d\nL\u2019action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition existe-t-elle si ce billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9?\nIl y a eu divergence d\u2019opinion \u00e0 ce sujet. Mais l\u2019opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale chez les auteurs modernes est que cette action existe. Voir Marcad\u00e9, vol. 4, No. 458; Hue, vol. 8, No. 392; Laurent, vol. 16, No. 164; Baudry Lacantinerie, vol. 11, No. 316.\nCette question est venue devant cette cour dans la cause de Consumers\u2019 Cordage Co. v. Connolly[32], et mon pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, le regrett\u00e9 juge Girouard, dans son jugement, en a fait une \u00e9tude compl\u00e8te. On a dit que cette opinion avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une erreur. Au contraire, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 l\u2019a adopt\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019il a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s pour trouver si l\u2019acte criminel que l\u2019on reprochait aux parties et qui donnait lieu \u00e0 l\u2019action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition avait r\u00e9ellement en lieu. Voir la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 rapport\u00e9 au volume 89 du Law Times, p. 347.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je suis d\u2019opinion que le billet de $3,000 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 pour une consid\u00e9ration ill\u00e9gale et que le maire est oblig\u00e9 de le remettre \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur Lapointe sans pouvoir en exiger le paiement.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d\u2019appel.\nAppeal alloived with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Angers, delorimier, Godin & deLorimier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Monty & Duranleau.\n[1] [1883] 8 App. Cas. 120.\n[2] [1891] 1 Q.B. 168.\n[3] 75 L.J.P.C. 79.\n[4] (1911) 2 K.B. 992, at p. 997.\n[5] 14 Q.B.D. 735.\n[6] 11 Q.B.D. 533.\n[7] 3 E. & B. 530.\n[8] 31 Can.

She requested her husband to have a will prepared and, on his instructions, his brother, an advocate, drafted a will whereby the husband was made sole beneficiary. Upon this will being read over to her, in the forenoon, the testatrix took exception to it because it ignored a promise, made to her father, that certain property she had received from him should ultimately revert to members of her own family; and she did not then execute it. Another will was drafted by the husband\u2019s brother to meet her wishes, but, either on account of her drowsiness or because of the presence in her bedroom of friends, including her sister, the plaintiff, the second will, though ready at noon, was not presented to the testatrix for signature until late in the afternoon, when she attempted to sign it, but the brother declared it worthless owing to the illegibility of the signature. On being told of this opinion, the will read to her in the morning, or one similar in its contents, was presented to her for signature and her husband offered to read it to her, but she declined to have this done, saying that she had already heard it read and knew its contents; she then signed it with her mark in presence of witnesses. In an action to set aside the last will, the evidence failed to establish that the testatrix understood its contents and the difference between its provisions and those of the will which she had attempted to sign, nor did it remove suspicion arising from the fact that the impeached will had been prepared under the instructions of the sole beneficiary, and other peculiar circumstances attending its execution.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 22 K.B. 252), the Chief Justice dissenting, that the evidence failed to establish that the will in question expressed the true last testamentary wishes of the testatrix and, consequently, that it should be set aside.\nBarry v.

Cinq-Mars, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014The will in this case is attacked on several grounds. I quote from the plaintiff\u2019s declaration:\u2014 (1) Le dit testament est nul et entach\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 pour cause d\u2019erreur de la part de la testatrice, de dol, de suggestion et de captation de la part du d\u00e9fendeur et d\u2019autres personnes d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui au moment o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9tendu testament parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; (2) les formalit\u00e9s relatives au testament suivant le mode d\u00e9riv\u00e9 de la loi d\u2019Angleterre et relat\u00e9es dans les articles 851, 852, 853, 854 et 855 du code civil n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies dans le cas actuel; (3) au jour et \u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 le testament parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, la testatrice, dame Flore Lamoureux, vu son \u00e9tat de grande faiblesse, tant de corps que d\u2019esprit, les m\u00e9dicaments qu\u2019on lui servait, les souffrances atroces qu\u2019elle endurait, ne pouvait donner un consentement entier et valable \u00e0 ce pr\u00e9tendu testament.\nThat the will was duly executed was found by both courts below. The trial judge found against the will on the ground that the husband of the deceased induced her to sign it on the false representation that the previous will was invalid because the signature was illegible. Whether it was or not, I submit respectfully, is not in issue here, but that the husband was so informed by his brother, a professional man, cannot be doubted. I understand that the majority here is of opinion that the will in question was properly executed and that the testatrix was of sound and disposing mind, but that it does not truly express her last intentions and that she was in error as to its provisions when she signed it.\nWhat are the facts? The parties married in Quebec, under what is known there as a \u201cr\u00e9gime de s\u00e9paration de biens.\u201d The husband, therefore, would not, in case of intestacy, inherit anything from his wife. They apparently lived together for twenty-seven years. During all that time the wife was under the impression that the last survivor would inherit everything. When the attention of her husband was drawn to the true situation, his observation was \u201cin my wife\u2019s present condition, I am not to trouble her about such things.\u201d This is not evidence of rapacity on his part. The respondent\u2019s father saw the priest who was about to attend on the deceased and he was asked to speak to her about her temporal affairs, and it was only as a result of that interview that the husband came to interfere in the matter at all. For what occurred when the wife gave her instructions to draw the will we must rely entirely upon his evidence. He says that her suggestion was that he should have the property, but that, when he came finally to dispose of it, he should bear in mind her promise to her father to give what she had received back to her family. I read the husband\u2019s evidence to mean that the deceased was prepared to execute the will leaving everything to him on his personal undertaking to comply with her request. He thought, however, that it would be more satisfactory to have the wife\u2019s wish expressed in the will itself. Hence the change.\nIf anything is clear in this unfortunate controversy, it is that the wife\u2019s wish was to give her husband her estate, relying upon him to carry out her verbal request with respect to her family, and the effect of this judgment is to defeat that intention. For that reason I think the appeal should be dismissed. As the evidence was carefully and ably analyzed by the Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, I do not think it necessary to do more than to say that I adopt his conclusions as well as his reasons.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent\u2019s late wife, whose health had not been very satisfactory for some time, fell rather suddenly very ill. She was nervous and suffered such pain that her physician, in order to alleviate her sufferings, administered morphine. He intimated to her husband that her condition was such that her spiritual adviser should be called in, and the reverend Father Charbonneau was accordingly sent for. On his reaching the house, he was interviewed by the father of the respondent, domiciled with him, and asked to bring under the notice of the sick woman the fact that her worldly affairs were not settled and to advise her to consider same.\nSomething is sought to be made of the different versions given on the trial hereof, by respondent\u2019s father and the priest, both as to what transpired at this interview and what the priest reported to him after leaving the sick-room of the dying woman.\nI attach little importance to any such discrepancy, though accepting the priest\u2019s version of what was said.\nThe eagerness of respondent\u2019s father is, of course, the subject of fair criticism. But the important thing to be observed is that it was not until after the priest had discharged his duties as required, by administering the last rites of the church to the sick woman, that the subject of making a will had ever been considered by her.\nImmediately after the departure of the priest, respondent tells that he was called into her room and, when the nurse had retired and no one else present, he was spoken to by her on the subject of her worldly affairs which, up to then, she had seemed to think settled.\nThe result of what seems to have been a very brief interview was that the brother of the respondent, also living in the same house and an advocate by profession, was asked to draw a last will and testament for his wife according to instructions given by him. The brother, accordingly, without any interview with her, drew up the following very short will:\u2014\nPar mesure de prudence, et sans me croire nullement dangereusement malade, je prends, \u00e0 tout \u00e9nv\u00e9nement, les pr\u00e9sentes dispositions: Je donne et l\u00e8gue, sans restriction, \u00e0 mon \u00e9poux, Isa\u00eee Craig, tous mes biens, tant immeubles que meubles, sauf les cadeaux qu\u2019il jugera \u00e0 propos de faire \u00e0 mes proches comme souvenirs. Et je d\u00e9clare ne pouvoir signer.\nWhen this wals read to her by respondent, she, as he testifies, said:\u2014\nSi tu pouvais faire quelque chose pour ma famille; mon p\u00e8re m\u2019a toujours demand\u00e9 de penser \u00e0 eux autres en autant que la chose serait de mon go\u00fbt, j\u2019aimerais que tu ferais la m\u00eame chose si tu peux.\nHe says that, thereupon, he withdrew and instructed his brother accordingly. The brother drew then a will which reads as follows:\u2014\nOutremont, Montr\u00e9al, 5 Juillet, 1911.\nPar mesure de prudence et sans me croire dangereusement malade, je prends \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement les pr\u00e9sentes dispositions: Je donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 mon \u00e9poux, Isa\u00eee Craig, tous mes biens tant immeubles que meubles, sauf les cadeaux qu\u2019il jugera \u00e0 propos de faire \u00e0 mes proches, comme souvenirs. Suivant les recommendations de mon d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re, je lui recommande de m\u00eame de ne donner ou l\u00e9guer ces dits biens \u00e0 nuls autres qu\u2019aux membres de ma famille, et je signe.\nFlore Lamotjreux.\nI omit in each case the attesting clause signed by the witnesses, I desire only to present the actual operative form of each of these wills. All this took place about half-past ten or eleven o\u2019clock in the morning of the 5th of December.\nWhy she was not asked to sign this latter will till five o\u2019clock in the afternoon is not, to my mind, at all clearly established beyond suspicion.\nIt is said, by and on behalf of the respondent, that she slept and only awoke about five o\u2019clock.\nIt appears, however, that her sister, the appellant, had called about eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon and stayed until five p.m. Nothing was said to her of these wills or of the purpose that existed relative thereto. It may be but a coincidence that she slept whilst the sister remained, but I cannot rid my mind of the suspicion that her sister\u2019s presence was equally a barrier in the way.\nHowever that may be, the sands of life were meantime ebbing fast, for in forty hours she was dead. The stock of vitality which was able in the morning to discuss the difference between the will first read to her and what it omitted and she would have preferred to have it provide for, had become so low at five o\u2019clock that she could not write her name so as to be legible when she attempted to subscribe the second will and, obviously, could not see the material difference between them, and treated the one as the equivalent of the other.\nWe are asked to believe as conclusive of her capacity to understand that she asked if this one to which she set her mark was the same as read in the morning, and to have her spectacles handed to her.\nThere is a marked difference between these two wills. And the fact that she did not observe it seems conclusive that she did not apprehend clearly what she was doing or saying.\nI am not concerned with any difference in their legal effect. I cannot assume that she was possessed of that legal knowledge and acumen that would have enabled her to decide that they were (if they were) in law the same.\nTo the ordinary mind they were as widely different as can be on the point she had called attention to in the morning and requested consideration of. She had forgotten. She had been drugged. She, when aroused from the slumber that induced, clearly had not that grasp of thought to enable her to discover this vast difference in language. That difference ought, but for the condition of mind thus induced, to at least have revived her memory relative to what she had requested. Nay, more, her request, veiled in the language of affection and politeness as quoted above, ought, to my mind, to have been treated by her husband as that of a command, or have, at least, driven him to the straight course of bringing to his wife the adequate assistance in the way of the independent skill of some one to whom she might have given instructions freed from the embarrassment of his presence.\nThe dying are entitled to such consideration at the hands of those they have loved and cared for. Or if he had even taken the appellant into his confidence and left the sisters to settle the matter and the dying woman had then, as the result of such consideration, persisted in leaving it entirely in his discretion whether she should leave him absolute owner or not, he would have possibly been relieved from the suspicion he must now forever rest under.\nHe has not removed it so as to comply with the law as laid down in the leading cases of Barry v. Butlin[3], and Fulton v. Andrew[4].\nIn the latter case, at foot of page 471 and top of page 472, Lord Hatherly uses language to be borne in mind in such cases as this. It is as follows:\u2014\nThere is one rule which has always been laid down by the courts having to deal with wills, and that is, that a person who is instrumental in the framing of a will, as these two persons undoubtedly were, and who obtains a bounty by that will, is placed in a different position from other ordinary legatees who are not called upon to substantiate the truth and honesty of the transaction as regards their legacies. It is enough in their case that the will was read over to the testator and that he was of sound mind and memory, and capable of comprehending it. But there is a further onus upon those who take for their own benefit, after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown upon them the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\n\u201cNow,\u201d again adopting the language of Lord Hatherly, \u201chow did the respondent discharge this onus in the present case\u201d?\nWhat I have related and suggested answer that he failed.\nBut, when we find that she left no children, that her property came from her father, that her sister had children surviving, that her father had extracted from her a solemn promise that the property should return ultimately to his family, the hopes and wishes she had expressed to her husband, so illuminated by such facts and read in light of the law applicable to one directing all and so directing it as to make the result enure entirely to his benefit, seem to have been so disregarded that this instrument cannot be called her will.\nI think we must find that he undoubtedly failed to discharge the onus resting upon him.\nThere is much that might be said relative to the details of the execution and attestation of this pretended will but, in view of the answer which these broad features of the case present, it seems needless to dwell on such details.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored. Duff J. concurred with Brodeur J.\nAnglin J.\u2014This case has given me not a little trouble and anxiety. Three questions arise: First: Had the testatrix mental capacity? Second: Was the will propounded by the defendant duly executed? Third: Does the evidence sufficiently remove the suspicion created by the facts that the instrument in question was prepared under the instructions of the husband of the testatrix, the defendant, who is the sole beneficiary, and its execution was procured by him\u2014a suspicion which is augmented by the peculiar circumstances of this case\u2014and establish that it expresses the true last will of the testatrix and that she knew and approved of its contents? Tyrell v. Painton[5].\nThe evidence has satisfied me that the testatrix had testamentary capacity at certain times on the day in question. McLaughlin v. McLellan[6]; Martin v. Martin[7]; Kaulbach v. Archbold[8]. From about noon until after four o\u2019clock she slept most of the time under the effect of a dose of a quarter of a grain of morphine administered about eleven o\u2019clock. She appears to have been awake and fully conscious from about half-past four until after five o\u2019clock, when the nurse gave her another dose of one-eighth grain of morphine to allay her pain. Whether the effect of this latter dose had not so much benumbed her faculties by six o\u2019clock, or shortly after, when the will now propounded was executed, that she was unable to fully appreciate the differences between it and the paper she had attempted to sign a short time before, is, I think, extremely doubtful. Yet it is essential to the validity of the will propounded by the defendant that he should establish that, at this time, the testatrix was capable of thus discriminating between the two wills and of understanding and approving the contents and effect of that to which she finally put her mark.\nIt is not satisfactorily proven that the formalities prescribed for the execution of a will in the English form were observed. The evidence of nurse Laporte, although in some parts uncertain, in the end seems clear enough that the three witnesses signed this will in the room of the testatrix and in her presence and that it was another will, to which the testatrix had previously put an illegible signature, which, although then believed to be of no value, was subsequently signed by the same witnesses in another room\u2014a peculiar circumstance, if it be the fact, of which there is no real explanation in the evidence. The witness, Marie-Louise Craig, is most unsatisfactory; and the evidence of the third witness, Dorila Amyot Lessard, while by no means clear, rather goes to shew that it was the signatures to the document now propounded which were affixed by the witnesses in another room and out of the presence of the testatrix. On the whole evidence, perhaps the balance of probability is in favour of the due execution of the will propounded. But it is not satisfactorily proven.\nIt is upon the third question, however, that the chief difficulty arises. The suspicion created by the facts that the defendant is the sole and absolute beneficiary under this will, that it was he who gave the instructions for its preparation to his brother, Fernand Craig, who is a lawyer, and that he was present at and procured its execution is greatly increased by the following circumstances, deposed to by himself. The testatrix, when the defendant read this instrument to her on the morning of the 5th of July (possibly in the presence of nurse Laporte, as was found by the trial judge upon evidence which is very slender, to say the least), expressed a desire that he should do something for her family in conformity with a wish of, if not in fulfilment of a promise made by her to, her father from whom she had received her property. The trial judge finds that she then refused to sign the will as drawn. As pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, there is no direct proof of such a refusal. The evidence, however, warrants the inference that the testatrix took exception to the will in the form in which it was read to her. In order to comply with the wish thus expressed by his wife, the defendant had his brother draft another will in which, after bequeathing her property to her husband, she recommends him not to give or bequeath it to any persons other than members of her family. This will was drawn about noon, but was not presented to the testatrix until after five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, either because she was drowsy from the effect of the dose of morphine given to her about eleven o\u2019clock, or because of the presence of visitors in her room, including her sister, the plaintiff, who remained from about eleven o\u2019clock to five o\u2019clock. The testatrix signed this will, apparently with much difficulty, and at the cost of considerable effort. It was subsequently attested, but, probably, not in her presence. This opinion is expressed by Archambeault C.J. in rendering the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The signature of the testatrix is said to have been illegible. The brother of the defendant, who had drawn the wills, was not present at the execution of either and was not called as a witness in this case. On seeing the defective signature, he expressed the opinion that it was worthless and that the will which bore it was invalid. The good faith of this professional opinion may be open to serious doubt. But I proceed on the assumption that fraud was not intended. On being told that her signature was insufficient, the testatrix, according to the testimony of the defendant, asked that the first writing of the morning should be brought to her. The defendant and the three witnesses say that he offered to read to her the document which he brought, but that she said it was unnecessary, that he had read it to her and that she knew its contents. She asked for a pen and her spectacles and signed it by making a cross. The witnesses then signed, probably in the room of the testatrix and in her presence. This took place about or shortly after six o\u2019clock in the evening. The testatrix died on the morning of the 7th of July. The will now in question was admitted to probate in common form on the 3rd of August.\nIn his preliminary examination, although asked generally to tell the circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of this will, which he propounds, the defendant made no allusion to the preparation or attempted execution of the other will. At the trial, during the early part of his evidence, occupying fourteen pages of the appeal case, he entirely suppressed the fact that another will had been drawn. He gives a manifestly false explanation of the delay in the execution of the will now propounded, which was read to the testatrix in the morning but not signed until the evening. It is only when pointedly asked whether there were two wills made that, after first pretending to be surprised and not to understand the question, (\u201cje ne saisis pas la chose,\u201d) when pressed he discloses the circumstances which led to the preparation of the second instrument and the facts concerning it. He was undoubtedly trying to conceal those facts. In a number of particulars\u2014some important, some not\u2014his evidence at the trial differs from the testimony which he gave on preliminary examination. He is not a frank or candid witness and his conduct in the litigation adds to the very grave suspicion which already surrounded this case.\nThe will to which the testatrix attempted to place her signature undoubtedly expressed with approximate accuracy her real testamentary wishes. It was only because she was told that the illegibility of her signature to that document rendered it worthless that she assented to signing another. The defendant sought to make it appear that it was the testatrix herself who asked that the document first prepared should be brought to her for signature. The other witnesses, Laporte, Marie-Louise Craig and Lessard, do not corroborate him on this point. His father, speaking of the time when the testatrix had endeavoured to sign the second instrument, says:\u2014\nElle a essay\u00e9 de le signer, elle a voulu faire des lettres et elle n\u2019a pas eu la force de mettre sa signature comme il faut. Fernand \u00e9tait absent, il est arriv\u00e9 sur ces entrefaites-l\u00e0, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, il a dit: \u201ccela ne vaut rien, celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ce matin vaudra mieux; faites-lui donc signer celui-l\u00e0;\u201d \u00e7\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, \u00e7\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9.\nMoreover, although the witnesses agree that, when the defendant brought in the will now in question, he offered to read it to his wife and she declined to hear it read upon being told that it was the will which had been read to her in the morning, in the evidence of nurse Laporte we find this passage:\u2014\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est dit?\nR. On a rapport\u00e9 ce papier, vingt minutes, une demi-heure apr\u00e8s, peut-\u00eatre pas tout \u00e0 fait autant, on est arriv\u00e9 avec celui-l\u00e0 et elle a demand\u00e9 si c\u2019\u00e9tait bien le m\u00eame; on lui a dit\u2014\"Oui, je te l\u2019ai lu,\u201d et elle a mis sa croix.\nThere is, no doubt, evidence from which an inference might be drawn that the testatrix knew that she was signing the document which had been read to her in the morning; but it is far from being absolutely clear that she was not confused or that she fully appreciated that it was not to a copy of the second will, which had been read to her shortly before and which she had attempted to sign, that she was asked to make her mark. The execution of this instrument took place about or shortly after six o\u2019clock\u2014nurse Laporte says about twenty minutes \u2014 Dorila Amyot Lessard, some few minutes\u2014after she had endeavoured to sign the other document. She had an injection of one-eighth grain of morphine about five o\u2019clock. Did she appreciate the difference between the two instruments when asked to make her mark to that now propounded because her attempted signature to the other was illegible? Did she, consciously and fully realizing what she was doing, abandon the wish she had expressed in the morning and the will giving effect to that wish, with which she had announced her satisfaction when it had been read to her some fifteen or twenty minutes before? Whether benumbed faculties afford the true explanation of her signing at six o\u2019clock a will to which she had taken exception at noon, or whether she accepted the document presented to her because she was fatigued and tired of the whole affair and anxious to be done with it, as her repeated expression \u201cd\u00e9p\u00eachez vous\u201d would indicate, or, perhaps, feared that she might not continue in a fit state to make a will long enough to have another prepared more exactly in accord with her wishes, is by no means clear. Whatever the explanation, she put her mark to an instrument which did not fully express her wishes\u2014not of her own initiative, but upon this document being presented to her for signature by her husband at the suggestion of his brother, Fernand Craig, who undoubtedly could have given evidence that would be very valuable upon material points in this case. He was not called. The defendant, on whom lay the burden of proof, must bear the consequences of failure to call him.\nWhatever the true facts may be, no adequate reason is given for the testatrix relinquishing her desire to have her father\u2019s wish carried out\u2014and the evidence is by no means convincing that she did consciously and deliberately abandon her intention to give effect to that wish and decide of her own volition to make the will in which it is ignored.\nThe learned trial judge found against the will propounded on the ground that its execution was invalid because procured by a mistaken representation of law, viz., that the imperfection of the signature to the other will rendered it valueless. The court of appeal held that this mistake did not avoid the later will. Apparently proceeding on the footing that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff and that she had failed to prove the allegations of her declaration, the appellate court held that the will attacked contained the last wishes of the testatrix; that she was of sound mind at the time of its execution; and that this will was made in conformity with the formalities prescribed by law. The judgment of the Superior Court was reversed and the action dismissed. With great respect I think there was error in charging the plaintiff with the burden of proving that the formalities of execution were not observed and, more especially, that the will propounded by the defendant did not really express the last wishes of the testatrix. Probate in common form of this will having been granted, the plaintiff was, no doubt, obliged to begin. But, so soon as it appeared that the will had been procured by the defendant who was the sole beneficiary, the burden of proof shifted. Tyrell v. Painton[9]; Brown v. Fisher[10]; Fulton v. Andrew[11]; St. George\u2019s Society of Montreal v. Nichols[12]; art. 858 C.C.\nSomething has been said of alleged intrinsic evidence afforded by the documents themselves that the will to which the testatrix finally affixed her mark was not the document read to her in the morning. But, as this aspect of the case does not appear to have been gone into at the trial, I pass no opinion and rest nothing upon it.\nOn the whole case, though not without some hesitation, due chiefly to the contrary view unanimously taken by the learned judges of the court of appeal, I have reached the conclusion that the burden which rested upon the defendant, particularly in regard to establishing that the will propounded expresses the true last testamentary wishes of the testatrix and that when executing it she knew and approved of its contents, has not been satisfactorily discharged. The principle of the decision in Harwood v. Baker[13], s: cited by counsel for the appellant, applies to this case. See also Tribe v. Tribe[14].\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court of appeal, and the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit du testament de Madame Isaie Craig, n\u00e9e Flore Lamoureux, dont on conteste la validit\u00e9.\nCe testament qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait suivant la forme d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de la loi d\u2019Angleterre, est dat\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 5 juillet, 1911.

Marie-Louise Craig, sa cousine, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que:\u2014\nLa croix appos\u00e9e au bas du dit testament est celle de Dame Flore Lamoureux, qui n\u2019a pas pu signer de sa main ses nom et pr\u00e9nom, vu son \u00e9tat de faiblesse;\nLa signature appos\u00e9e au bas du dit testament Marie-Louise Craig est ma propre signature, et je l\u2019ai appos\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence et \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de la testatrice;\nLes signatures \u201cDame Dorilla Amiot Lessard\u201d et \u201cAnna-Maria Laporte\u201d sont celles de ces personnes qui ont sign\u00e9 devant moi en pr\u00e9sence et \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de la testatrice.\nLes h\u00e9ritiers de la d\u00e9funte n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 cette v\u00e9rification qui s\u2019est faite ex parte et le protonotaire a alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le testament d\u00fbment prouv\u00e9.\nLe 21 ao\u00fbt, 1911, la pr\u00e9sente action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e par la s\u0153ur de la testatrice, l\u2019une de ses h\u00e9riti\u00e8res, pour faire annuler ce testament en all\u00e9guant en substance que ce testament \u00e9tait le fruit de l\u2019erreur et du dol, qu\u2019il y avait eu suggestion et captation, qu\u2019il ne repr\u00e9sentait pas la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice et que les formalit\u00e9s essentielles n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a comparu par le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019avocat Craig, son fr\u00e8re, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui avait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les deux ou trois projets de testament en question \u00e0 cette date du 5 juillet, 1911. Il y a eu cependant substitution de procureur et M. l\u2019avocat Craig a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper comme avocat du d\u00e9fendeur.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge Bruneau, a annul\u00e9 le testament P. 1, en disant qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par erreur.\nLa cour d\u2019appel a renvers\u00e9 le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et a maintenu le testament.\nLa demanderesse, par le pr\u00e9sent appel, nous demande de consid\u00e9rer la validit\u00e9 du testament et de l\u2019annuler.\nIl s\u2019agit surtout d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite; car la diff\u00e9rence d\u2019opinion entre les deux cours inf\u00e9rieures r\u00e9sulte de leur interpr\u00e9tation des faits. Il y a cependant la question de Vonus probandi qui se pr\u00e9sente aussi.\nLe demandeur a examin\u00e9 les trois t\u00e9moins du testament et le d\u00e9fendeur. Je suis d\u2019opinion que la preuve qu\u2019il a faite est suffisante pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le testament.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, cette preuve \u00e9tait suffisante pour faire dispara\u00eetre la pr\u00e9somption qui r\u00e9sultait de la v\u00e9rification en faveur du testament. L\u2019onus probandi retombait sur le d\u00e9fendeur. Ce dernier aurait d\u00fb alors faire entendre son fr\u00e8re, l\u2019avocat qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ce testament et qui aurait pu \u00e9clairer la justice sur les incidents de cette journ\u00e9 du 5 juillet, 1911.\nAvant de diss\u00e9quer cette preuve, il convient que je rappelle bri\u00e8vement des faits qui me paraissent admis par les deux parties et au sujet desquels la preuve offre une certitude assez parfaite.\nM. et Mde. Craig, le l\u00e9gataire et la testatrice, \u00e9taient mari\u00e9s depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es et n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019enfants. Ils \u00e9taient s\u00e9par\u00e9s de biens.\nLe 5 d\u00e9cembre, 1904, le p\u00e8re de Madame Craig, Olivier Lamoureux, lui aurait fait donation d\u2019une somme de $7,000. Il lui aurait fait promettre plus tard, et m\u00eame jurer sur les \u00e9vangiles, de donner le capital de ses biens aux membres de sa famille.\nMadame Craig \u00e9tait d\u2019une sant\u00e9 d\u00e9licate, souffrant de gastrite depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Le 3 juillet, 1911, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de prendre le lit. Les m\u00e9decins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mand\u00e9s et son cas paraissant d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9, une garde-malade fut appel\u00e9e \u00e0 son chev\u00eat. Elle demeurait depuis longtemps chez son beau-p\u00e8re avec son mari et les deux fr\u00e8res de ce dernier. Parmi ces fr\u00e8res se trouvait l\u2019avocat Fernand Craig.\nLe 5 juillet au matin, on d\u00e9cida de faire venir le pr\u00eatre pour lui administrer les sacrements. Et alors le p\u00e8re Craig a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils, le mari de la malade, si elle avait fait un testament. Sur r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative et sur le refus du mari d\u2019aborder ce sujet avec sa femme, le p\u00e8re a attendu l\u2019arriv\u00e9e du pr\u00eatre; et, avant que ce dernier entr\u00e2t dans la maison, il lui a dit de sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 la malade de faire un testament.\nLe cur\u00e9 s\u2019est charg\u00e9 du message; et apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part la mourante aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la garde-malade de faire venir son mari \u00e0 qui elle aurait exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir de faire son testament.,\nNous n\u2019avons quant \u00e0 ses instructions que le t\u00e9moignage du mari, le l\u00e9gataire, car la garde-malade n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rest\u00e9e dans la chambre. Au lieu de faire venir un notaire, il crut qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de faire r\u00e9diger le testament par l\u2019avocat Fernand Craig, son fr\u00e8re, qui \u00e9tait alors dans la maison.\nCe dernier aurait \u00e9videmment pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un testament par lequel le mari \u00e9tait institu\u00e9 l\u00e9gataire universel en jouissance et en propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCe projet de testament ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 par le mari \u00e0 sa femme. Nous ne savons ce qui s\u2019est alors pass\u00e9 que par le t\u00e9moignage du mari. Il est sur ce point aussi bien que sur bien d\u2019autres, si peu satisfaisant, et m\u00eame si contradictoire, que je ne puis pas l\u2019accepter sans corroboration.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, ce testament n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9able \u00e0 la femme et elle a d\u00fb alors lui rappeler la promesse ou le serment qu\u2019elle avait fait \u00e0 son p\u00e8re et elle a d\u00fb sugg\u00e9rer de faire un autre testament par lequel elle l\u00e9guerait ses biens en jouissance \u00e0 son mari et en nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux membres de sa famille, puisque l\u2019avocat Fernand s\u2019est mis \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre pour r\u00e9diger un nouveau testament par lequel, apr\u00e8s avoir l\u00e9gu\u00e9 ses biens \u00e0 son mari, elle ajoutait:\u2014\nSuivant des recommendations de mon d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re je lui (\u00e0 mon \u00e9poux) recommande de m\u00eame de ne donner ou l\u00e9guer ces dits biens \u00e0 nuls autres qu\u2019aux membres de ma famille.\nOn ne sait pas pourquoi ce testament ne fut pas alors sign\u00e9 de suite. Sur ce point il y a deux versions \u00e9galement probables. La premi\u00e8re, c\u2019est que la malade s\u2019est endormie ou qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait trop faible et qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas voulu la d\u00e9ranger. La seconde, c\u2019est que l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de la demanderesse, vers cette heure-l\u00e0, a g\u00ean\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur, qui n\u2019a pas voulu qu\u2019il f\u00fbt question du testament en pr\u00e9sence de la s\u0153ur de la testatrice.\nJe dois dire ici que depuis une couple de jours on faisait prendre \u00e0 la malade de la morphine pour apaiser ses douleurs qui, au t\u00e9moignage de tout le monde, \u00e9taient des plus atroces. Les m\u00e9decins experts qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s sont d\u2019opinion que ce traitement avait pour effet d\u2019amoindrir ses facult\u00e9s intellectuelles, que son cerveau ne pouvait pas \u00eatre aussi clair et aussi lucide et que la morphine diminuait la force de sa volont\u00e9.\nDans le cours de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de la s\u0153ur, le d\u00e9fendeur s\u2019est mis en frais de faire signer ce second testament. Il l\u2019aurait lu en pr\u00e9sence des trois t\u00e9moins, Madame Lessard, Mlle. Craig et Mlle. Laporte. La testatrice aurait alors demand\u00e9 ses lunettes et aurait griffonn\u00e9 sa signature.\nLe juge instructeur d\u00e9clare que les t\u00e9moins auraient de suite, en sa pr\u00e9sence, sign\u00e9 l\u2019attestation.\nA l\u2019arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la maison de l\u2019avocat Fernand Craig, il prit connaissance de la signature de Mde. Craig et, ayant trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait illisible, il aurait alors dit en pr\u00e9sence de son p\u00e8re qui nous le rapporte:\u2014\nCela ne vaut rien; celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ce matin, vaudra mieux, faites lui donc signer celui-l\u00e0.\nEt alors le mari serait revenu dans la chambre avec un autre projet de testament. On ne le lui aurait pas lu. Elle aurait fait sa marque d\u2019une croix. Ce testament est celui qui est en litige et qui, comme je l\u2019ai dit plus haut, a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, mais maintenu par la cour d\u2019appel.\nComme le testament portant la signature plus ou moins lisible de la testatrice devra \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9 assez souvent au cours de ce jugement, je vais le d\u00e9signer comme le testament de jouissance, ou le testament P. 2. Nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence de deux testaments bien diff\u00e9rents. Dans l\u2019un elle donne tous ses biens \u00e0 son mari, sans restriction. Dans l\u2019autre, elle lui recommande de ne l\u00e9guer ou donner ces biens qu\u2019aux membres de sa famille. Sons d\u00e9cider de la port\u00e9e exacte de ces deux testaments, mais pour simplifier les faits en litige, je dirai que dans le premier elle institue son mari l\u00e9gataire en jouissance et en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 tandis que dans le second il n\u2019est que le l\u00e9gaitaire en usufruit, la famille de la testatrice devant avoir la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQuelles \u00e9taient les intentions de la testatrice avant de tester?\nNous avons la promesse formelle qu\u2019elle a faite \u00e0 son p\u00e8re de ne pas laisser sortir les biens de sa famille. Ce serment qu\u2019elle avait donn\u00e9, elle s\u2019en est \u00e9videmment rappel\u00e9, puisqu\u2019elle a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019on en fasse mention dans le testament P. 2. Elle avait d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 ses s\u0153urs, avec que elle \u00e9tait dans les relations les plus intimes, que son mari aurait la jouissance et que ses neveux auraient la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses biens.\nNous avons bien, d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la d\u00e9claration du p\u00e8re Craig qu\u2019elle lui aurait dit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que tout ce qu\u2019elle avait, retournerait \u00e0 son mari. Mais la cour sup\u00e9rieure, en pr\u00e9sence de ces t\u00e9moignages contradictoires a accept\u00e9 la version des premiers t\u00e9moins en disant: \u201cqu\u2019il est certain d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve que le testament exhibit P. 2 celui consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme portant une signature illisible, contient et exprime exactement la volont\u00e9 et l\u2019intention de l\u2019\u00e9pouse du d\u00e9fendeur dans la disposition de ses biens.\u201d\nEt la cour d\u2019appel ne para\u00eet pas attacher au t\u00e9moignage du p\u00e8re Craig plus d\u2019importance que la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nDonc nous pouvons dire que l\u2019intention de la testatrice \u00e9tait de disposer de ses biens de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils ne sortent pas en d\u00e9finitive de sa famille.\nCe sentiment est d\u2019ailleurs conforme \u00e0 ce qui se fait d\u2019ordinaire dans les familles canadiennes-fran\u00e7aises. On y est toujours soucieux de conserver les biens dans une famille. Nous en avons d\u2019ailleurs la preuve \u00e9vidente dans le principe des substitutions qui, quoique aboli en France, a \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9 cependant dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nCette intention de la testatrice de laisser ses biens a sa famille, non seulement elle l\u2019avait manifest\u00e9e avant de tomber dangereusement malade, mais elle l\u2019a \u00e9videmment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 son mari quand il est venu lui lire le premier projet de testament. Ce projet, suivant la version du mari, et il est le seul pour nous dire ce qu\u2019il s\u2019est pass\u00e9, ne donnait rien \u00e0 sa famille. Elle lui a rappel\u00e9 les recommandations de son p\u00e8re, et c\u2019est alors que le fr\u00e8re du mari, l\u2019avocat Craig, a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un nouveau testament, l\u2019exhibit P. 2, qui contenait le legs de nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de la famille de la testatrice.\nCe testament aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 lu en pr\u00e9sence des t\u00e9moins. La testatrice aurait paru l\u2019avoir bien compris et elle y aurait appos\u00e9 sa signature avec beaucoup de difficult\u00e9, c\u2019est vrai, ce qui montre son grand \u00e9tat de faiblesse. Mais quand on montre cette signature \u00e0 l\u2019avocat \u00e0 son retour, il dit:\u2014\nCelle ne vaut rien, celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ce matin vaudra mieux, faites lui donc signer celui-l\u00e0.\nLe mari informe sa femme qu\u2019il faut recommencer parce que la signature n\u2019est pas correcte; et alors on substitue au testament P. 2, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire au testament o\u00f9 le mari n\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e9gataire qu\u2019en usufruit, un autre testament, l\u2019exhibit P. 1, o\u00f9 il est l\u00e9gataire en usufruit et en propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nComment cela s\u2019est-il fait? Comme c\u2019est le fait le plus important dans la cause, il est bien important de diss\u00e9quer soigneusement la preuve sur ce point. C\u2019est ce que je vais faire.\nIl faut d\u2019abord dire que les trois femmes qui ont attest\u00e9 ce testament, ont, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, donn\u00e9 leur t\u00e9moignage avec peu de clart\u00e9. Elles paraissent bien de bonne foi, surtout Madame Lessard et Mlle. Laporte, la garde-malade. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019autre, Mlle. M. L. Craig, elle \u00e9tait tellement \u00e9nerv\u00e9e qu\u2019on a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de suspendre son t\u00e9moignage et de remettre la cause \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. Elle para\u00eet bien dispos\u00e9e en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur. On lui a demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait en amour avec lui et la question n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 permise. Mais il est \u00e9tabli que le d\u00e9fendeur allait la voir tous les jours, c\u2019\u00e9tait sa cousine, c\u2019est vrai. Et devant cette cour il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9 et non contredit de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait maintenant mari\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur.\nLa demanderesse appelante pr\u00e9tend que la testatrice, en signant de sa croix l\u2019exhibit P. 1, croyait signer un testament semblable \u00e0 celui qu\u2019elle avait essay\u00e9 de signer quelques minutes avant.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur intim\u00e9, au contraire, pr\u00e9tend que la testatrice a demand\u00e9 de changer ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas donner ses biens en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 sa famille.\nPour arriver \u00e0 r\u00e9ussir, la d\u00e9fendeur doit d\u00e9montrer formellement qu\u2019il y a eu un changement d\u2019opinion chez la testatrice. Autrement il devra succomber dans ses pr\u00e9tentions. Voyons la preuve. D\u2019abord, prenons Mlle. Laporte, la garde-malade. Il y a dans son t\u00e9moignage beaucoup de confusion et d\u2019incertitude. Elle est de la meilleure foi du monde, j\u2019en suis convaincu; mais\u201d elle n\u2019est pas bris\u00e9e aux affaires, elle a, comme les autres t\u00e9moins du testament, \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e dans l\u2019ignorance de ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 le matin entre le mari et la femme lorsque celleci a demand\u00e9 de faire un testament et a manifest\u00e9 ses intentions.\nCe qui a donn\u00e9 lieu aussi \u00e0 beaucoup de confusion, c\u2019est que pour les avocats le premier testament, c\u2019est celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le matin, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire le testament donnant tout sans restriction; tandis que pour les t\u00e9moins, le premier testament est celui qu\u2019elles ont sign\u00e9 le premier, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire l\u2019exhibit P. 2, ou le testament avec signature illisible.\nVoici ce que dit Mlle. Laporte. On lui demande:\nVoulez-vous prendre connaissance de l\u2019original du testament qui est d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la cour et que je vous exhibe, et dire si c\u2019est le premier ou le deuxi\u00e8me qui est ici?\nR. C\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me celui-l\u00e0.\nQ. Etes-vous bien certaine de cela?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nPar Mtre. G. Lamothe, C.R., conseil du d\u00e9fendeur:\nQ. Celui, qu\u2019on vous exhibe maintenant, c\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nPar Mtre. J. A. Hurteau:\u2014\nQ. Ce testament qui vous est exhib\u00e9 maintenant et qui est marqu\u00e9 comme document \u201cA\u201d dans la liasse de documents, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant la cour, est le deuxi\u00e8me?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nElle a l\u00e0 bien identifi\u00e9 les testaments. On l\u2019interroge plus loin, pour savoir si le testament d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la cour, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire le testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu. Voici le texte de sa d\u00e9position \u00e0 ce sujet:\u2014 Q. Le testament qui est devant la cour, vous dites qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu par qui?\nR. Par monsieur Isaie Craig.\nPar le juge:\u2014\nQ. En pr\u00e9sence des trois t\u00e9moins?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nPar Mtre. J. A. Hurteau:\u2014\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s?\nR. Ils se sont tous retir\u00e9s pour aller souper; moi, je suis rest\u00e9e seule avec elle dans la chambre.\nCette d\u00e9claration est absolument inexacte. Ce testament d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la cour n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 lu. La testatrice a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. Il n\u2019y a eu qu\u2019un testament de lu; c\u2019est l\u2019exhibit P. 2, mais non pas le testament v\u00e9rifi\u00e9, ou celui devant la cour.\nOn l\u2019interroge encore sur cette lecture et elle n\u2019est pas aussi positive. Voici d\u2019ailleurs cette partie de son t\u00e9moignage:\u2014\nQ. Savez-vous qu\u2019est-ce que Monsieur Craig a lu?\nR. Il a lu un papier d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel son \u00e9pouse lui donnait tout ce qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait.\nQ. Savez-vous quel papier? Est-ce celui-l\u00e0? Etes-vous capable de jurer que c\u2019est celui-l\u00e0 ou le second testament?\nR. Je crois que c\u2019est celui-ci, celui qui est d\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nQ. Vous le croyez?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Etes-vous capable de le jurer?\nR. Je ne me rappelle pas assez, mais je crois que c\u2019est celui-ci.\nOn lui fait dire la diff\u00e9rence qu\u2019il y avait entre les deux testaments et, en parlant du testament par lequel la testatrice d\u00e9sirait que ses biens iraient \u00e0 sa famille, on lui demande:\u2014\nQ. Ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu \u00e0 la malade?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nComme on le voit, elle s\u2019est contradite; mais elle \u00e9tait de bonne foi; c\u2019est \u00e9vident. L\u2019honorable juge-en-chef de la cour d\u2019appel d\u00e9clare que la testatrice, apr\u00e8s avoir sign\u00e9 le testament P. 2 et apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait nul,\ndemanda d\u2019apporter le premier projet de testament, celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 dans l\u2019avant-midi.\nEt il se base sur le t\u00e9moignage de Mlle. Laporte et de Mlle. Craig.\nMlle. Laporte est loin d\u2019\u00eatre positive. Voici d\u2019ailleurs ce qu\u2019elle dit, quand on lui en parle pour la premi\u00e8re fois, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on lui e\u00fbt fait rapporter ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 au sujet du testament P. 2.\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, qu\u2019est-ce qui s\u2019est dit?\nR. On a rapport\u00e9 ce papier vingt minutes, une demi-heure apr\u00e8s, peut-\u00eatre pas tout \u00e0 fait autant, on est arriv\u00e9 avec celui-l\u00e0 et elle a demand\u00e9 si c\u2019\u00e9tait bien le m\u00eame, on lui a dit: \u201cOui, je te l\u2019ai lu\u201d et elle a mis sa croix.\nPar Mtre. Cinq-Mars:\u2014\nQ. Vous avez dit tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure, si j\u2019ai bien compris, que Madame Craig avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son mari si c\u2019\u00e9tait le m\u00eame testament qu\u2019elle avait sign\u00e9 dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi qu\u2019on voulait lui faire marquer de sa croix?\nR. Non, si c\u2019\u00e9tait bien ce qu\u2019on lui avait lu.\nQ. Si c\u2019\u00e9tait ce qu\u2019on lui avait lu?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Voulez-vous dire qu\u2019en parlant de cela, madame Craig voulait mentionner le testament qu\u2019elle avait sign\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re illisible? Ou du testament qui est produit en cette cause?\nR. Moi, je veux parler de celui-ci, de celui qui est produit en cour.\nPar le juge:\u2014\nQ. Est-ce que dans le temps le testament qui est devant vous, lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lu?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nPar Mtre. J. A. Descarries, C.R., conseil de la demanderesse:\u2014\nQ. Avez-vous vu l\u2019autre document ou testament sur lequel vous avez dit que la testatrice avait mis une signature illisible?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. L\u2019avez-vous lu? R. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Que disait ce testament?\nR. Exactement la m\u00eame chose, except\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait un d\u00e9sir d\u2019exprim\u00e9.\nQ. Quel d\u00e9sir?\nR. Que ses biens iraient \u00e0 sa famille.\nPar le juge:\u2014\nQ. Que ses biens iraient \u00e0 sa famille?\nR. Oui, un d\u00e9sir.\nQ. Ce qu\u2019on voudrait savoir de vous, mademoiselle Laporte, si quand on est venu avec vous avec le testament qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9 de sa croix, et qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 si s\u2019\u00e9tait le testament qu\u2019on lui avait lu, est-ce le testament qui est produit maintenant devant la cour dont parlait la malade?\nR. Celui qui est avec la croix.\nQ. Celui qui est maintenant devant la cour?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nPar Mtre. J. A. Descarries, C.R., conseil de la demanderesse:\u2014\nQ. Voulez-vous dire qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 on pr\u00e9sentait \u00e0 la malade le testament qui est maintenant devant la cour et la malade a demand\u00e9: \u201cEst-ce le testament qu\u2019on m\u2019a lu?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Quand elle disait cela, voulait-elle parler du testament qui est maintenant devant la cour? Ou de l\u2019autre testament dont vous avez parl\u00e9 vous-m\u00eame? Quand elle a dit \u201cest-ce le testament qu\u2019on m\u2019a lu\u201d voulait-elle parler, quand elle disait cela, voulait-elle mentionner l\u2019autre testament ou bien celui-ci?\nR. Je crois que c\u2019est celui-ci?\nQ. Vous croyez que c\u2019est celui-ci?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Quand elle parlait de la sorte, voulait-elle parler du testament dans lequel un d\u00e9sir \u00e9tait exprim\u00e9 que ses biens iraient \u00e0 sa famille?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Elle ne voulait pas parler de celui-l\u00e0?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Pourquoi dites-vous cela?\nR. Parce qu\u2019on nous a lu la premi\u00e8re partie du testament qui \u00e9tait, si je me rappelle bien, la m\u00eame chose que celui-ci et le d\u00e9sir a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9.\nPar le juge:\u2014\nQ. Sur le testament?\nR. Oui, sur celui qui avait une signature illisible. Par Mtre. J. A. Descarries, C.R., conseil de la demanderesse:\u2014\nQ. C\u2019est apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9 que celui qui est devant la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la malade pour \u00eatre sign\u00e9?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. L\u00e0, elle a demand\u00e9: \u201cEst-ce celui que vous m\u2019avez lu\u201d? et on lui a r\u00e9pondu: Oui\u201d parce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lu?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nPeut-on concevoir quelque chose de plus incertain et d\u2019aussi peu satisfaisant?\nTrouve-t-on dans cette d\u00e9position l\u2019intention formelle de la testatrice de changer son testament?\nNon. Suivant Mlle. Laporte, elle aurait demand\u00e9: \u201cEst-ce le testament qu\u2019on m\u2019a lu?\u201d Le mari a r\u00e9pondu: \u201cOui, je te l\u2019ai lu.\u201d La testatrice devait supposer que c\u2019\u00e9tait celui qu\u2019on venait de lui lire, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire, l\u2019exhibit P. 2, celui o\u00f9 elle faisait certains legs \u00e0 sa famille.\nMaintenant Mlle. Laporte suppose cependant qu\u2019il peut s\u2019agir du testament pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le premier, le matin. Ce n\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019une supposition de sa part; mais nullement bas\u00e9e sur les propres termes de la testatrice. Et quand on la presse \u00e0 ce sujet, elle finit par cette phrase incompr\u00e9hensible:\u2014\nParce qu\u2019on nous a lu la premi\u00e8re partie du testament qui \u00e9tait, si je me rappelle bien, la m\u00eame chose que celui-ci et le d\u00e9sir a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9.\nJe suis incapable, avec une preuve comme celle-l\u00e0, de dire avec la cour d\u2019appel que cette testatrice a chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e et que le testament sous croix repr\u00e9sente sa volont\u00e9. D\u2019ailleurs, on demande \u00e0 Mlle. Laporte:\u2014\nY a-t-il eu quelque suggestion de faite devant vous par la testatrice de changer le premier testament qu\u2019elle avait sign\u00e9 dans lequel elle exprimait le d\u00e9sir que ses biens iraient \u00e0 sa famille?\nR. Pas \u00e0 ma connaissance. Cette r\u00e9ponse cat\u00e9gorique, suivant moi, r\u00e8gle le point.\nMlle. Craig, la cousine du d\u00e9fendeur, est l\u2019autre t\u00e9moin sur lequel la cour d\u2019appel se base pour d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il y a changement d\u2019id\u00e9e chez la testatrice. Son t\u00e9moignage cependant n\u2019est pas beaucoup plus clair que celui de Mlle. Laporte. Elle \u00e9tait tellement \u00e9nerv\u00e9e qu\u2019on a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de suspendre les proc\u00e9dures et d\u2019ajourner la cause pour lui donner l\u2019avantage de se remettre.\nQue dit-elle?\nElle commence sa d\u00e9position par ces d\u00e9clarations-ci qui ne sont gu\u00e8re compr\u00e9hensibles.\nQ. Y a-t-il eu seulement un testament?\nR. C\u2019est \u00e0 dire qu\u2019il y en a eu deux.\nQ. Voulez-vous expliquer la chose?\nR. Il y en a eu un qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9, mais la signature \u00e9tait illisible.\nQ. Est-ce le premier qu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9?\nR. C\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me.\nQ. Celui dont la signature \u00e9tait illisible, c\u2019\u00e9tait le deuxi\u00e8me?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous \u00eates bien positive que c\u2019est le deuxi\u00e8me?\nR. Autant que je peux me rappeler, vous savez dans ces occasions-l\u00e0.\nQ. Expliquez \u00e0 la cour ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 afin que je sache par vous m\u00eame comment les choses se sont pass\u00e9es?\nR. Quand je suis arriv\u00e9e, monsieur Craig, quelques minutes apr\u00e8s, m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de lire un papier que j\u2019ai lu, il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 si je voulais le signer. Madame Craig ne l\u2019a pas sign\u00e9, elle a fait sa croix sur le testament, et c\u2019est plus tard qu\u2019on a sign\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019on a sign\u00e9 apr\u00e8s elle, elle avait sign\u00e9 un testament dont la signature \u00e9tait illisible.\nQ. Avant ou apr\u00e8s?\nR. Apr\u00e8s, autant que je peux me rappeler, il me semble.\nQ. Pourquoi aurait-elle sign\u00e9 un second testament; pouvez-vous le dire \u00e0 la cour?\nR. Moi, je ne le puis pas.\nQ. Dites ce que vous savez?\nR. La-signature n\u2019\u00e9tait pas beaucoup compr\u00e9hensible.\nQ. C\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019elle aurait sign\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me testament, le premier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas compr\u00e9hensible? R. Oui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi.\nQ. D\u2019apr\u00e8s vous?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous venez de dire que le testament dont la signature n\u2019\u00e9tait pas compr\u00e9hensible avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 le deuxi\u00e8me. Vous venez de dire cela?\nR. Vous m\u2019embrouillez tellement que je ne puis me le rappeler.\nQ. Comment est-ce que je vous embrouille?\nR. Je ne puis pas vous r\u00e9pondre.\nQ. Pers\u00e9v\u00e9rez-vous \u00e0 dire que le testament sur lequel on dit que la testatrice a mis une signature illisible a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le deuxi\u00e8me?\nR. Je ne puis pas le dire.\nQ. Pourquoi?\nR. Parce que je suis malade.\nLa d\u00e9position du t\u00e9moin est ajourn\u00e9e \u00e0 onze jours et Mlle. Craig, qui dans l\u2019intervalle avait eu les visites presque quotidiennes du d\u00e9fendeur, r\u00e9apparut et, nous relevons ce qui suit:\u2014\nQ. Oui, comment il se fait qu\u2019on a chang\u00e9 de testament?\nR. Elle a sign\u00e9 un papier.\nQ. O\u00f9?\nR. Dans sa chambre, elle a sign\u00e9 un papier, la signature \u00e9tait illisible; alors on a pens\u00e9 que ce papier-l\u00e0 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bon et on a rapport\u00e9 un autre que son mari lui a demand\u00e9 pour lui lire et elle a dit: \u201cSi c\u2019est celui de ce matin, je n\u2019ai pas besoin, je le sais,\u201d elle a sign\u00e9 d\u2019une croix, et apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir lu je l\u2019ai sign\u00e9.\nQ. Jurez-vous qu\u2019elle a prononc\u00e9 ces mots-l\u00e0, \u201ccelui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu ce matin\u201d?\nR. Oui, je le jure.\nPlus loin on lui demande:\u2014\nQ. Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019on a dit a madame Craig pour lui faire signer l\u2019autre testament, vu qu\u2019elle venait d\u2019en signer un?\nR. On lui a dit que la signature \u00e9tait illisible\u2014je crois que c\u2019est cela qu\u2019on lui a dit; je ne me le rappelle pas au juste, vous savez cette journ\u00e9e-l\u00e0 j\u2019\u00e9tais si impression\u00e9e de la voir malade que je ne pouvais presque pas rester l\u00e0.\nO\u00f9 est la preuve l\u00e0 que la testatrice ait chang\u00e9 d\u2019id\u00e9e? Serait-ce dans cette phrase:\u2014\nSi c\u2019est celui de ce matin, je n\u2019ai pas besoin, je le sais? Mais elle n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 d\u2019apporter celui du matin. D\u2019ailleurs ces mots \u201csi c\u2019est celui du matin,\u201d on ne les retrouve pas dans la bouche de Mlle. Laporte et encore moins dans celle de Mde. Lessard.\nD\u2019ailleurs, Mlle. Craig nous dit elle-m\u00eame qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais entendu madame Craig dire cette journ\u00e9e l\u00e0 qu\u2019elle voulait donner ses biens \u00e0 son mari. Elle nous dit aussi, Mlle. Craig, que la testatrice n\u2019a pas voulu entendre la lecture du second testament parce que cela la fatiguait trop.\nMadame Lessard nous dit bien franchement qu\u2019elle a toujours cru que les deux testaments comportaient la m\u00eame chose, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire, jouissance au mari et propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la famille de la testatrice.\nCe t\u00e9moin aussi se m\u00eale quant \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des testaments et elle nous dit tant\u00f4t que c\u2019est le testament P. 1 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 le premier et plus tard elle se reprend et dit que c\u2019est celui P. 2.\nElle est certainement de bonne foi.\nMaintenant quant \u00e0 la phrase qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dite par la malade quand on lui a apport\u00e9 le testament P. 1, voici ce qu\u2019elle dit:\u2014\nQ. Ce testament sur lequel elle a sign\u00e9 de sa croix lui a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 lu en votre pr\u00e9sence?\nR. Non, monsieur Craig a offert de lui lire encore et elle n\u2019a pai voulu, elle a dit: \u201cCe n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, je vais signer tout d\u00e9 suite\u201d\nQ. Son mari lui a offert de lui lire encore?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nIl n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 question de testament du matin, comme le dit Mlle. Craig.\nVoil\u00e0 ce que nous disent les t\u00e9moins du testament.\nJe ne puis arriver \u00e0 d\u2019autres conclusions que la testatrice en signant de sa croix le testament attaqu\u00e9 a cru signer un document semblable \u00e0 celui qu\u2019elle avait sign\u00e9 quelques minutes auparavant. Ces d\u00e9positions ne sauraient justifier un tribunal de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019elle voulait donner ses biens \u00e0 son mari seul.\nCette substitution s\u2019est faite suivant le d\u00e9sir de l\u2019avocat Fernand Craig qui d\u00e9clarait en pr\u00e9sence de son p\u00e8re, apr\u00e8s avoir vu le testament P. 2 portant la signature illisible:\u2014\nCela ne vaut rien, celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ce matin vaudra mieux; faites lui donc signer celui-l\u00e0.\nEt alors on a substitu\u00e9 un testament \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\nCes deux testaments \u00e9taient bien diff\u00e9rents et sans entrer dans les m\u00e9rites de la dissertation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, je me contenterai de citer le jugement que nous avons rendu dans la cause de Shearer v. Hogg[15], pour d\u00e9montrer que la recommandation d\u2019un testateur peut engendrer des obligations.\nJe pourrais aussi sur ce point citer: Baudry Lacantinerie, vol. X., No. 1836; Coin Delisle, sur l\u2019art. 967, No. 4; Laurent, vol. XIII., No. 480; Fuzier Herman, Repertoire, vo. \u201cTestaments,\u201d No. 68; Demolombe, vol. XXL, No. 51; Zacharise, Aubry et Rau, vol. V., p. 492.\nOnus Probandi.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9 si le testament attaqu\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moins en pr\u00e9sence de la testatrice.\nLa preuve sur ce point n\u2019est pas non plus tr\u00e8s satisfaisante. Les trois femmes ne sont gu\u00e8re bien positives. Il est un fait bien certain, c\u2019est que l\u2019un de ces testaments a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 dans la chambre de la malade et l\u2019autre a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 dans la chambre de l\u2019avocat, hors de la pr\u00e9sence de la testatrice.\nIl aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9ressant de conna\u00eetre \u00e0 ce sujet la version de l\u2019avocat. C\u2019est bien malheureux qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin.\nNous devons au sujet de ce testament fait suivant la forme anglaise appliquer les r\u00e8gles du droit anglais. C\u2019est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre de Migneault v. Malo[16].\nThe law which introduced into Canada the English law as to wills must be considered as having introduced it with all its incidents, and, therefore, with the admissibility of oral evidence.\nDans un cas aussi peu clair que celui qui nous occupe, c\u2019\u00e9tait le devoir du d\u00e9fendeur de prouver luim\u00eame que le testament \u00e9tait valide. Cette r\u00e8gle par laquelle le fardeau de la preuve retombe dans des circonstances comme celle-ci sur le l\u00e9gataire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par Lord Hatherly dans la cause de Barry v. Butlin[17]:\u2014\nThere is one rule which has always been laid down by the courts having to deal with wills and that is that a person who is instrumental in the framing of a will and who obtains a bounty by that will, is placed in a different position from other ordinary legatees who are not called upon to substantiate the truth and honesty of the transaction as regards their legacies. It is enough in their case that the will was read over to the testator and that he was of sound mind and memory and capable of comprehending it.\nBut there is a further onus upon those who take for their own benefit after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown upon themselves the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\nEt cette cour a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le m\u00eame principe dans la cause de Mayrand v. Dussanlt[18], en d\u00e9cidant:\u2014 That as the promoter of the will by which he took a bounty, had failed to discharge the onus of proof cast upon him to shew that the testator had acted freely and without undue influence in the revocation of the former will, the second will was invalid and should be set aside.\nIl s\u2019agissait dans cette cause de Dussault d\u2019un testament authentique fait dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe juge Tait dans la cause de St. George\u2019s Society of Montreal v. Nichols[19], a aussi rejet\u00e9 le fardeau de la preuve sur le l\u00e9gataire qui avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le testament.\nC\u2019est une r\u00e8gle juste et equitable que nous devons appliquer dans cette cause.\nIl y avait un t\u00e9moin bien important qui aurait pu nous donner une foule de renseignements sur la confection de ces testaments. C\u2019est l\u2019avocat qui les a r\u00e9dig\u00e9s.\nIl aurait pu nous dire pourquoi le testament P. 1 se termine par les mots: \u201cEt je d\u00e9clare ne pouvoir signer\u201d et pourquoi le testament qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit quelques minutes apr\u00e8s se termine par les mots: \u201cEt je signe.\u201d\nIl aurait pu nous dire comment il se fait que certains mots au bas de l\u2019attestation paraissent y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que les t\u00e9moins eussent isign\u00e9.\nJ\u2019aurais voulu lui entendre r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les instructions qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues de son fr\u00e8re pour pr\u00e9parer deux on trois projets de testament et comment il en est venu a faire signer l\u2019un de ces projets dans sa chambre.\nTous ces faits et bien d\u2019autres, auraient \u00e9clair\u00e9 la justice. Mais le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de le faire entendre.\nIl aurait pu \u00e9galement nous dire lequel des deux testaments a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moins dans sa chambre, la preuve de ces pauvres femmes est si peu satisfaisante sous ce rapport.\nVomis devait pour une autre raison retomber sur le d\u00e9fendeur.\nDans l\u2019affidavit qu\u2019il a produit au soutien de sa requ\u00eate pour v\u00e9rification, il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par Mlle. Craig que\nla signature appos\u00e9e au bas du dit testament, Marie-Louis Craig est ma propre signature et je l\u2019ai ainsi appos\u00e9e en pr\u00e9sence et \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de la testatrice.\nQuand elle est en pr\u00e9sence du juge \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate en cette cause, on lui demande:\u2014\nQ. A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 question des testaments pendant que vous \u00e9tiez l\u00e0 par madame Craig?\nR. Bien, quand je suis arriv\u00e9e on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 lire un papier qui \u00e9tait un testament et on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de le signer quand madame Craig l\u2019aurait sign\u00e9.\nPar le juge:\u2014\nQ. Qui vous a demand\u00e9 cela?\nR. Monsieur Craig, mon cousin.\nO\u00f9 est la r\u00e9quisition de la testatrice?\nLes deux autres t\u00e9moins Mlle. Laporte et Mde. Lessard, d\u00e9clarent \u00e9galement que la demande de signer leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le mari. Le femme ne leur a jamais demand\u00e9.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je trouve, comme la cour sup\u00e9rieure, que le testament attaqu\u00e9 ne repr\u00e9sente pas la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice. Elle voulait \u00e9videmment conserver ses biens dans sa famille et cette disposition ne s\u2019y trouve pas.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d\u2019opinion avec l\u2019honorable juge Bruneau que le testament P. 2 exprimait mieux les volont\u00e9s de la testatrice. Il est nul, dit la cour d\u2019appel, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moins. C\u2019est possible. Mais tant pis pour le d\u00e9fendeur. Pourquoi au lieu de se cacher comme il l\u2019a fait, n\u2019a-t-il pas fait ce testament au grand jour en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un notaire qu\u2019il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si facile d\u2019avoir dans une grande ville comme Montr\u00e9al.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas fait la preuve qu\u2019il devait faire et que le testament n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait suivant les exigences de l\u2019article 851 du Code Civil, il est aux termes de l\u2019article 855 du m\u00eame code nul.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures et les conclusions du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9clarant le testament P. 1 nul doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9es.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSoliciter for the appellant: J.

Breakey v. Carter (Cass. Dig. (2 ed.) 463) and Gale v. Bureau (44 Can. S.C.R. 312), referred to.\nBy the judgment appealed from it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to reparation for loss incurred in respect of the diminution in value of his water-power and the adjoining property on account of the construction of the works in question.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 22 K.B. 265), Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the plaintiff was entitled to reparation for such injuries.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014As it was apparent that the defendants could operate their works in such a manner as to avoid, or diminish, the inconveniences occasioned therebyj it would not be proper, in such an action, to include possible future losses in assessing the damages to be given as compensation for the injuries complained of. Montreal Street Railway Co. v. Boudreau (36 Can. S.C.R. 329); Chanbly Manufacturing Co. v. Willett (34 Can. S.C.R. 502); and Backhouse v. Bonomi (9 H.L. Cas. 503), referred to. Per Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Where no effective steps have been taken by the party from whom damages are claimed to have the damages resulting from improvements constructed in a stream ascertained by an expertise, in the manner provided by article 7296, R.S.Q., 1909, he cannot set up a mere proposal of such an arbitration as an exception to an action against him to recover compensation.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The defendants not having taken steps under the statute for several months, and not having shewn that they were in fact ready and willing to proceed under the statute, the action lies.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], which varied the judgment of McCorkill J., in the Superior Court for the District of Quebec[2], by increasing the damages awarded to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff was the owner of a mill driven by water-power, on the River Etchemin, near the site of which the company, defendants, erected a dam in connection with a power-house which they were constructing on the same stream a short distance below the plaintiff\u2019s mill. The dam was of a permanent character and had the effect of penning back the water, raising its level and flooding the tail-race of plaintiff\u2019s mill to such an extent that his mill-wheels were drowned. Another effect of the dam was to make still water where previously there had been a rapid, that ice formed in the pond so created and, when it came out in freshets, the ice carried away the plaintiff\u2019s mill. For all these injuries the plaintiff sued to recover $6,000 damages and, at the trial, McCorkill J. assessed the damages at $1,070, being for the actual losses incurred up to the time of action, less f 110 for some of the machinery which had been saved, and recourse was reserved to the plaintiff to bring further actions for any damages happening subsequently. Both parties appealed and, by the judgment now appealed from, the Court of King\u2019s Bench dismissed the appeal taken by the company and allowed that of the plaintiff by increasing his damages to $3,685 in consideration of the diminished value of the plaintiff\u2019s water-power and adjoining property.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nL. A. Cannon K.C. for the appellants.\nEus\u00e8be Belleau K.C. for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014The trial judge did not grant damages once for all because he felt himself concluded from doing so by the decision of this court in Gale v. Bureau[3]. I do not think, however, that that case decided that point absolutely. There are obviously many cases in which future damages may or may not arise and which may or may not be foreseen or capable of toeing estimated at the time action is brought or proceedings begun under the statute to fix them. In all such cases recourse may be reserved for future damages. But with respect to damages which have been incurred and which are capable of being estimated when action is brought or proceedings taken under the statute to estimate them I see no reason whatever why they should not be estimated and determined.\nWith respect to the value of the water-power of the plaintiff which the trial judge did not include in his judgment, because he thought it was a subject-matter for future damages which the authorities prohibited him from considering, I cannot see why such value may not now be estimated as well as later.\nIt is found as a fact by both courts that the plaintiff\u2019s mill has been destroyed and his water-power had ceased to be a water-power\u2014as such it has been destroyed. The defendant does not plead that the dam erected by him which caused this destruction was a temporary construction or other than a permanency. In the absence of any such plea we must hold it to be intended as a permanent work. If the plaintiff is not now entitled to be compensated for the loss of this water-power, when will his future right to such compensation arise? A reservation of future rights in such a case would be an illusory one. He has, in my opinion, under the circumstances a right to damages as well for the destruction of his water-power as for the destruction of his mill. The assessment of damages made by the court of appeal, on the basis of the plaintiff being entitled to such damages once for all, I see no reason to quarrel with.\nOn the other question as to the right of the plaintiff to take proceedings for the recovery of the damages in the courts, without resorting to the method prescribed by the statute, I am of opinion that we are bound by the authorities to hold that the statute does not take away the common law right of the party damnified to sue unless at any rate proceedings had been properly commenced and prosecuted under the statute for the assessment of the damages.\nI do not think the letter written to the plaintiff in this case before suit began constituted such a valid commencement of proceedings under the statute. It was, no doubt, an invitation to the plaintiff to name an arbitrator under the statute, but that was all and such a mere invitation without the naming of an arbitrator by the party himself making it cannot be held to constitute a valid commencement of proceedings.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014It seems to me that to allow damages based on the supposition that the respondent\u2019s water-power has been permanently taken away, is contrary to the law as laid down in the judgment of this court in the case of Montreal Street Railway Co. v. Boudreau[4], which I think should be followed.\nIt was and is quite competent for the appellant to so lower its dam as to avert future damages.\nOf course, if the appellant chose to avail himself of the statutory provisions for assessing damages what is allowed here might well be proper measure of such.\nBut in an action even where the right to assess damages is provided by arbitration under a statute that does not necessarily determine same measure of damages in each case.\nThe appellant being liable for actions from day to day we ought not in this case to depart from the law so laid down and add to the confusion that prevailed before that case.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent was the proprietor of a mill situate on the River Etchemin worked by the direct application of water-power derived from the river. The appellant company, at a place below the respondent\u2019s mill, erected a dam, for the purpose also of obtaining water-power for working its plant. The respondent\u2019s mill was carried away by a freshet in April, 1911, and it was charged by the respondent and has been held by the courts below that this was due to the presence of the appellant\u2019s dam. It has also been found as a fact that the effect of erecting the dam was to raise the level of the river to such an extent as to submerge the respondent\u2019s turbines and permanently to diminish the head of water available for the working of his mill. The learned trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation in respect of the injury proved to have been suffered by him down to the time of the commencement of the action\u2014such damages comprising the value of the mill swept away and loss of profits arising, first from the diminished efficiency, and afterwards from the destruction of the mill. The court of appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to reparation not only in respect to the damages mentioned, but also for loss in respect of the diminution in the value of respondent\u2019s land by reason of interference with his water-power. Two questions arise: First: Can compensation for such loss be awarded? and, Secondly: Whether, by reason of certain proposals made by the appellant\u2019s solicitors, prior to the commencement of the action, the action ought to be entirely dismissed?\nThe appellant\u2019s dam was; erected and worked under the authority of article 7295 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec of 1909. That article and the succeeding article 7296 are as follows:\u2014 7295. Every proprietor of land may improve any water-course bordering upon, running along or passing across his property, and may turn the same to account by the construction of mills, manufactories, works and machinery of all kinds, and for this purpose may erect and construct in and about such water-course, all the works necessary for its efficient working, such as flood-gates, flumes, embankments, dams, dykes and the like.\n7296. (1) The proprietors or lessees of any such works are liable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the flood-gates or otherwise.\n(2) Such damages shall be ascertained by experts to be appointed by the parties interested in the ordinary manner.\n(3) In default of either of the said parties appointing an expert, experts selected by the warden of the county shall act; and, in case of difference of opinion, the two experts appointed shall choose a third.\n(4) The experts shall be sworn before a justice of the peace faithfully to perform their duty as such.\n(5) In assessing the damages and fixing the compensation to be paid, the experts may, whenever proper, set off against the whole or any part of such damages, any increased value which the property of the claimant has acquired by reason of the erection of such works, mills, manufactories or machinery.\n(6) In default of payment of the damages and indemnity so awarded, within six months from the date of the report of the experts, together with legal interest to be computed from the said date, the party by whom the payment is due, shall demolish the works which he shall have erected, or they shall be so demolished at his expense, upon judgment to that effect rendered, the whole without prejudice, to the damages already incurred.\nIt was held by this court in Breakey v. Carter (1), (I am quoting for convenience from my own judgment in Gale v. Bureau(2)):\u2014\nThat the right given by article 7295, in so far as it justified the penning back the waters of a stream upon the upper riparian proprietors, is to be regarded as a right of servitude to which is attached an obligation to indemnify the proprietor who is prejudiced by the exercise of it.\nIt was also held in that case[5], and the decision on that point was followed in Gale v. Bureau[6], that this statutory right to reparation was one in respect of which the person damnified has recourse to the courts as damage from time to time accrues notwithstanding the provisions of article 7296. I think, moreover, that there is no satisfactory ground for holding that (assuming an action to lie in the circumstances) the plaintiff cannot recover in the action reparation once for all to the full extent to which experts proceeding under the Act would be entitled to award him compensation. I may add that I regard this action as a proceeding to recover compensation under this statute; I decide nothing as to the rules of law by which, apart from the statute, the measure of damages would be determined.\nAs to the second ground of appeal, I think that, in the circumstances, the appellants were, at least, bound to shew that they were in point of fact ready and willing to proceed under article 7296 and, having regard to the delay that had already taken place, I agree with Mr. Justice Cross that they have failed to do so.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014Two questions arise on this appeal\u2014the first, whether the plaintiff\u2019s right of recourse to the courts is taken away by article 7296, R.S.Q. 1909; the other, whether the plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be once for all, in respect of damages future as well as past, or should be confined to damages already sustained.\nNo case was made for a review of the finding that the appellants\u2019 dam caused the injuries complained of. The quantum of the damages awarded in the Superior Court, if they should be confined to injuries already sustained, or of those awarded by the court of appeal, if they should be now allowed once for all, has not been seriously attacked.\nIf the first of the two substantial questions presented for determination, were res Integra, I should incline to the view that the appellant\u2019s contention upon it is well founded. By article 7295 certain works are authorized; by article 7296 the proprietor or lessee of such works is required to pay \u201call damages resulting therefrom,\u201d and it is provided that \u201csuch damages shall be ascertained by experts, etc.\u201d the liability thus created would seem to be only for damages so ascertained. But it has been held in a series of cases in the Province of Quebec (see Gale v. Bureau[7], at page 308), and by this court in Breakey v. Carter[8], followed in Gale v. Bureau7, that the jurisdiction of the courts is not ousted by these statutory provisions. If, as Mr. Justice Cross appears to think, effective steps to commence proceedings under article 7296, taken before action has been brought in the courts, would oust the jurisdiction of the latter, I agree in his view that it has not been established in the present case that such steps were so taken. The appeal on this branch fails.\nThe second question presents a little more difficulty. The decision of this court in Gale v. Bureau7 does not appear to be decisive upon it. There is no suggestion made that the structure of the defendants is not meant to be permanent or that the invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s rights was unintentional. In Gale v. Bureau7 the defendant appears to have done what was complained of inadvertently (p. 311) and it was not his avowed intention to maintain the dam in such a way as to continue the flooding complained of (p. 317). In the present case the appellants may so manage the gates of their dam in future years that the water privileges of the respondents will not be affected ] at all, or at least, not to the same extent as during the period complained of.\nI incline to think that the plaintiff did not in his declaration claim to recover for permanent loss of his water-power. The judgment awarding damages for that loss seems, therefore, to be ultra petita, and, as such, in contravention of article 113, C.P.Q.\nThe case is not one of trespass. The appellants were not wrong-doers in constructing the dam. They had statutory authority to do so, subject to the condition that they should pay \u201call damages resulting therefrom.\u201d It is the resulting damages which constitute the cause of action and they are recoverable when and as they occur. Chambly Mfg. Co. v. Willet[9]; Montreal Street Railway Company v. Boudreau[10]. The well-known principle of the decision in Backhouse v. Bonomi[11] seems to be applicable. Although the appellants have not exercised a right of expropriation, yet it would appear to be within the purview of article 7296 that damages once for all may be awarded in the expertise for which it provides. But I do not think that future damages are recoverable in an action such as that now before us.\nI would for these reasons allow this appeal to the extent of restoring the judgment of the learned trial judge. Brodeur J.\u2014Le demandeur intim\u00e9 avait un moulin, sur la rivi\u00e8re Etchemin dans le comt\u00e9 de Dorchester. Ce moulin \u00e9tait m\u00fb par un pouvoir d\u2019eau et existait depuis un grand nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es. La compagnie appelante, en vertu de l\u2019article 7295 des Statutes Revis\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9rigea dans l\u2019automne de 1910 une digue \u00e0 quelques arpents plus bas de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 \u00e9tait le moulin en question.\nCette digue a eu pour effet de faire refluer l\u2019eau et de rendre absolument sans valeur le pouvoir d\u2019eau qui alimentait le moulin du demandeur.\nDe plus, la rivi\u00e8re, \u00e0 cet endroit, ne gelait presque jamais; mais, \u00e0 raison de la construction de cette digue, l\u2019eau est devenue plus limpide, la glace s\u2019est form\u00e9e; et, au printemps de 1911, en se d\u00e9gageant, elle est venue frapper le moulin, l\u2019a emport\u00e9 et a caus\u00e9 de tr\u00e8s grands dommages. Le demandeur, \u00e0 raison de cela, r\u00e9clame une somme de $6,000 par son action institu\u00e9e le 28 avril, 1911.\nVers le m\u00eame temps o\u00f9 cette action \u00e9tait institu\u00e9e, mais avant qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt signifi\u00e9e, la d\u00e9fenderesse appelante a, par lettres de ses avocats, du 2 mai, 1911, invit\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 faire \u00e9valuer ces dommages par arbitres, suivant les dispositions des articles 7295 and 7296 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe demandeur n\u2019en a pas moins persist\u00e9 dans son action et, apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, la cour sup\u00e9rieure lui a accord\u00e9 une somme de $1,070 pour les dommages jusqu\u2019alors encourus et lui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa r\u00e9clamation pour les dommages futurs.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se soul\u00e8ve est de savoir si le demandeur pouvait proc\u00e9der par action directe sans avoir ces dommages d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par experts.\nCette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions devant les tribunaux et elle s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant cette cour dans une cause de Gale v. Bureau[12]. II. a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les dispositions de la loi statutaire n\u2019emp\u00eachaient pas le recours par action ordinaire.\nLa jurisprudence a d\u2019abord h\u00e9sit\u00e9; mais elle est maintenant bien \u00e9tablie. Il ne peut y avoir de doute que les personnes qui souffrent \u00e0 raison de l\u2019\u00e9rection de digues peuvent proc\u00e9der par voie d\u2019action ordinaire. (1869) Biais v. Blais[13]; (1869) Nesbitt v. Bolduc[14]; Emond v. Gauthier[15]; (1879), Jean v. Gauthier[16]; (1878) Breakey v. Carter[17]; (1881) Proulx v. Tremblay[18]; (1898) Gie. de pulpe de M\u00e9gantic v. Village d\u2019Agnes[19]; (1906) Leclerc v. Dufault[20].\nQuant aux dommages, je dois dire que la cour d\u2019appel a modifi\u00e9 le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et a condamn\u00e9 la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 payer une somme de $3,685. L\u2019appelante nous demande de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de renverser celui de la cour d\u2019appel.\nDans son action, le demandeur disait que la construction de la digue avait eu pour effet de faire refluer l\u2019eau sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u2019inonder son moulin, de noyer ses turbines et d\u2019emp\u00eacher son exploitation. Il ajoutait aussi que la crue des eaux occasionn\u00e9e par la chauss\u00e9e et l\u2019amas de glace qui en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la suite avaient d\u00e9truit compl\u00e8tement la b\u00e2tisse o\u00f9 se trouvait son moulin et il r\u00e9clamait une somme de $6,000.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les dommages, et a accord\u00e9 au demandeur la valeur du moulin d\u00e9truit plus la perte que le demandeur avait subie par le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pu exploiter son moulin depuis l\u2019\u00e9rection de la chauss\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au moment de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action; mais elle ne lui a rien accord\u00e9 pour la destruction de son pouvoir d\u2019eau et pour l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 il va se trouver \u00e0 l\u2019avenir de pouvoir continuer son exploitation.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ces dommages pour l\u2019avenir; et l\u2019honorable juge dans ses notes nous dit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 tous ces dommages, vu la d\u00e9cision de Gale v.Bureau[21].\nEn lisant, en effet, la note qui se trouve en t\u00eate de la d\u00e9cision on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans cette, cause que les dommages qui seraient accord\u00e9s ne devaient pas \u00eatre des dommages globaux mais des dommages annuels.\nDans cette action de Gale v. Bureau21 le jugement avait accord\u00e9 une somme annuelle et on disait que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0-une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Le juge-en-chef de cette cour, se basant sur l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Sourdat, d\u00e9cida que la cour avait parfaitement le droit d\u2019accorder des annuit\u00e9s ou une rente. Il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans cette cause que la cour ne pouvait pas accorder une somme fixe une fois pay\u00e9e.\nEn effet, si nous consultons Sourdat, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le jugement de l\u2019honorable juge-enrchef, vol. 1, No. 132 bis, il dit ceci:\u2014\nDu principe que les tribunaux appr\u00e9cient souverainement le dommage et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la r\u00e9paration, il suit qu\u2019ils peuvent accorder soit une somme fixe une fois pay\u00e9e, soit une rente ou annuit\u00e9. Et comme le dommage peut cesser ou se restreindre dans un temps donn\u00e9, ils peuvent \u00e9galement r\u00e9duire Pindemnit\u00e9 dans ces pr\u00e9visions. Ainsi dans une affaire jug\u00e9e par la Cour de Dijon, l\u2019on a maintenu la disposition d\u2019un jugement qui allouait, \u00e0 une femme dont le mari avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9, une rente, avec condition que cette rente serait r\u00e9duite de moiti\u00e9 si la veuve convolait \u00e0 un second mariage.\nIls peuvent encore limiter le service de la rente \u00e0 un certain temps, pass\u00e9 lequel il sera statu\u00e9 de nouveau, les droits du plaignant \u00e9tant ainsi r\u00e9serv\u00e9s quant au pr\u00e9judice qui se manifesterait ult\u00e9rieurement,\nOn a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la cause de Montr\u00e9al Street Railway v. Boudreau[22], et on a dit que la d\u00e9cision dans cette cause ne justifie pas une indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e9finitive.\nJe crois que les deux cas ne sont pas analogues.\nDans la cause de Boudreau22, le caract\u00e8re permanent des dommages ne pouvait pas \u00eatre assum\u00e9 par la mani\u00e8re dont les travaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits; au contraire, la cause de ces dommages pouvait \u00eatre facilement \u00e9vit\u00e9e. Et, \u00e0 raison de cela, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d\u2019accorder des dommages globaux.\nIl fait bon de mentionner le fait que la cour \u00e9tait divis\u00e9e sur cette question et que le juge-en-chef, Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, et M. le Juge Girouard \u00e9taient d\u2019opinion qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e9finitive devait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, suivant en cela la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans une cause de Gareau v. Montreal Street Railway[23].\nNous sommes dans la pr\u00e9sente cause en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un statut qui invite \u00e0 r\u00e9gler d\u00e9finitivement cette question d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, vu qu\u2019il s\u2019agit virtuellement de l\u2019expropriation d\u2019un droit dont jouissait le demandeur. Or, en vertu de l\u2019article 407 du Code Civil, l\u2019expropri\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 juste et pr\u00e9alable. Cette indemnit\u00e9 doit couvrir tous les dommages.\nLa compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse ne sugg\u00e8re pas dans ses plaidoiries, ou dans ses pr\u00e9tentions, que la digue qu\u2019elle a \u00e9lev\u00e9e n\u2019est que temporaire. Au contraire, cette digue a un caract\u00e8re de permanence.\nLe pouvoir d\u2019eau dont le demandeur jouissait se trouve d\u00e9truit par le fait de cette digue. Le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il \u00e9prouve a donc un caract\u00e8re permanent et la suggestion que cet homme pourrait venir tous les ans devant les tribunaux pour r\u00e9clamer de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse le dommage r\u00e9sultant du fait qu\u2019il ne peut plus exploiter son moulin parait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que nous devons emp\u00eacher autant que possible la multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e8s.\nMais on dit: Vous accordez alors des dommages futurs.\nJe ne crois pas que cela soit exact. Le dommage peut \u00eatre futur en ce sens qu\u2019il se r\u00e9alisera dans l\u2019avenir par suite du fait dommageable; mais \u00e0 vrai dire le pr\u00e9judice est actuel et il continuera \u00e0 se manifester. (Laurent, vol. 20, p. 570.)\nFuzier-Herman dans son code annot\u00e9 sous l\u2019art. 1382 nous rapporte aux nos. 116 et 117 un jugement de la cour de cassation au sujet d\u2019une mine dont les travaux d\u2019exploitation avaient alt\u00e9r\u00e9 les eaux d\u2019une source o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9\nqu\u2019il peut \u00eatre allou\u00e9 aux propri\u00e9taires inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au lieu d\u2019une rente annuelle un capital une fois pay\u00e9, r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la perte d\u00e9j\u00e0 subie et \u00e0 celle qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9prouv\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que la cour d\u2019appel a ajug\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 des conclusions de l\u2019action en indemnisant le demandeur intim\u00e9 pour la perte de son pouvoir d\u2019eau.\nJe vois au contraire dans la d\u00e9claration que le demandeur all\u00e8gue sp\u00e9cialement que la construction de la chauss\u00e9e a eu pour effet d\u2019inonder ses moulins, de noyer ses turbines et l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de les exploiter; et apr\u00e8s avoir ensuite all\u00e9gu\u00e9 la crue des eaux et l\u2019amas de glaces occasionn\u00e9s par la chauss\u00e9e, il demande une condamnation contre l\u2019appelante de $6,000 de dommages. Ces all\u00e9gations \u00e9taient certainement suffisant\u00e9s pour justifier la cour d\u2019appel de faire l\u2019\u00e9valuation de tous ces dommages et d\u2019accorder $3,685.\nDans ces circonstances, je suis d\u2019opinion que le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel est bien fond\u00e9 et que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taschereau, Roy, Cannon & Fitzpatrick.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pelletier, Belleau, Bail larg\u00e9on & Belleau.\n[1] Q.R. 22 K.B. 265.\n[2] Q.R. 22 K.B., at p. 266.\n[3] 44 Can.

L.R. 358), Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. dissenting, that the $500 paid \u201cas deposit\u201d was part of the purchase money, that the retention by the vendor of monies paid when the purchase was not completed was only a penalty for failure to make the payments promptly; and that the court could grant the purchaser relief from the consequences of such failure. Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands ([1913] A.C. 319), followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. There was but one question of law raised for decision in this appeal, namely, whether or not, where a contract for sale of land to be paid for by instalments at fixed dates, with a forfeiture of instalments paid in case of default in any, time being of the essence of the contract, the stipulation that the initial payment is a deposit takes it out of the rule in Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands[2], that the forfeiture of the money is only a penalty and default does not of itself disentitle the purchaser to decree for specific performance. The trial judge granted the decree, but his judgment was overruled by the Appellate Division.\nProudfoot K.C., for the appellant. The appellant never had nor indicated any intention of abandoning the contract and his failure to pay on the day stipulated was not his fault. See Labelle v. O\u2019Connor[3], at pages 522, 523, 530; Tilley v. Thomas[4].\nKilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands2 sets at rest any doubt heretofore existing as to the soundness of the rule in In re Dagenham (Thames) Dock Co.[5], that the condition of forfeiture in case of default in a contract of this nature is only a penalty and this rule entitles the appellant to a decree for specific performance.\nJ. E. Jones for the respondent. Making the first payment a deposit takes this case out of the doctrine laid down in Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands2. See Howe v. Smith[6]; Hall v. Burnell[7]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am not able to distinguish this case from that of Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands[8], and, therefore, think that the appeal must be allowed with costs, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim for specific performance granted.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this case is governed by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands8.\nThe application of that decision becomes as I think very clear when the real nature of the agreement now before us is once understood. It was constituted by a proposal from the purchaser accompanied by the sum of $500 on account of the purchase money and an acceptance by the vendee. The proposal and acceptance are as follows:\u2014\nOFFER OF PURCHASE.\nToronto, February 20th, 1912.\nTo G.W. Ormerod,\nAgent.\nI hereby make you the following offer, that is to say: I offer to buy that certain parcel of land situate in the Township of Scarboro and County of York and being composed of Lots 1 and 2 according to Registered Plan, Number 412, save and except (1) the portions of said lots heretofore conveyed to the School Board of S.S. No. 12, in the Township of Scarboro for a school site; (2) the most westerly 100 feet frontage on Danforth Road of Lot 2, by a depth of 200 feet, for the price or sum of seven thousand five hundred\ndollars\n$7,500\npayable as follows: Five hundred dollars\n$500\npaid G.W. Ormerod, as deposit accompanying this offer, to be returned to me if offer not accepted; two thousand dollars\n2,000 to be paid upon the acceptance of title and delivery of deed and give you back a first mortgage on the property for the remainder, re\u2011payable in 5 years from the date of closing\n$5,000\n$7,500 $7,500\nwith interest from date of closing at 6 per cent. per annum payable half-yearly, said mortgage to be drawn on the vendor\u2019s solicitor\u2019s usual form and contain clauses providing for the following:\u2014\n(1) A discharge of such portions of said lands as may be required for public streets, upon the payment of $1,500 upon the mortgage;\n(2) A discharge of any portion of said lands upon a further payment of $2 per foot frontage on any street;\n(3) The right to pay off the whole mortgage at any time, by giving three months\u2019 notice or paying three months\u2019 advance interest.\nRent, fire insurance premiums, taxes, rates of assessments, local or otherwise, to be proportioned and allowed to date of closing, which shall be 15th March, 1912.\nThe purchaser shall take the property subject to existing tenancies.\nThe vendor shall not be bound to produce any abstract of title or any title deeds or evidence of title except such as he may have in his possession, nor to furnish a surveyor\u2019s plan or description or proof that the buildings stand wholly within the limits of the said lands.\nThe purchaser shall search the title at his own expense and shall have ten days from said date of acceptance to examine the same, and if no written objection be made within that time he shall be deemed to have accepted the title. If any valid objection be made within that time the vendor shall have reasonable time to remove it, and if he be unable or unwilling so to do, and the purchaser is unwilling to accept said title subject to the objections, he, notwithstanding any intermediate negotiations, may cancel the contract and return the deposit, and neither party shall have any claim on the other for damages or expenses.\nThis offer, if accepted as aforesaid, shall with such acceptance, constitute a binding contract of purchase and sale, and time shall in all respects be strictly of the essence hereof.\nShould the purchaser make default in completing the purchase in the manner and at the time above mentionel, any money theretofore paid on account shall at the option of the vendor be retained by the vendor as liquidated damages, and the contract shall, at the option of the vendor, be at an end and the vendor shall be entitled to resell the said land without reference to the purchaser.\nThe vendor is to have the right to remove raspberry canes, currant bushes, asparagus and rhubarb roots, up to 1st November, 1912. Signature of Purchaser\u2014W.H. Snell.\nPurchaser\u2019s Occupation\u2014Baker.\nPurchaser\u2019s Address\u2014156 Main Street.\nPurchaser\u2019s Solicitor\u2014Proudfoot, Duncan, Grant & Skeans.\nI hereby accept the above offer.\nFebruary 20th, 1912.\n(Sgd.)G.W. ORMEROD.\nThe above acceptance is hereby confirmed and I agree to pay\nG.W. Ormerod a commission of 5 per cent. on the sale price.\n(Sgd.)ISAAC BRICKLES.\nVendor\u2019s Solicitor\u2014DuVernet, Raymond, Ross & Ardagh.\nAmount received, $500.\nDate received, February 20th, 1912.\nThe important provisions bearing on the point in dispute are these:\u2014\nThis offer, if accepted as aforesaid, shall with such acceptance, constitute a binding contract of purchase and sale, and time shall in all respects be strictly of the essence hereof.\nShould the purchaser make default in completing the purchase in the manner and at the time above mentioned, any money theretofore paid on account shall at the option of the vendor be retained by the vendor as liquidated damages, and the contract shall, at the option of the vendor, be at an end and the vendor shall be entitled to resell the said land without reference to the purchaser.\nThere can be no doubt as to the application of this last paragraph to the sum of $500 paid on the acceptance of the offer. It is true that this sum is said to be \u201cdeposited\u201d pending the acceptance, but it is plainly described as and unquestionably was paid as part of the purchase money. In Ockenden v. Henly[9], at page 492, Lord Campbell speaking for the court adopted the statement of law in Sugden, Vendors and Purchasers:\u2014\nIt is well settled that by our law following the rule of the civil law a pecuniary deposit upon a purchase is to be considered as a payment in part of the purchase money, and not as a mere pledge.\nWhatever disputes might have arisen in the absence of express provision on the subject, the terms of this agreement are perfectly unambiguous upon the point that in the event of the vendee making default in respect of any of the things necessary for completion on the day named the vendor may terminate the agreement and retain the moneys theretofore paid. If any part of the sum of $2,000 should remain unpaid on the 15th of March, 1912, the consequences mentioned were to ensue by the express language of the contract.\nNow, the decision in Kilmer\u2019s Case[10] as I understand it is that such a clause must be read as providing for a penalty against which the court will relieve.\nIn that case their Lordships of the Privy Council adopted and acted upon the principle of In re Dagenham[11], as that principle is explained in the judgment of Lord Macnaghten delivered by Lord Moulton at pp. 79 and 80 of 82 L.J., in the following passage:\nIn the case of Dagenham Thames Dock Co.; In re Hulse\u2019s Claim11, Lord Justice Mellish expresses himself as follows: \u201cI have always understood that where there is a stipulation that if, on a certain day, an agreement remains either wholly or in part unperformed\u2014in which case the real damage may be either very large or very trifling\u2014there is to be a certain forfeiture incurred, that stipulation is to be treated as in the nature of a penalty.\u201d That was a case like this of forfeiture claimed under the letter of the agreement met by an action for specific performance. Lord Justice James seems to have been of the same opinion. \u201cIn my opinion,\u201d he says, \u201cthis is an extremely clear case of a mere penalty for non-payment of the purchase money.\u201d He ends by stating that he agreed with the Master of the Rolls (Lord Romilly) that it was a penalty from which the company were entitled to be relieved on payment of the residue of the purchase money with interest. No doubt the learned Lord Justice referred in detail to the special circumstances of the case, but it appears to their Lordships that that reference was made in answer to the arguments which had been addressed to the court on behalf of the appellants. As regards the ground of his decision the two Lord Justices seem to have been in perfect accord. This passage contains the ratio decidendi of their Lordship\u2019s judgment and is, of course, an absolutely authoritative exposition (and\u2014need I add\u2014by one of the greatest of the English Equity judges) not only of the effect of the decision of the Lord Justices in Re Dagenham[12], but of the law upon the point in question; and the agreement now in controversy as I construe it, is well within the rule here laid down.\nTwo points in Mr. Jones\u2019 most ingenious argument ought to be noticed. He says first that the effect of adopting this view must be virtually to abrogate the principle that time may by agreement be made of the essence of a contract for the sale of land. This argument is founded on a misapprehension; the view involves no such consequence. Where the effect of a stipulation that time is of the essence of the agreement is expounded in express terms by the agreement itself and according to that exposition that stipulation gives the vendor a right to rescind the contract on failure to pay an instalment of purchase money whether it be the last instalment or not at the exact hour named for such payment by the contract and to forfeit the moneys already paid, then these stipulations are treated as constituting a penal clause for securing the punctual payment of the purchase money and the penalty is relieved against. That, as I understand it, is the effect of Re Dagenham12 as explained by the judgment and the decision in Kilmer\u2019s Case[13]. It may be observed that, before the decision in Kilmer\u2019s Case13, Re Dagenham12, although it appears to have been overlooked by English text writers and some English judges (it is not mentioned in Fry, Specific Performance, 1911, or in the last edition of Dart, Vendors and Purchasers, or in Williams\u2019 Vendors and Purchasers, or in Halsbury under Specific Performance or Sale of Land and in Talbot and Fort\u2019s Index only two references are noted, both in 1900, it was not mentioned either in Wallis v. Smith[14] or in Howe v. Smith[15] was correctly appreciated (i.e., in accordance with the interpretation afterwards adopted in Kilmer\u2019s Case[16]) in Whitla v. Riverview Realty Co.[17], a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal, and in Chadwick v. Stuckey[18], a decision of the full court of Alberta both of which courts in effect adopted the views expressed by Meredith C.J. in his dissenting judgment in Labelle v. O\u2019Connor[19].\nThe other point is perhaps the same argument in another form. The respondent, it is said, is not exercising the power of rescission given by the agreement. But he has professed to put an end to the agreement and he has retained the moneys paid; and he does not, of course, pretend that he has kept the moneys inadvertently, but asserts his right to them. He does not really argue that in the circumstances he could have kept these moneys except under some stipulation express or implied to that effect; and he finds such a stipulation implied in the use of the word \u201cdeposit.\u201d As I have said above, the presence of the express stipulation excludes any implication which might otherwise have arisen in respect of the precise matter upon which that stipulation makes provision; and it is pursuant to this stipulation that the vendor must be taken to have acted. Although in the view above expressed it is not strictly relevant, I think it is not improper to add that I am far from satisfied that even in the absence of the express stipulation the plaintiff would have been entitled in the circumstances to terminate the agreement and retain the moneys already paid. He had always been anxious to carry out his contract and personally was in a position to do so on the appointed day, the 15th of April. The responsibility for the delay, such as it was, lay with his solicitor; and on the 20th of April the purchase money, a properly executed mortgage and a deed prepared for execution were tendered. The action was brought on the 23rd. It is contended that in these circumstances, even in the absence of express stipulation, the respondent could refuse to execute the conveyance and retain that part of the purchase money already paid. And this is said to result from the fact that the sum of $500 being denominated a \u201cdeposit\u201d is to be treated as security for the performance by the vendee of his contract with the consequence that \u201ctime being of the essence\u201d of the agreement his failure to complete on the day named, the 15th of April, entitles the vendor to retain the moneys so placed in his hands as security.\nNow it has been many times laid down and it is undoubtedly law that where an instalment of purchase money is declared by the contract to be paid as a \u201cdeposit,\u201d and there is no modifying context, it is thereby implied that this sum besides being a part payment of the purchase money stands as security for the completion of the purchase.\nBut, what is the consequence of this where the contract contains a provision that time is the essence of it and the vendee fails, let us say, through the carelessness of his solicitor, to make the final payment? Does it follow that the vendor becomes instanter indefeasibly entitled to refuse to transfer the property and at the same time retain the moneys in his hands?\nThere are, no doubt, dicta to this effect. But I think there is no decision, and I think it is very questionable whether the dicta are consistent with principle. Certainly the difficulties of reconciling the dicta with the doctrine of Re Dagenham, as interpreted in Kilmer\u2019s Case, are not trifling. In Howe v. Smith[20] the decision proceeded upon the ground that the vendee had so acted \u201cas to repudiate his contract,\u201d as Cotton L.J. put it; \u201cto recede from his bargain,\u201d as Bowen L.J. put it. The vendee had \u201caccepted the repudiation,\u201d treated the agreement as dissolved in consequence of the vendee\u2019s conduct, and sold the property. The vendee in such circumstances, demanding the return of his deposit, was met with the answer that \u201cthis sum was paid as security by you for the performance of your contract, and having deliberately elected not to perform it and your election having been so acted upon that it is now impossible to carry it out, you cannot get back your security.\u201d In the agreement in question in that case, time was not declared to be of the essence of the contract; and the decision has no direct bearing upon the effect of such stipulation. The same observation may be made with regard to Ex parte Barrell[21], which was cited and relied upon in Howe v. Smith20. Indeed, the judgment of Lord Justice James contains two sentences which sum up the point of both decisions. They are: \u201cThe money was paid to the vendor as a guarantee that the contract should be performed. The trustee (vendee) refuses to perform the contract and then says: Give me back the deposit.\u201d In Hall v. Burnell[22], Mr. Justice Eve states the principle upon which he proceeds (p. 554) in these words:\u2014\nSuch being the nature of the deposit and the implied terms upon which it was paid, is there any sufficient reason why I should not, as against a purchaser who has receded from and persistently refused to perform the contract, declare that the deposit has been forfeited and belongs to the vendor, who has been in no way in default and has done everything in his power to force the purchaser to carry out his bargain? I think not.\nIn Sprague v. Booth[23] the purchaser was also refusing to carry out his contract. I have not found any decision and I do not think there is one in which the vendee\u2019s default being merely the technical default of failing to pay at the hour named, there being in fact admittedly the intention as well as the ability on his part to carry out his contract, and an offer to perform it made almost immediately after the default has occurred, there being no equity against the vendee or in favour of the vendor, except such as may be created by the existence of the formal stipulation making time the essence of the contract and technical default in exact performance\u2014I say I have found no decision and I do not think one can be found\u2014that a vendor in such circumstances is on equitable principles entitled to terminate the agreement and retain the moneys paid on the sole ground that such moneys are declared by the agreement to be paid as a \u201cdeposit.\u201d\nAs to whether such a decision could be justified on principle there are two observations which appear to me to be of weight. It ought to be noted that in the traditional view of courts of equity the vendor\u2019s interest in the contract of sale has been considered to lie in the right it gives him to demand and enforce the payment of the purchase money. This has been compendiously put by saying that the estate in equity was considered to have passed to the vendee or that the vendor was considered to be a trustee of the land for the purchaser subject to the interest he had in it as security for the purchase money. Expressions of this kind, of course, may easily be misunderstood by people who leave out of sight the manner in which the doctrine they are intended to epitomize is applied by courts of equity; but one may say, I think, with entire accuracy that the Court of Chancery looked at such contracts from a point of view which brought into relief the interest of the vendor in the payment of the purchase money as his substantial interest in the contract. See the judgment of Jessel M.R. in Cave v. Mackenzie[24], at page 219, and of Mowat V.C. in Parke v. Riley[25], at page 230. The second observation is this:\u2014The English doctrine of the equity of redemption is only a particular application of the principle governing the law as to penalties and forfeitures. The Lord Chancellor in G. and C. Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co.[26], at page 35, says that the equitable jurisdiction in personam over mortgagees\nwas merely a special application of a more general power to relieve against penalties and to mould them into mere securities.\nIn the light of these observations some of the results of the contention I am now considering appear rather singular. First, this sum that is to stand as security for the performance of the vendee\u2019s obligations which in their substance consist in making the payments mentioned on the stipulated days, is, according to the contention, to become the absolute property of the vendor on the vendee\u2019s failure to pay on the exact hour named and against this forfeiture the courts have no power to relieve; and this consequence is not only not prevented by the fact that the intention of the parties was that the sum mentioned was to stand as security only, it is expressly on the ground that it was intended to be and is a security for the payment of the purchase money that (according to the argument) the court is powerless to afford relief. The process referred to by the Lord Chancellor is reversed. Instead of a penalty being moulded into a security and relieved against a security is turned into a penalty and forfeited as a penalty. Secondly, the effect of declaring the initial payment to be a \u201cdeposit\u201d coupled with a stipulation that time is of the essence of the contract being to raise an implied agreement that the vendor shall upon default of punctual payment be entitled to terminate the agreement and retain the moneys deposited and these stipulations giving rise to this implied agreement being (according to the respondent\u2019s argument) sanctioned and enforceable according to the doctrine of the court; nevertheless, it is indisputably the law as laid down in Re Dagenham[27] and in Kilmer\u2019s Case[28], that if such an agreement be stated in express terms on the face of the contract, that is to say, if it be declared in so many words that in the event of non\u2011completion on the day named the contract of sale may be re- scinded and the initial payment forfeited, that is a stipulation which the courts will relieve against as a penalty. A stipulation stated in plain terms is a penal stipulation; a stipulation precisely the same in effect is not penal when stated in terms which can only be understood by lawyers. This, presumably, is regarding substance rather than form.\nThe difficulties arising from conflict among views from time to time expressed by distinguished lawyers and judges in relation to this subject are, no doubt, considerable. I am inclined to think it will be found, if the decisions themselves be looked at as distinguished from the expressions of individual judges, that most of the apparent difficulties disappear. In the meantime the case before us seems to me, as I have already said, to be governed by the decision in Kilmer\u2019s Case[29], according to which I think the appellant is entitled to be relieved from the exigency of the penalty and to have judgment for specific performance.\nOn the other points in the case I express no opinion.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The material facts of this case are as follows:\u2014\nOn the 20th February, 1912, by accepting a written offer of purchase from William H. Snell, Isaac Brickles agreed to sell to him, for $7,500, certain land in the Township of Scarborough. The purchase money was payable, $500 as a deposit accompanying the offer, $2,000 on acceptance of title and delivery of deed; and $5,000 by the purchaser giving a mortgage \u201cto be drawn on the vendor\u2019s solicitors\u2019 usual form.\u201d Pro- vision was made for the return of the deposit if the offer should not be accepted, or if, after acceptance of the offer, the vendor should be unable or unwilling to remove any objection to the title on which the purchaser should insist. The agreement provided for payment of a commission of 5% to the vendor\u2019s agent, who received and still retains the deposit of $500.\nOne of the terms of the agreement was that the transaction should be closed on the 15th March, 1912, and it provided that\ntime shall in all respects be strictly, of the essence hereof.\nThe agreement also contains this clause:\u2014\nShould the purchaser make default in completing the purchase in the manner and at the time above mentioned, any money theretofore paid on account shall, at the option of the vendor, be retained by the vendor as liquidated damages, and the contract shall, at the option of the vendor, be at an end, and the vendor shall be entitled to resell the said land without reference to the purchaser.\nThe agreement is silent as to the preparation of the deed and the mortgage.\nThe solicitors for the vendor on the 21st of February, 1912, sent to the solicitors for the purchaser a draft deed for approval. The purchaser\u2019s solicitors did not return this draft deed or signify approval of it, although, on February 27th, the vendor\u2019s solicitors wrote asking its return. The purchaser\u2019s solicitor admits that he received the draft deed and states that he found difficulty in settling the description. In his evidence he says:\u2014\nOn the 12th, Mr. Ross phoned to me and said Mr. Brickles was in his office and that the 15th was the date of closing and his client was very anxious to close * * * He asked me for the return of the draft deed and I said I would return it. Then that was, I think, on Tuesday, and next morning I was going to return the draft deed, but in the afternoon I had brought the deed to send it back, that was on Wednesday, and then I discovered that there was not anybody in to dictate a letter to, and so left it over till Thursday morning.\nHis Lordship: That would be the 14th? A. Yes, my Lord.\nMr. Proudfoot: Then what happened? A. I was not down either on the 14th or the 15th or the 16th. I was sick the last three days of that week.\nQ. Were you confined to your home? A. Oh, yes, I was not out of the house the last three days of the week.\nQ. Then the draft deed was not returned? A. No.\nQ. What took place on the Monday, that would be the 18th? A.\nThe deal should have been closed on Friday, and then there was Saturday morning. Monday I came down, and the first thing I took up was this matter. I had it on my desk and it was the first thing I attended to. I phoned to Mr. Ross and asked him if we could close the matter. I said we were ready and would like to get the matter closed. Mr. Ross then told me that his client had been in, and as the matter had not been closed on the 15th that his client refused to carry it out. * * * I prepared the mortgage on that day and had it executed, and asked Mr. Snell for a cheque, and got a cheque, and then called Mr. Ross up again and asked him if there was any possibility of closing and he said there was not; and I spoke about tender on that occasion; and he said that his client would not do anything in the matter. Then I asked him if there was any possibility of settlement in any way, and he said that he did not think so, but he would write to his client.\nBefore these telephone interviews occurred the vendor\u2019s solicitors, apparently, had already written a formal letter to the purchaser\u2019s solicitor notifying him that their client would not carry out the contract. Elsewhere in the evidence of the purchaser\u2019s solicitor there is the following passage referring to his conversation with the vendor\u2019s solicitor on the 12th March:\nQ. It is entered in your docket that he telephoned you up and insisted on closing on the 15th? A. Yes.\nNegotiations for settlement ensued, but they proved abortive. On the 20th of April the purchaser\u2019s solicitor made a tender of $2,000, and of a mortgage for $5,000 executed by his client and he presented the deed for execution by the vendor, which was refused. He brought this action for specific performance on the 23rd of April.\nFalconbridge, C.J., who tried the action, decreed specific performance with costs. The executrix of the defendant, in whose name the action had meantime been revived, appealed and her appeal was unanimously allowed by the Appellate Division. From that judgment the present appeal is taken.\nTwo questions present themselves for decision: (a) whether the vendor was in default in regard to the conveyance of the property and cannot on that ground take advantage of the provision making time of the essence of the contract in all respects; and (b) whether, notwithstanding that provision, the purchaser, although in default, is entitled to specific performance.\nThe first point presents little difficulty. The agreement being silent as to it, the duty of preparing the conveyance fell upon the purchaser. \u201cAn ordinary contract of sale is not only to convey to the purchaser, but to convey as the purchaser shall direct\u201d: Earl of Egmont v. Smith[30], at page 474. The rule, in the absence of a stipulation, is that the purchaser must prepare and tender the conveyance. Dart on Vendors and Purchasers (7 ed.), p. 1002. This rule of English law is well recognized in the courts of Ontario: Bolton v. Hugel[31], at page 407; Mooney v. Prevost[32], at page 419; Stevenson v. Davis[33], at page 633. With very great respect for the learned Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench, I agree with Sutherland J., that there appears to be nothing in the agreement before us which makes it inapplicable. The fact that the vendor\u2019s solicitors actually prepared and submitted a draft deed for the approval of the purchaser\u2019s solicitors did not change the legal rights or duties of the parties. If the vendor unnecessarily assumed the burden of drafting the conveyance it was at least the duty of the purchaser\u2019s solicitor to peruse and return it approved in due time to permit of its being engrossed and executed by the vendor and ready for delivery on the day fixed for closing. That he failed to do. It was also the duty of the purchaser\u2019s solicitor to prepare a draft mortgage and to submit it to the vendor\u2019s solicitor for approval in time to have it properly considered and returned for engrossment and execution before the day fixed for closing. It was his business to ascertain what was the vendor\u2019s solicitors\u2019 usual form of mortgage, and if they had no special form to submit a draft mortgage in the statutory form. The purchaser introduced the provision for a mortgage into his offer for his own benefit and convenience. In so doing he undertook to bear the additional conveyancing expense thus entailed: Fahner v. Ran[34]; and that fact cast on him the duty of preparing the instrument: Foster v. Anderson[35]. On the 16th of March the draft deed had not been returned, the draft mortgage had not been submitted and the $2,000 due on the 15th had not been tendered. There was the clearest default on the part of the purchaser and I find none on the part of the vendor. On the contrary his solicitor appears to have been unnecessarily diligent. He had prepared and submitted a draft conveyance. He had written on the 27th of February asking its return; and he had notified the purchaser\u2019s solicitors three days before the time fixed for closing the transaction that his client expected punctuality.\nThe appeal, therefore, fails on the first point.\nNor do I see how it can succeed on the second point unless we are to consider a point in the law of specific performance which has been settled for over half a century (27 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, p. 67) to have been overturned by the recent decision of the Privy Council in Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands[36], on which the appellant chiefly relies, and to hold that, as a result of that judgment, it is no longer possible for parties by explicit terms to make time of the essence of a contract for the sale of land. I do not understand that to have been the intention of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee, nor to be a consequence fairly deducible from their decision.\nThat case differs in many important particulars from the one now before us. There $2,000 had been paid, not as a deposit, but as an instalment of the purchase money; there had been an extension of time for payment of the second instalment (although that is not always material, Barclay v. Messenger[37]; and the subsequent insistence on the provision making time of the essence rather took the purchaser by surprise; a forfeiture clause, applicable although the entire purchase money except a small fraction had been paid, was invoked by the vendors; provision was also made for subdivision of the property to which the vendors were bound to assent on receiving three-fourths of the money for which the subdivided lots might be sold, and the right of forfeiture was reserved in regard to money paid in respect of these subdivided lots. Here no instalment of the purchase money had been paid, but merely a deposit; there had been no extension of time; on the contrary the purchaser had been notified that punctuality would be exacted; the vendor does not invoke the forfeiture clause in the agreement; he says that the $500 deposit had not become \u201cmoney paid on account\u201d within the purview of that clause; and there is no provision for subdivision such as there was in the Kilmer Case[38]. That decision, as I understand it, leaves untouched the familiar doctrine laid down in such authorities as Howe v. Smith[39], and Hall v. Burnell[40], in regard to cases where there has been default by a purchaser who has paid nothing except a deposit. In Howe v. Smith39 the purchaser had paid $500 which has stated in the contract to be paid \u201cas a deposit and in part payment of the purchase money.\u201d Cotton L.J., at p. 94, cites Collins v. Stimson[41], where Baron Pollock said:\u2014\nAccording to the law of vendor and purchaser the inference is that such a deposit is paid as a guarantee for the performance of the contract, and where the contract goes off by default of the purchaser, the vendor is entitled to retain the deposit.\nIn Ex parte Barrell[42], Lord Justice James, who had presided at the hearing of the Dagenham Case[43], upon the authority of which Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands38 was disposed of, says, speaking of a deposit paid on a contract for the sale of land by a purchaser who had become bankrupt and whose trustee sued to recover it:\u2014 The trustee in this case had no legal or equitable right to recover the deposit. The money was paid to the vendor as a guarantee that the contract should be performed.\nAs Lord Justice Cotton says in Howe v. Smith[44], at page 95:\u2014\nThe deposit, as I understand it, and using the words of Lord Justice James, is a guarantee that the contract shall be performed. If the sale goes on, of course, not only in accordance with the words of the contract, but in accordance with the intention of the parties in making the contract, it goes in part payment of the purchase-money for which it is deposited; but if on the default of the purchaser the contract goes off, that is to say, if he repudiates the contract, then according to Lord Justice James, he can have no right to recover the deposit.\nI do not say that in all cases where this court would refuse specific performance, the vendor ought to be entitled to retain the deposit. It may well be that there may be circumstances which would justify this court in declining, and which would require the court, according to its ordinary rules, to refuse to order specific performance, in which it could not be said that the purchaser had repudiated the contract, or that he had entirely put an end to it so as to enable the vendor to retain the deposit. In order to enable the vendor so to act, in my opinion there must be acts on the part of the purchaser which not only amount to delay sufficient to deprive him of the equitable remedy of specific performance but which would make his conduct amount to a repudiation on his part of the contract.\nIn the same case, Fry L. J., said:\u2014\nMoney paid as a deposit must, I conceive, be paid on some terms implied or expressed. In this case no terms are expressed, and we must, therefore, inquire what terms are to be implied. The terms most naturally to be implied appear to me in the case of money paid on the signing of a contract to be that in the event of the contract being performed it shall be brought into account, but if the contract is not performed by the payer it shall remain the property of the payee. It is not merely a part payment, but is then also an earnest to bind the bargain so entered into, and creates by the fear of its forfeiture a motive in the payer to perform the rest of the contract.\nAs shortly put by Bowen L.J.:\u2014\nA deposit is * * * a security for the completion of the purchase. In the recent judgment of Eve J., in Hall v. Burnell[45], the nature of a deposit is fully considered and the doctrine laid down in Howe v. Smith[46] is applied.\nA divisional court of which I was a member, had occasion, a few years ago, to review the authorities bearing upon a contractual stipulation that time shall be of the essence in a contract for the sale of land, in Labelle v. O\u2019Connor[47], to which I refer for a convenient collection of the cases. My conclusion then was that an express stipulation making time of the essence of a contract for the sale and purchase of land is efficacious in equity as well as at law and that, where clearly established and there is no ground for suggesting fraud, surprise, accident or mistake, it will be enforced unless there has been waiver by the party claiming the benefit of it. I have had no reason to change my opinion. There are certainly no circumstances from which waiver can be inferred in this case and, unless we are to hold that such a stipulation should be disregarded, however clear and explicit, I am unable to see how the purchaser can obtain specific performance.\nIn claiming to retain the deposit the vendor does not invoke or rely upon the clause of the agreement which expressly provides for the forfeiture of purchase money paid on account. The deposit becomes part payment, or money paid on account, only \u201cif the sale goes on.\u201d If not, it remains \u201can earnest\u201d or \u201csecurity.\u201d It may well be that had the $2,000, or some part of it, been paid on or before the 15th of March, the court would have relieved against the con- sequences of default for which that clause provided. The present case might then have been brought within the authority of the Dagenham Case[48] and the Kilmer Case[49] as to the purchaser\u2019s right to be relieved from the forfeiture of purchase money paid on account. But I should require to consider very carefully whether, even in that case, be would be entitled to specific performance\u2014which was accorded in the Kilmer Case49 but was apparently not sought in the Dagenham Case, so far as the report in 8 Ch. App. 1022 shews, although in the Kilmer Case49 it appears to have been assumed that it was. The present case is simply one of default under a contract, of which the parties have expressly stipulated that time shall be of the essence, by a purchaser who has paid merely a deposit. There is no excuse for the default; no case of fraud, surprise, accident or mistake has been suggested; and there has been no waiver of the stipulation. No authority has been cited, and I am satisfied that none can be, found, which would support a decree for specific performance under such circumstances. Wide as the powers and discretion of a court of equity are, they do not extend to making new contracts for suitors. Hipwell v. Knight[50], at page 416; Seaton v. Mapp[51], at page 564; Honeyman v. Marryat[52], at page 24.\nThe plaintiff does not ask for a judgment rescinding the contract. At bar his counsel asserted and relied upon the right of his client to rescind without curial assistance. A return of the deposit has not been asked for by the plaintiff. It could not in any case properly be granted except as to the balance of $125 over and above the agent\u2019s commission, which amounts to $375, and to which he is clearly entitled. But, having regard to the very short default\u2014three days\u2014and to the circumstances in which it occurred, I think the defendant should return this $125. The purchaser did not refuse to perform his contract and his conduct did not amount to a repudiation of it. On the contrary he is and always has been anxious to carry it out, though he neglected to comply with its terms. In dismissing this appeal I should be disposed to give the respondent his costs in this court only on condition that this sum of $125 is returned to the plaintiff or that the respondent should agree to credit it upon such costs: Howe v. Smith[53], at page 95; Gee v. Pearse[54]. If this is done, however, it must be on the basis that the contract is to be deemed rescinded. If the appellant should decline so to treat it, the appeal will simply be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by my brother Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Proudfoot, Duncan & Grant.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rowan, Jones, Somerville & Newman.\n[1] 28 Ont.

In a suit for specific performance of a contract for the sale of lands an agreement for the re-sale of the lands may be set up as a defence notwithstanding that such re-sale agreement does not satisfy the requirements of the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds. Judgment appealed from (10 D.L.R. 765) affirmed.\nSuch an agreement for re-sale affords a sufficient reason for refusing a decree for specific performance of the original contract for sale.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada refused to review the finding of the courts below that the defendants, while agents for the sale of the property in question, when purchasing it themselves under the contract for re-sale, had discharged their duty towards the plaintiff in regard to disclosure of material facts relating to the value of the property.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ. \u2014 Where the parties to a contract come to a fresh agreement of such a kind that the two cannot stand together the effect of the second agreement is to rescind the first.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Harvey C.J., at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs and the counterclaim of the defendants was disallowed without costs.\nThe action was brought by the appellant for speci- fic performance of an agreement by the company to sell certain lots in Calgary, Alta., to him. Being dissatisfied with the situation of the property the plaintiff had listed it for sale with the company which, being unable to secure a purchaser, offered to buy the property back and, owing to what took place between them, the defence of the company was that the appellant had resold the property to them and they relied upon this also by counterclaiming for specific performance of the alleged agreement by the appellant to re-sell the property to them. At the trial Chief Justice Harvey dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs, and, on account of the agreement for re-sale being ambiguous and not available as a memorandum in writing within the Statute of Frauds, the counterclaim was disallowed without costs. It was also contended, on the appeal, that the defendants were in a fiduciary relationship towards the appellant; that they had information as to increased value of the property which they did not communicate to the appellant, and that, on the whole evidence, there should have been a decree for specific performance of the agreement to sell to him.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. and J. Leslie Jennison K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the notes of Mr. Justice Anglin and I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by him.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Idington. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant bought from the respondent, for $641.25, some property, of speculative value, paid part of the price, complained of its being unprofitable, listed it with respondent to re-sell at $900, and, respondent's officials, concluding it was good value at that, decided on behalf of respondent to offer the appellant this price on the terms in his listing, but varied the terms so as to please him, and, so varied, he accepted the offer.\nThe first transaction is in writing, and so is the last also, but ambiguously so, by reason of the cancellation of some words in the receipt rendering it doubtful if it fulfils the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\nThis defect arose from the effort of the respondent to so vary it as to meet appellant's views.\nHe seeks specific performance of his contract to purchase, whilst repudiating his contract to re-sell to his vendor; after having for a month $50 of respondent's money in his pocket and having enjoyed its forbearance during that month and many previous months in regard to his overdue payments under the contract he sues on.\nThe parties, instead of simplifying matters by striking a balance between them and making one transaction of these two, let each contract take care of itself, and thus left it open for appellant, by way of experimental litigation, to claim that he was entitled to specific performance of his contract, in April, when the last payment should fall due thereunder, and that respondent could not set up this contract of re-sale to his vendors either as rescission of the first or an answer to the claim for specific performance.\nI think it is quite possible to hold that, in light of all that transpired between the parties, rescission is, in truth, what they intended, subject merely to this, that the ultimate result of the financial adjustment (balancing accounts as the respondent's payments fell due and were made) should be left to work itself out in the few months that they had to run.\nSuch conditional rescission might well be treated as a complete answer to the claim for specific performance.\nFor purposes, not involving the bringing of an action, a contract falling within the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds is valid if otherwise binding and not illegal.\nSuch a contract may and has often been held a complete answer by way of defence to an action for specific performance, and the cases so maintaining were cited in argument before us and relied upon herein and in the courts below.\nIt is urged, however, with some force, that, however that may be, when the new contract involves rescission, it cannot be so in a case where the parties contemplated the continued existence of the contract.\nIt is always desirable to look at the substance of what the parties in litigation had in view in their transactions out of which the litigation has arisen, and to discard, if possible, the mere form of expression, if clearly but a mere form of expression.\nIt is upon this or something like this principle that the legal rights of these parties must be decided.\nIt is laid down in Fry on Specific Performance (4 ed.), section 1031, thus:\u2014\nWhere the parties to a contract come to a fresh agreement of such a kind that, the two cannot stand together, the effect of the second agreement is to rescind the first. This is one form of novatio in Roman law. He then reviews a number of authorities and in conclusion, in section 1039, says, as follows:\u2014\nBut where the new contract is relied on only as an extinguishment of the old one, the mere fact that it is not in writing, and so could not be put in suit, seems to be no ground for denying its effect in rescinding the original contract. The Statute of Frauds does not make the parol contract void, but only prevents an action upon it; and it does not seem to be necessary to the extinction of one contract by another that the second contract could be actively enforced. The point has never, it is believed, been matter of decision. But, in point of principle, it seems to stand on the same footing as a simple agreement to rescind.\nI think his conclusion fits this case and puts the principle on which it must be decided in its true light.\nAgain, let us assume the receipt in question herein constitutes a compliance with the Statute of Frauds, and the appellant's action was resisted upon no other ground than thus furnished: Does any one believe that a court proceeding upon the fundamental principles upon which the right to specific performance rests, would listen to such a claim for a moment \u2014 as to enforce a conveyance in April when clearly there must be a re-conveyance in August following?\nSuch a thing, I imagine, would be treated by a court so appealed to as most palpably trifling.\nThen, if the written contract of re-sale is a bar, so must the oral one, or partly written partly oral, be a complete defence upon the authority of the cases cited.\nAnd, as to the question springing from the relation of principal and agent, I do not think on the evidence before us there is anything open to the appellant herein.\nThere was no concealment by respondent, no failure on respondent's part to disclose anything known to it, but unknown to appellant. Each used his own judgment. The respondent's may have been better than that of the appellant, tout that is always liable to happen.\nThe law has not pushed the principles governing the relation of principal and agent so far as to preclude that sort of thing, or it would render it impossible for an agent ever to buy from his principal.\nThe dealing must be fair, but is not impossible.\nAnd the evidence of the opinion of others next day in regard to values in a highly speculative market can be of no value, standing alone, as a test of what is fair.\nThe appellant was a speculator himself and his opinion is just as good. See Kelly v. Enderton[3].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that, in the absence of any defence based upon the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds, the respondents would be entitled to enforce against the appellant the agreement of the 18th of February. The real question is whether (there being no memorandum sufficient under that enactment) that agreement was an answer to the appellant's action. At the date of the trial, 7th February, 1912, the respondents would have been entitled under the terms of the agreement of February, 1911 (assuming that agreement enforceable) to demand an assignment of the appellant's interest in the lands on payment of the purchase price; and, in these circumstances, I think the Chief Justice of Alberta was right in refusing specific performance of the earlier agreement. I shall assume that, under the law of Alberta, the appellant, by virtue of the agreement of April, 1910, acquired before the second agreement was entered into an interest in the lands in question that would be an \"interest in lands\" within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds (4th section). The law of England is clear enough that a purchaser under an agreement for the sale of lands still in fieri, the circumstances being such that on the performance of his obligations he would be entitled to a decree for specific performance of it, has such an interest in the land; but the interest is an equitable interest and it rests upon the fact that there is an agreement of sale in respect of which a court of equity would decree specific performance. The existence of an agreement enforceable by action at law only would not vest in him an interest in the land. Primarily the (equitable rights were rights in personam, but the peculiar nature and efficacy of the remedies available in the Court of Chancery for the enforcement of such rights together with the effect of the equitable doctrine of notice, in enormously widening the field over which rights in personam would otherwise have been enforceable, eventually led in certain cases to such rights being regarded as jura in re and protected as rights of ownership. But every merely equitable right of ownership or interest in the property owes its vitality to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery.\nThe question to be determined here is whether, notwithstanding the agreement of February, 1911, the appellant is entitled to demand the exercise of that jurisdiction by way of decreeing specific execution of the contract of April, 1910. I concur with Har- vey C.J. in thinking that the existence of the subsequent agreement is a proper ground for refusing the equitable remedy.\nAll the other points resolve themselves in questions of costs in regard to which this court ought not to intervene.\nANGLIN J.\u2014There is much in the circumstances under which the defendants procured from the plaintiff the contract for the re-sale of the property in question that is calculated to arouse a suspicion that they failed to make to him that full disclosure of material facts which is incumbent on agents for sale when they themselves become purchasers. But the trial judge has said that it was\nestablished to my entire satisfaction that the plaintiff knew he was dealing with the defendants as purchasers, and that no advantage whatever had been taken of him.\nAlthough, in appeal, Mr. Justice Walsh expressed his dislike of\nat least one incident in connection with the dealings between the parties on this re-sale,\nhe accepted, as did Mr. Justice Scott and Mr. Justice Simmons, \"the findings of fact adverse to the plaintiff.\" While not satisfied that, if I had been presiding at the trial of this action, I should, upon my present appreciation of the evidence, have reached the conclusion that the defendants had fully discharged their duty to the plaintiff as his agents, I am not prepared to reverse the concurrent finding of two courts upon that point, which must to a considerable extent, in the case of the learned trial judge, have rested upon the view taken by him of the credibility and weight of the testimony of the several witnesses. On the other branch of the case, while, in my opinion, the contract of re-sale did not effect and was not intended to effect a rescission of the original contract\u2014 the terms of the re-sale contract, the conduct of the parties in regard to the payments and the- retention by the defendants of the purchase money paid on the original contract make that very clear \u2014 I do not think the plaintiff is entitled to invoke the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction of the court to decree specific performance. He made a contract of re-sale which is unenforceable by action only because an ambiguity in the receipt which he gave for the first instalment of the purchase money renders it insufficient as a memorandum to satisfy the requirements of the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds. Under that contract, if enforceable, the defendants would be entitled on their counterclaim to a decree for specific performance of it and a re-conveyance to them of the property in question concurrently with the decree which the plaintiff claims requiring the defendants to convey the same property to him. Under such circumstances the court should not, I think, decree specific performance in favour of the plaintiff. While not available to support an action, the contract of re-sale may be used as a defence. To that the Statute of Frauds offers no obstacle. Given as a defence the effect which it would have had in an action upon it, if properly evidenced, the contract of re-sale affords a sufficient answer to the plaintiff's claim to a decree for specific performance.\nWhatever may be thought of the conduct of the defendants, the plaintiff's own course of dealing in this matter was not such as to entitle him to any special consideration from a court of equity.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 10 D.L.R. 765.\n[2] 4 Alta.

L.R. 521) which affirmed the decision of a Divisional Court (27 Ont. L.R. 479) by which the judgment of the trial Judge (26 Ont.

Molsons Bank v.

Having become insolvent he made an assignment for benefit of his creditors and the assignee brought action to set aside the security held by the bank on the assets. The main grounds on which he relied in this action were, that Brethour was not a \u201cwholesale purchaser,\u201d and that the lumber purchased by the insolvent was not a \u201cproduct of the forest\u201d both within the meaning of sec. 88(1) of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d The trial judge and both Appellate Courts below held in favour of the bank on both grounds and decided other points raised mainly in the same way.\nLaidlaw K.C. and Atwater K.C. for the appellant. Sawn lumber is not a \u201cproduct of the forest\u201d within the meaning of that term in sec. 88(1) of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d Molsons Bank v. Beaudry[4].\nThe \u201cOntario Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act\u201d makes a mortgage of personal property void as against creditors unless it is registered. The \u201cBank Act\u201d cannot, and does not, purport to override this provision. See Montreal Street Railway Co. v. City of Montreal[5], at page 228. The insolvent Brethour was not a \u201cwholesale purchaser\u201d of the lumber under said sec. 88(1).\nThe bank\u2019s advances were for past due debts and not authorized by the \u201cBank Act.\u201d See Bank of Hamilton v. Halslead[6].\nArnoldi K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal, though I confess with much doubt on the question as to whether the advances made by the bank and for which the security under the \u201cBank Act\u201d was taken were really bon\u00e2 fide contemporaneous advances as required by the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nBeing in doubt on the point I confirm the judgment appealed from.\nDUFF J.\u2014Considering the facts of this case together with the course of the proceedings in the Ontario courts I think the only points requiring discussion are the points raised by the appellant relating to the construction of sec. 88 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 29. These questions arise upon the first (unnumbered) paragraph of that section, which is in the following words:\u2014\n88. The bank may lend money to any wholesale purchaser or shipper of or dealer in products of agriculture, the forest, quarry and mine, or the sea, lakes and rivers, or to any wholesale purchaser or shipper of or dealer in live stock or dead stock and the products thereof, upon the security of such products, or of such live stock or dead stock and the products thereof. The loans in question were made upon the security of certain lumber, the property of one Brethour and the first question is whether Brethour was a \u201cwholesale purchaser, or shipper of, or dealer in\u201d these commodities. The evidence shews that Brethour purchased in carload quantities, storing the lumber purchased in his yard, making use of it very largely in his own business which was that of a builder, and selling in comparatively small quantities to the general public. Whether Brethour was strictly a wholesale \u201cdealer\u201d may be open to question. But \u201cwholesale purchaser\u201d is used in contradistinction to \u201cwholesale shipper\u201d and \u201cwholesale dealer,\u201d and I think that the circumstances being such as I have mentioned, Brethour is within the intendment of the phrase \u201cwholesale purchaser.\u201d\nThe second question is whether lumber is an article which falls within the phrase \u201cproducts of * * * the forest\u201d as the words are used in this enactment. I may say at the outset that I have been unable to read the section in the manner in which it is read by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. I think the words \u201cproducts thereof\u201d in the last line are connected both grammatically and by the general sense of the paragraph with the words \u201csuch live stock or dead stock\u201d immediately preceding them. Is lumber then a \u201cproduct of the forest\u201d for the purposes of this section? According to the narrow construction which the appellant asks us to give effect to when pressed to its logical conclusion, timber ceases to be a product of the forest as soon as it has been subjected to any process of manufacture. That is almost a reductio ad absurdum, and Mr. Laidlaw, of course, did not assume any such untenable position, rather he tried to escape from it. He did not, as I understood him on the oral argument before us, dispute that what are commonly known as saw-logs would be \u201cproducts of the forest,\u201d within the meaning of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d But why draw the line at the saw-logs? Logs are frequently reduced to lumber at the very place, or at all events, within a short distance of the very place where they are felled, by means of portable saw-mills. The appellant\u2019s answer, of course, to this mode of argument is that the line must be drawn somewhere and that if you admit dressed lumber as a \u201cproduct of the forest\u201d you cannot logically stop short of admitting the articles into which the lumber is further manufactured.\nI concur with much that is said as to the difficulty of drawing an abstract line. This is only one example of the class of cases in which the court being loath and refusing to attempt to draw an abstract line, finds itself compelled to decide whether a particular concrete case falls on one side or on the other side of the line which theoretically must be found somewhere within given limits. In this particular case I prefer to say that according to the common understanding the articles in question would fairly be comprised within the description \u201cproducts of the forest,\u201d and I think they are within the contemplation of the enactment we have to interpret.\nI may add a sentence respectfully recording my inability to agree with the decision of the majority in Molsons Bank v. Beaudry[7].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014On the two questions as to the construction of section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 29) involved in this appeal I respectfully agree in the conclusions reached in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nSir William Meredith C.J., who tried this action, was of the opinion that\npart of the business which (the insolvent) Brethour carried on was that of a wholesale dealer in lumber.\nWhile, because of the limitations resulting from the fact that the community in which he did business is comparatively small, Brethour\u2019s transactions were not as extensive as a wholesale dealer in a large centre of population would naturally be expected to have, the evidence discloses that his purchases were not of a retail character. They were by the carload, and his yard at times held from 200,000 to 300,000 feet of lumber. Most, if not all, of his sales were, no doubt, by retail and it may be that he could not properly be described as a \u201cwholesale dealer in lumber.\u201d But the statute uses the word \u201cpurchaser\u201d apparently in contradistinction to the word \u201cdealer\u201d and it was, no doubt, intended to cover the case of the man who purchases by wholesale, although he may either himself use the material which he purchases in his business as a contractor, or may dispose of it by retail sale. In my opinion, Brethour was properly held to be a wholesale purchaser of lumber.\nWhile I am, with respect, unable to accept what I understand to have been the view of Meredith C.J., that the words \u201cand the products thereof,\u201d which occur in the 5th line of sub-section 1 of section 88, and again in the last line,\napply to all the articles previously mentioned in the sub-section and, therefore, apply to the products of the forest\nand think that, upon their proper grammatical con- struction and, read in the light of the context, they relate only to \u201clive stock or dead stock,\u201d I am of the opinion that the other words in the sub-section, \u201cproducts of the forest,\u201d are wide enough to include lumber, which is sometimes sawn in a portable saw-mill situate at or near the limits where the trees from which it is made grew and sometimes in a permanent mill situate at some other convenient point. I have fully considered the judgment of the Quebec court of appeal in Molsons Bank v. Beaudry[8], relied upon by counsel for the appellant. With great respect, I cannot agree with the conclusion there reached. The construction of section 88 which excludes planks or boards because they are not \u201cproducts of the forest\u201d is, in my opinion, too narrow.\nCounsel for the appellant further urged that the evidence established that the debt for which the bank obtained the securities in question was then past due and that the loans for which such securities were taken were, therefore, not within section 88. He stated that this point was taken in the provincial courts. No allusion is made to it either in the judgment of the learned trial judge or in the opinions delivered in the Divisional Court and the Appellate Division, and counsel for the respondent insisted that it was urged for the first time at bar in this court. However that may be, assuming this ground of appeal to be open, it is, I think, sufficiently clear from the copy of the bank account in evidence that the indebtedness in respect of which the bank claims to hold the impeached securities is for advances made at or subsequently to the respective dates at which such securities were taken, and that the loans were made upon such securities. I agree with the views expressed by Mulock C.J., as to the re-pledging of the securities when renewal notes were given.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The trial judge having found that the business which Brethour carried on was that of a wholesale purchaser in lumber and that finding having been confirmed by the Divisional Court and the Appellate Division we should accept it.\nThe question has been raised by the appellant that that lumber was not a product of the forest within the meaning of section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d and that no valid security could be given by Brethour to the respondent under that section.\nIt is contended also by the appellant that the power to pledge products of the forest should reasonably be limited to the original resources and should not be extended to the product of a product.\nSection 88, in my view, never contemplated that security should be given on standing lumber, and if there was any doubt as to that we will find the answer in the \u201cBank Act\u201d of last session which, in section 84, made a special provision authorizing banks to lend money upon the security of standing timber.\nThat power to the banks to lend money on the security of natural resources has reference specially to the nature or to the volume of the trade carried on by one who gives the security.\nIn view of the fact that Brethour was a wholesale lumber purchaser, I think the respondent was entitled to receive from him the security in question.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William Laidlaw.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Arnoldi & Grierson.\n[1] 28 Ont.

A contract was entered into with H. and W. paid $20,000 on account of the purchase price on which S. was paid his commission. Default having been made in the further payments H. brought action claiming possession of the property and the right to retain the amount paid. W. counter-claimed for rescission of the contract and return of the money paid with interest and on the trial swore that he knew nothing of S.\u2019s agency for several months after the contract was signed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (29 Ont. L.R. 6), Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that it was the duty of H., on becoming aware that S. was a co-purchaser with W. to satisfy himself that the latter was aware of the agency of S.; and that W. was entitled to the relief asked by his counterclaim.\nHeld, per Davies and Anglin JJ. (Duff J. contra), that S. by concealing from W. the fact that he was to receive a commission from the vendor was guilty of a fraud for which H. was responsible as agent.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judg- ment of a Divisional Court which affirmed the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nCline, for the appellants, referred to Coy v.

The only point requiring discussion, in my judgment, is whether because of the dealings between the Hitchcocks and Sykes the respondent Webster became entitled on discovering those dealings to rescind the agreement for sale. The facts and the law have been very fully discussed in the various judgments delivered in the courts below. I do not think that among the cases cited there is one decision which exactly fits this case. But when the facts are fully seized, it appears to be well within the principle of the decisions upon the authority of which the Court of Appeal rested its judgment in Grant v. Gold Exploration, etc., Syndi- Cate6. The essential feature of the case, in my view of it is one which has perhaps not been emphasized as much as its importance would justify. It lies, I think, in the letter of March 29th, 1910, written by W.R. Hitchcock to Sykes. That letter is as follows:\u2014\nCornwall, Ont., March 29, 1910.\nHiram Sykes, Montreal.\nDear Sir,\u2014Enclosed herewith please find map as surveyed and drawn up by Robert B. McKay, M.E., of Cobalt, Ontario. It will give you an idea of the surface work done on the Hitchcock Bros.\u2019 silver property, and I may add that since Mr. McKay visited the property in the early part of January last, a large amount of work has been done, principally in stripping veins and trenching on them to a depth from two to eight feet, until native silver, smalltite or nickelite would appear.\nLOCATION: The E. \u00bd of N. \u00bd Lot 10, Concession 1, Township of Tudhope, consisting of 80 acres, being only about one-half mile from the wharf at the foot of Elk Lake, where all steamboats between Latchford and Elk City may call. The land from the mine to the wharf is level, so that a good wagon road will be inexpensive.\nTITLE: The claims were staked by E.H. Hitchcock, and recorded in November, 1909, under his own license. Sufficient work has been done and recorded so that a Crown patent may now be obtained. No option has ever been given on the property, so that the title is clear with E. H. Hitchcock of Elk Lake.\nWhile there is but a few acres of rock shewing above the level ground, I believe the bed rock is not far below the surface of the ground. There appears to be about a dozen well-defined fissure veins running parallel with each other through the exposed rock. We have stripped and blasted out rock on only seven of them and find good shewings of native silver in four of them, as well as smalltite, nickelite and a large quantity of Cobalt bloom in all veins opened. The rock formation is partly Gabro and partly fine diabase. In many places the wall rock between the veins is well mineralized with native leaf silver, Argentile and silver sulphides shew freely in many places.\nIn all my experience in the Cobalt country I have not seen so many large, rich-looking veins in so small a compass. Every vein worked on has the appearance of widening as depth is obtained. First-class timber in abundance is grown on the property.\nPractical mining men from all the surrounding country have been to see the property and praise it most highly. I believe it will prove to be richer than anything in the Elk Lake or Gowganda Districts. We want a syndicate or company to operate it and are agreeable to dispose of 9\/10 interests. We must get a substantial payment down of say $20,000 or $25,000, the balance from time to time to suit. As soon as payment is made we will allow the company to start operations as they may see fit. However, a fair percentage of receipts of ore shipped must be placed in bank to secure our final payments.\nWe have spent a lot of money, and are still spending it and we know we have a genuine silver mine, where silver in large quantities can be bagged without even using a steam plant to mine it.\nIf you con prevail on any of your friends to join you in a syndicate or company so that mining can be done on a thorough basis early this spring, I feel that the result will be all that you can hope for. You can safely advise your most intimate friend or client to invest their money in this proposition.\nYours truly,\nHITCHCOCK BROS.,\nper W.R. Hitchcock.\nPursuant to the suggestions contained in this letter, Sykes approached Webster. The result of his negotiations with Webster was an agreement of partnership dated April 7th, 1910, in which they agreed to buy the property in question and to divide the profits equally between them. The other material facts, in my view of them, are that on April 12th the agreement for sale was entered into and the initial payment made, the agreement contemplating the working of the property by the purchasers; that the commission which it was understood Sykes was to receive for procuring a purchaser on the terms mentioned in the letter of March 29th, 1910, was paid to Sykes by the Hitchcocks without the knowledge of Webster, but without any attempt on the part of the Hitchcocks to conceal from Webster the facts touching the commission to be paid to Sykes and without any knowledge or suspicion that Webster was not aware of the facts; that the Hitchcocks were aware that Sykes was a man of no means, but had had some experience as a mining Operator and a promoter of mining companies; that the Hitchcocks were not aware of the agreement of April 10th, but they understood that the purchasers were buying and intended to work the property either temporarily or permanently as a joint venture.\nOn general principles I must say, with great respect, that it appears to me very clear, indeed, when one keeps in view the terms of the letter of March 29th (the existence of which is, in my view of it, the decisive fact of the case) that a duty rested on the Hitchcocks to inform Webster of the fact that they were paying Sykes a commission.\nThe relationship into which Webster and Sykes had entered with the knowledge of the Hitchcocks, was one of the class which imposes upon the parties to it reciprocal obligations of good faith and loyalty as regards the common interest in the common venture: Carter v. Horne[7]. Among others these obligations include the duty of fully disclosing to his co\u2011adventurers any interest one of the parties may have which is in fact adverse to the common interest or which may be of such a character as to give rise to an obvious risk of exposing him to a temptation to fall short of the loyalty he owes to that interest. It was visibly Sykes\u2019 duty to inform Webster of the arrangement he had made with the Hitchcocks respecting commission, and for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties in this case it must be taken that the Hitch-cocks were aware of the existence of that duty. So far we are really on common ground. It is not disputed either that if after becoming aware that Sykes and Webster had formed a partnership for the purpose of dealing in mines generally or for the purpose of buying the property in question, the Hitchcocks had approached Sykes and offered to pay him personally a commission upon the purchase of the property by him and his partner, a duty would have rested on the Hitchcocks to disclose this arrangement to Webster. Such a transaction stands, of course, on the same footing as an arrangement by one party to some proposed business to pay the agent of the other party a commission on the completion of the business. The law casts upon the person who deals with the agent in this suspicious and questionable way the burden of seeing that the duty of disclosure is performed at the risk, if it be not performed, of becoming implicated in the agent\u2019s culpability.\nThe principle is not a technical one; and it appears to me to apply to the circumstances of this case for these reasons. As the letter of the 29th of March demonstrates, the Hitchcocks contemplated, when they agreed to pay Sykes a commission for procuring a purchaser that for the purpose of bringing about a sale and thereby earning this commission, he should enter into relations of confidence with other persons with whom he was to become associated as purchaser, of such a character as would impose upon him the duty of disclosing to them his existing relations with the Hitchcocks. It cannot, I think, be successfully contended that there is in principle any substantial relevant distinction between a case of that kind and those cases in which the confidential relationship exists before the arrangement for commission is made. The principle has its justification in the necessity of protecting these confidential relationships and from that point of view there is, in my judgment, no essential distinction between the two classes of cases. On this ground, therefore, (and I wish to make it plain that for my part I am deciding this case upon the letter of March 29th) I think a duty of disclosure rested upon the Hitchcocks,\nAs to the authorities\u2014I have only a word to say upon one of them\u2014Grant v. Gold Exploration, etc., Syndicate[8].\nIt is not to be disputed that Lord Justice A. L. Smith puts his judgment on grounds that are not applicable to this case. Neither is it to be disputed that if the findings of fact discoverable in the judgment of Lord Justice Collins are to be considered the basis of his judgment, then that judgment is not conclusive of the present case; moreover, there is this further distinction\u2014it is an important distinction\u2014between the circumstances in that case and this: Govan was not only intended to promote a company, that is to say, to bring a company into existence for the purpose of purchasing the property that Grant had to sell, but he was in fact the managing director of the company and, as such, himself decided upon and actually concluded the purchase out of which the litigation arose. Here it is admitted that Sykes did not act in a representative capacity in deciding upon or concluding the bargain with the Hitchcocks; on the contrary Webster applied his own judgment to the facts and decided for himself.\nIt may well be doubted, therefore, whether the decision in Grant v. Gold Exploration, etc., Syndicate8 can fairly be held to rule the decision in this case. I am inclined to think it does not. On the other hand, while, as I have said, the opinion above indicated seems to be justified by the principle of the decisions on which their Lordships proceeded in Grant\u2019s Case[9], there are observations in the judgment of Lord Justice Collins which are almost literally applicable to the facts of this case.\nOn this ground then I should dismiss the appeal, but I do not think I ought to take leave of the case without referring to another contention advanced by Mr. Kilmer. The contention was this: Sykes\u2019s conduct in representing himself as a person standing in the same interest with Webster, coupled with the concealment of his existing relations with the Hitchcocks was a fraud, in the carrying out of which he was acting as the agent of the Hitchcocks and in respect of which the Hitchcocks are chargeable as the principals of Sykes. The contention was not raised on the pleadings or in the courts below, or in the respondent\u2019s factum, and I am pretty certain, was advanced by Mr. Kilmer out of deference to observations made from the Bench during the argument of Mr. Cline. After considering it, I do not think there is anything in the point, and, if there were, I do not think it would be open at this stage of the proceedings. I refer to it because I think I am in a sense responsible for the discussion of it and with the object of making it clear that I am not proceeding upon any such ground in dismissing the appeal.\nIt is not, of course, argued that Sykes was the agent of the Hitchcocks for the selling of the property; he had no authority from them as their representative, that is to say, to bind them by any obligation as to the sale of the property. The arrangement between him and the Hitchcocks was that if he pro- cured a purchaser, at a price named, prepared to buy the property on terms acceptable to the Hitchcocks (indicated in a general way in the letter of 29th March,) he. was to be paid a commission. Generally speaking, an owner of property who agrees to pay a commission to one or more persons for procuring a purchaser does not by such an agreement confer any authority upon such persons to enter into any obligation on his behalf. And, in this case, although it was contemplated that Sykes should enter into partnership arrangements with others, it would be vain to argue from any facts in evidence in this case\u2014indeed, it is obviously not so\u2014that it was contemplated between Hitchcock and Sykes that Sykes in entering into such arrangements was to have authority to act as the Hitchcock\u2019s agent and bind them by the obligations which he should profess to undertake with his co-purchasers. While it was contemplated that Sykes should undertake such obligations, it was never intended that he should assume them on behalf of and as the alter ego of the Hitch-cocks; as there was no authority in fact, so also was there no ostensible authority because, of course, Sykes in all these arrangements professed to act only for himself.\nThen as to the authority of Sykes to make representations on behalf of the vendors and as their agent, Sykes had been promised a commission for the introduction of a purchaser, but he was under no duty to try to procure a purchaser; he was not bound to take a single step to that end. It may be, although I should think it a disputable question, that a person having such an arrangement with the vendor would solely in virtue of that arrangement be possessed of implied authority to make representations as the agent of the vendor in relation to the description or value of the property. In any case such representations made professedly under the authority of the vendor might, of course, be ratified by him and (if brought to his attention while the contract was still in fieri) ratification would be manifested by the vendor\u2019s proceeding with the contract. But the misrepresentation complained of was not and in the nature of things could not be made professedly as the representation of the vendor and it was consequently incapable in law of ratification by him. If made without antecedent authority his responsibility for it must rest on some other principle than that of ratification. It seems equally clear that under such an arrangement as that in question whatever authority might be implied by law as to representations touching the description and value of the property, no authority could be implied or apart from special circumstances inferred by which the commission-earner would be entitled to represent himself as disinterested. Whether the circumstances of this case would justify the conclusion that Sykes had a general authority which would extend to that class of acts, must be, I think, a question of fact. If I had to pass upon that question, in this case, I should say there was no such authority. But the question does not arise because if the respondent intended to rest his case upon that ground, he should have done so at a stage of the litigation at which the appellants would have had an opportunity of meeting his allegations under this head. But the difficulties of the contention do not end here. Assuming authority established the respondent must shew that the fraud was dans locum contractui that he was influenced by it in whole or in part to enter into the contract. That again is an allegation which the appellants have had no opportunity to meet. The respondent, it is true, has said, that he would not have purchased, had he known Sykes\u2019 relations with Hitchcock. But the evidence was not directed to the issue now sought to be raised and the appellants have never been called upon to answer it, and we can feel no assurance that we have before us all the evidence bearing upon the issue.\nIt would, therefore, be contrary to the settled practice of this court to permit the respondent to raise the point at this stage.\nTherefore, there is nothing in this case to which respondeat superior as expounded in the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[10] and the cases therein referred to, can be applied.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs, vendors of mining property on which $20,000 had been paid on account of the purchase price, $167,000, for default in payment of further instalments of the purchase money claim in this action possession of the lands freed from liens, etc., and assert the right to retain the $20,000 paid as forfeited under a provision of the agreement. The defendants, Sykes and Webster, are the purchasers. Sykes was the vendors\u2019 agent for the sale of the property on a 10% commission basis, and he induced Webster to become his co\u2011purchaser without disclosing to him his agency and commission agreement with the vendors. He received $2,000 as commission on the $20,000, which was in fact paid by Webster, who remained unaware of the agency and of the payment of this commission until after this action was brought. Webster counterclaims for rescission of the agreement and the repayment of the $20,000 on the ground that the sale was fraudulent as against him, and for damages.\nAfter reviewing the evidence, Hodgins J.A. summarized it as follows:\u2014\nThe fair result of the whole evidence\u2014of which I have extracted only a few of the more important parts\u2014I think is as follows: That the respondents arranged to pay a ten per cent. commission to Sykes to find a purchaser for, or induce his friends to join in purchasing, the mining property; that the respondents agreed that if Sykes purchased himself or induced another to purchase alone or jointly with him, the commission would be paid to Sykes, and in that sense the commission was consciously added to the purchase price; that the respondents knew, before the agreement was signed, that a relationship of partner or joint purchaser existed between Webster and Sykes, and that they were exacting a price from Webster and Sykes that they would not have exacted from Sykes alone; that they did not disclose the fact that they were paying Sykes a commission; and that the appellant did not know of it until September, and until after action brought; and that if he had known it he would have declined to purchase.\nThe plaintiffs obtained judgment by default against Sykes, who had absconded.\nThe trial judge upheld the plaintiff\u2019s claim and dismissed the counterclaim on the ground that there was no fraud or intentional concealment on the part of the plaintiffs. This judgment was upheld in the Divisional Court, because no \u201cduty was cast on the respondents to disclose * * * to the appellant\u201d that his co-purchaser Sykes was receiving a commission from them on the sale. To hold otherwise, said the learned Chief Justice, would be\nto set up an artificial standard of morals.\nFrom this judgment Middleton J. dissented, holding that \u201cthe plaintiffs had been guilty of fraud both in morals and in law.\u201d In the Appellate Division these judgments were reversed, the court holding that Sykes was in fact the agent of his co-purchaser, Webster; that this relationship was known to the plaintiffs; and that such knowledge imposed on them the duty of assuring themselves that Webster was aware of the arrangement under which Sykes was to receive a commission on the sale. Meredith J.A. dissented on grounds similar to those which prevailed in the Divisional Court. He concludes his opinion with this sentence:\u2014\nWhile willing to be as vicious against vice in any form, as any one can be, I decline to chop off the heads of innocent and useful setting hens on the chance of their really being poisonous serpents.\nThere is no doubt upon the evidence that Webster was induced to become a purchaser by the persuasion and commendations of Sykes, in whom he placed implicit confidence because he believed their interests to be identical. He has sworn that he would not have purchased had he known that Sykes was in fact the vendors\u2019 paid agent.\nSykes was admittedly the plaintiffs\u2019 agent for sale. Indeed, it was they who suggested to him that he should prevail on some of his friends to join him in purchasing the property. In the course of his employment by the plaintiffs and to further its purpose he represented to Webster by his conduct, if not in actual words, that his sole interest was that of a co\u2011purchaser with him. He deliberately and fraudulently concealed the fact that he had another and an adverse interest\u2014that he was to receive a commission from the vendors of which the amount would increase in proportion to the purchase price. When the civil responsibility of the principal for fraud and misrepre- sentation of his agent in the course of his employment is taken into account, the present case is, in my opinion, indistinguishable in principle from one where vendors, knowing that it is necessary for a prospective purchaser to rely on the skill and advice of an expert in regard to the property which he contemplates buying and that he intends to do so, recommend to him and induce him to employ for that purpose as an independent man, in whose opinion and advice he can place implicit confidence, a person in their own pay whose remuneration is dependent upon a sale being effected and its quantum on the price obtained, and deliberately refrain from disclosing to him that person\u2019s relationship with themselves. Sykes\u2019s misrepresentation to Webster as to his true position in regard to the transaction with the plaintiffs and his fraudulent concealment of his commission interest occurred in the course of his principals\u2019 business and were, at least in part, for his principal\u2019s benefit. That a purchaser who bought under such circumstances in reliance on the advice of the person thus recommended by the vendors and in ignorance of his relations with them, would be entitled, on discovering the facts, to repudiate the transaction is unquestionable. It. is not material that Sykes\u2019s fraud, since it was committed while he was purporting to act within the scope of his employment, and in the course of the service for which he was engaged, may have been committed in his own interest rather than in that of the plaintiffs. Lloyd v. Grace Smith & Co.[11] For the fraudulent misrepresentations of their agent the plaintiffs were responsible and on that ground alone the impeached contract cannot stand. Milburn v. Wilson[12]; 1 Halsbury\u2019s L. of E., 211.\nI also agree with the view taken in the Appellate Division that, on becoming aware of the relationship between Webster and Sykes, as they admittedly did before the contract for the sale was made, knowing that they were paying a commission to Sykes, that he then stood in a fiduciary relation to his co-purchaser, and that his interest was in conflict with his duty in regard to the disclosure to Webster of his claim to a commission, it was the duty of the vendors to have satisfied themselves that Webster was aware of Sykes\u2019s relations with them. It does not matter that when the agreement to pay commission was entered into Sykes and Webster had not yet come together. Before the contract of sale was made the plaintiffs knew that Webster was relying on Sykes in the purchase which he was making. They knew he had sent Sykes to examine and report on the property. They knew, or should have known, that it was, or might be, Sykes\u2019s interest to conceal his agency for them from Webster and they should have anticipated that he might have done so; and it was at their peril that they consummated the transaction and paid Sykes his commission without having ascertained that Webster was apprised of the true situation. The principle underlying the decision in Grant v. Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate[13] covers this case. When the agreement to pay a commission was made in that case the vendor did not know that the agent, Govan, to whom it was promised, stood in a fiduciary relation to the purchasers. But, as Collins L.J. says at p. 247:\u2014 It is, however, quite sufficient to raise the legal question in this case that he (the vendor) became aware before he agreed to sell to the defendants that Govan had been acting for them in bringing about the sale. The facts are, then, that the vendor and the buyers\u2019 agent, known to the vendor to be such, agree upon a price to be paid by the purchaser one-tenth of which is to go into the pocket of the buyers\u2019 agent.\nSee also the judgment of Vaughan Williams L.J., at pp. 253-4.\nIndeed, while I do not rest my judgment on such a finding, from the facts established it would seem to be a legitimate inference that, when closing the transaction with Webster in the solicitor\u2019s office at Cornwall, the Hitchcocks were aware that he was ignorant of the commission to be paid to Sykes and were parties to the concealment of it from him. They knew that the arrangement between Webster and Sykes was that they should become purchasers with equal interests; they knew that Webster was buying in reliance on Sykes\u2019s. report on the property and for a price which Sykes had fixed with E.H. Hitchcock when he made the inspection; they knew that the $20,000 was being paid by Webster\u2019s cheques. Instead of one cheque for $20,000 Webster had brought to Cornwall three marked cheques\u2014one for $15,000, one for $3,000 and one for $2,000\u2014with a very faint hope, which proved illusory, that at the last moment, he might possibly secure some reduction in the price of the property. When the agreement of purchase was signed in the solicitor\u2019s office the Hitchcocks took the three cheques. Nothing was said about the fact that $2,000, the exact amount of one of them, was to go to Sykes for commission. When the party left the solicitor\u2019s office to go to the bank Webster dropped off on the way for some unexplained reason. At the bank, instead of handing over Webster\u2019s $2,000 cheque to Sykes, two new cheques, each for $1,000, were drawn and given to Sykes, one being signed by E.H. Hitchcock and the other by W.R. Hitchcock. No receipts were taken from Sykes and the cheques did not state for what they were given. The explanation of this offered by W.R. Hitchcock is that Sykes was in a great hurry to catch a train. Why, if that were the case, Webster\u2019s $2,000 cheque was not endorsed and handed over to Sykes either in the solicitor\u2019s office or in the bank is not explained. If it was not designed to keep Webster in ignorance as to the commission paid to Sykes, it is difficult to understand why this course was not adopted. There was in fact no such hurry as Hitchcock suggests. Of course, if the $2,000 had been paid to Sykes in the solicitor\u2019s office Webster would have known it; if Webster\u2019s cheque had been endorsed over to Sykes and put through his bank account Webster might have learned inconveniently soon of the payment of the commission. It seems to me incredible that the Hitchcocks could have believed that Sykes had told Webster of the commission arrangement. There is no suggestion of any reason why, if Webster was aware of it, he should have allowed Sykes to have the whole benefit of the commission, which would result in his paying for the property 10% more than the vendors\u2019 actual price\u2014for his one-half share 20% more than Sykes was to pay for his. It is utterly unreasonable to suppose that the Hitchcocks really thought that Webster was consciously entering into a transaction of that kind. That they knew that Sykes was obtaining the commission for his own benefit admits of no doubt. If they thought Webster was ignorant of the commission arrangement (as I think they did) their duty to have informed him of it is indubitable.\nBut that duty, in my opinion, arose when they obtained knowledge that their paid agent occupied a fiduciary relation in the transaction to his co-purchaser, and failure to discharge it cannot be excused by proving that they believed that Sykes had disclosed the circumstances to Webster. Grant v. Gold Exploration and Development Syndicate[14], at page 248, per Collins L.J.\nThat Webster is entitled to the relief of rescission is clear on the authority of cases such as Panama and South Pacific Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Co.[15] And it is not an answer that the property was good value for the price paid. Parker v. McKenna[16]. The court will not enter on that field of inquiry.\nOn both these grounds, therefore\u2014because Sykes, as the vendor\u2019s agent, was guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation for which they are responsible, and because they paid a commission to Sykes when they knew him to be Webster\u2019s trusted adviser and co-purchaser, without ascertaining that Webster knew that this commission was to be paid\u2014I am of the opinion that the defendant Webster is entitled to succeed on his counterclaim.\nThe mechanics\u2019 liens which were registered against the property have been removed. They present no obstacle to the defendant Webster having this relief. The plaintiffs are in possession of the property. I agree with Hodgins J.A., that there is not enough in the correspondence to warrant a finding of waiver by Webster of his right to rescind after he became aware of the facts which gave him that right nor has there been any dealing by him with the property which would amount to ratification of the contract.\nIn the judgment of the Appellate Division the plaintiffs\u2019 rights in regard to protection of the shaft sunk on the property by the defendants, or their assignee, and in regard to the ore taken from it are carefully provided for.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014It is with a great deal of hesitation that I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI was unable to see that the appellants were guilty of fraud in the ordinary sense of the word or that they intended to bribe Sykes when he stipulated a commission in their letter of the 29th of March, 1910.\nIf I may refer to some judgments rendered in mining cases in this country, I see that it is the habit of some who deal in mining operations to become members of syndicates, to play the part of the broker and to receive from the vendor a commission upon the sale to another member of the syndicate.\nEvery business (says Judge Riddell in a case of Murray v. Craig[17], has its own methods and its own code of ethics, and while the method of proceeding spoken of looks odd at first sight there is nothing improper in it, if thoroughly understood by all concerned.\nBut in this case, however, no such method has been proved as being prevalent in the circles of which the parties formed part and we have to apply the law as it applies to all persons. The principle of law and equity is that an agent or a partner shall make no profit to himself out of his employment other than the amount payable to him by his employer or by the partnership.\nThat principle is an exceedingly just one calculated to secure the observance of good faith between principal and agent or between partners and to prevent the agent sacrificing the interest of the employer and obtaining gain and advantage for himself.\nIt was found in this case that Sykes though a partner of Webster and though instructed by the latter to report upon the value of the mining proposition that was offered to them by the appellants was, however, in their pay and was, therefore, interested in having the purchase carried out.\nIt seems to me that this case is in all respects similar to the case of Grant v. Gold Exploration Development Syndicate[18], in which it was stated by Mr. Justice Collins that\nif a vendor pays a commission to a buyer\u2019s agent in order to secure his help in bringing about the sale, and does not inform the buyer of the fact, he cannot defend the transaction impeached by the buyer, who has in fact had no notice, by proving that he believed that the agent had disclosed the circumstances to his principal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Maclennan & Cline.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Kilmer, McAndrew, Irving & Davis.\n[1] 29 Ont.

The plaintiff, a linesman employed by the contractor, ascended a pole before it had been secured, without first having ascertained that it was safe for him to do so, in order to string wires upon it. The pole fell while he was at work upon it and he was injured.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (18 B.C. Rep. 407) that the accident was the result of the default of the contractor in relation to the work he had undertaken in regard to the strengthening of the poles and, consequently, the owners of the transmission line were not liable for the damages sustained by the plaintiff. Marney v. Scott ( (1899) 1 Q.B. 986) ; Indermaur v. Dames (L.R. 2 C.P. 311), and Lucy v. Bawden ((1914) 2 K.B. 318), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming, iby an equal division of opinion, the judgment of Murphy J., at the trial, by which, upon the findings of the jury, judgment had been entered in favour of the plaintiff for $3,200, with costs. The circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head\u2014note.\nSir C. H. Tupper K.C. for the appellants.\nM. A. Macdonald, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In this case the relation of master and servant did not exist between the plaintiff and the defendants.\nLockwood, in whose service the plaintiff was at the time of the accident, was an independent contractor, and to his collateral negligence the injury to the plaintiff is attributable. It is quite true that the contract with the company was to string wires on the poles, and, if limited to that, a great deal might be said in favour of the view urged upon us so strenuously at the argument that the company would be liable as owner in occupation of the pole\u2014line for having invited the workman to enter upon unsafe premises. But here, by his contract, Lockwood, the plaintiff's employer, assumed a duty to examine the poles and to make them safe before attempting to string wires upon them and to his breach of that duty the accident is attributable.\nIn such circumstances there is no recourse against the company appellant, and the appeal should be allowed with costs.'\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the allowance of this appeal with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 The respondent was not in any sense the servant of the appellant and hence all that has been said relative to care of him as a workman is beside the question. There was, in fact, no contractual relation of any kind between appellant and respondent.\nAppellant never invited the respondent to the place he calls a dangerous place.\nNot until the respondent's master had so fixed the pole that wires could be properly strung upon it was there any permission, much less an invitation, to respondent to touch the pole.\nAnd the respondent as an expert linesman, must have known that when he attempted to string wires on such a pole he was doing that which was sure to prove useless or worse, and that he ought, instead of trying to do so, to have pointed that out to his master.\nI need not dwell on the case at length. I fail to see the slightest resemblance in all this to the invitation to stevedores, which was in question in Marney v. Scott[2], so much relied upon.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The facts of this case can be stated in a sentence or two. The appellants are an electric power company and, in 1911, they erected a line of poles to support their transmission wires, but, before the wires were strung, the appellants became aware that some of the poles were not securely set and they, thereupon, entered into a contract with one Lockwood by which Lockwood agreed both to secure the poles and put the wires in place. The respondent was a linesman in Lockwood's employ and, while engaged in the work of wiring, was thrown to the ground and injured owing to the instability of the pole on which he was working at the time.\nThe question on this appeal is whether the appellants are answerable for the condition of the pole. The respondent says they are answerable on the principle in Indermaur v. Dames[3]. I think this contention cannot be sustained and that the appeal ought to be allowed..\nThe principle invoked may be stated, I think, in the language of Mr. Justice Atkin, in delivering judgment in Lucy v. Bawden[4]. At page 322, he says:\u2014\nThis obligation was expressed in Indermaur v. Dames[5], per Willes J.: \"And, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall, on his part, use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger, which he knows or ought to know.\" Those words are adopted in the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber[6]. In Smith v. London and St. Katharine Dock Co.[7], where the defendants were sued for providing a gangway from dock to ships insufficiently secured whereby the plaintiff, who had business on the ship, was damaged, Bovill C.J. said: \"The case then comes within the principle that persons inviting others on to their premises are answerable for anything in the nature of a trap.\" Then Byles J. said: \"there was a duty, on the part of the defendants to the plaintiff, not to permit the gangway to be insecure without warning the plaintiff of it.\"\nAnd then again, at page 325, he refers to the obligation resting upon the occupier under such circumstances as \"an obligation to avoid traps.\"\nIt seems to me that this principle can have no application whatever in the circumstances of this case. Where a contractor is engaged, as here, to make safe something that is known to be unsafe, it would be absurd to suggest that, on this principle, the employees of the contractor could hold the occupier responsible for the very condition of affairs which they are employed in rectifying. The principle invoked can have no application where the existence of the danger complained of is one of the ordinary risks of the particular business which the invitee comes on the premises to do.\nNor can the invitee (whose only invitation is that implied in the fact that he is engaged in the service of a contractor employed by the person who is sought to be charged as occupier) be said to be exposed to a trap for which the occupier is responsible within this principle where the danger arises from the negligent default of his own employer in relation to that which he has contracted to do. The implied invitation must be taken to be given and accepted upon the footing that the invitee knows as well as the occupier the risk of negligence by his own employer or his own fellow-servants, and, as between himself and the occupier, he must be taken to have assumed that risk.\nOn this short ground I think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014 I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should, be allowed.\nThe plaintiff while engaged as a linesman, employed by a contractor, one Lockwood, in stringing wires, was injured by falling with a pole of the defendant company, which was insecurely planted.\nThe ground on which he seeks to hold the defendants liable to him is that he went upon their property to string wires by their invitation and that they owed him the duty of having their poles in such a condition that he could safely ascend them for that purpose.\nThe uncontradicted evidence establishes \u2014 and it was admitted at bar \u2014 that it was part of Lockwood's undertaking that the defendants, before stringing the wires, should strengthen certain poles, from which the supporting earth had been washed away, one of them being that with which the plaintiff fell. Lockwood or his employees failed to do this, and the plaintiff's misfortune was due to that failure. The case was not one of an unqualified invitation to the workmen of Lock-wood to come upon the defendant's premises involving a representation or holding out on their part that those premises were safe for the purpose for which the invitation was given. The only invitation to the plaintiff, as a workman of Lockwood, was to ascend the pole in question after it had been properly strengthened or secured. Taking this view of the case, two of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal would have set aside the verdict for the plaintiff rendered at the trial. I concur in that conclusion. In the circumstances the defendants owed no duty to the plaintiff in respect of the security of the pole from which he fell.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014Velasky, the respondent, was injured by falling from a pole of the appellant company. He was then in the employ of an independent contractor who had undertaken to strengthen that pole. He was entirely under the control of that contractor.\nThe pole to be made use of by Velasky was unsafe to the knowledge of his master, the contractor, since he had undertaken to repair it. That contractor was then bound to give notice of that fact to his employee. He neglected to do so.\nNo negligence has been established against the appellants.\nWhen a person employs an independent contractor to do a specified work he does not thereby render himself liable for injuries caused by the sole negligence of such contractor. The action should have been dismissed.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Tupper, Kitto & Wightman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Russell, Mowat, Hancox & Farris.\n[1] 18 B.C.

The company let the work to a contractor who, in the construction of the road-bed blasted away a hillside by a method known as \"top-lofting\" thereby throwing large quantities of rock outside the right-of-way and upon plaintiff's adjoining lands in such a manner as to interfere with his use thereof. This injury could have been avoided by proper precautions.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (18 B.C. Rep. 81), Fitzpatrick C.J. hesitante, that the company was responsible in damages for the omission of their contractor to take precautions necessary to prevent his blasting operations producing the injury to the plaintiff's lands.\nHeld, further, that the general language of the release should be so construed as to restrict it to the matters in regard to which it had been granted with reference to the proper exercise of the powers of the company to construct the tramway in question, and that it could not apply to injuries caused through negligence.\nPer Duff J.\u2014 Where statutory powers respecting the construction of works are being exercised through an independent contractor, the correlative obligation of the beneficiaries of those powers to see that due care is taken to avoid unnecessary injurious consequences to the property of other persons is not discharged when their contractor fails to perform that duty, and they are responsible accordingly. Hardaker v. Idle District Council ((1896) 1 Q.B. 335), and Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural Council ((1911) 2 Ch. 188), referred to. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing in part the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's claim in so far as it concerned the damages for injury to his lands.\nIn the circumstances mentioned in the head-note, the learned trial judge dismissed the plaintiff's action in respect of the damages claimed for injury to his lands occasioned by the blasting away of the hillside for the purpose of constructing the company's roadbed on the ground that the injuries were not caused by the company, but were the consequences of the methods followed by an independent contractor. By the judgment now appealed from, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversed this decision and maintained the plaintiff's claim for the damages in question.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants.\nM. A. Macdonald for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I do not wish to enter a formal dissent, because I am not satisfied that, on the pleadings, the point with which I am concerned was properly raised. But I must say that the conclusion I reached at the argument and in which a careful examination of the evidence confirms me is that this is a case of collateral negligence by a contractor and that, if the work of blasting had been carefully proceeded with, no injurious consequences would have resulted to the adjoining proprietor.\nIt is common knowledge that, in this country, railways and other large undertakings are built by con- tractors, and that the work of excavation and blasting in connection therewith is carried on over large areas and in thickly populated centres with little inconvenience; such work cannot now be considered per se dangerous or of such a character that injury to the property of adjoining owners must be expected to arise in the natural course of its execution. I cannot find in the special circumstances of this case anything to justify the conclusion that the work was one from which mischievous consequences must arise unless preventive measures were adopted, and there was, therefore, no duty on the company to take special precautions. If, as is practically admitted here, there were two ways of carrying on this piece of work, one perfectly safe and the other dangerous, and, if the contractor chose to adopt the latter, the company is not responsible for the consequences.\nFor the general rule as to the liability of a contractor, see Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 3, page 315, No. 669, para. 2.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe principle of law illustrated by the cases cited in the judgment of Mr. Justice Irving in the Court of Appeal and applied herein by the learned judge and that court must prevail. Whether stated too broadly or not in any particular case does not dispose of the existence of the principle relied upon or the possibility of its application to any given case. And it seems applicable to the facts in this case. The appellant offered no excuse and probably had none to offer for its conduct in ignoring the principle involved. The economies involved in the operation of the contractors do not appear to me to have been as alleged only for their own benefit.\nThe fair inference, in the absence of any evidence to modify such inference, is that it was absolutely necessary for these contractors to adopt the cheap and reckless methods used to save themselves from loss when working within what was possible in that regard, on the basis of prices promised by appellant. Else why should they incur the responsibility for what they as well as appellant might have been called upon to answer for?\nPrima facie, at least, it is to be so presumed or we should have heard pretty loudly from appellant to the contrary, unless the nature of contractors or human nature, has recently changed.\nThe condition of things and of work to be done or dealt with by appellant being dangerous the appellant was bound to take some precaution, but apparently took none.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant company is a company incorporated under the provisions of the British Columbia \"Water-Clauses Act,\" ch. 190, R.S.B.C., 1897, having power inter alia to construct certain tramways. The course of one of these tramways being through the respondent's lands, the strip required by the appellant for its right-of-way was purchased from the respondent in June, 1910. At the locality in question the line follows the side of a hill and the construction of the road-bed necessitated the blasting out of the rock of which the hill is formed through the whole width of the right-of-way. The result of this operation as conducted (by the contractor to whom the work had been let) was that large quantities of rock were thrown upon the plaintiff's property in such a way as to constitute a substantial interference with his enjoyment of it. For this the court below has held the appellant company to be responsible and assessed the damages at $500.\nThere are two questions: 1st. Was the appellant company responsible for the wrongful act of its contractor? And 2ndly. Is a certain release contained in the deed of conveyance of June, 1910, from the respondent to the appellant company an answer to the respondent's claim?\nThe points of fact material to the consideration of the first question are: that in letting the contract for the construction of the road-bed the appellant company must have contemplated the use of high explosives for breaking up the rock and (owing to the fact that the blasting was to be done on a hillside immediately adjacent to the respondent's land) they must have known that in the ordinary course of things, unless proper precautions should be taken to prevent it, large quantities of rock would be thrown, as in fact happened, upon the respondent's land. It is not disputed, on the other hand, that by the exercise of proper care the contractors could have avoided the injurious consequences from which the respondent suffered. In these circumstances I can entertain no doubt that the court below rightly held the appellant company answerable for those consequences.\nUnder the provisions of the \"Water-Clauses Consolidation Act\" the appellant company had authority to construct and work this tramway. It was entitled, therefore, to make use of all necessary and reasonable measures to accomplish that object. But in doing so it was under a duty to exercise all proper care in order to avoid doing harm to others in exercising the powers conferred upon it. The company was entitled, of course, to make use of explosives in effecting the necessary excavations for the construction of its right-of-way, and in doing so, as it was acting under statutory authority, it would escape the somewhat stringent rule (in Rylands v. Fletcher[2]) which, in the absence of such authority, would have determined its responsibility for any injurious consequences arising from the use of such agencies. But while the legislative authority under which it proceeded protects it from the more rigorous rule, there arises out of the grant of that authority a correlative duty which is to employ all proper means and to take all proper care to see that, in the exercise of its powers, it does no unnecessary harm to the property of third persons. In the present case the company was exercising its powers not through its own servants but through the contractors whom it employed to construct its road-bed. That it may properly do; but it does not thereby escape responsibility for the performance of its own duty, the burden of which it necessarily undertakes when it puts in exercise the authority the legislature has conferred upon it. The beneficiary of statutory authority, such as a railway company, cannot appropriate the benefit of the powers with which the legislature has invested it without at the same time assuming full responsibility for the performance of the obligations by which its right to exercise those powers is conditioned. This is very clear law, and there ought to be no necessity for citing authority in support of it. The observations of Lindley L.J., how- ever, in Hardaker v. Idle District Council[3], at pages 340 and 342, are so apt that I cannot forbear quoting them verbatim:\u2014\nThe powers conferred by the \"Public Health Act, 1875,\" on the district council can only be exercised by some person or persons acting under their authority. Those persons may be servants of the council or they may not. The council are not bound in point of law to do the work themselves, i.e., by servants of their own. There is nothing to prevent them from employing a contractor to do their work for them. But the council cannot, by employing a contractor, get rid of their own duty to other people, whatever that duty may be. If the contractor performs their duty for them, it is performed by them through him, and they are not responsible for anything more. They are not responsible for his negligence in other respects, as they would be if he were their servant. Such negligence is sometimes called casual or collateral negligence. If, on the other hand, their contractor fails to do what it is their duty to do or get done, their duty is not performed, and they are responsible accordingly. This principle lies at the root of the modern decisions on the subject.\n* * * * * * * *\nI pass now to consider the duty of the district council in the present case. Their duty in sewering the street was not performed by constructing a proper sewer. Their duty was, not only to do that, but also to take care not to break any gas-pipes which they cut under; this involved properly supporting them. This duty was not performed. They employed a contractor to perform their duty for them, but he failed to perform it. It is impossible, I think, to regard this as a case of collateral negligence. The case is not one in which the contractor performed the district council's duty for them, but did so carelessly; the case is one in which the duty of the district council, so far as the gas-pipes were concerned, was not performed at all.\nSee also Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural District Council[4].\nThat the contractors were exercising the statutory powers of the power company cannot be disputable. Conceive an action brought against them to recover damages for injury caused by the use of dynamite upon this particular section of the line. They could not be successfully charged with responsibility under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher[5]; the answer would be that they were exercising statutory powers and were, consequently, only chargeable for negligence under the rule in Dumphy v. Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[6]. The power company and the contractors must be presumed to have settled the terms of their bargain on the footing that the contractors, in the executing of their contract, would be entitled to all the protection afforded them by the legislative authority under which the work was being carried out.\nSufficient has been said to dispose of the first point.\nThe second question ought also, I think, be answered in the sense contended for by the respondent. The words in which the release upon which the appellant company relies are not apt to cover, that is to say, they do not necessarily cover, claims based upon a charge of negligence against the company. They do, doubtless, cover all claims for compensation in respect of the loss suffered by reason of the proper exercise of the appellant company's statutory powers in respect of the construction or working of its tramway. But there is abundance of authority for holding that such general words do not afford an answer to a claim based upon such a breach of duty as that in respect of which the courts below held the appellant company to be liable.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The Court of Appeal of British Columbia, reversing Morrison J., awarded to the plaintiff $500 as damages for injury done to his land by contractors, who threw large quantities of rock upon it while blasting, in the course of constructing the defendant's railway. The defendants seek to have this judgment set aside on two grounds, viz., that these damages are covered by a release given them by the plaintiff, and that what is complained of was a deliberate, wilful and wanton act of independent contractors for which the defendants are not responsible.\nThe defendants acquired a strip of land through the plaintiff's farm for their right-of-way. The release, which is found in the conveyance of this strip, was given for damages to which the plaintiff might be or become entitled by reason of the taking of this land, the severance of his farm and the construction and operation of the defendant's railway in the ordinary manner and with due care. The general language in which it is couched must be given a construction which will restrict its application to the subject-matter that the parties had in mind when it was executed. Negligence, whether in operation or construction, was something they did not contemplate and against the consequences of which they did not intend to provide. The release does not seem to have been relied upon in the provincial courts as affecting this cause of action. This ground of appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nOn the other branch the defendant is without a finding that what is complained of was a deliberate, wilful and wanton act of the contractors. And that is not surprising, because, so far as the record discloses, this contention was not made at the trial. It is very questionable whether the evidence sufficiently supports it. Had this defence been pleaded and an issue upon it clearly raised, it is impossible to say what evidence might have been adduced by the plaintiff to meet it. He might have shown by the contractors that what they did was in the ordinary course of blasting operations such as they had undertaken and was not, as now charged, a wanton trespass; or he might have established that the contract under which the work was done contemplated its being done in the manner in which it was. No reference is made to this point in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal, which proceeded on the ground that the defendants are responsible for the failure of their contractors to take proper precautions to avoid the doing of injury, which, unless such precautions were taken, was likely to be caused in the execution of the inherently dangerous work that they undertook. If the defendants proposed to contend that this case does not fall within the well-known rule which holds proprietors responsible under such circumstances, because the injury was ascribable not to mere negligent omission, but to a wilful and wanton act of commission by the contractors, they should have alleged that fact specifically in their plea and should have clearly taken that position at the trial. They appear to have done neither. It is too late now to set up such an answer to the plaintiff's claim.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPhillips & Wood.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ogilvie & Brown.\n[1] 18 B.C.

The case stated by the police magistrate was, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cIn the matter of the Act respecting the employment of female labour in certain capacities, being chapter seventeen (17) of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912, and a certain conviction of Quong Wing thereunder made by W. F. Dunn, police magistrate in and for the City of Moose Jaw, in the Province of Saskatchewan on the twenty-seventh (27th) day of May, 1912, on the information of W. P. Johnson, chief of police in and for the City of Moose Jaw.\n\u201cCase stated by W. F. Dunn, police magistrate in and for the City of Moose Jaw under the provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada in that behalf.\n\u201cOn the twenty-first (21st) day of May, 1912, an information was laid under oath before me by the above-named W. P. Johnson for that the said Quong Wing on the twentieth (20th) day of May, 1912, at the City of Moose Jaw, in the Province of Saskatchewan, he being a Chinaman and the owner, keeper or manager of a place of business, known as the \u2018C. E. R. Restaurant,\u2019 in the City of Moose Jaw, did employ in the said restaurant, as waitresses, two white women, to wit, one Mabel Hopham and one Nellie Lane, contrary to the Act respecting the employment of white female labour in certain capacities, being chapter seventeen (17) of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912. On the twenty-seventh (27th) day of May, 1912, the said charge was duly heard before me, the said information having been first amended by striking out the words \u2018or manager\u2019 and substituting in the place thereof the word \u2018and\u2019 so as to make the information read \u2018owner and keeper\u2019 after which the said information was re-sworn, in the presence of both parties and after hearing the evidence adduced and the statements of the said W. P. Johnson and Quong Wing and their counsel I found the said Quong Wing guilty of the said offence and convicted him therefor, but, at the request of the counsel for the said Quong Wing I state the following case for the opinion of this honourable court.\n\u201cI find on the evidence:\u2014\n\u201c1. That the accused Quong Wing was born in China and of Chinese parents.\n\u201c2. That the said accused was on the date of the alleged offence a naturalized British subject.\n\u201c3. That on the twentieth (20th) day of May, 1912, the said accused was the keeper of a restaurant known as the \u2018C. E. E. Restaurant\u2019 in the City of Moose Jaw, in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\u201c4. That on the said twentieth day of May, 1912, the said accused had in his employ as waitresses in the said restaurant one Mabel Hopham and one Nellie Lane, and that the said Mabel Hopham and Nellie Lane are white women.\n\u201cThe counsel for the said Quong Wing desires to question the validity of the said conviction on the following grounds:\u2014\n\u201c1. That it is erroneous in point of law.\n\u201c2. That the said Act, chapter seventeen (17) of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912, is ultra vires.\n\u201c3. That the court had no jurisdiction.\nThe questions submitted for the judgment of this honourable court being:\u2014\n\u201c1. Whether the premises described as being the place in which the alleged white women worked is included in the Act under which the information was laid. \u201c2. Whether any offence under the said Act is disclosed.\n\u201c3. Whether the accused, being a naturalized British subject, is one of the persons prohibited by the Act from employing female labour.\n\u201c4. Whether the said Act under which the said information was laid is ultra vires.\n\u201c5. Whether the conviction was in excess of the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d\n\u201cDated at Moose Jaw, this ninth (9th) day of November, A.D. 1912.\n(Sgd.) W. F. Dunn,\nPolice Magistrate in and for the City of Moose Jaw.\u201d\nBy the judgment now appealed from, the conviction of the appellant was affirmed.\nThe issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. N. Fish K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The appellant, a Chinaman and a naturalized Canadian citizen, was convicted of employing white female servants contrary to the provisions of chapter 17 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912, and, for his defence, he contends that the Act in question is ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nIt is urged that the aim of the Act is to deprive the defendant and the Chinese generally, whether naturalized or not, of the rights ordinarily enjoyed by the other inhabitants of the Province of Saskatchewan and that the subject-matter of the Act is within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Act in question reads as follows:\u2014\n1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or save as a bon\u00e2 fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent, any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Chinaman.\n2. Any employer guilty of any contravention or violation of this Act, shall, upon summary conviction be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months.\nIn terms the section purports merely to regulate places of business and resorts owned and managed by Chinese, independent of nationality, in the interest of the morals of women and girls in Saskatchewan. There are many factory Acts passed by provincial legislatures to fix the age of employment and to provide for proper accommodation for workmen and the convenience of the sexes which are intended not only to safeguard the bodily health, but also the morals of Canadian workers, and I fail to understand the difference in principle between that legislation and this.\nIt is also undoubted that the legislatures authorize the making by municipalities of disciplinary and police regulations to prevent disorders on Sundays and at night, and in that connection to compel tavern and saloon keepers to close their drinking places at certain hours. Why should those legislatures not have power to enact that women and girls should not be employed in certain industries or in certain places or by a certain class of people? This legislation may affect the civil rights of Chinamen, but it is primarily directed to the protection of children and girls.\nThe Chinaman is not deprived of the right to employ others, but the classes from which he may select his employees are limited. In certain factories women or children under a certain age are not permitted to work at all, and, in others, they may not be employed except subject to certain restrictions in the interest of the employee\u2019s bodily and moral welfare. The difference between the restrictions imposed on all Canadians by such legislation and those resulting from the Act in question is one of degree, not of kind.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The question on this appeal is not one as to the policy or justice of the Act in question, but solely as to the power of the provincial legislature to pass it. There is no doubt that, as enacted, it seriously affects the civil rights of the Chinamen in Saskatchewan, whether they are aliens or naturalized British subjects. If the language of Lord Watson, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Union Colliery Company of British Columbia v. Bryden[2] was to be accepted as the correct interpretation of the law defining the powers of the Dominion Parliament to legislate on the subject-matter of \u201cnaturalization and aliens\u201d assigned to it by item 25 of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d I would feel some difficulty in upholding the legislation now under review. Lord Watson there said, at page 586:\u2014\nBut section 91, sub-section 25, might, possibly, be construed as conferring that power in case of naturalized aliens after naturalization. The subject of \u201cnaturalization\u201d seems, prim\u00e2 facie, to include the power of enacting what shall be the consequences of naturalization, or, in other words, what shall be the rights and privileges pertaining to residents in Canada after they have been naturalized. It does not appear to their Lordships to be necessary, in the present case, to consider the precise meaning which the term \u201cnaturalization\u201d was intended to bear, as it occurs in section 91, sub-section 25. But it seems clear that the expression \u201caliens,\u201d occurring in that clause, refers to and, at least, includes all aliens who have not yet been naturalized; and the words \u201cno Chinaman,\u201d as they are used in section 4 of the provincial Act, were, probably, meant to denote, and they certainly include every adult Chinaman who has not been naturalized.\nAnd, at page 587:\u2014\nBut the leading feature of the enactments consists in this \u2014 that they have, and can have, no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the Province of British Columbia.\nTheir Lordships see no reason to doubt that, by virtue of section 91, sub-section 25, the legislature of the Dominion is invested with exclusive authority in all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada. They are also of opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments of section 4 of the \u201cCoal Mines Regulation Act,\u201d in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects, and, therefore, trench upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nIf the\nexclusive authority on all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada\nis vested in the Dominion Parliament by sub-section 25 of section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d it would, to my mind, afford a strong argument that the legislation now in question should be held ultra vires.\nBut in the later case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[3] the Judicial Committee modified the views of the construction of sub-section 25 of section 91 stated in the Union Colliery decision. Their Lordships say, at pages 156-157:\u2014 Could it be suggested that the Province of British Columbia could not exclude an alien from the franchise in that province? Yet, if the mere mention of alienage in the enactment could make the law ultra vires, such a construction of section 91, sub-section 25, would involve that absurdity. The truth is that the language of that section does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization. It, undoubtedly, reserves these subjects for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion \u2014 that is to say, it is for the Dominion to determine what shall constitute either the one or the other, but the question as to what consequences shall follow from either is not touched. The right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization; but the privileges attached to it, where these depend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality.\nReading the Union Colliery Case[4], therefore, as explained in this later case, and accepting their Lordships\u2019 interpretation of sub-section 25 of section 91, that\nits language does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization,\nand that, while it exclusively reserves these subjects to the jurisdiction of the Dominion in so far as to determine what shall constitute either alienage or naturalization, it does not touch the question of what consequences shall follow from either, I am relieved from the difficulty I would otherwise feel.\nThe legislation under review does not, in this view, trespass upon the exclusive power of the Dominion legislature. It does deal with the subject-matter of \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d within the province, exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures, and so dealing cannot be held ultra vires, however harshly it may bear upon Chinamen, naturalized or not, residing in the province. There is no inherent right in any class of the community to employ women and children which the legislature may not modify or take away altogether. There is nothing in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d which says that such legislation may not be class legislation. Once it is decided that the subject-matter of the employment of white women is within the exclusive powers of the provincial legislature and does not infringe upon any of the enumerated subject-matters assigned to the Dominion, then such provincial powers are plenary.\nWhat objects or motives may have controlled or induced the passage of the legislation in question I do not know. Once I find its subject-matter is not within the power of the Dominion Parliament and is within that of the provincial legislature, I cannot inquire into its policy or justice or into the motives which prompted its passage.\nBut, in the present case, I have no reason to conclude that the legislation is not such as may be defended upon the highest grounds.\nThe regulations impeached in the Union Colliery Case[5] were, as stated by the Judicial Committee, in the later case of Tomey Homma[6],\nnot really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.\nI think the pith and substance of the legislation now before us is entirely different. Its object and purpose is the protection of white women and girls; and the prohibition of their employment or residence, or lodging, or working, etc., in any place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Chinaman is for the purpose of ensuring that protection. Such legislation does not, in my judgment, come within the class of legislation or regulation which the Judicial Committee held ultra vires of the provincial legislatures in the case of The Union Collieries v. Bryden(1).\nThe right to employ white women in any capacity or in any class of business is a civil right, and legislation upon that subject is clearly within the powers of the provincial legislatures. The right to guarantee and ensure their protection from a moral standpoint is, in my opinion, within such provincial powers and, if the legislation is bon\u00e2 fide for that purpose, it will be upheld even though it may operate prejudicially to one class or race of people.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the prohibition is a racial one and that it does not cease to operate because a Chinaman becomes naturalized. It extends and was intended to extend to all Chinamen as such, naturalized or aliens. Questions which might arise in cases of mixed blood do not arise here.\nThe Chinaman prosecuted in this case was found to have been born in China and of Chinese parents and, although, at the date of the offence charged, he had become a naturalized British subject, and had changed his political allegiance, he had not ceased to be a \u201cChinaman\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the statute. This would accord with the interpretation of the word \u201cChinaman\u201d adopted by the Judicial Committee in the case of The Union Colliery Company v. Bryden[7].\nThe prohibition against the employment of white women was not aimed at alien Chinamen simply or at Chinamen having any political affiliations. It was against \u201cany Chinaman\u201d whether owing allegiance to the rulers of the Chinese Empire, or the United States Republic, or the British Crown. In other words, it was not aimed at any class of Chinamen, or at the political status of Chinamen, but at Chinamen as men of a particular race or blood, and whether aliens or naturalized.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The Legislature of Saskatchewan, by chapter 17 of the statutes of 1912, intituled \u201cAn Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities\u201d enacted as follows:\n1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bon\u00e2 fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person\nwhich is followed by a penal clause under which appellant has been convicted. That conviction has been maintained by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in a judgment from which the learned Chief Justice of that court dissented.\nThe first question raised is whether or not the appellant, who is admitted to have been born in China, of Chinese parents, but was at the time of the alleged offence a naturalized British subject, falls within the Act. It is quite clear that the term \u201cany Chinaman\u201d may, in the plain, ordinary sense of the words, be so construed as to include naturalized British subjects. It is, to my mind, equally clear that, having regard to many considerations, to some of which I am about to advert, a proper and effective meaning may be given to this term without extending it to cover the naturalized British subject.\nThe Act, by its title, refers to female labour and then proceeds to deal with only the case of white women.\nIn truth, its evident purpose is to curtail or restrict the rights of Chinamen.\nIn view of the provisions of the \u201cNaturalization Act,\u201d under and pursuant to which the appellant, presumably, has become a naturalized British subject, one must have the gravest doubt if it ever was intended to apply such legislation to one so naturalized.\nThe \u201cNaturalization Act,\u201d in force long before and at the time of the creation of the Province of Saskatchewan, and ever since, provided by section 4 for aliens acquiring and holding real and personal property, and by section 24, as follows:\u2014\n24. An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations to which a natural-born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification, that he shall not, when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.\nThese enactments rest upon the class No. 25 of the classification of subjects assigned, by section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, and which reads as follows: \u201cNaturalization and Aliens.\u201d The political rights given any one, whether naturalized or natural-born British subjects, may in many respects be limited and varied by the legislation of a province, even if discriminating in favour of one section or class as against another. Some political rights or limitations thereof may be obviously beyond the power of such legislature. But the \u201cother rights, powers and privileges\u201d (if meaning anything) of natural-born British subjects to be shared by naturalized British subjects, do not so clearly fall within the powers of the legislatures to discriminate with regard to as between classes or sections of the community.\nIt may well be argued that the highly prized gifts of equal freedom and equal opportunity before the law, are so characteristic of the tendency of all British modes of thinking and acting in relation thereto, that they are not to be impaired by the whims of a legislature; and that equality taken away unless and until forfeited for causes which civilized men recognize as valid.\nFor example, is it competent for a legislature to create a system of slavery and, above all, such a system as applied to naturalized British subjects? This legislation is but a piece of the product of the mode of thought that begot and maintained slavery; not so long ago fiercely claimed to be a laudable system of governing those incapable of governing themselves.\nAgain, it may also be well argued that, within the exclusive powers given to the Dominion Parliament over the subject of naturalization and aliens, there is implied the power to guarantee to all naturalized subjects that equality of freedom and opportunity to which I have adverted. And I ask, has it not done so by the foregoing provision of the \u201cNaturalization Act\u201d?\nIt is quite clear that, if the Dominion Government so desire, it can, by the use of the veto power given it over all local provincial legislation insist upon the preservation of this equality of freedom and opportunity. It is equally clear that a casual consideration of this Saskatchewan Act might not arrest the attention of those whose duty it is to consider and determine whether or not any provincial Act should be vetoed. It might well be that, in regard to such an Act respecting aliens, those discharging the duty relative to the veto power might let it go for what it might be worth, knowing that, as to them, Parliament could later intervene; whereas other considerations might arise as to naturalized subjects and the duty to protect those naturalized be overlooked by reason of the general term used.\nIt may be that the guarantee which I incline to think is implied in the \u201cNaturalization Act\u201d covers the ground. If so, there is then in this Act that which, as applied to the appellant (a naturalized subject) is ultra vires the legislature.\nIf so, this conviction falls to the ground. Much stress is laid, on the one hand, upon the expression of opinion in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[8], and, on the other hand, in that in the judgment of the same court in the case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[9].\nI may observe that a decision is only binding for that which is necessary to the decision of the case and add that, perhaps, neither expression of opinion now relied upon by the respective parties hereto was actually necessary for the determination of the case. Perhaps neither decision, in itself, can be said to be conclusive by way of governing the questions to be resolved herein. But of the two the former, certainly, so far as one can gather from the report, touches more nearly or directly the point involved in the present inquiry.\nOf course, such opinions, even if obiter dicta, are entitled to that weight to be given such eminent authority. What was clearly decided in the first case was that such comprehensive language as used in the regulation in question and, I rather think, aimed chiefly at alien Chinamen, was ultra vires, and, in the other, that the political right to vote was something within the express power of the legislature to give or withhold or restrict as it should see fit. This latter point in no way touches what is raised herein.\nWith the very greatest respect, I submit that the obiter dictum, relative to the limitations of the power existent in the Dominion Parliament by virtue of the assignment to it of paramount legislative authority over the subject of \u201cnaturalization and aliens\u201d never was intended to be treated or taken in the sense now sought to be attributed to it, and, if bearing such implication, that it is not maintainable.\nCanada, for example, is deeply interested as a whole and always has been in the colonization of its waste lands by aliens expecting to become British subjects, and surely the power over naturalization must involve in its exercise many considerations relative to the future status of such people as invited to go there and accept the guarantees and inducements ottered them. To define and forever determine beyond the power of any legislature to alter the status of such people and measure out their rights by that enjoyed by the native-born seems to me a power implied in the power over \u201cnaturalization and aliens.\u201d Many incidental powers have, as something implied in the other powers, contained in the same category, been held as attached thereto or to be used as part thereof with less excuse for the implication of incidental power there in question than would be involved in going a good deal further than I suggest in the execution of this power over \u201cnaturalization and aliens\u201d the Dominion Parliament may go.\nSome of these guarantees might depend on conventions with other powers, and I should hesitate to hamper the exercise of the power by any such limitations thereon as a provincial legislature might think fit to impose.\nThat power must be treated as the other powers categorically assigned to Parliament by section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d in a wide and statesmanlike fashion.\nAll these considerations have, in a measure, been observed in the provisions of the \u201cNaturalization Act,\u201d and in framing the provision I have quoted and other like provisions.\nNo one can, as of right, become naturalized. He must reside for three years in this country and thus become known to those who have to aid in his qualifying himself by shewing that he is of good character. Unless and until he fulfil these conditions he cannot come within the class to which appellant belongs.\nThe appellant having, under the \u201cNaturalization Act\u201d (as I think fair to infer) become a British subject, he has presumably been certified to as a man of good character and enjoying the assurance, conveyed in section thereof which I have quoted, of equal treatment with other British subjects, I shall not willingly impute an intention to the legislature to violate that assurance by this legislation specially aimed at his fellow-countrymen in origin. Indeed, in a piece of legislation alleged to have been promoted in the interests of morality, it would seem a strange thing to find it founded upon a breach of good faith. which lies at the root of nearly all morality worth bothering one's head about.\nHaving regard to all the foregoing Considerations and the farther -consideration that this it a. penal statute and, therefore, to be read and construed at-. cording to the principle applicable to such like statutes, I think this is one of the relatively few instances in which we can depart from the cardinal rule of interpreting all documents, including statutes, according to the plain ordinary reading of 'the language used, and, with Bowen. in Wandsworth Board of Works v. United Telephone Co. [10]; ask 'ourselves if these words so read are capable of two.. constructions and, if. so, say :\u2011\nIt is wise to adopt such a construction as is based upon the assumption that Parliament merely intended to give so much power as was necessary for carrying out the objects of the Act, and not to give any unnecessary powers.\nOr say, with Keating J., in Boon v. Howard (in-1874)[11], at page 308.:\u2014 .\nIf the words are susceptible of a reasonable and also of an un\u00adreasonable construction, the former construction must prevail\nOther like cases are collected in Hardeastle : (3 ed.), at pages 174 et seq.\nLooked at from this point of view I. am constrained to think that this Act must be construed as applicable only to those Chinamen who have not become natural\u00adized British subjects, and is not applicable to the ap\u00adpellant who has become such. Whether it is .ultra vires or intra vires the alien Chinamen is a question with which, in this view, I have nothing to do.\nYet, in deference to the 'argument put forward in way of so interpreting the \"British North America Act\" that the reservation to Parliament at the end of .section 91 of the powers enumerated in said section .91 must apply . only in its limitation to item number 16 of section 92, instead of as usually construed, so far as necessary to each' and all of the enumerated powers given by that section, I may be permitted to .say that I wholly dissent from the view put forward. I look upon the powers given Parliament in the twenty-nine enumerated classes set forth in section 91, so far as necessary to 'give efficacy thereto, as paramount to anything contained else-where as in section:92.\nSubject thereto, and some other special powers given Parliament, .the powers given the legislatures are exclusive and cannot be infringed upon or restricted save by the .veto power. There is, however, the possibility of legislation by a legislature being held good until Parliament asserts its powers in conflict therewith.\nUntil this relation of the powers respectively -given Parliament and the legislatures and. their order of .priority and superiority is thoroughly comprehended and acted upon, there is sure. to' be confusion in 'work\u00ading the system and that confusion invites and induces still greater confusion when the place of the residual power has to be fixed and the relation there of to these considered.\nThe maintenance of the warehouse receipts given banks by virtue 'of the \"Bank Act,\" is against legislation resting upon authority, over property and civil rights, as held in Tennant v. The Union Bank of Canada[12] illustrates how unfounded is the argument put forward. And the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Company v. The Attorney-General of Canada[13], relative to the power of a railway company to contract itself out of the provision of the \"Railway Act\" prohibiting such a contract with its employees, is another illustration of how the law of a province, quite good till Parliament asserted its power, by virtue of section 91, subsection 29, must bend before such assertion of superior power.\nThe fact that Parliament has, in regard to naturalization, intervened, has much weight with me in reaching the conclusion I have as a reason why the legislature must not be presumed to have decided to ignore what is enacted by Parliament.\nI am by no means to be held as deciding the effect of that legislation by Parliament. All I say, in way of deciding herein, is that \u2022until, in such case, the legislature makes it clear that it intended to question the effect of that legislation, I need go no further than say it has not clearly expressed its intention to assert and exercise such a doubtful right.\nIt is an attempt to cover and classify by an ambiguous term the case of a man who is in truth and fact what the term used clearly implies, and may return home any day, with that of a man who may have bid good-bye forever to his native land, induced to do so by the assurances offered him. I may add that we are not instructed as to the exact relation between China and Great Britain in regard to the position of the appellant, and, for the present purpose, that is immaterial, but I can conceive of further consideration of this sort of legislation rendering more full information necessary than this case does.\nAnd, if the like term \"Chinaman,\" as used here and in The Union Colliery .Co. v. Bryden[14], is to be read as extending to such, when naturalized British subjects, then the decision therein must bind us herein.\nI think, therefore, that this appeal should be al\u00adlowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The first question to be considered is a question of jurisdiction which was raised during the course of the argument. The appeal comes before us by leave, under section 37(c), but an order made under that provision does not conclude the question of jurisdiction which arises here. Section 36, sub-section \"b,\" provides in express terms that there shall be \"no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code.\" In the judgments of three members of the -court in Re McNutt[15], the word \"criminal,\" as it appears in section 39, sub-section \"c\" (and it is obviously used in the same sense in subsection \"a,\" section 36) was construed in the :broad sense as applying to proceedings for the punishment of offences under provincial penal enactments, which, if passed by a legislature exercising authority unrestricted as to subject-matter would, according to the general prin\u00adciples, be classified as criminal law. See pages 261, 267 and 286.\nIf these views correctly interpret the word \"criminal\" in section 39 (e), it would follow, I think, that the appeal in the present case comes within the prohi\u00adbitions of section 36 ( b ), and is incompetent.\nFor reasons, however, which I gave in full hi re McNutt[16] , I think the phrases \"criminal case\" and \"criminal charge\" in these provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" must be read in the narrow sense -there indicated, and in my view the prohibitions contained in sub-Sections \"a\" and \"b,\" of section 36, have no application to judgments in proceedings under provincial penal statutes.\nThe statute in question came into force on the 1st of May, 1912, and is in the following words:\u2011\n1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bond fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person.\n2. Any employer guilty of any contravention or violation of this Act shall, upon summary conviction, be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months.\n3. This Act shall come into force on the first of May, 1912.\nOn the 27th of May, 1912, the appellant, who was a restaurant keeper, was convicted by the police mag\u00adistrate of Moose Jaw of the offence of employing white female servants in contravention of the provisions of this Act. On the 11th of January, 1913, the Act was amended by striking out the italicized words in the last two lines of section 1, its application being thereby limited to \"Chinamen.\"\nThe appellant, at the time of the alleged offence, had been naturalized under the naturalization laws of Canada.\nThe first question .for consideration, which is the substantial question on the appeal, is whether, assuming that this. statute is not in conflict with any Act passed by the. Parliament of Canada, it is within The scope of the legislative powers of the Province of Saskatchewan.\nIt Might plausibly be contended that it is legislation in relation to any one of these. three classes of subjects : \"local undertakings,\" section 92 ( \"B.N.A. Act\"), item 10, or \"property and civil rights\" within Saskatchewan, section 92(13), or \"matters merely local\nor private\" in Saskatchewan, section 92(16). For the purposes of this judgment it may be assumed that the words \"any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement\" are not in this enactment descriptive of \"local works or undertakings\" within the meaning of section 92(10) and I shall assume further that (although the legislation does unquestionably deal' with civil rights)- the,; real purpose of it is to abate or prevent a \"local evil\" and that con\u00adsiderations similar to those which influenced the minds of the Judicial Committee in The Attorney-General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba Licence-Holders' Association(1), lead to the conclusion that the Act ought to be regarded as enacted under section 92 (16), \"matters merely local or private within the province,\" rather than under section 92 (13), \"property and civil rights within the province.\" There can be' no doubt that, prima facie, legis\u00adlation prohibiting the employment of specified classes of persons in particular occupations on grounds which touch the public health, the public \u2022 morality or the public order from the \"local and provincial point of view\" may fall within the domain of the authority conferred upon the provinces by section 92(16). Such legislation stands upon precisely the same footing in relation to the respective powers of the provinces and of the Dominion as the legislation providing for the local prohibition of the sale of liquor, the validity of which legislation has been sustained by several well-known decisions of the Judicial Committee, including that already referred to.\nThe enactment is not necessarily brought within the category of \u201ccriminal law,\u201d as that phrase is used in section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d by the fact merely that it consists simply of a prohibition and of clauses prescribing penalties for the non-observance of the substantive provisions. The decisions in Hodge v. The Queen[17], and in the Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion[18] as well as in the Attorney-General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba Licence-Holders\u2019 Association[19], already mentioned, established that the provinces may, under section 92(16) of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d suppress a provincial evil by prohibiting simpliciter the doing of the acts which constitute the evil or the maintaining of conditions affording a favourable milieu for it, under the sanction of penalties authorized by section 92(15).\nThe authority of the legislature of Saskatchewan to enact this statute now before us is disputed upon the ground that the Act is really and truly legislation in relation to a matter which falls within the subject assigned exclusively to the Dominion by section 91 (25), \u201caliens and naturalization,\u201d and to which, therefore, the jurisdiction of the province does not extend. This is said to be shewn by the decision of the Privy Council in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[20]. I think that, on the proper construction of this Act (and this appears to me to be the decisive point), it applies to persons of the races mentioned without regard to nationality. According to the common understanding of the words \u201cJapanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person,\u201d they would embrace persons otherwise answering the description who, as being born in British territory (Singapore, Hong Kong, Victoria or Vancouver, for instance), are natural born subjects of His Majesty equally with persons of other nationalities. The terms Chinaman and Chinese, as generally used in Canadian legislation, point to a classification based upon origin, upon racial or personal characteristics and habits, rather than upon nationality or allegiance. The \u201cChinese Immigration Act,\u201d for example, R.S.C., 1906, ch. 95 (sec. 2 (d) and sec. 7) particularly illustrates this; and the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin, In re \u201cThe Goal Mines Regulation Act\u201d[21], at pages 421 and 428, gives other illustrations. Indeed, the presence of the phrase \u201cother Oriental persons\u201d seems to make it clear, even if there could otherwise have been any doubt upon the point, that the legislature is not dealing with these classes of persons according to nationality, but as persons of a certain origin or persons having certain common characteristics and habits sufficiently indicated by the language used. Prim\u00e2 facie, therefore, the Act is not an Act dealing with aliens or with naturalized subjects as such. It seems also impossible to say that the Act is, in its practical operation, limited to aliens and naturalized subjects. From the figures given by the census of 1911 it appears that, while the total Chinese population of the three western provinces was about 22,000, there were about 1,700 persons born in Canada classed as Chinese, nearly all of whom would be found in those provinces; and these, of course, are natural born subjects of His Majesty. There are at this moment in Western Canada, moreover, considerable numbers of people unquestionably embraced within the description \u201cOriental persons\u201d who have come to this country from other parts of His Majesty\u2019s territorial dominions and as regards nationality stand in the same category. The Act would (giving its words their usual meaning) apply to all these; and there can be no sound reason for suggesting that they can, consistently with the objects of the enactment, be excluded from the field of its operation.\nThe appellant\u2019s attack is really based upon a certain interpretation of the decision of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden[22]. Lord Watson, in delivering their Lordships\u2019 judgment, at page 587, said:\u2014\nBut the leading feature of the enactments consists in this \u2014 that they have, and can have, no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the Province of British Columbia. * * *\nThey are also of opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments or section 4 of the \u201cCoal Mines Regulation Act,\u2019\u201d in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects, and, therefore, trench upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nOf the legislation before us it would be impossible to say that \u201cit has and can have no application except to \u201cOrientals\u201d who are aliens or naturalized subjects,\u201d as I have already pointed out. It seems equally impossible to affirm that it establishes any rule or regulation at all comparable to regulations of the character described by His Lordship, viz.,\nthat these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work or be allowed to work in certain industries,\nand, lastly, it would be going quite beyond what is warranted by anything like a fair reading of the statute before us to say of it that\nit establishes no rule or regulation except a rule or regulation laying a prohibition upon aliens or naturalized subjects.\nOrientals are not prohibited in terms from carrying on any establishment of the kind mentioned. Nor is there any ground for supposing that the effect of the prohibition created by the statute will be to prevent such persons carrying on any such business. It would require some evidence of it to convince me that the right and opportunity to employ white women is, in any business sense, a necessary condition for the effective carrying on by Orientals of restaurants and laundries and like establishments in the Western provinces of Canada. Neither is there any ground for supposing that this legislation is designed to deprive Orientals of the opportunity of gaining a livelihood.\nThere is nothing in the Act itself to indicate that the legislature is doing anything more than attempting to deal according to its lights (as it is its duty to do) with a strictly local situation. In the sparsely inhabited Western provinces of this country the presence of Orientals in comparatively considerable numbers not infrequently raises questions for public discussion and treatment, and, sometimes in an acute degree, which in more thickly populated countries would excite little or no general interest. One can without difficulty figure to one\u2019s self the considerations which may have influenced the Saskatchewan Legislature in dealing with the practice of white girls taking employment in such circumstances as are within the contemplation of this Act; considerations, for example, touching the interests of immigrant European women, and considerations touching the effect of such a practice upon the local relations between Europeans and Orientals; to say nothing of considerations affecting the administration of the law. And, in view of all this, I think, with great respect, it is quite impossible to apply with justice to this enactment the observation of Lord Watson in the Bryden Case[23], that \u201cthe whole pith and substance of it is that it establishes a prohibition affecting\u201d Orientals. For these reasons, I think, apart altogether from the decision in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma[24], to which I am about to refer, that the question of the legality of this statute is not ruled by the decision in Bryden\u2019s Case(23).\nI think, however, that in applying Bryden\u2019s Case(23) we are not entitled to pass over the authoritative interpretation of that decision which was pronounced some years later by the Judicial Committee itself in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma.(24) The legislation their Lordships had to examine in the last mentioned case, it is true, related to a different subject-matter. Their Lordships, however, put their decision upon grounds that appear to be strictly appropriate to the question raised on this appeal. Starting from the point that the enactment then in controversy was prim\u00e2 facie within the scope of the powers conferred by section 92 (1), they proceeded to examine the question whether, according to the true construction of section 91(25), the subject-matter of it really fell within the subject of \u201caliens and naturalization\u201d; and, in order to pass upon that pointy their Lordships considered and expounded the meaning of that article.\nAt pages 156 and 157, Lord Halsbury, delivering their Lordships\u2019 judgment, says:\u2014\nIf the mere mention of alienage in the enactment could make the law ultra vires, such a construction of section 91, sub-section 25, would involve that absurdity. The truth is that the language of that section does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization. It undoubtedly reserves these subjects for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion \u2014 that is to say, it is for the Dominion to determine what shall constitute either the one or the other, but the question as to what consequences shall follow from either is not touched. The right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization; but the privileges attached to it, where these depend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality.\nIt was hardly disputed that if this passage stood alone the argument of the appellant must fail. But it is said that this passage is obiter and is inconsistent with and, indeed, contradictory of certain passages in Lord Watson\u2019s judgment in Bryden\u2019s Case[25], which passages, it is contended, give the true ground of the decision in that case and, consequently, are binding upon us. I have already said what I have to say as to the effect of Lord Watson\u2019s judgment; but I think this last mentioned argument is completely answered by reference to a subsequent passage of Lord Halsbury\u2019s judgment in Cunningham\u2019s Case[26], at page 157. It is as follows:\u2014\nThat case depended upon totally different grounds. This Board, dealing with the particular facts of the case, came to the conclusion that the regulations there impeached were not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.\nThat is an interpretation of Bryden\u2019s Case[27] which it appears to me to be our duty to accept.\nIt should not be forgotten that the very eminent judges (Lord Halsbury, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson and Lord Lindley), constituting the Board which heard the appeal in Cunningham\u2019s Case[28], had that case before them for something like six months after it had been very fully argued by Mr. Blake against the provincial view; and, in delivering the considered judgment of the Board, Lord Halsbury, as we have seen, examines and sums up the effect of the decision in Bryden\u2019s Case, which the courts in British Columbia had believed themselves to be following in passing upon Cunningham\u2019s Case. In these circumstances, whatever might otherwise have been one\u2019s view of their Lordships\u2019 judgment in Bryden Case, we should not be entitled to adopt and act upon a view as to the construction of item 25 of section 91 (\u201cB.N.A. Act\u201d), which was distinctly and categorically rejected in the later judgment.\nThere is one more point to be noted. Section 24 of the \u201cNaturalization Act,\u201d ch. 77, of the Revised Statuses of Canada, 1906, provides as follows:\u2014\n24. An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations, to which a natural-born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification that he shall not, when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject, unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether or not this section goes beyond the powers of the Dominion in respect of the subject of naturalization, or whether \u201cthe rights, powers and privileges\u201d referred to therein ought to be construed as meaning those only which are implied by the \u201cprotection\u201d that is referred to as the correlative of allegiance in the passage above quoted from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Cunningham\u2019s Case[29]. This much seems clear: The section cannot fairly be construed as conferring upon persons naturalized under the provisions of the \u201cNaturalization Act,\u201d a status in which they are exempt from the operation of laws passed by a provincial legislature in relation to the subjects of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d and applying to native-born subjects of His Majesty in like manner as to naturalized subjects and aliens. If the enactment in question had been confined to Orientals who are native-born British subjects it would have been impossible to argue that there was any sort of invasion of the Dominion jurisdiction under section 91 (25); and it seems equally impossible to say that this legislation deprives any Oriental, who is a naturalized subject, of any of \u201cthe rights, powers and privileges\u201d which an Oriental, who is a native-born British subject, is allowed to exercise or retain.\nAnglin J. agreed with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacCraken, Henderson, Greene & Herridge.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

Sayers v. British Columbia Electric Rway. Co. (12 B.C. Rep. 102) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Murphy J., at the trial[2], and directing that a new trial should be had between the parties.\nThe action was brought, under the \"Families Compensation Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 82, by the widow and children of the late George Trawford, deceased, to recover damages for his death, which was alleged to have been caused through the negligence of the company while he was travelling as a passenger on their tramway. As a defence to the action, the company set up a release executed by the deceased before his death discharging them from all claims which he then had against the company on account of the injuries he had sustained or which, in future, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns might have, in consequence of such injuries. The release was granted in consideration of the sum of $1,000, which was paid to deceased by the company at the time the release was executed. The answer by the plaintiffs was that the release had been obtained through fraud and misrepresentations, but they did not offer to return the money which had been paid to deceased by the company nor did they bring it into court. The personal representative of the deceased was not a party to the action. The trial judge took the case from the jury and dismissed the action because the plaintiffs had not tendered back the money nor deposited the amount in court to abide the result of the trial. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and a new trial was ordered.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants. The plaintiffs were not entitled to attack the release given by the deceased, upon the ground of misrepresentation and undue influence\u2014 (a) in the absence of any election to repudiate the settlement made by the deceased, either by him personally or by his legal representative: (b) in the absence of restitution by the deceased or his legal representative of the money paid by the company. We also contend that the plaintiffs' claim is barred by lapse of time.\nThe plaintiffs' contention is that their right of action is separate and distinct from that to which the deceased was entitled. In view of the English authorities this assertion is untenable. Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[3]; Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley[4] ; Williams v. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board[5].\nThe alleged misrepresentation and undue influence, no matter how amply proved, do not make null or void the settlement entered into by the parties. They render it voidable only. Until election to rescind it is made, it is valid and binding. Election can be made only by the deceased or by his legal personal representative. Kerr on Fraud (1910), page 9; Deposit and General Life Ins. Co. v. Ayscough[6]. A contract tainted with fraud remains valid until it is rescinded. Reese River Silver Mining Co. v. Smith[7]. There being no suggestion of any election prior to the commencement of the action, the settlement was, at that time, valid and binding; the rights of the parties must be regarded as of that date. We rely upon Lee v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[8] ; Foss v. Harbottle[9]; Clinch v. Financial Corporation[10]; Bank of Toronto v. Cobourg, Peterborough and Marmora Railway Co.[11]; Knight v. Bowyer[12], and Greenstreet v. Paris[13].\nThe plaintiffs' cause of action is barred by section 60 of the \"Consolidated Railway Company's Act\" (B.C.), 59 Vict. ch. 55. On this point we refer to Williams v. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board[14]; Markey v. Tolworth Joint Isolation Hospital District Board[15]; Kent County Council v. Folkstone Corporation[16]; City and South London Railway Co. v. London County Council[17] ; Barker v. Edger[18] ; Esquimalt Waterworks Co. v. City of Victoria[19]; British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Stewart[20].\nW. Hart-McHarg for the respondents. The \"Families Compensation Act\" of British Columbia is legislation to provide for the compensation of the families of persons killed by accident and creates an entirely new cause of action of which the person injured cannot deprive them. See Kenrick & Co. v. Lawrence & Co.[21], at page 104, per Wills J. The person injured cannot make a settlement in regard to his injuries, binding on his family, without the family's consent. We refer also to Pym v. Great Northern Railway Co.[22] ; Seward v. The \"Vera Cruz\" [23]; Blake v. Midland Railway Co.[24] ; The \"George and Richard\"[25].\nIt would appear that the legislation of British Columbia was intended to meet the difficulties arising under \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" where there might be a hostile executor, and to provide that, in a suit by the dependents, they should have all the rights and powers of the personal representative. They are, consequently, entitled to attack the release. Stewart v. Great Western Railway Co.[26]; Hirschfeld v. London, Brighton and South Coast Railway[27] ; Johnson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[28].\nAs to the effect of section 60 of the defendant com- pany's Act in regard to limitation of plaintiffs' right of action, we refer to Zimmer v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[29]; Green v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.[30]; McDonald v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.[31]. In the English cases relied upon by the appellants it is to be noted that the \"Public Authorities Act\" there in question is an Act for the protection of public authorities, whereas the defendant company's Act is a private Act only. See Parker v. London County Council[32], per Channell J., at page 504. It is submitted also that an injury to a passenger on the company's tramway does not come within the proper construction of the words used in section 60 of the Act. See Carpue v. London and Brighton Railway Co.[33]; Ryckman v. Hamilton, Grimsby and Beamsville Electric Railway Co.[34]; Sayers v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.[35]; Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[36], and Cie. pour I'Eclairage au Gaz de St. Hyacinthe v. Cie. des Pouvoirs Hydrauliques de St. Hyacinthe[37], per Strong C.J., at page 173.\nIt is submitted that the plaintiffs have an entirely new cause of action irrespective of anything that the deceased may have done; that they have all the powers an executor or administrator would have had in so far as concerns their present action; that it is not necessary for them to bring a separate action to have the release set aside, and that they are under no obligation to tender back the money paid in considera- tion of the release nor to bring it into court to abide the issue of their action.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The statute of British Columbia gives the dependent, on the death of the injured party, a right of action against the person who has caused the wrong, if, at the time of his death, the deceased had a subsisting enforceable claim. The cause of that action is the injuria or prejudice resulting to the dependent from the wrongful act. In one sense it is a new action, but the condition subject to which that right of action may be exercised being that the deceased did not receive indemnity or satisfaction during his lifetime, to that extent and in that aspect, it is a representative or derivative action. If, therefore, the action of the dependent is met by the plea of satisfaction based upon a release, that plea being destructive of his right, the dependent should be able to meet it by denying the existence of such release or by alleging that it was obtained by fraud, and that, in the latter case, the deceased did not receive a real or tangible indemnity or satisfaction for the offence or quasi-offence in question. It may well be that it will be necessary to have all the parties to the release, or their representatives, before the court on that incidental issue, but, if that be necessary, then I am satisfied that the resources of the British Columbia \"Procedure Act\" will be found quite sufficient to enable that to be done.\nI have no hesitation in saying that it would be a cruel injustice to deny the dependent an opportunity to set up and make good the allegation of fraud against a plea of satisfaction which, if upheld, is a complete bar to his other action. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin, I am of opinion that the company cannot set up as a defence to this action the plea of prescription (59 Vict. (B.C.) ch. 55, sec. 60).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by the widow and children of George Trawford who, in his lifetime, was injured by an accident on the defendants' railway. He died of his injuries on the 22nd of February, 1910. Prior to his decease, the company claimed that he had made a settlement with them for all claims in connection with the accident and that he had given them a release of all such claims. The company pleaded this settlement and release and the plaintiffs replied that it was obtained by wilful misrepresentation and fraud.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action on the grounds: First, that it could not lie without the money paid for the release being brought into court as a condition of setting it aside; and, secondly, that these plaintiffs, not suing in a representative capacity, cannot bring an action to set aside the release.\nThe Court of Appeal set aside this judgment and ordered a new trial. I agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal and, for the reasons given by them, which I do not think it necessary to re-state at any length.\nI cannot accept the contention of Mr. McHarg that the action under \"Lord Campbell's Act\" is an entirely independent one which cannot be affected by any release granted by the injured party in his lifetime. I think the authorities shew that a bon\u00e2 fide settlement may be made between the parties during the lifetime of the injured party and that, where this is reached and the injured party obtains satisfaction and grants a release of all his claims, apart from fraud, no action accrues to his widow and childen after his death. In order to give them such a right of action the injured party must himself possess it at the time of his death. If a settlement has been made between the injured party and a release obtained from him by fraud, that would not deprive him of his right of action. I see no reason whatever why, in such a case, the statutory representatives and beneficiaries of the injured man who had died should not have the right to bring their action and set up the fraud. It was conceded by Mr. Ewart that the executor, if he sued, would have that right, and I am unable to follow the reasoning that the parties for whose benefit he had the right to sue, and who themselves had a statutory right to sue in their own names in the event of the executor not doing so, should not have the same right as the executor is conceded to have in case he brought the action.\nI think these dependents and beneficiaries are, under the statute, the legal personal representatives of the deceased in respect of everything necessary to assert their rights under the statute.\nIt surely must be so or Mr. McHarg's contention must be sustained that the statutory action is one entirely and absolutely independent and not open to be defeated by any settlement made in his lifetime by the injured party.\nThe authorities are adverse to that contention which, if accepted, would practically result in the company causing the injuries being mulct in damages twice over for the same wrongful act.\nBut, that being so, I cannot accept the contention that the statutory rights of the widow and children can be defeated by a fraudulent release and that, in the event of the executor of the deceased declining to sue, their statutory action is defeated by a fraudulent release which they cannot attack.\nThen, Mr. Ewart relied strongly upon the applicability to such a case as this of the limitation upon actions brought against the company contained in the \"Consolidated Railway Company's Act,\" section 60.\nI have reached the conclusion that this contention of Mr. Ewart cannot be sustained.\nThe Act under which the plaintiffs sue, commonly known as \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" created, it is true, a new cause of action. That cause of action is given for the benefit of the dependents of the deceased, not solely because of the injuries he received, but because he died possessed of a good cause of action in respect of those injuries. In order to recover in this statutory action, not only in the words of the statute must\nthe death of a person have been caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default\nof the defendant, but such wrongful act, neglect or default must be such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof. And so I agree, under the authorities, that, if the party injured had received satisfaction in his lifetime either by a voluntary settlement with the person liable or by recovery of damages in court or otherwise, the statutory action created in favour of the dependents of the deceased person would not arise.\nThis special Act of Lord Campbell, creating a special cause of action arising by reason of the death of the person injured in consequence of such injuries, provides that such action must be\ncommenced within twelve calendar months after the death of such deceased person.\nThe limitation clause in the company's Act, of 1906, provides that\nall actions or suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway or the works or operations of the company shall be commenced within six months next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained.\nI do not think such a general clause can be held to repeal the special limitation clause of \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" the action under which arises not alone as a consequence of the damages sustained by reason of the railway or the works or operations of the company, but by reason of the death of the injured person having, at the time of his death, a good cause of action. I agree with the court of British Columbia, in Green v. British Columbia Electric Co.[38], that a special Act creating a special cause of action and making special provisions as to the time within which it is to be brought is not repealed by a general limitation clause passed for the benefit of a private corporation. A technical construction of the two limitation clauses which could produce such a result would bar very many actions of dependent widows and children who may not have been guilty of any neglect or delay in asserting their statutory rights which only arise on and because of the death of the uncompensated injured party. Many such deaths of injured parties may not take place within six months of the injury received and, as to all these cases, the maintenance of such a contention would be tantamount to a repeal of the Act.\nThe general limitation in the company's Act has reference only to\nactions or suits for indemnity for damage or injury sustained by reason of the railway or the works or operations of the company,\nand such action would arise as soon as the injury was sustained.\nBut the damages sought to be recovered in this action only arise as and when death follows from the injuries and may be more than six months after such injuries.\nThen, the appellants submit that, even if fraud was proved, the alleged settlement and release would not necessarily be null and void, but voidable only, and could only become void on the election of the deceased or his personal representatives. The important question Mr. Ewart suggested is not whether they have a right to sue for injuries sustained by the deceased, but whether they have a right to elect to rescind an agreement made by him.\nSubstantially, the submission of the company is that, assuming the alleged settlement to have been a fraudulent one, the company cannot be restrained from setting it up as against the claim of the plaintiffs, there not having been rescission made in his lifetime by the injured man or by his executor after his death. It seems to me the proposition contains its own refutation as it amounts to saying that a fraudulent release can be set up as a bar to defeat the statutory claim of the widow and children.\nI have no doubt that such an unjust and inequitable result cannot be supported and that the Court of Appeal in so holding was right. For the purpose of maintaining their statutory right of action the widow and children of an injured person who is dead may be considered as the statutory representatives of such party, and, as such, they have a right to attack a release obtained from him in his lifetime and which is being set up as a bar to their actions on the ground that it is fraudulent. The High Court, having the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the Court of Chancery, in the words of Sir William James L.J., in Lee v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co.[39],\u2014\nshould not relinquish its jurisdiction to deal with a case of fraud, but should say that the company was not to be entitled to use at all, for any purpose or under any circumstances, the document which has been obtained in that way.\nThe question what, if any, portion of the money paid to the injured party in his lifetime might be set off against the claim of the widow and children seems to me one which must, in each case, be left to the court and jury trying the case. It may well be that the amount so paid was solely for the actual medical and other expenses incurred by the injured party and for damages for the pain and suffering he endured, and for the actual loss of his time while injured, none of which would be recoverable in the action brought by the widow and children. In such a case, no part of such moneys should either be returned to the defendants or allowed for in estimating the pecuniary damages these statutory claimants were entitled to recover. In other cases, the moneys paid might be taken into consideration, in whole or in part, in estimating the damages, the test being whether or not they were recoverable in the statutory action. In each case it must be left to the court or the jury assessing the damages to determine on the facts as proved.\nIt seems to me that this must be the proper course to be followed. If not, Mr. Ewart's argument must prevail that the statutory action, when brought by the widow and children on their own behalf, may be defeated by the plea and proof of a release which could be shewn by them to be a fraudulent one, or Mr. McHarg's position must be accepted that the statutory action was an entirely new and independent one, which could not be satisfied or discharged by any release given by the injured party.\nIn my judgment, neither contention should prevail, but the course I have suggested should be followed, which would ensure justice to all parties.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Two questions are raised on this appeal. The first is whether or not the family of a man who has died under such circumstances as would give them a right of action founded upon \"Lord Campbell's Act\" against the appellant are, by virtue thereof, entitled to disregard a release alleged to have been obtained from deceased by fraud, or are, notwithstanding the fraud, barred thereby from any action.\nThe next question is whether or not the limitations in one of the company's Acts, to which I will refer at length, has created a bar to the action.\nThe answer to the first question must depend upon the construction of the Act upon which the action is founded and without which there can be no action by the respondents. The action must be founded upon and within the following terms of the Act.\nThat whensoever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default and the act, neglect or default is such as would (if death had not ensured) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured.\nI must ask to be permitted to pass by much learning, heretofore and in this case, expended upon efforts to determine the knotty questions of whether it is or is not a new action or only one that the deceased had or might, but for his death, have had, yet enlarged, by the results of his death, in its consequences upon the pecuniary fortunes, or deprivation of pecuniary fortune, thereby wrought in and upon the welfare of the members of the family concerned.\nI must read the language of this statute according to its plain ordinary meaning, and, in doing so, I discard no authority binding upon this court. There is no dispute that, but for the alleged release (or the statutory limitation relied upon), the respondents, by virtue of what happened, had become entitled to bring this action. And the whole controversy turns upon whether or not the release, even if obtained by fraud, must stand as a bar to the action. And that depends on the meaning to be given to the words\nthen the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages in respect thereof.\nIt is clear that a person who had, either in anticipation of such an accident clearly accepted the risk and consequences or has wrought his own destruction or certainly contributed thereto by his own acts causing the injury and damages, may, by his agreement, acts or conduct have thus deprived his family of any chance of invoking this statute to support an action against others, though culpable in relation to the cause of death.\nI will, for argument's sake, assume that by a release duly executed and covering the accident and the personal consequences to the husband himself, or the father of a family so stricken, he so releasing would have no action, and, hence, his wife and family would have no right of action.\nBut, if that release was obtained by fraud and, hence, was liable to be effectively repudiated by the deceased, I am unable to comprehend how or why the existence of that which was no barrier in the way of liability to him can be set up as a barrier in the way of those given by this statute an action to recover in case of any existing liability to him not that which he could have recovered for, but that which they are declared entitled to recover for as their own, by way of compensation for their pecuniary loss, as the Act has been held to mean.\nIt is said that a fraudulent transaction is not absolutely void, but only voidable, and that, in case the deceased has not repudiated the fraudulent release, it stands good. This is very plausible, but also very sophistical.\nThe inherent right of deceased to bring an action if he so willed, and not his willing it should or should not be brought, is the test which the fair meaning of the language furnishes. It is the liability of the appellant to be so called upon that is the condition precedent to the right of action of respondents. And the answer is that, if he was capable of bringing or had any right, notwithstanding what had transpired, to bring an action, then the family can.\nTheir right, in my view, no more depends upon the expression of his will or that of his representatives than upon the expression of the will of any one else.\nSome propositions of law were made in argument relative to the necessity for re-payment by one defrauded, either before or concurrently with his repudiation in order to make it effective.\nI entirely dissent from such or any like sweeping proposition in relation to the effective termination of the validity of a transaction induced by fraud.\nIts repudiation terminates its validity. There may be an infinite variety of circumstances which may induce a court of justice to impose or not impose terms upon one pursuing his right after such repudiation.\nFrom the grossest kind of wilful deceit down to the case of a dubious form of misrepresentation inducing an unfair dealing, or mere mistake, the variety or complexity of what may or may not be imposed in such cases is so almost infinite that I will not attempt to discriminate herein, where I have not the facts before me, to enable me to do so if I could. All I need say here is that finding the right to repudiate existed in deceased, then the right of respondents to insist that, in fact, the deceased could have so repudiated leaves the path open to respondents to proceed with the action given by this statute.\nWhether the doing so may be clogged with such conditions as a court would have imposed upon him must depend upon the development of the facts surrounding the giving of the release.\nIt may well be that the money he got was in the way of compensating him for his inability or lessened ability to maintain his family, and, in such case, be properly considered in this case, or it may be that the payment had no relation to any such thing, but merely that personal to himself by way of expenses and for his personal sufferings, when it might be something which did not concern the pecuniary claims of respondents which are alone in question in the action.\nI must refrain from doing more than to illustrate here what I have concluded is the nature of the right of action respondents have under the peculiar circumstances in question herein.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the respondents are entitled to proceed with the action, unless barred by the limitations in the statute which the appellant relies upon and which reads as follows:\u2014\nAll actions or suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway, or the works or operations of the company, shall be commenced within six months next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, or, if there is continuance of damage, within six months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards, and the defendant may plead the general issue and give this Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act.\nI do not think this statute of limitation applies to the claim made by the respondents. I have so frequently had to point out that a statute of limitation must, in order to be applicable to any given case, be clearly shewn to have been intended to cover the case in respect of which it is invoked, that I do not deem it necessary to repeat my views at length here.\nEvery word in the section I have just quoted can be given a plain, ordinary meaning without straining them to repeal this Act pro tanto. I can hardly imagine any legislature ever intended to repeal any part of the Act upon which respondents' action is founded, and, least of all, by such means as by use of such an enactment as this.\nOf course, if the legislation could not be given a clear, sensible meaning without involving repeal of the Act in question, it must stand repealed. We are not driven to any such alternative or subterfuge. The limitation in the \"Railway Act\" involved in the action in question in the case of the Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Robinson[40] is somewhat analogous, and we did not find the limitation there claimed applicable, though much like this, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council refused to disturb the ruling.\nThe English authorities relied on are the result of considerations that are not open to the appellant and to the application in its favour of the clause in question.\nOn the other hand, a great body of judicial interpretation in this country relative to this very section of the Act and similar Acts, and their bearing upon the Act upon which respondents rest their claim, is ranged against the ground taken by appellants, and, no doubt, has been acted upon for years in this country.\nHence, I do not think, unless imperatively driven to put another view forth, we should disturb what seems so long settled.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014 The first ground of this appeal is that the action is barred by section 60 of the Act under which the appellants' railway is operated. That section is as follows:\u2014\nAll actions or suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway, or the works or operations of the company, shall be commenced within six months next after the time when such supposed damage is sustained, or, if there is continuance of damage, within six months next after the doing or committing of such damage ceases, and not afterwards, and the defendant may plead the general issue, and give this Act and the special matter in evidence at any trial to be had thereupon, and may prove that the same was done in pursuance of and by authority of this Act.\nIn this connection there are two points: First, whether this action, which charges the appellants with causing the death of the late George Trawford, a passenger on their railway (through negligent default in their duty as carriers), is within the contemplation of this provision. That point was dealt with in Sayers v. The British Columbia Electric Co.[41], and I think it is unnecessary for me to do more than to say that, having re-considered the question, I see no reason to alter the view which was given effect to in that case.\nThe other point arises in this way. The respondents contend that, assuming section 60 to apply to an action charging default by the appellants in respect of their duty as carriers of passengers, the dependents of Trawford can, notwithstanding that section, bring their action within the limit of one year fixed by \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" That point also has been dealt with by the courts in British Columbia in Green v. The British Columbia Electric Co.[42]. I was a party to the judgment of the Chief Justice in that case, in which the opinion was expressed and acted upon that section 60 does not apply to actions brought under \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" I think that view is right, and for the reasons then given.\nThe principal ground upon which counsel for the appellants contends that the action ought to be dismissed is that the deceased George Trawford, before his death, entered into a contract with the appellants whereby, in consideration of certain sums of money (which were paid), he agreed to release the appellants from all claims for damages in respect of the negligence charged in this action; that this release has never been set aside or repudiated by Trawford or by his legal personal representatives, and that, according to the settled law as to the nature and conditions of the right of action created by \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" the subsistence of this release presents an insuperable obstacle to the respondents' success in this action. \"Lord Campbell's Act\" created a new cause of action, but, with full acknowledgments for the able argument addressed to us by counsel for the respondents upon the point, I think it must be taken as settled, for this court at all events, that it is a condition of the right of action which the statute confers upon the dependents that the victim should himself have been entitled to maintain an action, if he had lived. As Blackburn J. puts it in Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[43],\nthe intention of the enactment was that the death of the person injured should not free the wrongdoer from an action,\nor, to use the words of Lush J., in the same case,\nthe intention of the statute is to enable representatives of the person injured to recover in a case where the maxim actio personalis, etc., would have applied. Read's Case[44] was decided forty-six years ago, and the decision seems to have been treated as sound law by Lord Watson, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[45], at page 487. If, therefore, the appellants had proved at the trial that the deceased George Trawford had entered into a contract whereby, for good consideration, he had agreed to release all his claims in respect of the negligence complained of in this action, and the consideration had been paid, and the matter had ended there, that would constitute a complete defence against the respondents' claim. But, in answer to this defence, the respondents allege that the settlement relied upon was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentations and undue influence, and at a time when the deceased Trawford was ill and without legal advice. At the trial, the learned trial judge permitted the appellants to prove the execution of the document\u2014it is not under seal\u2014 by Trawford, which is in the following terms:\u2014\nI, George Trawford, do hereby declare, for the sum of $1,000 and doctor's and hospital expenses to date, which I acknowledge to have received on the execution hereof, I hereby release and acquit and forever discharge the B.C. Electric from all claims which I, my heirs, executors or administrators and assigns now have, or may in future have, by virtue of an accident happening to me on the 10th November, 1909, whereby I sustained personal injuries, without acknowledgment on their part of any liability whatever, and I further declare that said release has been read to me and I fully understand its contents.\n(Signed) GEORGE E. TRAWFORD.\n(Before two witnesses.)\nThe learned trial judge refused to allow the respondents to shew the circumstances under which this document was obtained, and, treating it as a con- clusive answer to the respondents' claim, dismissed their action. It seems, however, quite clear to me that if it should appear from the evidence\u2014it is, of course, a question of fact\u2014that Trawford really did agree with the appellants to accept the sum mentioned in full satisfaction of all claims to compensation which he might have in respect of all injuries arising from the negligence in question, but that his assent, although a real assent, was obtained by fraud or by an unconscientious abuse of the opportunity which his situation afforded the appellants, then the respondents would be entitled to say in this action that as Trawford, if he had lived, could have maintained, an action against the appellants (notwithstanding the existence of the agreement thus procured), so they, likewise, are not debarred by it from claiming compensation under \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" On the other hand, if it should appear that, in fact, Trawford did not assent, that \"his mind did not go with\" that which appears upon the document, to use the language of Erle C.J., in Rideal v. The Great Western Railway Co.[46], so that there never was an agreement, then, although the appellants should be acquitted of fraud, the respondents would be equally entitled, on the same principle, to maintain their action. As to the rights of the appellants arising out of the fact that moneys were paid to Trawford\u2014that is a question which, to some extent, depends upon the facts as developed at the trial. In either of the supposititious cases above suggested, if Trawford himself had been suing, while it seems clear that, in the first case at all events, it would not have been necessary for him to bring or offer to bring the money into court, [Clough v. London and North-Western Railway Co.[47]], yet, in my opinion, the defendants would have been entitled to rely upon the document as a binding receipt for the amount in fact paid as a payment on account of the compensation to which Trawford was justly entitled. On the other hand, if it should appear that Trawford had been led to believe, by the artifices of the appellants, that this document was something other than it, in truth, was, and that the receipt he was giving was a receipt for damages only suffered down to the time when the receipt was given, then Trawford would have been entitled to maintain an action for subsequent damages without bringing the amount paid into account; for the appellants would be estopped by their conduct from alleging that the receipt was other than that which they pretended it was. In the last mentioned case, the respondents, in my judgment, would be entitled to have the amount of their compensation estimated without reference to the moneys paid. In either of the other two cases, I think the respondents' action must be subject to the same incidents as Trawford's action would have been, if he had lived\u2014to this extent, at all events, that the appellants are entitled to have the amount paid brought into account.\nThe substance of Mr. Ewart's contention at this point is that the agreement relied upon can only, at worst, be a voidable agreement which stands and must be given effect to until it is repudiated by the legal personal representatives of Trawford. It occurs to one at once that this contention is open to the obser- vation that the respondents have not had an opportunity of raising, before the proper tribunal, the question whether or not there ever was an agreement such as that alleged. But, let us assume that such an agreement was really entered into, that is to say, that the mind of Trawford was really brought to the point of assenting to such a settlement as that evidenced by the document produced; and let us also assume that the respondents are in a position to shew that this agreement was brought about by fraud or in such circumstances of unfairness as would have entitled Trawford to rescind it. It follows (I repeat) that Trawford, in his lifetime (there being no suggestion that there was any conduct of his which would have precluded him from repudiating the arrangement), could have maintained an action against the appellants in respect of the negligence upon which the present action is based. That being so, the condition of the statutory right of action is satisfied; the case is, indeed, within the express words of the statute\u2014the death of Trawford having been \"caused by wrongful act, neglect or default,\" and the act, neglect or default being such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof.\nThe only criticism Mr. Ewart attempts to make upon this application of the very words of the statute itself is this:\u2014He argues that to permit the action to proceed might be unjust to the estate of Trawford whose legal personal representatives might desire that the settlement should stand. But the only possible interest the estate could have would be to retain the benefit of that which it had received, and if justice should require that the benefit should be restored without detriment to the estate, or, in other words, at the cost of the dependents, it is for these to say whether or not they will pursue their remedy at such a price. If there is any reason to suppose that the interests of the estate are really involved, there can be no difficulty adding as a party defendant an administrator ad litem to keep an eye on these interests.\nIt might easily happen, of course, that the interests of the estate and the interests of the dependents should be far from identical, and it may very fairly be argued that the Act does not contemplate the estate being called upon to set aside a settlement for the benefit of the dependents at the cost of giving up the advantages the deceased had derived from the settlement. But, on the other hand, I see no reason to doubt that it would be within the authority, if not the duty, of the executor (the interests of the estate being properly protected) to take the necessary proceedings on behalf of the dependents, including the impeaching of any fraudulent settlement; and, if the executor refused to act or if there were no executor, I can see no reason for holding that the right of action vested in the dependents in such circumstances does not ipso jure include as one of its incidents this same right to impeach a fraudulent settlement. That seems a reasonable implication when one bears in mind that the object of the statute was to afford a way of escape from the injustice which often attended the application of the principle actio personalis, etc., according to the settled doctrine of the courts.\nANGLIN J.\u2014 The chief question in this case is whether the plaintiffs, suing under \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" are debarred from maintaining their action by a release of his claim against the defendants arising out of his injuries, given by the injured man, since deceased, in consideration of a payment of $1,000 made to him. In answer to the plea of this release, the plaintiffs reply that it was procured by fraud of the defendants, and is, therefore, not available to them as a defence. The defendants contend that, until the release is set aside, it is binding, and that only the personal representatives of the deceased can take proceedings to set it aside. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, maintain that the issue as to the validity of the release can be raised by them in this action and without the presence of the personal representatives. They also contend that the release, even if unimpeachable, is not a bar to their recovery, because their right of action under \"Lord Campbell's Act\" is new and independent and not a statutory continuance of the right of action which the injured man had. On the last point, compare Read v. The Great Eastern Railway Co.[48]; Seward v. The \"Vera Cruz\"[49], at pages 67 and 70; Pym v. The Great Northern Railway Co.[50]; Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[51] ; and Williams v. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board[52].\nI find no satisfactory ground of distinction between the extinguishment of the cause of action by the injured man by an accord and satisfaction, evidenced by a release, and its extinguishment by the recovery of a judgment upon it or the expiry of a period of limitation. If, on a proper construction of \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" it is a condition of the plaintiff's right of action that the deceased shall have had, at the time of his death, a subsisting and enforceable cause of action against the defendants, as I think the English authorities establish, a release binding on the deceased would seem to present a very formidable\u2014I think an insurmountable\u2014obstacle to the plaintiffs' recovery. It has, however, been the view of some eminent judges that the existence of a cause of action in the deceased, enforceable by him up to the time of his death, is not made a condition of the right of action given to his wife and others by \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" See Erdman v. Town of Walkerton[53], at page 456, per Burton J.A.\nBut, if the release pleaded by the defendants is voidable for fraud, it did not bind the deceased man. The defendants remained liable to him up to the moment of his death, and, in an action brought by him against the company, if they had pleaded the release, its validity could have been questioned and determined. Johnson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[54]. Apart from the objection that they do not sufficiently represent the deceased, I see no reason why the plaintiffs may not raise and require the determination in this action of the question as to the validity of the release set up by the defendants. That, I think, is the proper practice under modern procedure.\nThere is, no doubt, some anomaly in permitting the validity of a contract made by a dead man to be impugned in the absence of his personal representative. But, having regard to the nature of the right of action conferred on the wife and other benefic- iaries by \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" and to the conditions upon which that right is given, I think it essential to \"advancing the remedy\" which the statute was designed to afford that these beneficiaries should have the same right to attack a release, such as that relied upon, so far as it presents an obstacle to their maintaining their statutory action, as the deceased himself would have had if surviving. Otherwise \"the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued\" would not be \"liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured,\" although the statute declares that he shall be so liable. 9 & 10 Vict. (Imp.) ch. XCIII.\nThe release being impeached for fraud, the court, in the administration of equity, does not require that the money paid by the defendants should be refunded or brought into court as a condition precedent to the right of repudiation being asserted. Equity may be done in the action by deducting the whole of the money already paid by the company, or such part of it, if any, as may be deemed proper, from any verdict which the plaintiffs may recover.\nOn this branch of the appeal I would, for these reasons, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nI am also of the opinion that the company cannot set up as a defence to this action section 60 of ch. 55, of 59 Vict. (B.C.), which gives it the benefit of a period of limitation of six months from the doing or committing of such damage, in all actions or suits for indemnity for\nany damage or injury sustained by reason of the tramway or railway or the works or operations of the company.\nThe plaintiffs maintain that a claim for damages for personal injuries sustained in a railway accident is not within the purview of that provision. While inclining very strongly to that view, I do not rest my judgment upon it, because I am satisfied that the section invoked is not available as a defence in an action under \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" The Ontario Court of Appeal, in Zimmer v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[55], held that a similar limitation provision did not affect rights of action conferred by \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" It would be supererogatory to do more than express my respectful concurrence in the opinions there delivered by Hagarty C.J.O., and by Burton and Maclennan JJ.A., on this point. I would merely add that, if applicable to actions under \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" the provision relied upon by the appellants would entirely cut out the right of action specifically given to the widow and other beneficiaries by the amendment of 27 & 28 Vict. (Imp.) ch. XCV., in all cases where there is an executor of the deceased or an administrator to his estate, because in such cases the right of the beneficiaries to sue arises only after the expiry of six calendar months from the death of the injured person. That cannot have been intended. See, too, Green v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.[56].\nTwo English cases are cited by the appellants in support of their contention that the period of limitation given by the statute which they invoke applies to this action, rather than the period of twelve months from the death specified in \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" They are Markey v. Tolworth Joint Isolation Hospital District Board[57], and Williams v. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board[58]. Unless the former decision is to be distinguished on the grounds that the Act there invoked was a public Act, whereas that in question here is a private Act, and that the English statute was enacted for the protection of public authorities and officials, whereas that before us is for the protection of a private corporation, it would seem to be in point. But it is an opinion of a Divisional Court by which we are not bound, and, if it be not distinguishable from the case at bar, I respectfully decline to follow it.\nWilliams v. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board[59], which is a decision of the English Court of Appeal, is clearly distinguishable on the ground that, at the time of his death, the right of action of the injured person had been barred by the limitation provision of the \"Public Authorities Protection Act.\" The existence of a cause of action against the defendants by the deceased at the time of his death was there held to be a condition of the right of action conferred by \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" Here the injured man, admittedly, had a cause of action against the defendants at the time of his death, unless it had been extinguished by the accord and satisfaction evidenced by the release pleaded, of which the validity is in question.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McPhillips & Wood.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Abbott, Hart-McHarg.

VII. ch. 71, the estimation of compensation to be awarded to the owners of the lands should be made according to the value of the lands to such owners at the date of expropriation. The prospective potentialities of the lands should be taken into account, but it is only the existing value of such advantages at the date of expropriation that falls to be determined. In re Lucas and the Chesterfield Gas and Water Board ((1909), 1 K.B. 16), and Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste, (30 Times L.R. 293), followed.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The opinions of witnesses to the effect that certain values would be assigned to expropriated lands upon a comparison of those lands with other lands in the vicinity for which selling prices might he estimated in a vague way cannot be deemed evidence sufficient to establish values for the expropriated lands.\n(Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused, 20th May, 1914.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada which awarded the defendants, respondents, the sum of $18,203.72, as compensation and indemnity for the expropriation of their lands taken, under the provisions of the \u201cNational Transcontinental Railway Act,\u201d 3 Edw. VII., ch. 71, and section 198 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 37, for the purposes of the National Transcontinental Railway.\nThe circumstances of the case and the issues on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and Alfred D\u00e9sy for the appellant.\nBelcourt K.C. and Guillet K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014In this case, His Majesty, upon the information of His Attorney-General, asks that the compensation due the respondents for certain lands taken for the right-of-way of the National Transcontinental Railway be ascertained.\nThe tract of land expropriated contains sixteen acres and a fraction and forms part of lots Nos. 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 in the Township of Mailhiot, County Champlain, Province of Quebec; the amount offered as compensation by the Crown is $3,280.51, the amount claimed by the respondents is $43,688.94, and the amount of the award below is $18,203.72 with interest.\nThe total area of the five lots traversed by the line of railway, and out of which the sixteen acres in question were taken, is about 914 acres. These lots were acquired from the Crown between the year 1881 and 1903 for $274.20. The respondents purchased them for $3,211.25 in 1910 and 1911.\nThe line of railway was first located across the property in question in 1905 and it was subdivided into building lots several years afterwards.\nIn July, 1908, formal notice of expropriation was given. The question to be determined is the value of the land at the time the property was taken by the Crown.\nIn a very recent case, the Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company v. Lacoste[1], at page 294, their Lordships said:\u2014\nThe law of Canada as regards the principles upon which compensation for land taken was to be awarded was the same as the law of England, and it has been explained in numerous cases\u2014 nowhere with greater precision than in the case of In re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[2], where Lord Justices Vaughan Williams and Moulton deal with the whole subject exhaustively and accurately.\nFor the present purpose, it may be sufficient to state two brief propositions. 1. The value to be paid for is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking, not the value to the taker. 2. The value to the owner consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, but it is the present value alone of such advantages that falls to be determined.\nAnd their Lordships add further:\u2014\nThat price must be tested by the imaginary market which would have ruled had the land been exposed for sale (at the time notice of expropriation was given).\nIn railway expropriation cases, section 198 of the Act provides:\u2014\nThe arbitrators or the sole arbitrator in deciding on such value or compensation, shall take into consideration the increased value common to all lands in the locality that will be given to any lands of the opposite party through or over which the railway will pass, by reason of the passage of the railway through or over the same, or by reason of the construction of the railway, and shall set off such increased value that will attach to the said lands against the inconvenience, loss or damage that might be suffered or sustained by reason of the company taking possession of or using the said lands. 3 Edw. VII. ch. 58, sec. 161.\nIt is common ground that the lots in question are totally unfit for agricultural purposes and their bare value is very trifling. The respondents, however, contend that they are in large part well adapted for building sites, hence their claim that they should be dealt with as building lots. The value of the property for that purpose depends upon the law of supply and demand. The evidence is not, it is quite true, very satisfactory, but it establishes beyond all doubt, in my opinion, that in view of the quantity of land available, the needs of the relatively sparse population and the prospect of future industrial development, the amount awarded is out of all proportion to the present value of the land or to any advantage which it has or is at all likely to possess for many years to come.\nThe total population of LaTuque in 1905 was under 1,000. It increased to two thousand in 1908 and to four thousand in 1912. Any future increase depends admittedly upon the further development of a water-power which is in the immediate neighbourhood of the land taken. In 1911, or thereabouts, a pulp-mill was built which, when completed, will employ five or six hundred people. That is the only local industry permanently established and the possibility of further development is very remote. There is no reasonable prospect that other industries will be established there in the near future. LaTuque is the western terminus of a branch line of the Lake Saint John Railway built to serve the purposes of the pulp-mill and it is traversed by the National Transcontinental Railway, but it does not appear that any material addition to the population has resulted, or is likely to result, from the existence of those roads; on the contrary, there is some evidence produced by the respondents to shew that, by reason of the construction of the railway bridge across the river the development of the water-power has been retarded, if not permanently prevented, so that, on the whole, there is a very poor prospect of anything like a fair demand for building lots.\nThe next question is: What is the area of the land available to satisfy any demand that may reasonably be expected to arise? In addition to the 914 acres owned by the respondents there is available and open for purchase the large area, owned by the Stuart and Tessier Syndicate, more favourably situated as regards the water-power and the pulp-mill and, therefore, more attractive for places of residence for those engaged in that industry. That property has this additional advantage that the church, the convent, the school and the railway stations are all built upon it.\nIn these circumstances I find evidence that there is no considerable demand for building lots \u2014 the floating population engaged at the mill and in connection with the railways in process of construction is not likely to reside permanently in LaTuque, and the area available is far in excess of the demand. It is impossible, in my opinion, to say that, if, at the time the land was expropriated, it had been put up for sale, it could have been sold for building purposes, and, if sold at public auction in the open market, it would not have brought anything like the price awarded by the judge of the Exchequer Court.\nIt is quite true that there is evidence of the sale of some lots at six cents a foot, but I am not satisfied that these sales represent anything like the value realizable at an open, honest sale.\nIn any event, in 1908, barely three per cent, of the lots located were sold and there were in all ten to twenty small houses built on them.\nIf one compares the prices at which the property held by the Stuart and Tessier Syndicate was sold, we get, I think, the only reliable evidence of value on which a satisfactory conclusion can be reached. That syndicate sold, on the 30th of January, 1908, 19 acres for $2,850, on the 20th December of the same year three acres and a fraction for $477; on the 11th of November, 1910, thirty-two acres for $4,914.60. As I have already said, these are the prices realized in the open market for land more advantageously situated than that of the respondents. On the whole, I am satisfied that the indemnity offered by the Crown was not only fair, but generous. The respondents will be recouped the whole of their original outlay and they will still have available for sale, as building lots, over 930 acres. If their previsions are realized they will have a very handsome profit out of the balance of their lands, due, no doubt, to some extent, to the existence of the National Transcontinental Railway.\nMuch reliance was placed upon the evidence of witness Bourgeois. Here is what he says:\u2014\nQ. Voulez-vous dire quelle \u00e9tait la valeur de ces terrains en mille neuf cent huit?\nR. La valeur de ces terrains-l\u00e0, ils avaient acquis plus de valeur parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait une site de ville.\nQ. Combien est-ce que \u00e7a valait dans le temps \u00e0 l\u2019arpent?\nR. Pour moi, \u00e7a ne valait pas absolument grand\u2019chose.\nQ. Donnez-nous donc un chiffre, donnez-nous donc ce que \u00e7a valait pour vous; c\u2019est ce que nous voulons savoir.\nR. Ah\u2014 \u00e7a valait . . . je ne sais pas comment les lots se vendaient. Je n\u2019ai pas demand\u00e9 combien \u00e7a se vendait, ni, quelle \u00e9tait la valeur de ce terrain-l\u00e0 \u00e0 l\u2019arpent au mois de juillet mil neuf cent huit.\nPar le Commissaire:\u2014\nSi vous n\u2019\u00eates pas capable r\u00e9pondre, dites-le.\nR. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne pas r\u00e9pondre que de lancer des chiffres sans \u00eatre capable de les appuyer.\nQ. Voulez-vous nous dire quel \u00e9tait le maximum de la valeur de ces terrains-l\u00e0 au mois de juillet mil neuf cent huit, au meilleur de votre connaissance?\nR. Pour moi, personnellement, \u00e7a valait trois \u00e0 quatre cents piastres de l\u2019arpent. I do not think that such evidence can be taken into consideration in the face of that given by Tessier, Scott and others.\nI would allow the appeal with costs on the ground that the amount offered by the Crown was full compensation for the land taken.\nIdington J.\u2014This is a most unsatisfactory case. The judgment seems to have some evidence to support it. Indeed, there can be found evidence in the case to support almost any conceivable judgment.\nYet the result seems apt to shock the ordinary man if allowing his stock of common knowledge to be brought to bear upon the evidence. It is the market price which must govern.\nTo say that the market price for a block of ninety-three lots, not to be selected by way of picking them out, but by virtue of an arbitrary line drawn directly across a survey of over two thousand such lots cut out of a recent wilderness to form part of a future city, must be measured by the prices got for isolated sales of a few single lots a year, spread over a period of years, seems to me unsound.\nYet something like this seems the process of reasoning adopted, default evidence having been directed to the purchase or possible purchase of such large blocks as is involved herein.\nThere is only one instance given in this survey of such way of looking at the matter and that is of an alleged offer for twenty lots which was refused and it affords no fair comparison with the block here in question. That block seems to have been compact and may have presented exceptional advantages which this does not, Stretching over a long space of some possibly well-situated, and of others ill-situated.\nIf, as seems likely, the whole survey is on the average no better or worse than this block in question, then it is worth four hundred thousand dollars.\nI imagine, if valued for purposes, for example say of succession duties, those concerned would be much surprised if asked to pay on such basis as adopted.\nBy comparison of this with sales made by a syndicate of a neighbouring block the price seems grossly excessive. And allowing most liberally for special collateral advantages possibly entering into that transaction, the price fixed here seems yet greatly excessive.\nIf there had happened to be an active market for these lots in respondent\u2019s survey, even if at excessive prices as result of temporary speculation when appellant\u2019s plan of expropriation declared; there would have been more ground for accepting such sales as a guide.\nIf we estimate the whole survey as worth even only a hundred thousand, instead of four hundred thousand dollars, the interest and taxes would eat up all the proceeds of sales and shew it was monstrous folly to expect to realize a profit by holding at similar prices and awaiting the building of the future city that might, in half a century hence, warrant such prices.\nOn the evidence before us, I do not think respondents have supplied a foundation for claiming any sum beyond that tendered by the Crown.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDuff j.\u2014This appeal arises out of an information exhibited in the Exchequer Court under the \u201cExpropriation Act.\u201d The lands in question comprise about sixteen acres in LaTuque, which is now a small town, on the River St. Maurice in the Province of Quebec. The lands were required for the way of the National Transcontinental Railway, and, a plan and description having been filed on the 2nd of July, 1908, it is with reference to that date that the compensation and damages are to be ascertained. The defendants advanced a claim for compensation and damages at the rate of six cents per square foot, the Government having tendered the sum of $3,280.51. The learned trial judge allowed the defendants for compensation and damages two and one-half cents per square foot \u2014 $18,203.72 in the aggregate. The Crown appeals.\nI have come to the conclusion that the amount allowed by the learned trial judge is excessive, but that the amount tendered by the Crown was insufficient. At the time in question \u2014 July, 1908 \u2014 the terminus of the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway, which had been in operation for a year, was in the locality now the Town of LaTuque. The locality had also been for some time the centre of supply distribution in connection with the construction of the National Transcontinental Railway. There were, it appears, some twenty or thirty houses in the vicinity of the property in question and there were some two thousand people \u2014 mostly living in tents \u2014 a transient population brought there largely, if not exclusively, in connection with the construction of the railway. There were no other industries then established. Rut there was a water-power on the River St. Maurice which had been acquired by the Quebec, St. Maurice and St. John Industrial Company, and arrangements had been made for the development of it, which subsequently took place, and for the establishment of a pulp-mill, which was afterwards erected and is now in operation. The locality had already attracted the attention of speculators as the probable site of a future town, and, in 1907, a syndicate (referred to throughout the evidence as \u201cthe syndicate\u201d) had purchased a considerable tract of land which lies immediately to the north of the defendants\u2019 property. The defendants\u2019 lands, which comprised parts of lots 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 of the Township of Malhiot, were granted by the Crown at various times, between 1881 and 1903, the prices paid amounting in the aggregate to $274.20. The defendants acquired lots 29 and 30 in June, 1910, for $2,000, and lots 26, 27 and 28 in the following year for $1,211.25; the total areas comprised within the five lots amounted to 914 acres. The strip which has been taken for the purposes of the railway is worthless for agricultural purposes and is capable of being used economically only as affording sites for building. In 1907, it had been surveyed and laid off in small building lots of about 50 by 200 feet. The learned judge has held that these lots had a market value which he puts at 2\u00bd cents per square foot, including in this, however, an allowance for the injurious affection of other parts of the defendants\u2019 lands not included in the part expropriated.\nI think the learned judge has fallen into some misapprehension in appreciating the evidence offered in support of the defendants\u2019 claim. The principle of compensation is, of course, well settled. It is stated very clearly in the following passage from the judgment of Moulton L.J. in Re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board[3], at page 29:\u2014\nThe principles upon which compensation is assessed when land is taken under compulsory powers are well settled. The owner receives for the land he gives up their equivalent, i.e., that which they were worth to him in money. His property is, therefore, not diminished in amount, but, to that extent, it is compulsorily changed in form. But the equivalent is estimated on the value to him, and not on the value to the purchaser.\nWhere future advantages are in question, the principle to be applied is that expounded by Lord Dunedin in the Cedar Rapids Case[4]. His Lordship says, at page 294:\u2014\nFor the present purpose it was sufficient to state two brief propositions. 1. The value to be paid for is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking\u2014not the value to the taker. 2. The value to the owner consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, but it is the present value alone of such advantages that falls to be determined.\nThe point to be determined, therefore, in this case is:\u2014How much was the property worth to its owners in July, 1908, taking into account the possibilities of future use, but estimating those possibilities at their value as of that date? In considering this question it may be observed one is not entitled to exclude any value arising from the advent of the National Transcontinental Railway in so far as that should be due to causes affecting lands in the locality generally and not these lands specially. (Section 198 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d) Now, first, I think it is abundantly clear from the evidence that, in July, 1908, there was not a market for the property (as building lots) which the defendants had subdivided into lots and of which the strip in question formed a part. There is evidence of thirteen sales prior to that date. There is evidence also that the sum of $4,000 had been offered for twenty lots, situated a short distance from the line of the railway, but, on the other hand, there was available for building sites a large area of land owned by the \u201cSyndicate\u201d and various points yet remained to be settled to determine the comparative advantages of different localities. The expected population, as pointed out, would be largely an industrial population, and experience seems to shew that such a population usually establishes itself in the vicinity of the church, the school and the shops. Until these localities should be identified it was not to be expected that lots would be purchased in great numbers for building purposes. How is one, then, to ascertain what this land was worth in money to the owners of it at that time? One can only figure to one\u2019s self an imaginary purchaser in touch with all the circumstances and considering the investment of money in the purchase of land in LaTuque for the purpose of re-selling it. What, to the mind of such a purchaser, would have been a fair and reasonable price (i.e., a price justifiable in the eyes of a prudent investor) to pay for this property? Now, the evidence offered on behalf of the defendants, with the exception of the evidence shewing actual sales and the offers to which I have referred, seems to be of very little value indeed, for the purpose of determining such a question. For the presupposition on which all this evidence appears to be based is the fallacious assumption expressed in the following passage in the testimony of the Reverend E. Corbeil:\u2014\nQ. Les terrains indiqu\u00e9s au plan?\nR. En autant que dans une paroisse il y a une connaissance publique que telle terre vaut telle somme et que telle autre terre vaut telle autre somme, il y a un march\u00e9 dans la paroisse, or, je sais d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019estim\u00e9 public ce que les lots valent et je peux le dire.\nThe evidence of this witness and of witnesses of the same class as to value is given with reference to this loose conventional standard \u2014 if standard it can be called. The witnesses, in a word, are not dealing with the question of what price this sixteen acres would bring or what this sixteen acres was actually worth to the owners in money; but the price which, according to the public talk in the locality, would be assigned to these lots upon a comparison with the supposed value of other lots. That is not of much assistance in view of the facts that the number of actual purchasers was so small, that the actual demand for lots for building purposes was so limited, and that the population was of the transient character that marked the population of LaTuque in July, 1908. Moreover, the prices actually paid by the defendants themselves, in 1910, afford a strong reason for thinking that this evidence does not afford any really trustworthy guide. On the other hand, there is some ground for thinking that the prices paid to the \u201cSyndicate\u201d by the Commissioners do not represent the full value of the land purchased and there is evidence given by one of the witnesses, called and put forward by the Crown as a competent person to pass upon the value of the property, that this property could have been sold at a price of from $300 to $400 an acre. This evidence, taken together with the prices paid and offered to the defendants for particular lots or groups of lots justifies one, I think, in holding that the defendants ought to be compensated at the rate of $400 per acre \u2014 this sum to include all damages.\nAnglin J.\u2014The disposition of this case is by no means free from difficulties. The parties are very far apart in their appreciation of the value of the expropriated property and they differ radically as to the proper basis of valuation. They agree that it is the market value of the land taken at the date of the expropriation which is to be allowed: but there is the widest possible divergence of views and opinions as to what that market value was and as to how it should be estimated.\nIt is common ground that as agricultural land the property is worth little or nothing. Its value is derived entirely from the proximity of two railways and the location of the works of the Quebec and St. Maurice Industrial Company. In July, 1908, when the expropriation took place, no railway had yet been constructed into LaTuque, but the Lake St. John Railway was in course of construction and the location of the right-of-way and the situation of its terminal station were known. The water-power now used by the Quebec and St. Maurice Iudustrial Company had already been acquired by it; the approximate location of its works was well understood; but no actual work of construction was done until October, 1909. The advent of the Transcontinental Railway itself was a practical certainty (James v. Ontario and Quebec Railway Co.[5]). These facts, no doubt, gave the defendants\u2019 land a substantial value; but it was a value wholly prospective. In considering what should be the amount of compensation, these potentialities must be taken into account as such and, whatever market value they had then given to the lands expropriated must be allowed for. The owners are entitled to be treated as if bargaining with a purchaser in the market. Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste et al.[6]. Of anything which a far-seeing purchaser would take into account in estimating what he should pay for the property (subject to the provisions of section 198 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d) the owners are entitled to the benefit in fixing the value of the land for purposes of expropriation. 6 Halsbury, Laws of England, pages 36-39. No doubt, the possibilities to which I have referred were, at least to some extent, taken into account in fixing the price when the defendants bought their property; and what they paid for it, not very long before the date of the expropriation, is a material element for consideration in determining the compensation they should receive. In re Fitzpatrick and New Liskeard[7].\nThe Rev. Cur\u00e9 Corbeil says that, at one time, it was expected that the parish church would be built on the defendants\u2019 property. If that expectation had been realized, the probability of their being able to dispose of a large part of their lands as building lots would have been much greater. But the site for the church was changed, probably before July, 1908, although the precise date of the change is not made clear in the evidence.\nFor the defendants, five disinterested witnesses pledged their oaths that the defendants\u2019 land was saleable in July, 1908, as building lots at four cents per square foot, corner lots being worth six cents per square foot.\nFor the Crown, four witnesses \u2014 of whom one had comparatively slight means of knowledge and another would appear to have been not wholly disinterested \u2014deposed that the value of the lands should be estimated by the acre, and placed it at $150 per acre. Another Crown witness, Ritchie, declined to put a value on the land expropriated, and still another, Benjamin Bourgeois, city engineer of Three Rivers, when pressed by counsel for the Crown, valued it at $300 to $400 per acre. No doubt, large areas almost in the immediate neighbourhood were sold to the Transcontinental Railway and to the Quebec and St. Maurice Industrial Company at $150 an acre, but special advantages resulting to other adjacent properties of the vendors probably influenced them in making these sales. Before July, 1908, other neighbouring proprietors had sold some building lots at $200 and $300 a piece. The defendants themselves had actually sold thirteen lots at similar figures and they had refused an offer of $4,000, or four cents per square foot, for twenty lots, because corner lots were included for which they were asking six cents per square foot. But this was when it was expected that the church would be built on the defendants\u2019 property and there was much speculation as to the site of the station, shops, etc., of the Transcontinental Railway itself.\nIn 1908, the Municipality of LaTuque did not exist. There were some fifteen houses on the lower level and ten or twelve on the upper level. The first municipal election was held in 1909.\nTaking all these facts into account and weighing all the evidence, I am convinced that, at the time of the expropriation, it was not fairly to be expected that the defendants could dispose of the ninety-three lots, or of any considerable number of them, as lots for building or other purposes, within a reasonable period of time. There was not a market for them as lots and they cannot properly be said to have had a market value as such. On the other hand, taking all the facts and potentialities into consideration, I am disposed to think that the figure named by Bourgeois, a Crown witness, viz., $400 per acre, approximately represents the value of this land on an acreage basis \u2014 and that, I think, is the true basis on which their value should be estimated. If anything, $400 an acre is, perhaps, a little beyond the actual value. I allow something for compulsory purchase.\nHaving regard to the provisions of section 198 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d I think that any damage occasioned to the adjacent lands of the defendants by the construction of the Transcontinental Railway has been offset by the special advantages which these lands have derived from the immediate proximity of it. This was the opinion of the Rev. Cur\u00e9 Corbeil, a chief witness for the defendants.\nAlthough always loath to interfere with the assessment of compensation in such cases by the judge of first instance, I feel compelled, for these reasons, to reduce the award in the present instance from $18,203.72 to $6,686.40. The Crown should have its costs of appeal.\nBrodeur J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alfred Desy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Belcourt, Ritchie & Chevrier.\n[1] 30 Times L.E. 293.\n[2] [1909] 1 K.B. 16.\n[3] (1909) 1 K.B. 16.\n[4] 30 Times L.R. 293.\n[5] 15 Ont.

British Columbia Electric Railway Co., (1914) 49 S.C.R. 518\nDate: 1914-03-02\nGeorge Daynes (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe British Columbia Electric Railway Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1914: February 3, 4; 1914: March 2.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nOn Appeal From The Court Of Appeal For British Columbia.\nPractice\u2014Rejection of evidence\u2014Memorandum by witness\u2014Withdrawing case from jury\u2014New trial\u2014Negligence\u2014Operation of tramway\u2014\"Block and Staff\" system\u2014Disregard of rules\u2014Defective system.\nOn the trial of a case it is permissible for a witness to consult a copy of a memorandum respecting circumstances attending the occurrence of an accident, which was made by himself at the time, in order to refresh his memory. The refusal of the trial judge to permit him to do so is ground for ordering a new trial.\nThe trial judge is not justified in withdrawing a case from the jury on the ground that the evidence establishes contributory negligence on the part of a plaintiff unless no other conclusion can be drawn from it.\nA motorman in the defendants' employ was injured in a collision with the car ahead of that upon which he was performing his work. The company's operation rules provided that cars operated in the same direction, as \"double-headers,\" unless block signals were in use, should be kept at least five minutes apart, except in closing up at stations; also that, when the view ahead was obscured, cars should be kept under such control that they might be stopped within the range of vision, but the rule was not enforced. The plaintiff, one of the company's motormen, on a foggy night, ran his car into the rear of another car standing at the station he was entering, and sustained injuries for which he claimed damages, alleging a defective system. The defence set up contributory negligence on the part of the motorman, but made no allusion to the breach of these regulations. A judgment, entered on the verdict of the jury in favour of the plaintiff, was set aside by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the injury had resulted in consequence of the plaintiff's disregard of the rules. Held, that as the rules had not been enforced by the defendants nor set up in their pleadings they could not be relied upon in support of the charge of contributory negligence.\nJudgment appealed from (17 B.C. Rep. 498) reversed and a new trial ordered.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment entered by Hunter C.J., on the findings of the jury at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head\u2014note.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 I concur in the judgment ordering a new trial.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014 I think this appeal should be allowed with costs, save so far as the costs incidental to the appeal may have been increased by reason of the appeal seeking to resist the granting of a new trial. It does not seem to me a case where the rule applicable to divided success can be applied.\nThe rule invoked by the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal does not seem to me to have had any statutory support binding the company and its employees to observe same.\nAnd on the evidence, the rules, which are put forward as binding the appellant do not seem to have been adopted by the company. Indeed, they seem to have been so ignored by the management of the com- pany in the running of the cars in question, that respondent cannot now rely on same as binding appellant and other employees.\nThe defence set up by the pleading and particulars given thereunder makes no allusion to the breach of any such rules by respondent. The case before us, therefore, does not permit of any such defence save in so far as the rules themselves be conformable with good practice according to the recognized system of the management of the company in running the cars in question.\nThe case must be tried according to the recognized system or practice of the company in that regard and the duty which the law imposes on any such company to adopt reasonable methods of safety and, upon any one occupying such a position in the service as appellant did, to take due care in avoiding negligence so far as he reasonably could in accordance with the requirements of such a service and the discharge of his duties thereunder.\nIt would seem from what transpired at the trial as if the company's management looked upon the exchange of staffs carried by crossing cars as a sort of block system and in itself thus excluding the application of the rule invoked.\nThere is evidence to support the verdict and no such clear, unconflicting evidence to sustain the charge of contributory negligence as the proximate cause of the accident as would entitle a judge to withdraw the case from the jury and dismiss the action.\nHowever, I, with great respect, think the learned trial judge erred in rejecting the evidence tendered during the examination of the witness McCutcheon, and see no escape from directing a new trial. Under the circumstances I cannot say that there has been no miscarriage of justice resulting from such misdirection.\nThe costs of the trial should abide the event of the new trial.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think Mr. Taylor has succeeded in establishing his contention that rule 91 which was so much relied upon in the court below, was not observed by the company in the operation of the line in question. The rule in its nature seems to be one impossible to apply in its entirety to a line operated as this was. Rule 210 shews that this system required, and, indeed, it is the very basis of the system, that all trains shall move either by time-table or pursuant to special written orders. Admittedly there was no time-table, and if there were written orders they were apparently exceptional. The defence based upon the rule was obviously an afterthought. It was not set up in the pleadings and appears to have occurred to nobody until counsel for the respondents began to examine the book of rules which was put in evidence by counsel for the appellant. The question of substance appears to be whether the jury could reasonably reject the defence set up in the pleadings, and insisted on at the trial, viz., that the appellant cannot be acquitted of contributory negligence in approaching Strathcona Station without having his car under better control. I have carefully considered all the circumstances bearing upon this point. The point is a doubtful one, but on the whole I think the view of the learned Chief Justice, before whom the case was tried, is the better view, and that it was proper that the jury should be asked to pass upon the question. I do not enter into the evidence in detail because I concur with the opinion expressed by two of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the evidence of McCutcheon was improperly rejected and that on that ground there ought to be a new trial. As to the costs I think the appellant is entitled to the costs in this court, and the respondents should be entitled to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal. The costs of the former trial should abide the result of the new trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The jury was fully justified in finding that the defendants were guilty of gross negligence because of their defective system, or utter lack of system, in the operation of their railway. With great respect, the earlier part of rule 91, for breach of which the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have found the plaintiff to have been guilty of contributory negligence, cannot, in my opinion, be invoked by the defendants. The particulars of contributory negligence delivered by them make no allusion to this breach of rules. The evidence shews that rule 91 was not enforced in the practice of the company. Indeed, the methods adopted in operating their railway would seem to have made it impracticable to carry out that rule in so far as it relates to keeping trains five minutes apart. The necessary means were not provided. I rather think that if disposing of this case as a trial judge sitting without a jury I would not improbably take the view of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that the proximate cause of the accident in which the plaintiff was injured was his own failure to have his car, when coming into Strathcona Station, under proper control, having regard to his expectation that the preceding car, the \"Cloverdale,\" might still be stopping at that station, to the fact that the night was dark and foggy, the range of vision being only from eight to twenty feet at the point in question, and to the requirement of rule 91 (which, though not capable of being enforced in practice in other respects, is, in this particular merely an expression of an obligation entailed by common prudence in entering a station where it is not unlikely that another car is standing) that\nwhen the view is obscured by curves, fog, storms or other causes, they (trains) must be kept under such control that they may be stopped within the range of vision.\nBut in so dealing with the case I would be discharging the functions of a jury. I cannot say that the evidence bearing on the issue of contributory negligence is not susceptible of another view, or that any other conclusion than that reached by the learned Chief Justice would be so clearly unreasonable that it would be perverse. I am, therefore, unable to agree in the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing this action, which was necessarily based on the opinion that it should have been withdrawn by the trial judge from the jury. Prim\u00e2 facie an issue of contributory negligence is for the jury and the case must be very clear when a trial judge is justified in taking it from them on the ground that contributory negligence has been so conclusively established that no jury could reasonably find otherwise.\nBut the verdict cannot be reinstated. I agree with Martin and Irving JJ.A., that the evidence of McCutcheon was improperly rejected. In order to refresh his memory he was entitled to look at the copy of his notes, which he was prepared to verify as having been made by himself from the original which was a transcript of his stenographic report of the interview between the plaintiff and the defendant's superintendent. His evidence would have borne directly on the main issues and it is impossible to say that its rejection did not materially affect the determination of those issues. There must be a new trial.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Grant, Stocton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McPhillips & Wood.\n[1] 17 B.C.

The contract contained this provision: \u201cThe said several crossings * * shall all be maintained at the cost of the Ontario Company (junior road), and shall each always be maintained in a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable, of the Midland Company (senior road).\u201d The said bridges were to be constructed according to plans and specifications settled and approved by the chief engineer of the senior road, and if the junior failed to maintain them to the satisfaction of said chief engineer the senior could cause the necessary work to be done at the cost of the other company.\nHeld, that the obligation of the junior road was not merely to keep the crossings in good and sufficient repair in the condition they were in when the contract was made, but they could, at any time, be ordered by the Railway Board to make them fit for the heavier traffic caused by the increased business of the senior road.\nCASE stated by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada on the question of law raised by the parties.\nThe following is the case stated by the Board, omitting the portions not material on this appeal:\u2014 1. For the purpose of the construction of the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company\u2019s line (now controlled by appellants), that company entered into an agreement with the Midland Railway Company (controlled by respondents) providing for four crossings of the line of that company, three of which, under the agreement, were to be effected by means of structures built over the line of the Midland, and one (the crossing now in question), by a structure carrying the Midland track over the line of the Ontario and Quebec Railway.\n2. The following is a true copy of said agreement:\u2014\n\u201cThis deed made this twenty-first day of February, in the year of Our Lord, 1883.\n\u201cBy and between:\n\u201cThe Midland Railway of Canada, hereinafter called the Midland Company, of the first part, and\n\u201cThe Ontario and Quebec Railway Company, hereinafter called the Ontario Company, of the second part.\n\u201cWhereas the Ontario Company propose with their line to cross the lines of the Midland Company at the points and in the manner following, that is to say:\n* * * *\n\u201cThe Whitby section by an undercrossing at or near Myrtle station.\n* * * *\n\u201cAnd whereas the Ontario Company desire the Midland Company to assent to the said respective crossings, and the Midland Company is willing to do so, but only upon and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter expressed, and the performance of which forms the consideration for the said consent.\n\u201cTherefore, this deed witnesseth that in this deed the words \u2018The Ontario Company\u2019 shall mean the party hereto of the first part, and the words \u2018the Midland Company\u2019 shall mean the party hereto of the second part.\n\u201cThat in consideration of the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter contained on the part of the Ontario Company to be by the Ontario Company observed, kept, and performed, they, the Midland Company, have and by these presents do grant unto the Ontario Company, their successors and assigns forever, the easements, rights, and privileges of crossing with their railway the lines of the Midland Company as follows, that is to say:\u2014\n\u201c4. At Myrtle, on the Whitby and Port Perry section of the Midland \u2018Company\u2019s line, by an undercrossing.\n* * * *\n\u201cWith respect to the said undercrossing of the Midland Company\u2019s Whitby (section or line, it is expressly covenanted and agreed that the Ontario Company shall prepare and submit to the chief engineer of the Midland Company the detailed plans and specifications for the work to be done.\n\u201cThat these plans and the specifications for the work shall, before the work is commenced, be settled and approved by the said chief engineer of the Midland Company, and when approved by him shall be signed by him, and his signature shall be the only evidence receivable of his said approval.\n\u201cThat the whole of the material used in the work of every kind, and the workmanship, shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications, so after the execution of these presents to be settled, agreed upon, and signed, and shall be done to the entire satisfaction of the said chief engineer of the Midland Company.\n\u201cThat the said several crossings above mentioned shall all be maintained at the cost of the Ontario Company, and shall each always be maintained in a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable, of the Midland Company; and against all damage because of the construction or non-maintenance of the said crossings, and each of them, the Ontario Company shall and will save the Midland Company harmless.\n\u201cThat, if at any time the Ontario Company fail or neglect to maintain the said crossings respectively to the satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being of the Midland Company, the said last-mentioned company may cause such repairs to be made, or said maintenance to be done, as by their said chief engineer may be deemed necessary, and the cost of so doing shall, on the account therefor, certified by the said chief engineer of the Midland Company, being presented, be paid in cash.\u201d\n4. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company, in operating a steam shovel used in making betterments in its line, damaged the bridge carrying the Midland line over its tracks (the crossing in question), and on February 6th, 1913, made application to the Board for its approval of temporary false work to support the bridge.\n5. The Grand Trunk Railway Company (owning and operating the Midland Railway), then made application to the Board for an order directing the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, at its expense, to reconstruct, in accordance with stress sheet, dated 5 th March, 1913, and submitted therewith, and thereafter maintain in a good and proper condition of repair, the bridge in question (which provides the undercrossing referred to in the agreement), so that the same shall be safe for the passage thereover of the traffic on the Grand Trunk Railway. It is on this application that Order No. 19298 has been made by the Board.\n6. Under the ordinary practice of the Board, the Canadian Pacific Railway, as the junior line, would have to provide a bridge sufficient for the present proper and reasonable requirements of the Grand Trunk, as ordered by the Board.\n7. The crossing in question having, however, been constructed under the above agreement, and not under the Board\u2019s order, the issue between the parties is determined by the agreement.\nThe question reserved at the request of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for determination by the Supreme Court of Canada is:\u2014\nWhether or not, under the agreement, the obligations of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are confined to maintaining the bridge as originally constructed, irrespective of the increased requirements of traffic carried on the Grand Trunk Railway.\n8. Should the opinion of the said Court be that the liability of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company is so limited the Grand Trunk Railway Company will pay to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company the sum of Two Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($2,250), the additional cost of a bridge to carry the increased load, and one-eighth of the annual cost of up-keep.\n* * * *\nW. N. Tilley, for the appellants.\nLafluer K.C. and Chisholm K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J.\u2014The dispute in question herein turns upon the construction of the following clause in the agreement between the respective predecessors in title of the parties hereto.\nThat the said several crossings above mentioned shall all be maintained at the cost of the Ontario Company, and shall each always be maintained in a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable, of the Midland Company; and against all damage because of the construction or non-maintenance of the said crossings, and each of them, the Ontario Company shall and will save the Midland Company harmless.\nIt is the crossing that is to be maintained and evidently in perpetuity. To interpret the word \u201cmaintained\u201d (a word of varying and doubtful import) as used here we must look at the scope and purpose of the whole agreement, and bear in mind the relation of the parties to each other, and why and how that came about. We must also bear in mind that the parties must have observed and known in 1883 (what every person having to do with railway building and maintenance then knew so well) that there was a continuous tendency to increase the load and consequent strain put upon such structures as this, and we must, therefore, assume that they anticipated the possibility of reconstruction to meet such emergency.\nWhen we bear all these things in mind, I think we must conclude that the party covenanting became bound to provide against each and all such emergencies and undertook with the other to bear whatever expenses were necessary to maintain the crossing in such manner as to enable that other safely to pass over with such load as at the time and occasion of its doing so might reasonably be used in the course of its business.\nI do not think that the reference made to the manner in which other crossings were to be then executed can determine anything relative to this, or that the manner in which this one was to be constructed or the method by which the temporary agreement for executing the work was specified, can have anything to do with the matter now arising.\nThe parties were very properly trying in an amicable manner to produce by such details being inserted in the agreement what would suit the then time and occasion and be satisfactory for use for a reasonable length of time at least.\nThe time seems to have come, after thirty years of development, that the structure is no longer adapted for the service now demanded.\nOf course, we have nothing to do with the facts relative to the necessity. All that we have to do is to assume that such a necessity has arisen by reason of the increased requirements of respondent\u2019s traffic, and determine whether or not the agreement is to be interpreted and construed as an undertaking against such possible necessity.\nI think it is to be so interpreted and construed, and that the submission must be answered accordingly.\nI do not see any provision made for the costs of this appeal. Of course, if there is none or understanding relative thereto, the usual rule of costs being borne by the unsuccessful party will have to prevail.\nDuff J.\u2014There were two observations in the able argument of Mr. Tilley which I fully accept: First, that in construing an agreement of this character one should be cautious in taking for granted that the circumstances immediately surrounding the transaction give the clue to all the considerations by which the contracting parties were actuated; and exceedingly cautious also in allowing such circumstances to suggest ambiguity in clauses not otherwise difficult to construe. Second, the agreement ought to be construed as a whole\u2014in the sense that one ought not to assume that an apparently leading provision is an overruling provision. The terms of the agreement are as follows:\u2014\nThis deed made this twenty-first day of February, in the year of Our Lord, 1883.\nBy and between:\nThe Midland Railway of Canada, hereinafter called the Midland Company, of the first part, and\nThe Ontario and Quebec Railway Company, hereinafter called the Ontario Company, of the second part.\nWhereas the Ontario Company propose with their line to cross the lines of the Midland company at the points and in the manner following, that is to say:\nThe Grand Junction section of the said Midland Company\u2019s railway by an overhead bridge or crossing at or near Crookston.\nThe Nipissing section by an overhead bridge or crossing at or near Agincourt.\nThe Whitby section by an undercrossing at or near Myrtle station.\nOn the Midland section of the Midland Company\u2019s lines near Bethany, by an overhead bridge or crossing.\nAnd whereas the Ontario Company desire the Midland Company to assent to the said respective crossings, and the Midland Company is willing to do so, but only upon and subject to the following terms and conditions hereinafter expressed, and the performance of which forms the consideration for the said consent.\nTherefore, this deed witnesseth that in this deed the words \u201cThe Ontario Company\u201d shall mean the party hereto of the first part, and the words \u201cThe Midland Company\u201d shall mean the party hereto of the second part.\nThat, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter contained on the part of the Ontario Company to be by the Ontario Company observed, kept and performed, they, the Midland Company, have and by these presents do grant unto the Ontario Company, their successors and assigns forever, the easements, rights, and privileges of crossing with their railway the lines of the Midland Company as follows, that is to say: \u2014\n1. At or near Crookston on the Grand Junction section of the Midland Railway of Canada by a bridge or overhead crossing, and the space between the abutments in the clear shall be sixty feet measured on the line of the Ontario Company.\n2. On the Nipissing section of the Midland Railway, at or near Agincourt, by a bridge or overhead crossing, and the space between the abutments in the clear shall be seventy feet measured on the line of the Ontario Company.\n3. At or near Bethany, on the Midland section of the Midland Railway of Canada, by a bridge or overhead crossing, having the space between the abutments in the clear of thirty-seven feet, measured on the line of the Ontario Company.\n4. At Myrtle, on the Whitby and Port Perry section of the Midland Company\u2019s line, by an undercrossing.\nThat each of the said several overhead crossings shall be made by a good substantial bridge on the plan and such material and workmanship as the Midland Company\u2019s chief engineer shall require and approve.\nThat each of the said bridges shall be well and substantially built, and shall have a space in each case in the clear for the purposes of the Midland Company as the Midland Company\u2019s chief engineer shall require and approve.\nThat each of the said bridges shall be well and substantially built, and shall have a space in each case in the clear for the purposes of the Midland Company, of the number of feet above expressed, and in each case shall be erected, kept, and at all times hereafter maintained in a good and sufficient state of repair and at such a height above the Midland Company\u2019s line of rails as shall secure at least seven feet clear above the highest of any freight cars now or hereafter passing over the Midland Company\u2019s said lines, respectively, as provided in the statutes in that behalf, now in force, or which may hereafter be passed by competent authority in that behalf, and this shall be done at the cost and charges of the said the Ontario company.\nThat every means shall be used to protect the Midland Company\u2019s line or premises from injury or damage from the said bridges, and from any car, engine or other machinery which may use or pass over the said bridges respectively. That the said bridges or overhead crossings respectively shall be so protected and so maintained at the costs and charges of the Ontario Company that nothing can or may fall through from any of them upon the line of the Midland Company over which they severally are erected; and that the Ontario Company, in all the above respects, will use and exercise due care and diligence.\nWith respect to the said undercrossing of the Midland Company\u2019s Whitby section or line, it is expressly covenanted and agreed that the Ontario Company shall prepare and submit to the chief engineer of the Midland Company the detailed plans and specifications for the work to be done.\nThat these plans and the specifications for the work shall, before the work is commenced, be settled and approved by the said chief engineer of the Midland Company, and when approved by him shall be signed by him, and his signature shall be the only evidence receivable of his said approval.\nThat the whole of the material used in the work of every kind, and the workmanship, shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications so after the execution of these presents to be settled, agreed upon, and signed, and shall be done to the entire satisfaction of the said chief engineer of the Midland Company.\nThat, while the work is in progress, the instructions and directions of the said Midland Company\u2019s said chief engineer shall be observed, and the work shall be so managed and carried on as not to interfere with or interrupt or endanger the traffic, trains, or property of the Midland Company in passing on their said line.\nThat the said several crossings above mentioned shall all be maintained at the cost of the Ontario Company, and shall each always be maintained in a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable, of the Midland Company, and against all damage because of the construction or non-maintenance of the said crossings, and each of them, the Ontario Company shall and will save the Midland Company harmless.\nThat, if at any time the Ontario Company fail or neglect to maintain the said crossings respectively to the satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being of the Midland Company, the said last-mentioned company may cause such repairs to be made, or said maintenance to be done, as by their said chief engineer may be deemed necessary, and the cost of so doing shall, on the account therefor, certified by the said chief engineer of the Midland Company, being presented, be paid in cash.\nThat in doing the work of building such crossings, respectively, no impediment or interruption to the traffic of the Midland Company shall take place, and the whole of said work shall be done under the orders, and subject to the orders and control of the chief engineer of the said Midland Company.\nEach of the said parties hereto covenants with the other to observe, abide by, and perform the above agreement in all respects according to the spirit, true intent, and meaning thereof. In Witness Whereof the said parties hereto have to these presents set their corporate seal on the clay and year first above written.\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of\nFor the Midland. Railway of Canada,\n(Sgd.) Geo. A. Cox, President. [L.S.]\nH. W. Nanton, Secretary-Treasurer.\nFor the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company,\n(Sgd.) Edward B. Osler, President. [L.S.]\nThe principal point made by Mr. Tilley in support of the appeal is that, (as the undercrossing at Myrtle was to be constructed conformably to plans and specifications \u201csettled and approved\u201d by the chief engineer of the Midland Company, and \u201cto his entire satisfaction,\u201d) the whole duty of the Ontario Company was to maintain the undercrossing and keep it in sufficient repair and in a \u201cgood and safe state,\u201d as it was when it was passed on by that officer. That, no doubt, is a possible construction. But it is not by any means the only construction. The specific provisions with respect to the Myrtle crossing may without difficulty be read as establishing simply a condition precedent to the right of the Ontario company to cross the line of the Midland Company at that place and not as limiting, in relation to that crossing, \u201cthe subject-matter of the general provision of the contract requiring the Ontario Company to maintain all the crossings \u201cin a good and safe state so as in no way to endanger the property of the Midland Company.\u201d I think the latter is the preferable view, because, observing strictly the, cautions above indicated, (as I think they ought to be observed in construing this agreement,) both parties must be presumed to have acted in view of the probability, as the learned Chief Commissioner remarks, of the load being increased from time to time; and it is manifestly improbable that the Ontario Company could have intended that the chief engineer of the Midland Company should be under a duty to his principals requiring him to insist that the initial design and construction of the undercrossing should be sufficient to provide for any increase of load that might take place in the future; and such, obviously, would be the effect of the construction the appellants as successors to the Ontario Company now contend for. I think the more satisfactory reading of the provision last referred to is to construe the words\nshall each always be maintained in a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable, of the Midland Company\nas stipulating for maintenance according to a varying standard sufficient to permit the safe passage of traffic as the conditions of traffic over the Midland Company\u2019s line might from time to time require. I concur in the view of the majority of the Board of Railway Commissioners as expressed in the judgment of the learned Chief Commissioner.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion the scope and character of the obligation of maintenance assumed by the appellants under the agreement of the 21st February, 1883, in respect of the crossing at Myrtle, as well as the other crossings with which that instrument deals, is to be found in the provision that\nsaid several crossings above mentioned shall all be maintained at the cost of the Ontario Company, and shall each always be maintained in a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable, of the Midland Company.\nThis clause entailed in respect of the other crossings, where the right-of-way of the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company is carried over the Midland Railway, the duty of maintaining bridges adequate to bear any increased weight of the rolling stock which the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company or its lessees might see fit to use in the future; it entailed a corresponding obligation to provide and maintain a bridge at Myrtle sufficient to carry in safety such rolling stock as the Grand Trunk Railway Co. might, in meeting the requirements of future traffic, find it economically necessary or advantageous to employ on its railway. Apart from agreement there can be little doubt that the Grand Trunk Railway Co., as senior road, could have obtained an order imposing this obligation on the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company when it sought the right of crossing. It is most improbable that it was the intention of the parties by their agreement to deprive the Grand Trunk Railway Company of any benefit which it might derive from its seniority. There is nothing to indicate an intention to abandon any such advantage. Read in the light of the circumstances under which it was entered into, I think the agreement makes sufficiently clear the obligation to which the Board of Railway Commissioners have held the appellants to be subject.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The right of one railway company to cross the track of another is as undoubted as its right to cross the land of the original owner. The senior road is then entitled as the original owner to proper compensation. In this case the right to cross was secured by the junior road undertaking to maintain the four crossings mentioned in the agreement,\nin a good and safe state, and so as in no way to endanger the property, fixed or movable\nof the senior road. No compensation in money or otherwise was stipulated.\nAll those four crossings were high level. In three cases subways were to be used by the senior road and in the other case the subway was to be used by the junior road. Four bridges then were to be constructed and maintained by the junior road.\nThe appellant, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., is the successor in title of the junior road and the senior road is represented by the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nIt is pretty clear by the provisions of the contract that the parties contemplated not only the then existing requirements of the traffic, but also the reasonable improvements consistent with the good administration of a railway.\nHeavier engines and trains having required the laying of stronger bridges, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. proceeded to build them at the three crossings where their track was passing above the Grand Trunk Railway Co. But haying refused to give a similar strength to the bridge that was utilized by the Grand Trunk Railway Co., the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was ordered by the Railway Commission to do it.\nThe obligation of the junior road is to see that the crossings should always be kept in such a way that the property of the senior should never be endangered, and even in the case where the subways were utilized by the Grand Trunk Railway Co. the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. is bound to change its height if the alterations made in the size of the cars required it. The contracting parties had not in view then only the present, but also the future, and they thought that the provision of the contract was sufficiently clear to cover stronger bridges if the necessities of the traffic required it.\n\u201cMaintenance\u201d would in the ordinary sense mean \u201ckeep in repair\u201d; but it must vary according to the instrument in which it is found and the circumstances in which it has been used.\nIt was decided in the case of Sevenoaks, Maidstone and Tunbridge Railway Co. v. London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co.[1], that\nunder power to maintain a railway and works, reasonable improvements, consistent with the purpose oil the undertaking, are included.\nMr. Justice Killam in construing a contract between the Intercolonial Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. said:\u2014\nIt appears to me, therefore, that the term \u201cmaintenance\u201d was not limited to keeping the railway and works in the condition in, which they were when the contract was made; and that there was no implied condition that the railway was then in a thorough working condition for the purpose of the future traffic; and it appears to me that the parties must also have contemplated that these changes would be constantly going on, and that they were going on at the very time the contract was made\u2014as the evidence shewed to have been the fact, to the knowledge of a number of officials of the Intercolonial Railway. And it must also have been within the contemplation of the parties that the company should not wait until a portion of the line or some structure or appliance connected with it was wholly unfit for use before repairing, replacing or improving it. In a work of this kind it is necessary to anticipate and to prepare in advance, in order that it may be kept in a thorough efficient working condition. The cost of anything reasonably required for this purpose appears to me to be part of the cost of maintenance to which the Crown is bound to contribute.\nAmong the authorities cited in support of this opinion, Mr. Justice Killam cites the case of The Leek Improvement Commissioners v. Justices of the County of Stafford[2], in which Lord Esher said, at page 796:\u2014\nIt might be that if owing to the increasing traffic it became necessary to use harder stone than had been used previously to repair such a road, so as to provide a better macadamized road to meet the requirements of the traffic, the highway authority in so doing would only be maintaining the road.\nWe have a very recent case decided by the Court of Appeal in England, on the 28th of January last, Attorney-General v. Sharpness New Docks and Gloucester and Birmingham Navigation Co.[3], bearing on the question at issue in this case. By an Act passed in 1791, a company was empowered and directed to make bridges to carry highways over a certain canal. The Act provided that all such bridges should from time to time be supported, maintained and kept in sufficient repair by the company. It was held.\nthat the company was under the obligation to repair the bridges according to the standard of the traffic requirements of the present day.\nThese authorities are conclusive and, in my opinion as to the provisions of the contract, the circumstance of the case, where a junior road obtains the use of a senior road without any compensation, the fact that a railway company has no right to cross the track of another so as to impair the exercise of its franchise shews that the Grand Trunk Railway Co. had the right to require that the bridges should be of such a character as to properly carry on its business.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E. W. Beatty.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. H. Biggar.\n[1] 11 Ch. D. 625.\n[2] 20 Q.B.D. 794.\n[3] 30 Times L.R. 273.\n"

VII., c. 8, s. 7.\nThe defendants rendered financial aid to F. & N. enabling them to purchase the stock-in-trade in the possession of a dealer in Vancouver, including also a quantity of goods ordered by him, but not then delivered, a payment on account being made in cash advanced by the defendants and the balance by four promissory notes, in deferred payments, which the defendants indorsed. At the same time new stock to the amount of $2,700 was purchased by F. & N. from the defendants which was afterwards delivered to them. A bill of sale by way of chattel mortgage was then given by F. & N. to the defendants for the advances so made and to secure them against liability on the indorsements, the proviso for redemption being on payment of the amounts mentioned and also for all goods thereafter supplied by the defendants to F. & N. during the continuance of the security. The bill of sale was registered with an affidavit by the acting-manager of the defendants, at Vancouver, who therein described himself as \"secretary\" of the company, which office was also held by him. The affidavit stated that the bill of sale was made bon\u00e2 fide for valuable consideration, namely, the amounts therein mentioned, and other considerations therein set forth, but it did not state that the grantors were justly and truly indebted to the grantees in such sums. About two years later, F. & N. made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to the plaintiff and, on the same day, after the execution of the assignment, but before the assignee had taken possession, the appellants entered into posses- sion of F. & N.'s stock-in-trade by virtue of the bill of sale and refused delivery to the assignee. In an action by the assignee for a declaration that the bill of sale was void as against him and the creditors and to recover possession of the stock-in-trade,\nHeld, that the registration of the bill of sale was not effective against the assignee or the creditors as it had not been verified in conformity with the provisions of the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act,\" 5 Edw. VII., ch. 8, sec. 7. In regard to the goods supplied after the execution of the bill of sale, the onus was upon the defendants to show that there were such goods in the possession of the mortgagors at the time of the assignment for the benefit of creditors.\nJudgment appealed from (18 B.C. Rep. 487) affirmed.\nPer Duff J. (Idington, J. dubitante) \u2014The affidavit of bona fides required by section 7 of the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act,\" 5 Edw.

A. MacDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Franklin & Nixon without any substantial means of any sort arranged with appellant, a wholesale merchant company, and one Horner, carrying on business in Vancouver, to buy that business and stock in trade therein, to be paid as to half by cash advanced by appellant and as to other half by their promissory notes indorsed by appellant. It was the opportunity of selling goods that moved the appellant to entertain the proposal, and concurrent with its assenting thereto and carrying out the main purchase, a stock of new goods to the amount of $2,700 was selected and set aside in its warehouse ready to be shipped upon completion of the bill of sale now in question which was to be the security for the re-payment of said sum of $2,700 as well as for the re-payment of the money advanced and for indemnity against the indorsement for the balance of purchase of Horner's stock in trade.\nBesides this new goods purchase of $2,700 there was at the same time a pretty substantial item of goods ordered by Horner elsewhere and taken over by the new firm for which appellant indorsed and looked to the bill of sale to indemnify it. Then there were goods to be supplied from time to time by the appellant to be secured by the same bill of sale.\nFranklin & Nixon became insolvent, and on the 27th October, 1909, made an assignment to respondent under the provisions of the \"Creditors' Trust Deed Act,\" 1901, and, when he went to take possession, he was met by some one who refused to give possession, claiming to represent appellant and hold the goods by virtue of said bill of sale.\nIt is stated in evidence and not denied that the taking possession by the appellant was after the execution of the assignment. The respondent then instituted this suit to have said bill of sale set aside and declared null and void (as against respondent as assignee representing the creditors) by reason of its infringing the provisions of the \"Bills of Sales Act\" of 1905, and being so declared in such cases as therein provided. The respondent, amongst other grounds taken, set up the following provision of section 7, sub-section 1, requiring that a bill of sale set forth the true consideration\nfor which the bill of sale was given otherwise such bill of sale as against all assignees, receivers or trustees of the estate and effects of the person whose chattels, or any of them, are comprised in such bill of sale, or under any assignment for the benefit of the creditors of such person, etc., * * * shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever, so far as regards the property in or right to the possession of any chattels comprised in such bill of sale, which at or after the time of the execution by the debtor of such assignment for the benefit of his creditors, or of such purchase or mortgage as the case may be, and after the expiration of the time hereinafter prescribed shall be in the possession, or apparent possession, of the person making and giving such bill of sale, or of any person against whom the process shall have issued under or in the execution of which such bill of sale shall have been made or given, as the case may be. * * *\nI agree with the learned trial judge that on the facts above outlined \"the true consideration\" has not been set forth as required by this bill of sale. Indeed, I find it difficult to see how it can be said otherwise.\nI cannot agree with the view which the learned trial judge has taken of the case of Ex parte Popple-well; In re Storey [2], as bearing upon the omission of the $2,700 purchase and sale of new goods or the Horner guarantee.\nThese transactions do not seem to me in any sense such collateral transactions as was the premium given in the Storey Case [3] to induce the mortgagee to refrain from registering the instrument.\nIn this case the transactions in question were clearly part of what the bill of sale was made to secure and by the terms thereof would be swept in under the general provisions for redemption. The object of the legislation now in question was to enable creditors and others concerned to ascertain with reasonable accuracy, from a reading of the instrument, the extent and nature of the encumbrance.\nThis document failed sadly in executing such purpose of the legislature. Those goods covered by these transactions were, on the facts shown, comprised within the very terms of the description used in the document, but the facts were so hidden away from the observation of any one interested searching this instrument, that he could never suspect such to be the case.\nIndeed, the recitals in the document and statements therein, were calculated to mislead the closest observer.\nIt seems to me that these omissions were serious offences against the clear policy and plain meaning of the statute and render this bill of sale null and void as against the respondent,\nso far as regards the property in or right to the possession of any chattels comprised in such bill of sale, which at or after the time of the execution by the debtor of such assignment for the benefit of his creditors, or of such purchase or mortgage as the case may be, and after the expiration of the time hereinafter prescribed shall be in the possession or apparent possession, of the person making and giving such bill of sale, or of any person against whom the process shall have issued under or in the execution of which such bill of sale shall have been made or given.\nWhen we read this nullifying part of the clause attentively, it clearly destroys all pretension not only to those goods which formed part of the stock in trade bought from Horner and the omitted transactions, but also any\nproperty in or right to the possession of any chattels comprised in the bill of sale.\nI think, therefore, the elaborate argument to bring the other goods resulting from later sales and deliver- ies to the mortgagors within the class of cases where a bill of sale or chattel mortgage is of such a nature as to render it impossible to conform with the statute and, therefore, outside the statute falls to the ground.\nI cannot say that, under the very comprehensive nature of the language used, these later deliveries are not comprised in the bill of sale and in the nullification of the statute.\nIndeed, it is of the essence of the claim made to the possession of these goods that they are \"comprised in the bill of sale\" and assuredly they were sold to the mortgagors and were found to be in their \"possession, or apparent possession,\" at or after the execution of the assignment.\nIn short, under this statute, however much it may be possible to find cases of transactions which as a whole may be outside the statute and, therefore, not nullified by it, the doctrine thus involved will not help where there is a bill of sale which in its substantial parts is within the statute and a claim is made to a right of property or possession which by the express language of the nullifying part of the section we have to deal with is made null and void.\nIf the term \"personal chattels\" given by the Act a specific statutory interpretation, had been repeated in this nullifying part of the section or the general scope of the statute rendered it imperative to read the word \"chattels\" as if \"personal chattels,\" then the argument put forward might have had some force. Note also the provision covers possession \"at or after the\" execution of the assignments.\nMoreover, the facts in this case and the frame of the instrument in question show just that kind of abuse which a careful draftsman seeking to promote the remedy adopted for the evil aimed at in the legislation in question should be expected to strike at in or by the comprehensive language I have quoted.\nThe appellant's factum quotes a number of cases decided on the English Acts relative to bills of sale. None of them meet or even touch upon the interpretation of section 8 of the English \"Bills of Sale Act\" of 1878, corresponding to section 7, sub-section 8.\nThey are in fact chiefly upon the English Act, as amended by the Act of 1882, which repeals sections 8 and 20 and possibly, by implication, some other sections of the Act of 1878.\nThe amendments made in 1882 are in the direction of making the very abuse before us impossible by making the clauses substituted more direct and clearly operative.\nIf, however, the interpretation and construction I adopt is to be adhered to it would be pretty effective. It might be so severe as to be undesirable.\nAs the Act is amended this becomes, except in a few cases, purely academic. But even if my interpretation be not well founded I agree in the view taken by Mr. Justice Clement as to the onus of proof resting upon the appellant in presenting any claim to enforce the possible equitable right the appellant might have on another view of its rights.\nThe possession which the insolvents had passed by operation of law to the respondent as assignee and the duty of appellant was to have prosecuted its claim accordingly and that would in due order have involved the appellant proving its right to recover the goods.\nOf course, if appellant had got possession before the assignment an entirely different state of things might have arisen to which different principles would have been so applicable.\nMoreover, counsel who appeared for appellant before Mr. Justice Clement seemed to be quite willing at one stage to abide by his ruling whatever it might be in this regard of onus of proof if only granted a special reference enabling appellant to make good its claim as it had not.\nThe referee was bound by the direction of the learned judge and appellant cannot complain of his reporting the fact that there was no evidence to support its claim. And as it seems to be, under all the circumstances, nothing but a mere matter of procedure that is involved where no violence had been done to natural justice, I doubt if we are not bound by the jurisprudence of this court to refrain from interfering even if so disposed as to this point.\nSee the collection of authorities in note to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, ch. 139, page 2328 (annotated edition).\nI agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal relative to the affidavit. It may have been necessary to make affidavits to meet both branches of the section, but evidently it was necessary to have verified the indebtedness.\nI need not, however, pursue this inquiry further for that which was most obviously needed was discarded.\nAnd as to the capacity of the appellant's officer to make the affidavit I much doubt his right to make it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014The controversy on this appeal is between the appellants, Gault Bros., as mortgagees under a bill of sale by way of chattel mortgage, dated the 20th day of September, 1907, executed by Arthur Albert Franklin and Thos. W. H. Nixon, carrying on business in the firm name of Franklin & Nixon and George Ed. Winter, assignee for the benefit of creditors of Franklin & Nixon under a general assignment executed on the 27th of October, 1909. Gault Bros. are wholesale merchants in Montreal. Before the bill of sale just referred to was given Franklin & Nixon conceived the idea of purchasing the business of one Horner, including his stock of goods, who had been for some years carrying on business in Vancouver. It was arranged between Gault Bros. and Franklin & Nixon that Gault Bros. should supply the necessary cash and financial support to enable Franklin & Nixon to carry out this purchase. Accordingly, Franklin & Nixon became the purchasers for a certain price, of which about $9,000 was to be paid in cash advanced by Gault Bros., and an equal sum was to be paid in deferred payments of four equal instalments for which promissory notes were to be given indorsed by Gault Bros. This transaction was carried out and, as security for Gault Bros., the bill of sale above referred to was executed.\nThe dispute between the parties is whether certain goods which were in the possession of Franklin & Nixon at the time of the execution of the general assignment are validly charged by the instrumentality of the bill of sale with the mortgagors' obligation to Gault Bros., or whether on the contrary, they belong to the unencumbered assets of the grantors and are at the disposition of the assignee for the discharge of the liabilities generally. There is no dispute that the property in controversy falls within the description of the mortgaged property in the bill of sale; or that as between the parties to the instrument prior to the execution of the assignment for the general benefit of the creditors the provisions of the bill of sale applied to this property or that all the powers of the bill of sale were exercisable in respect of it by the mortgagee. The assignee contends, and effect has been given to this contention in the court below, that certain provisions of the \"Bills of Sale Act,\" 1905, essential to the valid registration of an instrument such as this were not complied with by the mortgagees and that the result of this want of legally effective registration is to invalidate the mortgage as against the assignee with respect, at all events, to all goods which were the property of the mortgagors at the time of the execution of the mortgage; and as regards after-acquired property if the mortgage be legally effective in respect of such property, the mortgagees must fail even as to that, because there is no evidence by which the court can identify the after-acquired property and segregate it from the general mass.\nThere are three statutory requirements the absence of which it is contended vitiates the registration of this mortgage; the first of the requirements being that bills of sale shall set forth the \"true consideration\" for which they are given as provided by section 7(1), and the second and third of which are two of the requirements said to be exacted by sub-section 8 of section 7 of the Act referred to. As to two of these three requirements, I entertain no doubt that the provisions of the Act have been sufficiently observed. I postpone the discussion of them until I have dealt with another of the objections which appears to me to have been made good and to which I feel it my duty to give effect. That objection is founded on sub-section 8 of section 7 and, before stating it, it will be convenient to quote that sub-section in full and also two of the provisions of the bill of sale to which it will be necessary to give attention in order to make the point of the objection perfectly clear. Sub-section 8 of section 7 is as follows:\u2014\n(8) Every bill of sale shall further be accompanied by an affidavit by the grantee, or one of several grantees, his or their agent, that the assignment is bon\u00e2 fide for valuable consideration and that the consideration is duly set forth in the bill of sale, and that it is not for the purpose of enabling the grantor to hold the goods mentioned therein as against the creditors of the grantor; or in the case of security for a debt, that the grantor is justly and truly indebted to the grantee in the sum therein mentioned, and for the express purpose of securing the payment of money justly due or accruing due; and in all cases that the bill of sale is not given for the purpose of protecting the goods and chattels mentioned therein against the creditors of the grantor, or of preventing the creditors of said grantor from obtaining payment of any claim against him; and said affidavit shall be filed along with said bill of sale, otherwise the registration of the bill of sale shall be void. This sub-section shall not apply to the bills of sale mentioned in section 5.\nThe stipulations of the bill of sale which it is necessary to consider are as follows; the first being contained in the proviso for redemption following the habendum:\u2014\nPROVIDED always and these presents are upon this express condition that if the said parties of the first part, their executors and administrators, do and shall well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto the parties of the second part or their assigns, the full sum of $9,483.86 with interest for the same at the rate of 7% per annum from the date hereof by periodical payments to the entire and uncontrolled satisfaction of the parties of the second part or in one sum at any time on demand of the parties of the second part, and do and shall pay or cause to be paid the aforesaid promissory notes at maturity or any and all renewal and renewals thereof and all interest in respect thereof and pay, indemnify and save harmless the said parties of the second part from all loss, costs, charges, damages, or expenses in respect of the said notes or any renewal thereof and do and shall pay all sums of money which shall become payable by the parties of the first part to the parties of the second part for or in respect of all goods which shall be supplied by the parties of the second part to the parties of the first part during the continuance of this security punctually when the same shall become payable according to the terms of credit given by the parties of the second part to the parties of the first part, and do and shall repay on demand all advances of money made by the parties of the second part to the parties of the first part during the continuance of these presents.\n* * * * *\nAND THE SAID PARTIES of the first part do hereby jointly and severally, for themselves, their executors and administrators, covenant, promise and agree to and with the said parties of the second part and their assigns that they the said parties of the first part, their executors or administrators or some one of them, shall and will well and truly pay or cause to be paid to their assigns the said several sums of money in the above proviso mentioned with interest for the same as aforesaid on the days and times and in the manner above limited for the payment thereof; and will pay or cause to be paid the said promissory notes or renewal or renewals thereof as aforesaid and all interest and incidental expenses to accrue thereon and indemnify the said parties of the second part from all costs, charges, damages and expenses in respect thereof and all other sums of money which may or shall be secured hereby at any time and from time to time.\nIn order to make the point quite clear, it is necessary also to quote the affidavit filed with the bill of sale which is as follows:\u2014\nI, Charles T. McHattie, of Vancouver, British Columbia, Secretary-Treasurer of the grantee in the annexed bill of sale marked A named make oath and say:\u2014\nThat I am the Secretary-Treasurer of the grantee company and am authorized to make this affidavit on their behalf.\nThat the assignment contained in the said bill of sale is bon\u00e2 fide for valuable consideration, namely, $9,483.86 and the other considerations set forth in the said bill of sale and that the consideration is duly set forth in the said bill of sale and that it is not for the purpose of enabling the grantors to hold the goods mentioned therein as against creditors of the said grantors.\nThat the said bill of sale is not given for the purpose of protecting the goods and chattels mentioned therein against the creditors of the grantors or of preventing the creditors of the said grantors from obtaining payment of any claim against them.\nSworn before me at Vancouver, British Columbia, this 21st day of September, A.D. 1907.\nH. W. C. BOAK.\nC.T. McHATTIE.\nThe objection I am now considering is this: It is said that the bill of sale in question constitutes a \"security for a debt\" within the meaning of sub-section 8 and that the affidavit accompanying the bill of sale in intended or professed compliance with that sub-section does not contain the statement that the grantor is justly and truly indebted to the grantee in the sum therein mentioned; and it is contended that in the case of such a security the affidavit in order to comply with the sub-section must contain such a statement or the equivalent of it.\nThe points to be considered are first whether this bill of sale is a security for a debt within the meaning of this provision, and secondly, assuming that to be so, whether on the true construction of this enactment it is essential that the affidavit of bona fides should contain the statement that the grantor is \"justly and truly indebted to the grantee\" in the sum mentioned as the debt to be secured.\nI confess that on the first point I do not entertain any doubt. I think that where a bill of sale is given as security for money which is owing, but payable at a future date (debitum in prasenti, solvendum in futuro), then it is to that extent a \"security for a debt\" within the meaning of this provision and I think that is shown by the words \"securing payment of moneys justly due or accruing due,\" which follow. I think, moreover, where by a bill of sale property is assigned as security for a debt, in the sense just indicated, that it is none the less a security for a debt within this enactment because it contains additional provisions which in themselves would constitute a bill of sale, but would not constitute such a security.\nThe next point is a point with which I have had a great deal of difficulty, and the conclusion I have reached, in a sense adverse to the contention of the appellants, is one that I have come to with hesitation and, I must say, with much regret in view of the fact that the result is to defeat a perfectly honest and legitimate business transaction.\nThe question is, as I have already said, whether in the case of a bill of sale given as a security for a debt this sub-section requires that the statement above quoted or its equivalent shall appear in the affidavit of bona fides. Now, the difficulties of construing this sub-section are not inconsiderable. But it seems clear enough that one admissible construction, if you regard only the verbal structure of it, is to treat the second branch as providing in one particular an alternative form of affidavit which, in the case of securities for debt, the mortgagee may at his election adopt in preference to the general form which is provided for in the earlier part of the sub-section; and I am inclined to think that is the more natural way of reading the clause as it stands. On the other hand the sub-section is capable of being read as requiring in the second branch a particular averment which is imperative in the case mentioned. After much reflection, I am convinced, however, that in construing this provision one must have regard to the legislation as it stood at the time of the passing of this Act, which is mainly a consolidating statute, and I find that under the law as it then stood in case of mortgages of this description an affidavit in the form indicated in the branch of the sub-section we are considering was essential and imperative. The rule requiring a specific averment under oath by the mortgagee of the indebtedness of the mortgagor in these cases was a rule adopted for the protection of the public; and if, in consequence of a change of policy, mortgagees in such cases were to be given the right to adopt the more general form of averment that the consideration had been truly stated (as sufficient for the protection of the public) one does not see why the more specific form should not have been altogether done away with. Reading the sub-section in light of the legislation then existing and the manifest object of it, I am forced to the conclusion that the appellants' construction must be rejected.\nOn this ground, with very great regret as I have said, I conclude that the appellant must fail in respect of all property which as being the personal chattels of the grantors at the time the mortgage was executed within the definition of the \"Bills of Sale Act\" would be affected by the provisions of that Act. We may perhaps venture to hope, however, that the case may be the subject of consideration elsewhere; and I think I ought to express my opinion upon the other points involved.\nThe two remaining objections directly based upon the \"Bills of Sale Act\" are first, that the bill of sale does not, as required by section 7, sub-section 1, set forth the \"true consideration\" for which it was given, and secondly, that the affidavit accompanying the bill of sale, was not made by the appellants or their agents as provided by sub-section 8 of section 7. The second objection may be disposed of very shortly. Mr. McHattie, who made the affidavit, described himself as the \"secretary\" of the company. At the time the affidavit was made, and at the time the bill of sale was taken, he was in point of fact exercising the powers of manager of the company. He was, indeed, de facto manager of the company. There can be no doubt that the taking of the security was within the scope of his duty as acting manager. It follows that he was within the meaning of section 7 of the Act \"manager\" * * * or other officers of the company authorized for\" the purpose of making the affidavit.\nAs to the objection that the consideration for which the bill of sale was given is not truly set forth, this objection is grounded upon the contention that, in order to comply with the statutory direction, two transactions ought to have been recited which are omitted. The two transactions are these: 1. In the month of September, 1907, Mr. Campbell, a buyer for Franklin & Nixon, purchased $2,700 worth of goods from Gault Bros. on behalf of Franklin & Nixon. These goods were purchased in anticipation of the arrangement between Gault Bros. and Franklin & Nixon, which afterwards was carried to completion, including, of course, the bill of sale. In the ordinary course, the goods would not be delivered until after the time when it was anticipated that these arrangements would be completed and the evidence is quite clear that if anything had happened to prevent these being carried out the goods would not have been sent forward and this would have been quite in accordance with the intention of the parties. The purchase was unquestionably a conditional purchase which was not to become legally effective until after the contem- plated arrangements were consummated. The other transaction was this:\u2014 Horner, whose business Franklin & Nixon were purchasing, had ordered goods which had not come into stock (with the exception of some that arrived on the very date, the 20th of September) when the bill of sale was executed. Horner was, of course, under an obligation to take these goods and pay for them. These goods would, of course, according to the general intention of the parties, which was, that Horner's business was to be transferred to Franklin & Nixon, be received by the latter and paid for by them, but Horner evidently required some more satisfactory assurance, that his obligations to the sellers would be met; and the matter was arranged by Gault Bros. guaranteeing payment of the goods.\nNeither of these transactions is specifically referred to in the bill of sale, and it is said that the failure to recite them makes the description of the consideration so imperfect as to constitute a violation of the provision of section 7(1). The trial judge rejected this contention which seems, however, to have been accepted and acted upon by Mr. Justice Irving in the Court of Appeal.\nI think the contention involves a misapprehension of the effect of the word \"consideration\" in sub-section 1. That word might, according to context and subject-matter, be, of course, read in a very large sense embracing acts and motives leading up to and influencing more or less directly the transaction in relation to which it is employed. That, I think, is not the sense in which the term ought to be interpreted here. It is used, I think, in the strict legal sense; and construing it in the strict legal sense, the \"true con- sideration\" for which the bill of sale was given must, I think, be taken to mean that which passed to the grantor or that which was suffered by the grantee as the consideration in point of law for the assuring to the grantee of an interest, in prcesenti or in futuro, in the property to which the bill of sale applies where that is the nature of the instrument or for the vesting in the grantee of some power, or authority in respect of the property affected where the instrument is in the nature of a licence or power of attorney. Construing the word \"consideration\" in this way it seems to me that this bill of sale presents no difficulty. The proviso for redemption above quoted shows that the property to which the document relates is charged with the payment of\nall sums of money which shall become payable by the parties of the first part to the parties of the second part for or in respect of all goods which shall be supplied by the parties of the second part to the parties of the first part during the continuation of this security.\nIf the goods purchased in September are to be regarded as \"goods supplied during the continuance of this security,\" and I can see no reason why they should not be so regarded, I am unable to follow the argument that the consideration for the charge thereby created is not truly stated, the consideration being measured by the value as determined by the price of the goods supplied.\nIn view of some observations that have been made I think I ought to add this:\u2014Nobody reading the recitals of this bill of sale could fail to observe that the general intention was to provide security, first for the repayment of the cash advanced by the mortgagees, next, in respect of the mortgagees' guarantees in connection with the purchase, and thirdly, for pay- ment of the price of goods supplied by the mortgagees. I think that any business man being made acquainted with the fact that such was the general intention of the parties to the instrument would not be surprised to find that the instrument was to stand as security for the price of the goods included in what has been referred to as the September sale. On the contrary, he would be very much-surprised indeed to find that it was not so. Whether you look at this instrument from the point of view of the practical man, not a lawyer, or from the point of view of the lawyer there appears to be nothing in it, which as regards this transaction can fairly be described as misleading.\nAs to the other transaction. If the words quoted from the proviso for redemption\ngoods supplied by the parties of the second part to the parties of the first part during the continuance of the security\ndo not embrace the goods which were the subject of this transaction and I agree with the contention of the respondent that they do not then the property affected by the bill of sale is not charged with the repayment of any moneys paid by Gault Bros. under their guarantee in respect of them and the obligation arising under the guaranty is not part of the consideration for the bill of sale within the meaning of section 7. The transaction is a collateral one which the parties were entitled to bring within the bill of sale or leave out of the bill of sale as they should choose. This objection for these reasons in my opinion fails. I do not discuss the decisions, none of which is inconsistent with, and one of which, at all events, Ex parte Popple-well[4], strongly supports the view I have expressed. There is still another point upon which the appellants rely. It is argued that the provisions of the \"Bills of Sale Act,\" 1905, have no application to goods which were not property of Franklin & Nixon at the time the bill of sale was executed. I have no doubt that prior to the amendment of 1912, 2 Geo. V. ch. 2, sec. 5, the \"Bills of Sale Act\" of British Columbia did not apply to assurances of after-acquired goods. My reasons for that were given in Traves v. Forrest[5]. I there gave my reasons for thinking that the history of the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act,\" taken together with the course of judicial decision in England in relation to the definitions of \"personal chattels\" in the English Acts of 1854 and 1878, which have been closely followed in the British Columbia legislation, led to the conclusion that the British Columbia legislature had adopted the decision in Brantom v. Griffits[6], and that in construing the Act of 1905 one must be governed by that decision. In this view a majority of the court concurred and it may be noted that the parts of the Act then construed were re-enacted without relevant alteration in the consolidation which took place two years later. The law was changed by the amendment of 1912 above referred to. If that enactment is retroactive in its operation then the contention of the appellant on this point must fail; but that question need not, in the view I take of the point raised as to the onus of proof, be considered on this appeal.\nI have come to the conclusion after carefully weighing the argument advanced by the appellants that the onus was on the appellants to identify the goods in respect of which they alleged the bill of sale was effective, and I have come to that conclusion for this reason:\u2014 The interest in after-acquired goods under a mortgage of them when they come under the operation of the mortgage is, as Lord Macnaghten pointed out, in Tailby v. Official Receiver[7], at page 546, an equitable interest. The appellants' interest, if any, therefore, under this mortgage in the property in question was an equitable interest only. Now the effect of the assignment was to vest in the assignee the general property in the goods affected by the mortgage subject to this equitable interest of the mortgagee, if any; and such being the case it appears to me that, on general principles, the onus is upon the mortgagee who alleges this equitable interest to establish his title to it.\nSince writing the above my attention has been called to the fact that a point raised by the counsel for the appellant has not been noticed in any of the judgments and in view of the possibility of further proceedings and in order to avoid any dispute on the subject I think it is right to mention it. The point was, briefly, that on the construction of sub-section 8 of section 7 of the \"Bills of Sale Act,\" which I have adopted, it would be impossible to frame an affidavit of bona fides for the bill of sale in question which should at once be truthful and in conformity with the requirements of that enactment. I merely add, in a word, that having carefully considered the argument I have been unable to satisfy myself that there would be any real difficulty in framing such an affidavit.\nANGLIN J.\u2014With some regret, because the transaction appears to be free from the slightest taint of fraud or suspicion of fraudulent preference, I find myself obliged to concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nAs to the goods which were in the possession of the mortgagors when the impeached instrument was executed, I agree that it was void as against the plaintiff because the affidavit of bona fides did not comply with the statutory requirements. It is also possible that the consideration for which the mortgage was given was not accurately or sufficiently stated.\nAs to the after-acquired goods, assuming that, notwithstanding the sweeping terms of section 7 of the British Columbia \"Bills of Sale Act\" of 1905, the mortgage was enforceable, I agree with Mr. Justice Clement and the Court of Appeal that the burden was on the mortgagees to have shown that there were in fact such goods in the insolvents' stock, and to have segregated and identified them. That they have failed to do.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Tupper, Kitto & Wight-man.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Russell, Mowat, Hancox & Farris.\n[1] 18 B.C.

The Attorney-General of Alberta[3]. The statutes in question are substantially the same.\nThe right of respondent to sue for any taxes imposed by them or their officers or their predecessors seems clearly given.\nThe enactments upon which such taxation rest do not attempt to tax the land so far as vested in the Crown. In the absence of any such express attempt the statutes must be read as bearing only upon the interest of others in the lands and in this case of the appellant as lessee or occupant. The claim that these assessments are so excessive as to shew that they exceeded the value of the land cannot be raised herein.\nThe justice or injustice of the rating is something which we can have nothing to do with.\nThe local court for determining any such question can alone be appealed to or, default that, the legislative authority.\nThen it is suggested that appellant was a nonresident and hence the attempt to tax his interest in the lands or him in respect of such interest is ultra vires.\nThere is no evidence of appellant\u2019s residence except his description in the grazing lease granted him by the Dominion Government. It does not follow that he was, therefore, not resident in the province at the times involved in the imposition of these taxes. Nor does it follow that he as occupant of the lands can set up any such contention in law or in fact.\nAnd as at present advised I do not think the power of direct taxation given by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to the province can be circumscribed or limited in the case of taxation relative to lands by anything involved in the question of the owner\u2019s place of residence.\nIt may well be that in attempting to enforce by action in courts beyond the province, claims for taxes the municipality might find some difficulty.\nBut the courts of the province when duly constituted by its Legislature under and by virtue of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d and given thereby jurisdiction to enforce such a claim as if a debt, must be bound by the law of the province in everything pertaining to direct taxation and to property and civil rights in the province.\nFor the purposes of this appeal we must assume that the taxation of land or any interest therein or of any person in relation to any land in the province, or interest in any such land is direct taxation Within the meaning of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d; and that if the legislature had declared taxes so rightfully imposed to be or constitute a debt within the province due by those who enjoy the protection relative to such land and advantages thereof, for which the taxation is a compensation, it has acted within its power over property and civil rights in the province and that the courts duly constituted by the province to administer its laws must enforce them even if in doing so they may have to deal with people domiciled beyond the province and their property within the province.\nThe argument founded upon the provision of the statutes in question anticipating and providing for enforcement of the tax liens by way of sale of the lands seems to move in a circle for it is only that interest the owner taxed may have that can be reached. And if that remedy by any mode of construction can be made to appear otherwise it would simply be in that view inoperative as the Crown is not made subject to these enactments.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and, for his reasons, that if the taxes sued for in this action were lawfully imposed at all they can now be recovered by the respondent municipality. In 1909, the area comprised within the limits of the municipality was included in Large Local Improvement District C(3) and the appellant was assessed in that year for local improvement tax at the rate of cents an acre by the Local Improvement Branch of the Provincial Government under section 73 of the \u201cLocal Improvements Act\u201d of 1906. In December, 1909, the respondent municipality was organized and the appellant in the years 1910 and 1911 was assessed at the rates of 3\u00bd cents and 3 cents an acre respectively under the authority of sections 50 and 51 of the Act of 1906. In each of the years 1909, 1910 and 1911 the appellant was assessed at the rate of \u00bd cent per acre under the authority of the \u201cSupplementary Revenue Act.\u201d The lands in respect of which the appellant was assessed were, when the assessments were made, the property of the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada, subject to the grazing leases that had been granted to the appellant. It is admitted that in each of the years in question the appellant used these lands for grazing purposes under his leases; and it is further admitted that if he is assessable in respect of them such assessment was duly made. I think also that the result of the admissions is that the appellant was an occupier of these lands within the meaning of the statute. I think, moreover, that section 50 (as amended by section 7, chapter 25, statutes 1909), section 55 and section 59 of the Act of 1906 taken together had the effect of making taxes levied within the limits of a local Improvement District and unpaid a debt due to the District. It is admitted that the respondent municipality is entitled to recover these taxes unless the legislation under the authority of which they are levied is itself ultra vires or the taxing authority has exceeded the powers conferred upon it by the legislation. The first question is: Has the Legislature of Saskatchewan authority to tax the appellant as occupant of these lands, the appellant himself residing outside the province, and to provide effectively for the recovery of the taxes in the courts of the province as a debt?\nAs to this point, very little need be said. Prim\u00e2 facie, the authority of the province under section 92(2) of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d to legislate in relation to the subject of direct taxation in the province includes the power to levy taxes upon the occupants of the property within the province in respect of their occupation, whether they are residents or non-residents.\nIt would appear also that as reasonably incidental to the authority of the province in relation to that subject there must be vested in the legislature the right to empower the taxing authority to recover as a debt any taxes assessed upon or in respect of property owned or occupied within the province. That is the view that has always been taken and acted upon in the Canadian provinces and until the argument of this appeal I do not think I have heard a doubt expressed as to the correctness of it. Of course, one ought not to lose sight of the fact that under section 92 (13) and section 92(14) the province has exclusive legislative authority in respect to property and civil rights in the province and the administration of justice. I may further observe that we are not concerned with any question here whether provincial legislation, enacting that a tax assessed upon the property of nonresidents, shall be recoverable as a debt, has or has not the effect of creating an obligation enforceable beyond the limits of the province. The general rule is that the revenue laws of one country are not taken notice of in another country and it appears to be on this principle that judgments proceeding upon such laws are not recognizable. Planch\u00e9 v. Fletcher[4]. It is also on this principle that it has been held in the United States (Henry v. Sargeant[5], at page 332, per Parker C.J.) that the courts of one state cannot be used as a means of collecting the taxes imposed by another. In Municipal Council of Sydney v. Bull[6] Mr. Justice Grantham dismissed an action brought by the Municipal Council of Sydney to enforce the payment of a local improvement rate levied on the authority of an Act of the Legislature of New South Wales, whereby the Council was authorized to recover the amounts levied under the Act, by action. It was held that the action was analogous to an action brought in one country to enforce the revenue laws of another country and consequently would not lie.\nIt was, moreover, held in the last mentioned case that the enactment on its true construction established only a liability to be enforced in the courts of New South Wales; and it may be that the true intendment and effect of the Act of 1906 is to create in respect of these taxes a debt recoverable by action in the courts of Saskatchewan only. At all events it could be forcibly argued that this particular provision ought to be read in the light of the recognized principle of private international law to which I have referred and if when so read it offends against no limitation imposed by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d upon the legislative powers of the province, one would not, of course, be justified in ascribing to it a construction and effect which would make it ultra vires.\nThe point the appellant really endeavours to make in this connection is that the legislation infringes the prohibition of section 125 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d\nno lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nNow, first, it is beyond question that the appellant is assessed in respect of the occupation of the lands in question, which lands, as I have already said, are (subject to the interest vested in him by virtue of his leases) the property of the Crown in the right of Canada. If this legislation really and truly authorizes the taxation of the appellant in respect of the property of the Crown then I have no hesitation in saying that it does infringe this provision. If, on the other hand, what the Legislature has done is to tax the appellant in respect of his own interest or in respect of his occupation in right of his own interest, it appears to me to be unobjectionable. I think it is hardly arguable that section 125 prohibits the levying of taxation by the Dominion or by a province upon or in respect of a particular interest held by a subject in Crown lands. The section may easily be read as exempting from taxation the interest of the Crown in Crown lands only. And the alternative reading suggested would have the effect of exempting from taxation a large variety of interests such, for example, as those arising under timber leases, mining leases, fishing leases, with which we are very familiar in this country, and it is not a construction which commends itself to my judgment. Then does this particular legislation exceed the limits set by the enactment mentioned either in itself or in the manner in which the respondent municipality has professed to put it in operation? First, as to the legislation itself: I do not think it was seriously argued that the tax imposed by the \u201cSupplementary Revenue Act\u201d of one-half of one cent per acre upon lands held under grazing leases is ultra vires. At all events, I am quite at a loss to understand on what ground it could be plausibly contended that this particular enactment ought not to be read as imposing a tax upon the lessee or occupant in respect of his occupation or his interest. The provisions relating to local improvement tax are sections 50 and 51 and sections 73 and 74 of the Act of 1906. These sections are as follows:\u2014\n50. The council may cause to be levied in each year for the general purposes of the district a tax not less than one and one-quarter cents and not more than five cents per acre upon every owner or occupant in the district for land owned or occupied by him:\nProvided that any person whose assessment would be less than fifty cents shall be assessed fifty cents.\n51. The rate per acre of the said tax shall be fixed by a resolution of the council.\n73. In large districts the rate of assessment shall be one and one-quarter cents per acre:\nProvided that in any large district if the commissioner is satisfied that the said rate of assessment would raise a sum greater than would be necessary to effect the improvements required in such district the rate of assessment may be reduced to such less amount per acre as the commissioner may determine.\nProvided further that any person whose assessment would be less than fifty cents shall be assessed fifty cents.\n74. As soon as possible after the beginning of each year or after the organization of a large district an assessment roll shall be prepared for each large district upon which shall be entered as accurately as may be the following information:\u2014\n(a) Each lot or parcel of land owned or occupied within the district and the number of acres it contains; (b) The name and post office address of the person assessed as owner or occupant of each lot or parcel;\n(c) The amount of assessment;\n(d) The amount of previous assessments which have not been paid.\nFirst.\u2014Of the sections 73 and 74 under which the rate for the year 1906 was levied:\u2014Is the tax thereby imposed a tax upon Crown lands within the meaning of section 125 of the \u201cBritish North America Act?\u201d I think, perhaps, there was some misapprehension in relation to this point as to the effect of Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v. The Attorney-General of Alberta[7]. It will be found, I think, that the decision in that case really rested upon the view taken by the majority of the court that the whole beneficial interest in the lands in question (subject to a lien for a fee payable to the Department of the Interior) had become vested in the land company. In the present case the contention is that looking at the provisions of these enactments as a whole and especially the provisions relating to the proceedings for the recovery of the tax levied through the sale of the lands themselves one sees that the tax is intended to be levied against and made a charge upon the fee simple or the equivalent of the fee simple in all the lands in the province. In the case of lands in respect of which the legal title is vested in the Dominion, but the entire beneficial interest is vested in the subject there would seem, and that was the view taken in the Calgary and Edmonton Case7, to be nothing to prevent such provisions having their full operation. But where the Crown in the right of the Dominion retains a substantial beneficial interest, as well as the legal title in the lands, then a different question entirely arises; and I have no manner of doubt that if the effect of the legislation in this respect is what the appellant contends for then it is obnoxious to section 125 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nI concur, however, in the view which was expressed in some of the judgments of the Calgary and Edmonton Case[8] to the effect that the interpretation clause entitles us where that is necessary to make the legislation effective and reasonably possible to read \u201cland\u201d and \u201clands\u201d in these enactments as meaning \u201cinterest in land\u201d; and, I think, we ought to give to these provisions a construction in so far as the language of them is reasonably capable of it, consistent with the assumption that the Legislature did not intend to offend against the section 125 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d; and on the other hand, having regard to the circumstances of the Province of Saskatchewan and the obvious injustice of exempting from taxation limited interests such as those in question here we must, I think, read these provisions in light of the strong probability that the Legislature did not intend to sanction such, a sweeping exemption. In other words, the entire exclusion from the operation of these Acts of all interests in Dominion Crown lands would operate so unfairly that one really can not suppose the Legislature to have contemplated it.\nWhatever difficulties there may be in putting into operation some of the provisions of these statutes in respect of an assessment such as that in question here I can see no good reason against holding that the essential enactment by which the liability to pay the tax is created may be given effect to in proceedings in personam against the occupier; who is at the same time owner of a limited interest in Dominion Crown lands.\nAt first sight it appeared that a difficulty might arise by reason of the fact that the rate is a uniform one with reference to owners and occupiers. But if the rate be conceived as having been fixed primarily with reference to the occupation value which may very well have been the case, one can quite understand the Legislature having resolved that the owners of lands which are unoccupied should not by reason of that fact alone escape taxation.\nComing now to sections 50 and 51, the only point necessary to refer to is that from admission No. 5 it appears that the rate imposed by the resolution of the respondent municipality was a uniform rate levied alike upon the owners and upon the occupants of land. Any objection founded on that circumstance must stand or fall with the objection just dealt with.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, in which I respectfully concur, I am satisfied that the respondent municipality had the right to collect the taxes in question if they were validly imposed.\nTheir validity is impugned on one ground only; namely, that they are in contravention of section 125 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which exempts from provincial taxation lands belonging to the Crown in right of the Dominion. In The Calgary and Edmonton Land Company v. Attorney-General of Alberta[9], we held legislation similar to, if not identical with, that now impeached to be intra vires of a provincial legislature. We regarded it as authorizing, in the case of Dominion Crown lands, only the taxation of any interest in them with which the Crown had parted. It was suggested \u2014 indeed argued at some length \u2014 that in the present case the tax is not upon an interest so parted with, but upon the lands themselves. It may be that the tax on the defendant\u2019s interest as holder of a grazing lease is excessive, but that is not a matter with which we can deal. There is no evidence that it was intended to tax any interest in the lands still held by the Crown. Nor is it established that the tax in question will indirectly affect the interest of the Crown to any greater extent than that interest is necessarily affected by the prospect that when parted with it becomes subject to provincial taxation.\nIt is also urged that because the defendant is a non-resident the provincial legislature cannot make him liable to a personal action for these taxes. I see no. reason why the legislature may not authorize the recovery in its own courts of a personal judgment against the owner, wherever resident, for arrears of taxes levied upon an interest in lands situate within the province. That judgment will be enforceable only against property of the defendant within the province. It can be enforced against his person only if he should come within the provincial boundaries. If he should be sued upon it in any other jurisdiction it is quite possible that some very nice questions of international law would arise. But the purchaser of an interest in land buys it subject to provincial legislation, whether present or future, affecting it and the incidents of its ownership within the province, and cannot be heard to say in a court of the province, or on appeal therefrom, that he is not bound by legislation which makes him personally liable within the province for taxes validly imposed in respect of such interest.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014In my opinion the case of Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v. The Attorney-General of Alberta[10] disposes of the present appeal.\nThat case determined that the provincial legislatures had the right and the power to authorize the taxation of beneficial or equitable interests in lands wherein the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada holds some interest and the legal estate.\nThe interest of the appellant in the Dominion lands in question then can be taxed. It may be that in this case the municipal valuation of that interest is larger than it should be, but we have no evidence to guide us on that issue.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Knowles, Hare & Benson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McKenzie, Brown & Co.\n[1] 24 West.

The King, (1914) 49 S.C.R. 577\nDate: 1914-03-02\nAnnie Conrod and Others (Petitioners) Appellants\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Respondent) Respondent.\n1914: February 18, 19; 1914: March 2.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nEight of action\u2014Lord Campbell\u2019s Act\u2014Death by accident\u2014Action by widow\u2014Accord and satisfaction.\nWhere the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another an action for damages does not lie under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act unless the deceased could have maintained an action if death had not ensued.\nC. was a temporary employee on the Intercolonial Railway and, as such, a member of the \u201cEmployees Relief and Insurance Association.\u201d By the rules of the Association the object of the Temporary Employees Accident Fund was to provide for members suffering from bodily injury and for the family or relatives of deceased members. Each member had to contribute to the fund and the Railway Department gave the annual sum of $8,000 in consideration of which it was to be \u201crelieved of all claims for compensation for injury or death of any member.\u201d C. was killed by a railway train and his widow was paid $250 out of this fund. She then brought an action under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court (14 Ex. C.R. 472), that as by his contract with the Association C. could not have maintained an action had he lived the widow\u2019s right of action was barred.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the petition of the appellant.\nThe suppliants, who were the wife and dependent children of Thomas Conrod, deceased, sought to recover against the Crown under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d (R.S.N.S. 1900, ch. 178) ten thousand dollars damages for the alleged loss sustained by the death of the said Conrod on a public work, resulting from the alleged negligence of a servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his employment.\nThe deceased was killed in the Intercolonial Railway yard at Richmond, near Halifax, on Sept. 11th, 1911, by the falling over of a tripod which had been set up by one James Cody, an Intercolonial Railway carpenter, for the purpose of dismantling a crane.\nThe Railway Department was enlarging the yard, laying new tracks, etc., and it was in connection with this work that the crane was being removed.\nThe alleged negligence was the failure on Cody\u2019s part to secure the tripod by guy-ropes or otherwise so as to make it safe for the intended purpose, the tripod having toppled over while the heavy part of the crane was suspended by a block and fall from the apex of the tripod, this heavy part falling against Conrod, who failed to get out of its way, causing the injuries resulting in his death.\nThe Crown denied that there was negligence and pleaded contributory negligence. The following other defences were also relied upon:\u2014\n(1) Volenti non fit injuria.\n(2) That the negligence, if any, was that of a fellow workman.\n(3) The deceased being a member of the I.C.R. Employees\u2019 Relief and Insurance Association, the Crown was relieved, by the rules and regulations of that Association, and by the deceased\u2019s agreement on becoming a member thereof, of all liability for the claim now being made. (4) That the suppliant, Annie Conrod, had by release under seal dated September 25th, 1911, discharged the Crown from all claims and demands arising out of the death of her husband.\nThe trial judge found that the death of Conrod was caused through negligence of the foreman in charge of the work, but dismissed the petition on the ground that the latter was a fellow-servant of the deceased. The suppliant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPower K.C. for the appellants. The trial judge found all the facts in favour of the suppliant, held that the foreman was guilty of negligence and that there was no contributory negligence. He applied the doctrine of common employment and dismissed our petition on that ground only.\nI respectfully submit that the learned judge took an erroneous view of the facts proved. The doctrine of common employment will not relieve the employer where the accident is caused by a defective system or lack of proper safeguards. Canada Woolen Mills v. Traplin[2]; Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[3]; Brooks, Scanlon, O\u2019Brien Co. v. Fakkema[4]; Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[5].\nThen as to the effect of deceased\u2019s membership in the Railway Insurance Association.\nThe action under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d is separate from and independent of the estate of the deceased or any right the latter might have had if he had lived. See White v. Parker[6]; Seward v. The \u201cVera Cruz\u201d[7]; Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[8]. And the release given by the widow is no bar. The King v. Desrosiers[9]; Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[10].\nRogers K.C. for the respondent. Ryder v. The King[11], followed by the learned trial judge, is conclusive against the appellant. See also Burr v. Theatre Royal[12].\nDeceased having contracted away his own right of action his widow\u2019s right is barred. See Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley[13]. The cases cited by appellant\u2019s counsel hold that there is a substantial difference between the provisions of the Quebec Code and \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d as to the right of action in case of death.\nPower K.C. for the appellants.\nRogers K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I express no opinion as to the sufficiency of the apparatus or the qualification of the foreman or whether the claim could have been successfully maintained on the ground of negligence.\nI regretfully come to the conclusion that the claim is barred by the release given by the appellant and which reads as follows:\u2014\n$250.00\nReceived from the Intercolonial Railway Employees\u2019 Relief and Insurance Association the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, which I hereby accept in full satisfaction and discharge of all my claims and demands against the said Association, and against His Majesty The King, His officers or servants arising out of the death of my husband, the late Thomas Conrod. It is submitted that this receipt or release is a complete discharge in so far as the claim is concerned. The circumstances under which this document was executed have not been, and could not be well, called in question, and I do not think that the suppliant was not fully aware as to the plain meaning of the words used.\nIt appears upon the pleadings and admissions that the deceased was a member of the Intercolonial Railway Employees\u2019 Relief and Insurance Association, an incorporated society, to the funds of which the Government of Canada contributes annually the sum of six thousand dollars. One of the rules of the Association was that in consideration of such contribution of the Government to the Association, the Government should be relieved of all claims for compensation for injury or death of any member. The rules were in force at the time of the accident and had been in force throughout the whole period of the employment of the deceased, and the contribution by the Crown to the funds of the Association had continued during the whole period. The facts upon this point constituted an agreement by the deceased with the Government by which he agreed to accept the contribution and advantages to which he might be entitled under the rules of the Association in lieu of any claim for damages which he might have against the Government. He would, therefore, have been precluded from maintaining this action had he survived, and it is apparent that the suppliant was likewise precluded.\nThe suppliant, having accepted $250, the amount of insurance on the life of deceased payable by the Association under its rules and regulations, is estopped from setting up any claim inconsistent with those rules and regulations, and, therefore, precluded from maintaining this action. Clements v. London and North Western Railway Co.[14]; Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley[15]. We were referred to the case of Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[16], but the terms of article 1056 of the Civil Code of Quebec, which was the foundation of the liability in that case, differ substantially from the provisions of \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d and the Nova Scotia provincial statutes. The suppliant here has not an independent and personal right which the deceased could not, in his lifetime, have released.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The decision of this court in the case of The Queen v. Grenier[17] seems conclusive against the appellant\u2019s right to recover herein by reason of deceased having by terms of his employment agreed to release the Crown in consideration of the benefits to be received by the rules of the Intercolonial Employees\u2019 Relief and Insurance Association.\nThe appeal must be dismissed; and with costs if respondent insists thereon.\nDuff J.\u2014The view I take of the terms under which the late Conrod was employed by the Department of Railways makes it unnecessary to express any opinion upon the question whether or not (the special stipulations of that contract apart) the appellants might have succeeded in this action. Thos. Conrod was required, according to the practice of the department, on entering on his employment, to become a member of the I.C.R. Employees\u2019 R. & I. Association, and to enter into an express agreement to be bound by the rules of the Association. These rules contain the following provisions:\u2014\nCopy of Rules (1 and 3).\nIntercolonial Railway Employees\u2019 Relief and Insurance Association.\nObject.\nThe object of the Temporary Employees\u2019 Accident Fund shall be to provide for its members while they are suffering from bodily injury, and in case of death by accident, to provide a sum of money for the benefit of the family or relatives of deceased members. All payments being made subject to the Constitution, Rules and Regulations of the Intercolonial Railway Employees\u2019 Relief and Insurance Association, from time to time in force.\nGeneral.\n1. Each and every temporary employee shall contribute to the funds of the Association one cent for each day or part of a day worked by him in the railway service, and in case of injury received while at such work, he shall receive medical attendance and medicine, and an allowance of $3 a week, of six working days, during the time he is unable to work in consequence of the said injury, but such weekly allowance shall not be paid for a shorter period than one week or for a longer period than thirteen weeks in any one year; and in case death shall occur as the result of the said injury within thirteen weeks from the date on which the said injury was received, the sum of $250 shall be paid to his widow, or failing his widow, to the executor or administrator of his estate.\n* * * * * * *\n3. In consideration of the annual contribution of $8,000 from the Railway Department to the Association, the Constitution, Rules and Regulations, and future amendments thereto, shall be subject to the approval of the Chief Superintendent; and the Railway Department shall be relieved of all claims for compensation for injury or death of any member.\nIt is not disputed\u2014indeed it is admitted\u2014that the provisions of Rule 3 formed part of Conrod\u2019s contract of employment. The sum of $250 for the payment of which Rule No. 1 provides, was duly paid to the appellant Annie Conrod. The effect of Rule No. 3 is, of course, effectually to bar any action under the provisions of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d against the Crown, by Conrod himself; and the only point susceptible of discussion is whether, notwithstanding that, the appellants can maintain an action for the loss occasioned by Conrod\u2019s death as his dependents under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act.\u201d It seems to me to be unnecessary to cite authority to shew that no such action is maintainable. Section 3 of the Act as re-enacted in Nova Scotia, ch. 178, R.S.N.S., 1900, is as follows:\u2014\nWhere the death of a person has been caused by such wrongful act, neglect, or default of another as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereto, in such case, the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action of damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death has been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to a crime.\nIt seems too clear for argument that under this provision only such \u201cwrongful acts, neglects or defaults\u201d as would, \u201cif death had not ensued have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereto,\u201d can give rise to any right to recover compensation under this Act; and since no damages could have been recovered by Conrod, if death had not ensued, in respect of the negligence charged (because of the above quoted rule by which he was bound) it follows that the Act can have no application.\nAnglin J.\u2014As a condition of his engagement on the Intercolonial Railway the deceased Conrod had undertaken to relieve the Crown of all liability to him for injuries which he might sustain in the course of his employment. In The Queen v. Grenier[18] a contract in the same terms was held to preclude recovery of damages for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband which had been occasioned by negligence of servants of the Crown. The decision in that case on this point is not affected by the judgment in Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[19]. It is a condition precedent of the right of recovery under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d that the deceased must have had a right of action against the defendant for the injuries which caused his death. British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Turner[20].\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and must be dismissed with costs if insisted on.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d which was re-enacted in Nova Scotia under ch. 178, R.S.N.S. 1900.\nIt was dismissed by the Exchequer Court on the defence of common employment.\nI would be inclined to agree with the appellants that on that question of common employment they should succeed. But I hold that their claim fails on account of the contract existing between the deceased and the Railway Department in whose employ he was when he was fatally injured.\nIn virtue of that contract every temporary employee of the Intercolonial Railway is entitled in case of injury to receive a weekly allowance; and, if he dies, his widow receives $250; and the Railway Department is relieved of all other claims for compensation.\nIs the effect of such a contract to debar his widow and his heirs from claiming any other compensation than the one provided?\nThe appellants claim that their right of action is independent of the estate of the deceased and is for the exclusive benefit of the widow and children.\nIt had been decided, however, that in order to succeed the representatives of the deceased must prove and establish that he had an action against the wrongdoers at the time of his death.\nIf the deceased has settled his claim in his lifetime, no further action can be brought on his dying through the same injuries. Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[21]. Or if he has made a contract with his employer not to claim compensation for personal injuries his widow and his children are bound by that contract and cannot claim under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act.\u201d Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley[22].\nThe appellants have been relying in support of their contention on some Quebec cases; but our art. 1056 C.C., which gives a right of action to a widow, confers an independent and personal right of action on the widow and relatives of the deceased and not as in \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act\u201d a right conferred on the representatives of the deceased only. Therefore, decisions under art. 1056 are not applicable to cases under \u201cLord Campbell\u2019s Act.\u201d Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway[23]; Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[24].\nThe appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the deceased had agreed that his employer should be relieved of all other claims for compensation, except the $250 which were paid to his widow.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John T.

Blyth (19 Ont. L.R. 386); Reg. v. Johnson (2 C. & K. 354); and Reg. v. Slavin (17 U.C.C.P. 205) referred to.\nAPPLICATION, on behalf of the appellant, for extension of the time for giving notice, as required by section 1024 of the Criminal Code, of an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], whereby the conviction of the appellant upon an indictment for murder was sustained, McPhillips J. dissenting. The circumstances in which the application was made are stated in the judgments now reported.\nCot\u00e9 appeared in support of the application.\nJ. A. Ritchie contra.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Unless we are prepared to declare that it is arguable that it may be held to be law that a prisoner has a legal right to insist upon postponement of his trial in any case where some evidence to be adduced against him has been brought to the notice of his counsel for the first time on the day of the trial, this motion must be refused.\nThe proposed appeal here is based upon the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice McPhillips, which in turn rests upon facts which imply nothing more than I have stated. A good many more facts are set forth therein, but none adding anything to the strength of the alleged legal right, or interfering in any way with the discretion assigned the learned trial judge in such case.\nIt would not be in the interests of the administration of justice to grant an indulgence such as now asked to permit of the presentation of such a case.\nIt may in some cases where like indulgence may be asked not be so easy as here to grasp all that really is involved in the proposed appeal.\nThe motion must be refused.\nDUFF J.\u2014After full consideration of the circumstances I think the application ought not to be granted. The question which counsel for the accused desires to raise upon appeal to this court is the ques- tion whether the accused was entitled to a traverse of the trial in the circumstances mentioned in the reserved case. My opinion is that, in this respect, the case does not present a question of law within section 1014 of the Criminal Code. I have reached this conclusion after the most anxious consideration of the judgment given in the court below in which the considerations in favour of the view that a question of law is stated are set forth with great fullness and ability. I can only say that, having come to a very clear conclusion that the appellant's appeal on this point would be hopeless, and that being of the opinion of my learned brothers, I think no possible object could be served by granting the application.\nThe right to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts by way of appeal from a conviction after a trial at the assizes given by section 1014 of the Criminal Code is a strictly limited one. The Code does not contemplate that an accused person should be entitled as of right to claim redress by way of appeal in every case in which it alleged that the trial judge has made a mistake as, for instance, in respect of a question which is left to his discretion; the appeal given is by way of case stated and the case must present some question of law. In respect of cases not falling within section 1014 or section 1021 a right is given by section 1022 to apply to the Minister of Justice who has power to order a new trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant applies to extend the time for service of notice of appeal to this court under section 1024 of the Criminal Code. The judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming his conviction for murder was pronounced on the 27th of January, 1914. He had the right to give notice of appeal within the fifteen days thereafter which section 1024 allows. But, having permitted that time to expire without giving notice, he now asks indulgence on the ground that he had not until quite recently the means to launch or prosecute the appeal which he desires to take. Before granting an extension of time to serve the notice it is our duty to satisfy ourselves that the proposed appeal involves a question of law which could be reserved under section 1014 of the Code and would properly form the subject of an appeal to this court.\nThe learned trial judge reserved three questions for the opinion of the Court of Appeal:\u2014\n(1) Whether the prisoner was entitled to a traverse of the trial to the Spring Assizes.\n(2) Whether the trial judge was right in permitting counsel for the Crown to ask the accused when he was giving evidence on his own behalf if he had been charged with or had committed certain offences.\n(3) Whether the trial judge was right in permitting the accused to be cross-examined on his alleged testimony at the inquest in the absence of the original depositions.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously answered the second and third questions in the affirmative; and it has been decided in McIntosh v. The Queen[2], that the right of appeal to this court is confined to questions upon which there has been dissent in the provincial court of appeal. The defendant's right of appeal is, therefore, restricted to the first question. Three of the five judges of the provincial court of appeal held that this was not a question of law which might be reserved under section 1014, and four of them that, if it were, it should be answered in the negative. Mr. Justice McPhillips dissented from the opinion of the majority on both grounds[3].\nSection 901 of the Criminal Code declares that\nno person prosecuted shall be entitled as of right to traverse or postpone the trial of any indictment preferred against him in any court.\nBy sub-section 2, power is conferred on every trial court, in its discretion, to grant an adjournment of trial to any prisoner.\nThe grand jury indicted the defendant, on the 13th of October, 1913[4]. On that day he was assigned counsel, who was informed that the Crown proposed to call two witnesses whose names were on the indictment, but who had not given evidence at the preliminary investigation. A copy of the memorandum purporting to state the substance of the testimony which these witnesses were expected to give was also furnished him. There is no doubt that this evidence was of vital importance and disclosed facts not stated at the preliminary investigation. Counsel for the prisoner moved to traverse the trial in order to have an opportunity to\ninquire into the antecedents (of these witnesses) and the reason their evidence had not been given at the preliminary investigation and was being now given,\nand on other general grounds. The Crown opposed postponement because of the expense involved and the great danger of loss of material evidence. The court offered to transfer the case to the Vernon Assizes to be held a fortnight later. Counsel for the defence declined to accept this offer, saying it would be useless to him, and the trial proceeded, on the 16th October, resulting in the defendant being convicted of murder.\nWhile it is possible to conceive of cases in which it would be clear that there had not been any exercise of judicial discretion in granting or refusing postponement of trial, and in such cases there might be error of law which would be properly reviewable, where, in what was clearly an exercise of his discretion, the trial judge has refused a postponement because he was \"of the opinion\" that further time should not be allowed (sec. 901, sub-sec. 2 (Crim. Code)), I am satisfied that the propriety of that exercise of discretion is not reviewable by an appellate court and is not properly the subject of a reserved case under section 1014. The principle which underlies the decisions in The Queen V. Charlesworth[5], and Winsor v. The Queen[6], approved in Rex v. Lewis[7], applies. I am, with respect, unable to appreciate the distinction which it is suggested exists between the discretion conferred where \"the matter rests in the opinion of the court\"[8], and this case where the court is empowered to postpone, if it \"is of the opinion\" that it should do so.\nIf the propriety of the refusal of the postponement is a question of law (Rex v. Blyth[9], pp. 389, 392, re-reviewable under section 1014 et seq. of the Criminal Code, I agree with Martin J.A. and Irving J.A. that, under the circumstances of the present case, interference by an appellate court would be out of the question. Reg. v. Johnson[10]; Reg. v. Slavin[11]. I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the extension of time asked for must be refused.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014By the provisions of article 1024 of the Criminal Code there is an appeal to this court by any person convicted of any indictable offence if the court of appeal has not been unanimous. But notice of appeal should be served on the Attorney-General within fifteen days after the judgment appealed from has been rendered. However, this court or a judge thereof may extend the time within which the notice of appeal should be given.\nThe object of the present application is to obtain that extension.\nThe applicant has been convicted of murder in the month of October last. He was, by the sentence of the court, to be executed on the 29th of December last. On the 23rd of December, just a few days before the date fixed for the execution, his counsel applied for a reserved case and a reprieve was granted until the 30th day of January. The Court of Appeal rendered its judgment on the 27th of January last. The execution of sentence was postponed until the 4th of April, 1914.\nInstead of giving notice of appeal to this court, as required by law, the applicant waited until the 17th of March to apply for an order extending the time for serving upon the Attorney\u2014General of the province the notice of appeal.\nI have gone into the merits of the case in order to satisfy myself as to whether the case presented some serious doubts, and I failed to see any good reason why we should grant the delay asked for. The only point of importance which was reserved by the trial judge and about which there was a dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal was whether the trial judge had exercised a proper discretion in refusing to postpone the trial to the Spring Assizes.\nIt was not established that the ends of justice would have been served by postponing the trial to the Spring Assizes. On the contrary, it was to be feared that the witnesses could not be procured at the future time at which it was prayed to put off the trial.\nThe witnesses about whom the prisoner wanted to have some information were well known to him, had been in relation with him for some time, and he knew of the antecedents of those witnesses.\nIt has been stated in Rex v. Jones, in 1806[12], that it is the constant practice of the Old Bailey not to put off trials for the absence of witnesses to character only.\nFor those reasons the present application now made to this court should be dismissed.\nApplication refused.\n[1] 5 West.

He was not, however, informed of the names of any sellers or purchasers, the brokers carrying out the transactions in their own names. There was a \u201cclearing house\u201d association connected with the Grain Exchange of which the brokers dealing on the Exchange were members and through which all transactions were settled daily by setting off purchases against sales, liability for the same being assumed by the clearing house and the brokers released upon a settlement for the resulting balances instead of for every separate transaction reported. It was not proved that B. was aware of this practice as to settlements, although he, from time to time, had paid \u201cmargins\u201d to the brokers when required to do so by them in order to protect them against losses on his account. B. became in arrears for \u201cmargins\u201d and, in an action against him, the brokers recovered the amount of their claim.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (23 Man. R. 306), the Chief Justice and Duff J. dissenting, that, as the evidence failed to shew that, by the manner in which the transactions were made, the amounts claimed had been expended in carrying out the commissions according, to the instructions the brokers had received from B., they were not entitled to recover the balance so claimed from him.\nHeld, further, per Idington and Brodeur JJ., and semble per Anglin J.\u2014Where, in such, transactions, neither party intends that there should be actual delivery made or received of the commodities to which the purchases or sales, relate the contracts are illegal and prohibited by the terms of section 231 of the Criminal Code.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nW. A. T. Sweatman for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. and E. A. Cohen for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action by an agent to recover from his principal moneys expended in his service.\nThe respondent as a commission merchant was instructed from time to time either to buy or sell, as directed, wheat and other grains on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.\nThe ordinary agency in way of buying and selling anything does not give rise to implications out of which can arise claims for reclamations by the agent Either the agent is directed merely to make the bargain as directed, to buy and pay for or sell, and there the matter rests. But, on change, there has arisen a practice of buying and selling of options and a custom of the agent advancing the needed cash, called margins, for the purpose of securing or of protecting the bargain and out of this peculiar form of agency often arise claims by way of reclamations.\nThe claim made herein is for a series of reclamations arising out of such mode of dealing. The parties are agreed, so far, that the law declares in such case that the agent has implied authority to act according to the usage and customs of the particular place, market or business in which he is employed, provided that no agent has implied authority to act in accordance with any usage or custom which is unreasonable unless the principal had notice of such usage or custom at the time when he conferred the authority.\nApplying this to the facts, it is clear that as regards the several dealings in question, in which the respondent acted as agent, it expressly represented, time and again, that the dealing entered upon was as follows:\u2014\nOn all marginal business we reserve the right to close transactions when margins are running out, without further notice. All purchases and sales made by us for you are made in accordance with and subject to the rules, regulations and customs of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.\nOn these rules alone the bargains made would each have created a privity of contract between the appellant principal and some one else to whom he could have looked and to whom he would have been bound.\nNone of the transactions in question here were allowed to remain in that simple primitive condition which the observance of these rules and ancient well-known usages would have produced. A few years before these dealings the \u201cClearing House,\u201d known as \u201cThe Winnipeg Grain and Produce Clearing House,\u201d was incorporated. Any member of the voluntary association known as \u201cThe Winnipeg Grain Exchange,\u201d referred to in the above-quoted memo., could become a member of this Clearing House.\nBut all the members of the Grain Exchange were not members of the incorporated Clearing House. The latter had a peculiar set of by-laws which no doubt bound its own members to each other, but could not bind others unless expressly or impliedly assenting to be so bound.\nI shall not enter into the details of the system for I find the learned counsel engaged in this case are very wide asunder not only as to the law, but the essential facts relative to the consequence of members of this Clearing House using its machinery and dealing through means thereof with bargains made between them on the \u201cExchange\u201d; and I find the learned judges in the court below seem to be in as hopeless a sort of disagreement in same regard as counsel in the case; and, to crown all, counsel for respondent will not accept the evidence of its own manager as to the position in which the practice and dealings of its members are supposed to have brought their respective clients in relation to contracts on their behalf when dealt with by means of this Clearing House.\nIndeed, we are invited to determine that matter by the construction of a few obscurely worded rules and, in doing so, to first determine that the meaning thereof is that which will best serve the purposes of respondent in this appeal, and next, under such circumstances, to find that appellant must be held bound by reason of his knowledge, or duty to know of the existence of such a Clearing House and its uses, and the legal consequence of such use, as part of the usage and custom of the Grain Exchange on which he authorized respondent to deal for him.\nThere is not a word of evidence to shew appellant had ever heard of such an institution or knew anything of its uses and the consequences of such use.\nHis examination for discovery is put in, so far as serving respondent\u2019s purpose, and a perusal of it leads me to conclude that all his apparent knowledge of the Grain Exchange was at best shallow; and it by no means leads me to conclude that he ever got beyond very old-fashioned notions of the business he was engaged in when entering on the dealings now in question.\nTo impute to such a man knowledge of what his agent would be likely to do in regard to the Clearing House seems absurd.\nAnd if the radical differences of opinion, amongst those likely to know about such a mode of doing business, which I have presented do not demonstrate how unreasonable it would be to bind an ignorant man to its adoption, I imagine I should fail if I attempted further elaborate demonstration.\nThe ordinary man cannot realize the existence of a contract without its continuation till ending in the ordinary way. It is contended that the twenty-four contracts involved herein each ended in some sort of novation by which the party with whom in each case appellant was brought into some contractual relation either as buyer or seller became discharged almost immediately after the contract had been framed.\nAnd it is said the Clearing House corporation became substituted in and by such novation as either buyer or seller as suited the exigencies of the case.\nThat is the position taken by counsel for the respondent and it has some colour of support in one if not more of the opinion judgments in the court below.\nBut the respondent\u2019s manager who took part in these deals and was at the time of giving evidence herein president of this Clearing House Association, and I infer, from a reading of his evidence, was possessed of a clear head, says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014In other words, two days later Bingham may have closed the transaction so far as he was concerned?\nA.\u2014Yes; of course, his position would be the same as ours. The purchase he made from another may have cancelled some deal he had outstanding, and he may have cleared on the Clearing House that day.\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014And the clients would look to you and no one else?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014No one else would be responsible to the clients except you?\nYou alone would be responsible to the clients?\nA.\u2014We are in every case. They can only look to us; they cannot look to the Clearing House.\nThe result would seem to be, as the man best fitted to know thus explains it, that there was by means of the ingenious and beneficent plan of the Clearing House a method whereby the commission agent and his clients could by due process of law form an apparently contractual relation between them, as basis for betting against the rise and fall of the market without the annoyance of being troubled by others, and the Clearing House be a good and safe place for, recording the bet and, barring some occasional accidents, form a stakeholding security.\nAt least such is what the appellant charges and relies upon as his second line of defence resting upon the section 231 of the Criminal Code, which, abbreviated, is as follows:\u2014\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence * * * who * * * (a) without the bon\u00e2 fide intention of acquiring any such * * * goods, * * * or of selling the same * * * makes * * * any contract * * * purporting to be for the sale or purchase * * * of any * * * goods * * *; or, (b) makes * * * any contract * * * purporting to be for the sale or purchase of any such * * * goods * * * in respect of which no delivery of the thing sold or purchased is made or received, and without the bon\u00e2 fide intention to make or receive such delivery.\u201d\nThe contention of respondent, either through its witness or counsel, as to the consequences of dealing through the machinery of the Clearing House, if correct, produces a situation that better lends itself to the operating of a system of betting or wagering than the old system of treating the contracts, as between the buyer and seller, as being kept on foot.\nBut the most significant fact bearing upon the essential question of whether or not these transactions were intended to be mere wagering transactions is that we have presented at least twenty-four transactions between the parties hereto in which alleged contracts of selling and buying are apparently involved yet not one of them resulted in the transfer and delivery of a single pound of goods of any kind.\nSurely it is asking too much of us to believe that the sale and form of delivery in all these cases was made with the bon\u00e2 fide intention to make or receive such delivery as the law contemplates and that in such a mass of cases it so signally failed of fruition in a single instance.\nThere is, however, more than that curious and continuous unbroken chain of business dealings between these parties to be considered; for we find that the very first contract, in January, 1910, was one of a sale for delivery in the future of \u201cMay wheat\u201d and long before the time for delivery had arrived, indeed, within a few days, another alleged contract is made for the purchase of exactly the same quantity of wheat, ostensibly bought for \u201cMay delivery,\u201d and these parties seem to have set the one off against the other and settled on that basis allowing a small item of profit as the result to the appellant.\nAn examination of other similar transactions and reckoning shews this process was gone through and a settlement arrived at, on the like basis and through the like methods, long before the respective times at which the future delivery ostensibly contemplated by the form of the transaction had arrived. Whether all were recorded in the Clearing House or not does not appear.\nIn some ancient temples we are told ceremonies were performed which no one but the initiated were supposed to behold or quite understand and outside that charmed circle the whole performance was treated with that respectful awe which is ever due to mystery.\nIn this modern temple probably some consecrated symbolical delivery takes place accompanied with appropriate ceremony. No ruthless hand has dared to lay bare before us exactly what form or symbol was substituted and accepted by the faithful as something they may call, and swear, to be delivery of that grain; in the clouds or four hundred miles away.\nIt never, in transactions such as presented herein, moves out of the warehouse or helps to propel the wheels of commerce. But the chips change sides and the bank accounts are expected to do the rest. I assume the usual ceremony or form was gone through on twenty-four successive occasions. No one saw, or felt, or ever handled a pound of grain or flax in any single instance!\nThis was not, I imagine, all accidental, but a mere using of the forms of the law to promote an illegal purpose present to the minds of those concerned. And the methods used and consequences involved in the use of the machinery provided by the Clearing House and its system facilitated this mode of mere wagering.\nI am not to be understood as alleging that the Clearing House and its system is used solely for that purpose and is not used for an honest and most beneficent purpose.\nBut, when asked to find that it was not used for such wagering purpose and could not be so used, I must say that to ask so much seems like trading on one\u2019s credulity, in face of the facts presented. As I read the statute it fits these facts.\nIt is idle to call a mere symbolical form, never intended to result in anything but a change in the bank ledger containing records of the gains and losses of those concerned, a delivery or evidence of intention to make or receive delivery.\nThere is a letter from appellant which opens the dealing in flax that is relied, upon as lending colour to the abandonment of the vicious system pursued in the eighteen wheat deals which had preceded it.\nIf the flax sale had taken the form that it might have done or, by any reasonable interpretation of what transpired, have been attributed to a sale of flax grown or to be grown upon the farms in which appellant was interested, then I might have found some colour of reason for supposing the practices of a year\u2019s duration now spread out before us had been abandoned.\nI can find nothing in the transaction to bear this out. I conclude that the appellant is entitled to succeed on both grounds taken and that the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba both upon the facts and the law and application of the authorities he relies upon is well founded and that I accept to cover the ground which I have not dwelt upon in detail.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. My reasons for thinking that the plaintiff is chargeable in respect of the transactions upon which the action is based, are so fully and satisfactorily stated in the judgments of Mr. Justice Perdue and Mr. Justice Cameron that I should not have considered it necessary to do more than simply express my concurrence in those judgments, had it not been for the difference of opinion in this court. The first point for consideration arises out of the position taken by the appellant that, the transactions in course of which the moneys were paid for which he had been held responsible in the courts below, were not within the scope of the respondents\u2019 employment. Reduced to its lowest terms the appellant\u2019s contention upon this head could, perhaps, be stated in this way: The respondents were instructed by the appellant as brokers to buy or sell grain; under such instructions the authority of the respondents was limited to making contracts of sale or purchase in a representative capacity for and on behalf of the appellant, or to put it more concretely \u2014 it was the respondents\u2019 duty, and their authority was limited by this duty, in executing the instructions of the appellant, to constitute agreements of sale and purchase between the appellant as seller or buyer with a purchaser or seller, which contracts should be enforceable by the appellant as the respondents\u2019 principal, and in respect of which contracts, moreover, the rights of the appellant should not be affected by the state of the account between the respondents or their clients and the other party, or parties, to the transactions. The process by which these legal incidents are said to be ascribable to the respondents\u2019 employment is something like this: first, it is said \u2014 and perhaps I ought to say assumed \u2014 that prim\u00e2 facie the respondents were employed as agents of the appellant to make contracts of sale or purchase for him as his representatives, and this is assumed to involve as a legal consequence the limitations upon the authority of the respondents above indicated in the absence of evidence proving the contrary which, it is argued, is not forthcoming in this case.\nI think this is not the right road of approach for arriving at the nature of the employment of the respondents. I will discuss later the decisions of the courts upon which the appellant relies. In the meantime, for the purpose of stating my view as to the nature of the respondents\u2019 authority, I refer to a passage of the judgment of Parke, B., in Foster v. Pearson[2], at pages 858 and 859, which indicates, I think, the point of view from which the evidence bearing upon the question ought to be examined. In point of fact, the respondents, as the appellant knew, were grain merchants carrying on business at many places in Canada in buying and selling on their own account and also as commission merchants. They were also commission merchants and members of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and the appellant dealt with them as such. The commissions they undertook for the appellant were to buy or sell grain \u201con margin\u201d in the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and they were, by the terms of the respondents\u2019 employment, to be executed according to the \u201crules, regulations and customs\u201d of the Exchange. As regards the incidents of the respondents\u2019 employment in these circumstances, those observations of Baron Parke in the case above mentioned appear to me to be pertinent.\nThe judgment in the case of Haynes v. Foster[3], is treated in the argument for the defendant as establishing that it is a sort of legal incident to the character of a bill broker that he is to pledge the bills of each customer separately; but we think that such is not the fair meaning of the judgment, but that it is to be taken in connection with the evidence, and that all that was intended was this, that, in the absence of evidence as to the nature of such an employment, a bill broker must be taken to be an agent to procure the loan of money on each customer\u2019s bills separately, and that he had, therefore, no right to mix bills together and pledge the mass for one entire sum. In truth, a bill broker is not a character known to the law with certain prescribed duties; but his employment is one which depends entirely upon the course of dealing. It may differ in different parts of the country; it may have powers more or less extensive in one place than in another: what is the nature of its powers and duties in any instance is a question of fact, and is to be determined by the usage and course of dealing in the particular place.\nInstead of beginning with certain presumptions founded upon legal decisions with reference to states of fact, more or less remotely similar to that disclosed by the evidence in this case, I shall try to ascertain what the facts in evidence have to say as to the nature of the transactions contemplated by the appellant\u2019s instructions to the respondents to make sales and purchases for his benefit \u201cin accordance with and subject to the rules, regulations and customs of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.\u201d Connected with the Winnipeg Grain Exchange is an incorporated company, known as the Winnipeg Grain Exchange Clearing House Association, the members of which are necessarily members of the Grain Exchange. The function of the Clearing House Association is to \u201cclear\u201d transactions entered into between its members. Members of the Grain Exchange who are not members of the Clearing House Association were not entitled to avail themselves of the services of the latter. As to members of the Clearing House Association it is their duty to report any transactions entered into between any two of them, within three-quarters of an hour after closing on the date of the transaction. The transaction is examined by the manager of the Clearing House Association and, if accepted by him, the Association itself intervenes, assuming towards the seller the obligations of buyer and towards the buyer the obligations of seller. The single contract between two members becomes decomposed into two contracts, the Clearing House Association being a party to each, in one case being seller and in the other case being buyer. For the purposes of these two contracts the price is the closing price of the day, and if that differs from the price in the original contract, the difference is settled by payment in cash. This practice applies, of course, only to sales and purchases for future delivery. These contracts between the purchasing member, on the one hand, and the Association, and the buying member, on the other hand, and the Association, are, of course, subject to the rules of the Clearing House Association and there are two points as to the effect of these rules which are important; indeed, it is upon these two points that the defence and the appeal are based. The first of these is that the Clearing House Association treats the buying member, or the selling member as the case may be, as the principal and the only principal in the transaction. It is admitted by Mr. Ruttan, the general manager of the respondents, that according to the system in force the Clearing House Association is not bound to recognize any client of any member. The next point is: according to the regulations of the Clearing House Association a settlement takes place each day between each member and the Association, which settlement is effected in this way. At the close of any given day each member is credited by the Association with the aggregate amount of any advance in that day\u2019s closing price of commodities in respect of which the member is seller over the closing price of the previous day, or debited, as the case may be, with the amount in the aggregate of the decline, while with regard to commodities in respect to which he is a purchaser the process is reversed. The difference between the credits and debits is paid to the Clearing House Association by the member or to the member by the Clearing House Association, according to the state of the account. In order to secure payments of differences by members, the manager of the Association is entitled to call upon members from time to time for reasonable \u201cmargins\u201d which are placed to the credit of the member. In the event of a member failing to pay differences, or to produce margins, when called upon to do so, authority is conferred upon the manager of the Association by the by-laws, in respect of transactions in which the member is a seller, to produce commodities sufficient to fulfil such contracts, and, in respect of contracts in which he is buyer, to sell the commodities to which he is entitled. That, it appears to me, on careful reading of them, is the true construction of sections 3 and 4 of by-law 14.\nThe sum of the matter as affecting the respondents\u2019 transactions now in question is this: As regards sales a contract arose between the C.H.A. and the respondents by which the C.H.A. agreed to take delivery of a given number of bushels of grain at a certain future date and pay for them at the closing price of the date of the sale and to credit the respondents in the daily settlement with the decline in price (if any) for that day while the respondents undertake to deliver on the named date and to account in daily settlement for the rise in price (if any) for that day and to provide margins when called upon. When the date for delivery arrives, the respondents are bound to deliver the commodity contracted for unless they have it at the Clearing House, i.e., unless they have contracts entitling them to receive an equal amount from the Clearing House.\nThe incidents of a purchase are the same mutatis mutandis. As for the appellant (assuming the respondents are right) he had no right to enforce these contracts as against the Clearing House Association by which he would not be recognized; but, as between him and the respondents, he was entitled to have them carry out any transactions entered into for him so long as he furnished the required \u201cmargins\u201d and to have the benefit of all profits arising from such transactions.\nAll contracts for delivery of commodities within the scope of the business of the Grain Exchange made between two members of the Grain Exchange who are also members of the Clearing House Association, being necessarily subject to the rules of the Clearing House Association, have the incidents, and the rights of the parties, to them are held subject to the conditions just indicated.\nIt follows, of course, that any contract for sale or purchase of commodities for future delivery made by a commission merchant who is a member of the Clearing House Association with another member of the Clearing House Association, in execution of a commission to buy or sell such commodities, is necessarily affected by the same incidents. The question is whether transactions having such incidents are within the class of transactions contemplated by the appellant\u2019s instructions to the respondents.\nFor more than five years before the first of the transactions in question the appellant had been dealing in options on the grain exchange. That he was familiar with the practice of depositing margins is shewn by the correspondence. He was also familiar with the practice of \u201cclosing out\u201d one transaction by entering into another; by off-setting a sale with a purchase and taking the profits. It seems reasonable to conclude from the whole correspondence touching these matters that the appellant knew perfectly well that when a sale was made for his benefit the purchaser was not looking to him as principal. It seems reasonably clear that he never entertained any idea of assuming any obligation to anybody but the respondents.\nBut it is not necessary to go so far as that. The appellant knew there was some system in operation among the members of the Exchange by which profits could be made through speculating in sales and purchases for future delivery; and it was this system he wished to take advantage of. He desired and expected the benefit of all the advantages the respondents could offer their clients; he expected doubtless to have them act as they would act for themselves. If anybody had conceived the impracticable idea that, in executing his commissions they should buy only from persons who were not members of the Clearing House Association or sell only to such persons I think it is fair to assume he would have been the first to protest. Yet that would be the necessary effect of the appellant\u2019s construction by reason of the rigorous rule requiring all transactions between members of the Clearing House Association to be reported to the Association.\nOn a fair interpretation the stipulation that \u201call purchases and sales\u201d are \u201cmade in accordance with and subject to the\u201d * * * \u201ccustoms of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange\u201d seems to authorize these transactions. It would assuredly not be \u201cin accordance with\u201d the \u201ccustoms\u201d of the Exchange for a member of the Clearing House Association, in executing commissions for a client, to confine himself in his dealings with persons not members of the Association; nor would it be \u201cin accordance with\u201d those customs for members of the Association to fail to report their transactions to the Association and the requirement that a transaction between two members of the Association should be \u201cmade * * * subject\u201d to the \u201ccustoms\u201d of the Exchange would seem to import that a practice not only obligatory, but universally observed as regards such transactions should be followed.\nBut it is said that there is a series of decisions which oblige us to hold that the duty of the respondents was to establish privity of contract between the appellant and somebody else in each one of these transactions. I think that is a proposition which cannot be sustained. Lord Blackburn in his judgment in Robinson v. Mollett[4], pointed out that where a merchant instructs an agent in a foreign country to enter into a contract for him, the rule founded upon the presumed intention of the parties in the circumstances is that the agent contracts as principal and not as representative. In Clarke v. Bailie[5], I called attention to the fact that in the State of Massachusetts (see Chase v. City of Boston[6]) stockbrokers engaged in buying on margins for their clients are deemed to buy on their own account entering at the same time into an executory agreement to sell to the client on demand at the market price. That seems also the legal effect of transactions on the London Stock Exchange known as \u201ccontango\u201d transactions which constitute, apparently, a very large proportion indeed of the transactions on the Exchange. There is nothing startling or inherently improbable in the idea of a person buying and selling on margin speculation, that is to say, by the aid of the credit of a broker or a commission merchant who lends his credit for a commission, agreeing with the broker or the commission merchant that in the transactions in which he expects to make his profits the commission merchant shall act as principal while at the same time the client or customer shall be entitled to the profit derived from the transaction.\nRobinson v. Mollett4, and cases following it, are the authorities chiefly relied upon. But, the principle of those cases appears to have no application to the circumstances now under consideration. The plaintiff there relied upon an implied term of his employment founded upon a custom of his trade. It was held that a custom which, on being imported, would have the effect of altering the essential character of the employment could not be implied by law. It was not held that the plaintiff must fail if the contract of employment had expressly or by necessary implication provided that the employment was to be subject to a specified custom or the custom of the trade, whatever it might be, or if the circumstances shewed such to be the intention. Lord Blackburn, page 810, then Blackburn J.[7], uses these words:\u2014\nHad the order in the present case expressed that it was to buy according to the custom of the tallow market, there can, I think, be no question that the custom would have been incorporated, and that all that the plaintiffs did would have been in strict conformity with the authority given.\nLord Blackburn had been in the same case in the Exchequer Chamber and on the question which presented itself for decision (namely, whether in the absence of any reference to the custom in the written order on which the plaintiff acted, the custom was to be incorporated), he had differed from other very able judges, including Mr. Justice Willes, and I do not think he would have used the language quoted above if he had supposed they entertained a different opinion upon the point he is there dealing with.\nThe next question arises on the second branch of the defence, namely, whether these dealings were illegal. Section 231 of Criminal Code, R.S.C., ch. 146, declares:\u2014\n231. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to five years\u2019 imprisonment, and to a fine of five hundred dollars, who, with the intent to make gain or profit by the rise or fall in price of any stock of any incorporated or unincorporated company, or undertaking, either in Canada or elsewhere, or of any goods, wares or merchandise,\u2014\n(a) without the bon\u00e2 fide intention of acquiring any such shares, goods, wares or merchandise, or of selling the same as the case may be, makes or signs, or authorizes to be made or signed, any contract or agreement oral or written, purporting to be for the sale or purchase of any shares of stock, goods, wares or merchandise; or\n(b) makes or signs, or authorizes to be made or signed, any contract or agreement oral or written, purporting to be for the sale or purchase of any such shares of stock, goods, wares or merchandise, in respect of which no delivery of the thing sold or purchased is made or received, and without the bon\u00e2 fide intention to make or receive such delivery,\n2. It is not an offence under this section if the broker of the purchaser receives delivery, on his behalf, of the articles sold, notwithstanding that such broker retains or pledges the same as security for the advance of the purchase money or any part thereof.\nThis enactment first appeared in 1888, 51 Vict., ch. 42. The preamble to the Act shews that the legislature had in view the suppression of \u201cbucket shops.\u201d A \u201cbucket shop\u201d has been held to be a place where bets are made as to the rise or fall of commodities under the guise of fictitious sales and purchases. See Pearson v. Carpenter[8]. Now it cannot be contended that the sales and purchases entered into by the respondents for the account of the appellant were fictitious. In each case there was an actual contract. It is quite true that in each of these cases the contract, on being reported to the Clearing House Association and accepted by the manager, became pursuant to the rules of the Association transformed into two contracts in the manner already described, hut these two contracts were legally binding contracts which either party could be called upon at the proper time to fulfil and which in the ordinary course would be fulfilled either by the delivery of the commodity sold and the payment of the purchase price actually or by setting off the performance of one contract against the performance of another between the same parties relating to the same commodity deliverable at the same time.\nThe evidence shews that the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and the Winnipeg Clearing House are not mere conveniences for speculation. All transactions for future delivery, in fact, take place through the Grain Exchange and the vast majority apparently through the instrumentality of the Clearing House Association. When the commission merchant buys or sells for future delivery on the exchange and the transaction takes place between two members of the Clearing House Association, the commission merchant enters into a contract which he knows he will be obliged to carry out either by payment or delivery actually or by set-off of payments against the exigible obligations under some other real contract which has been accepted by the manager of the Clearing House Association. I think the following observations of Mr. Justice Holmes in Board of Trade of Chicago v. Christie Grain and Stock Co.[9], at page 247, are pertinent:\u2014\nAs has appeared, the plaintiff\u2019s Chamber of Commerce is, in the first place, a great market, where, through its eighteen hundred members, is transacted a large part of the grain and provision business of the world. Of course, in a modern market, contracts are not confined to sales for immediate delivery. People will endeavour to forecast the future and to make agreements according to their prophecy. Speculation of this kind by competent men is the self-adjustment of society to the probable. Its value is well known as a means of avoiding or mitigating catastrophes, equalizing prices and providing for periods of want. It is true that the success of the strong induces imitation by the weak, and that incompetent persons bring themselves to ruin by undertaking to speculate in their turn. But legislatures and courts generally have recognized that the natural evolutions of a complex society are to be touched only with a very cautious hand, and that such coarse attempts at a remedy for the waste incident to every social function as a simple prohibition and laws to stop its being are harmful and vain. This court has upheld sales of stock for future delivery and the substitution of parties provided for by the rules of the Chicago Stock Exchange: Clews v. Jamieson[10].\nWhen the Chicago Board of Trade was incorporated, we cannot doubt that it was expected to afford a market for future as well as present sales, with the necessary incidents of such a market, and while the state of Illinois allows that charter to stand, we cannot believe that the pits, merely as places where future sales are made, are forbidden by the law. But again, the contracts made in the pits are contracts between the members. We must suppose that from the beginning as now, if a member had a contract with another member to buy a certain amount of wheat at a certain time, and another to sell the same amount at the same time, it would be deemed unnecessary to exchange warehouse receipts. We must suppose that then, as now, a settlement would be made by the payment of differences, after the analogy of a Clearing House. This naturally would take place no less that the contracts were made in good faith for actual delivery, since the result of actual delivery would be to leave the parties just where they were before. Set-off has all the effects of delivery. The ring settlement is simply a more complex case of the same kind. These settlements would be frequent, as the number of persons buying and selling was comparatively small.\nThe fact that contracts are satisfied in this way by set-off and the payment of differences detracts in no degree from the good faith of the parties and if the parties know when they make such contracts that they are very likely to have a chance to satisfy them in that way and intend to make use of it, that fact is perfectly consistent with a serious business purpose and an intent that the contract shall mean what it says. There is no doubt, from the rules of the Board of Trade or the evidence, that the contracts made between the members are intended and supposed to be binding in manner and form as they are made. There is no doubt that a large part of those contracts is made for serious business purposes. Hedging, for instance, as it is called, is a means by which collectors and exporters of grain or other products, and manufacturers who make contracts in advance for the sale of their goods, secure themselves against the fluctuations of the market by counter contracts for the purchase or sale as the case may be, of an equal quantity of the product, or of the material of manufacture. It is none the less a serious business contract for a legitimate and useful purpose that it may be offset before the time of delivery in case delivery should not be needed or desired. In point of fact, the particular transactions entered into in this case were transactions with milling companies or other exporters and, as regards the sales, the evidence of the respondents\u2019 manager is that in every case the warehouse receipts were actually delivered.\nThe argument most strongly pressed upon us under this head was that the appellant had no bon\u00e2 fide intention of acquiring any commodity or selling any commodity or of making or receiving delivery of any commodity. What I have already said as to the intention of the appellant furnishes, I apprehend, the answer to this argument. The appellant\u2019s intention was to \u201cspeculate in futures\u201d but to do so by means of sales and purchases of commodities for future delivery by the respondents \u201cin accordance and subject to the rules, regulations and customs of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.\u201d The contracts authorized were to be contracts in accordance with those rules, regulations and customs. As the authority was in fact executed the contracts entered into were contracts to which the appellant was not a party. They were not contracts which in any way professed to be purchases or sales by him, or to give him the right to demand delivery, or to insist upon delivery being taken. But they were contracts in every case, as I have already pointed out, which bound the respondents as principals in a contract of sale or purchase to make or receive delivery as the case might be; and there is no support in the evidence \u2014 indeed, the evidence is entirely against it \u2014 for the proposition that the respondents in entering into these contracts had no intention of acquiring commodities or selling commodities or to make or receive delivery. Anglin J.\u2014The facts of this case are fully stated in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba.\nThe plaintiffs sue to recover moneys expended by them in alleged discharge of their employment as brokers of the defendant. It is essential to their right to recover that they should prove that this expenditure was incurred in carrying out the commission entrusted to them. Either failure on their part to establish that, or proof that the undertaking was itself illegal, is fatal to their right to recover.\nTheir commission was to procure persons to enter into binding contracts to buy grain from the defendant. It is admitted that, although they made contracts with other brokers for the sale of grain in the quantities stipulated, these contracts were all subject to the rules of the Clearing House Association \u2014 an adjunct of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. It is conclusively established by, the evidence that, as the result of what the plaintiffs did in professed fulfilment of the defendant\u2019s commission, he did not, and it was intended that he should not, obtain any contract whereby any other person became and remained bound to him as a purchaser of the grain which he instructed the plaintiffs to sell on his account. By the system of the Clearing House his purchasers and their brokers were discharged, on the respective days on which the several contracts were made, from any obligations under them to accept, delivery from, and make payment to, the defendant. That obligation was assumed by the Clearing House and was in turn set off by it against other obligations of the plaintiffs to the Clearing House. The adjustment of accounts between the plaintiffs and the Clearing House would afford a complete answer to any claim which the defendant might attempt to prefer against the Clearing House. In fact, as the net result of what occurred, the personal responsibility and solvency of the plaintiffs was the only security which the defendant had that, at the maturity of the contract he had employed them to make for him, purchasers would be available to take his grain and pay him the sale prices. Nobody else was under any contractual obligation to do so. Such an outcome is something so radically and essentially different from what is contemplated by the instructions ordinarily given to a broker to buy or sell stocks or commodities that it could be taken to be a performance of the broker\u2019s undertaking only upon the clearest proof that the principal knew of the rules which operated to produce it, and therefore contemplated the adoption of this method of carrying out his mandate. That the evidence does not establish. The present case, in my opinion, falls within the principle of the authorities cited and relied upon by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, in whose conclusions on this branch of the appeal I respectfully concur.\nWhile I do not rest my judgment on the ground of illegality, because in the view I take on the other question it becomes unnecessary that I should do so, I incline to think the evidence discloses that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant at any time contemplated that delivery of the grain sold should be made or taken under the agreements purporting to be contracts for the sale of such grain which the defendant authorized and the plaintiffs made. The intent always was to meet the obligation to deliver by an off-set of a contract to purchase a like quantity of grain \u2014 to adjust the differences between the selling and the buying prices and by thus dealing in such differences to make gain or profit by an anticipated fall in the price of the merchandise. Such transactions are within the literal terms of section 231 of the Criminal Code, and, I believe, are also within the mischief against which it was directed. The difference in morals between thus dealing in differences and speculative transactions in which there is an actual purchase accompanied by present or future receipt and a subsequent sale accompanied by delivery, the intent being to make profit by the rise in price of the commodity so dealt in, may not be very clear; but Parliament in its wisdom has deemed it proper to make this distinction, with the result that a transaction of the former class is, while one of the latter is not, malum prohibitum.\nFor these reasons I would allow this appeal and would dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Richards, Sweatman, Kemp & Fillmore.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Critchton, McClure & Larmonth.\n[1] 23 Man.

C. for the appellant.\nF. S. Maclennan K.C. for the respondent was not called upon for any oral argument. The Chief Justice.\u2014I think that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014Respondent is alleged to have acted in entering into the agreement here in question upon section 85 of the respondent\u2019s charter contained in 56 Vict., ch. 54, which reads as follows:\u2014\n85. The council shall have power to purchase, acquire and enter into any land, ground or real estate whatever, within the limits of the town, for the purpose of opening any street or roads through the same, or for forming or making any public parks or squares of a nature to conduce to the health or well-being of the inhabitants of the town, either by amicable arrangements, entered into between the corporation and the proprietors, or any persons interested, or by complying with the provisions, applicable to the corporation, respecting expropriations, and, in the event of its being necessary or advisable, for the purpose of such improvements, to acquire any larger tract of land than may be ultimately required for the purpose of such improvements.\nBy some means not very clear the Westmount Land Company, on the 15th September, 1897, induced respondent\u2019s council on its behalf to accept, for the purposes of streets, the gift of a few lots of the property which the company seems to have acquired and divided into lots, and, as appellant alleges, to agree to bind the respondent to assume the burden of constructing certain streets. The successors of that council have never been able to find it was necessary in the public interest to open said streets to the extent desired by appellant, who claims to be a purchaser of a considerable number of lots in the survey of the Westmount Land Co., Limited, to be served by said streets.\nHe claims herein a declaration that respondent is under the obligation arising from said contract \u201cto properly open and grade Grosvenor Avenue opposite\u201d his property \u201cand in its entire extent,\u201d and that the corporation, defendant, be condemned to pay him \u201cten thousand dollars with interest and costs.\u201d\nHe reserves all other rights and remedies and future damages.\nIt has been found by the two courts below as a matter of fact that the extension of the said street as demanded has never yet become necessary in the public interest.\nWhy should we, contrary to our usual rule (which, of course, has its exceptions) be asked to reverse such finding of fact?\nIt is suggested this fact is to be determined by the construction of the instrument relied upon by appellant and hence is not purely a question of fact, but rather of law.\nI see no reason to complain of the construction adopted by the learned trial judge which implies in the term \u201cwhen necessary\u201d only when in the public interest such work shall become necessary, and not merely when the prospects of the speculator making a profit might render it necessary to have the work done.\nIf the latter must be the construction put upon the contract, then it was an illegal contract.\nIndeed, if the private interest in any other way than when and so far as that interest might coincide with the public interest were to be allowed to enter into the making of such a contract it must be held null and can furnish no basis for any undertaking by such a corporate body as the respondent.\nIn addition to the authorities upon which the learned judge relied I might refer to such cases as In re Morton and City of St. Thomas[1], and Pells v. Boswell[2], where, as well as in a note on page 333 in Biggar\u2019s Municipal Manual, numerous authorities are collected which shew how jealously the courts have guarded against the infringement of the principle. Most of these cases turned upon just such municipal power as given respondent\u2019s council by above-quoted section of the statute.\nAnd though not binding upon this court they illustrate a principle of law which does bind this as well as other courts.\nIndeed, I know of nothing in the administration of our municipal systems which needs one to be more watchful lest evil creep in, than in relation to just such cases as this. It is so easy to present a plausible case of alleged identity of public and private interest (an apt, but inaccurate, phrase) when in truth it may only be the latter that is kept in view.\nA perusal of the evidence herein in support of appellant\u2019s case alone destroys any possibility of holding such a work as sought herein to have execution decreed and the expenses thereof to be imposed upon the public by order of the court as in truth necessary from a purely public interest in its promotion.\nIt is a work evidently needed to develop the appellant\u2019s property. The expense would be quite beyond what any reasonable expectations on the part of the public to reap any benefit therefrom can be found to justify.\nThere is no similarity between this case and what was agreed to be done in the case of Town of Outremoni v. Joyce[3]. The only relation the cases can have is that that case illustrated how there may be an identity of private and public interest, and this case shews how impossible it is to find that identity. I shall not labour the matter.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff seeks to enforce an agreement whereby the defendant municipality undertook to open a portion of Grosvenor Avenue \u201cwhen necessary.\u201d The court of appeal, confirming the dispositif of the judgment of the Superior Court, held that the plaintiff had failed to prove that such opening had become necessary.\nThe plaintiff complains that without the opening of Grosvenor Avenue his land abutting upon it is inaccessible owing to the lowering of the grade of the boulevard on the south side of the property by the defendant municipality. He maintains that this fact makes the opening of Grosvenor Avenue necessary. There are no residences on lands abutting on Grosvenor Avenue except a summer cottage, and no other land-owner has asked for the opening of the street.\nUnless we are to attribute to the municipal council the intention of making a most improper agreement, one wholly for the benefit of the Westmount Land Company and its grantees and disadvantageous and unfair to the city at large and its ratepayers, which would be an improper exercise of their powers, In re Morton and City of St. Thomas[4], we must give to the word \u201cnecessary\u201d the meaning \u201cnecessary in the public or general interest,\u201d and not merely in the interest of the other party to the agreement. That is, in my opinion, the meaning which should be given to it. I agree with Mr. Justice Carroll that such necessity has not been shewn.\nMoreover, I think it is reasonable and proper to ascribe to the municipal council the intention to preserve to itself and to its successors the right to determine when such necessity shall have arisen. It can scarcely have meant to abdicate the discretionary power in regard to opening streets vested in it by the legislature and to confer upon the courts the right to decide when that power should be exercised. Such an abdication would result from the agreement if construed as the appellant contends for. Looked at most favourably to the plaintiff the word \u201cnecessary\u201d is ambiguous and should not be given a construction which would imply grave dereliction of duty by a public body.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

The Harbour Commissioners demurred to the action on the ground that the Imperial \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act, 1893,\u201d was made applicable to the admiralty jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada by the provisions of sub-sections 2 and proviso (a) of sub-section 3 of section 2 of the \u201cColonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890\u201d (Imp.), 53 & 54 Vict. ch. 27, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action, if any, was barred by the limitation of six months provided by the first section of the \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act, 1893.\u201d\nOn the hearing upon the demurrer before Dunlop, J., local judge for the Quebec Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada, the demurrer was maintained and the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed. By the judgment appealed from, Mr. Justice Cassels reversed this decision and dismissed the demurrer with costs.\nPeers Davidson K.C. for the appellants.\nHolden K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the opinion stated by Cassels J.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of whether or not the \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act, 1893,\u201d can be pleaded in the Exchequer Court of Canada (in the Quebec Admiralty District) in answer to a claim for damages alleged to have been caused by the negligence of appellants.\nThe case is presented to us in argument for appellant as one of jurisdiction. Even so, I am by no means convinced that Parliament intended in its creation of the jurisdiction to carry into every place where exercised the local law now invoked. Indeed, I see many reasons why it might not so intend and especially when we consider that the Statute of Limitations is, generally speaking, a personal privilege having relation to the subject-matter in question in litigation and that, as a defence, it must be clear that the legislature intended to confer it upon the party setting it up. The statute relied upon herein is clearly applicable only to those acting in the United Kingdom and, certainly, is not by any terms used therein or elsewhere made clearly applicable to any causes of action arising else where and not out of any act or omission of those it applies to.\nIn a sense it may even seem or may be made to seem, as urged here, to be a question of jurisdiction as illustrated in the case of The Metropolitan Water Board v. Bunn[2], from which it would seem that the same subject-matter might in one forum give rise to the defence resting upon one statutory limitation and yet be met in another forum by another statute of that sort.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court, in his reasons, has so fully dealt with the matter that I need not repeat his argument here, but adopt it as properly maintaining his decision.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I do not think the \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act\u201d can reasonably be said to be an Act relating to admiralty jurisdiction.\nI do not think that sub-section 2 of section 2, which authorizes the Colonial Court of Admiralty to exercise admiralty jurisdiction in like manner and to as full an extent as in the High Court in England, contemplates the giving effect to such statutes as the \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act\u201d by the colonial court.\nI think it is in respect of the exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction as such that the phrase \u201cin like manner and to as full an extent as the High Court in England\u201d is used.\nI may add that I fully concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cassels and I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Cassels, to which I cannot usefully add anything, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The Imperial Parliament never intended, when they passed, in 1893, the \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act,\u201d that it should apply to Canada in proceedings before our Court of Admiralty. On the contrary, it is formally declared that the limitation enacted by that Act could be invoked only in the actions instituted in the United Kingdom.\nThe appellants rely on a provision of the \u201cColonial Courts of Admiralty Act\u201d of 1890, in which it was declared that\nany enactment in an Act of the Imperial Parliament referring to the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England, when applied to a Colonial Court of Admiralty in a British possession, shall be read as if the name of that possession were therein substituted for England and Wales.\nThat last provision, as we may see, in reading the \u201cAdmiralty Court Act\u201d of 1861, is passed with a view of restricting the jurisdiction of our admiralty courts to cases where the ships are registered in Canada or where the ship\u2019s owners, or some of them, are domiciled here.\nWe cannot, then, under that special provision of the Act of 1890, incorporate the \u201cPublic Authorities Protection Act\u201d in our local admiralty jurisdiction when the Imperial Parliament declared specifically it should apply only to actions instituted in the United Kingdom.\nIt would have required express words or necessary intendment in order that such a provision would apply in our country.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A. R. Angers.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, Macpherson, Hague, Holden & Shaughnessy.\n[1] 15 Ey C.R.\n[2] [1913] 1 Q.B. 134.\n"

Respondent.\n1914: March 4; 1914: May 18.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT, SITTING IN REVIEW, AT MONTREAL.\n\u201cNegligence \u2014 Construction contract \u2014 Sub-contract \u2014 Dangerous premises\u2014Servant or agent\u2014Building materials\u2014Duty of principal contractor\u2014Injury to invitee\u2014Responsibility for damages\u2014Evidence\u2014Findings of jury.\nThe McG. Co., contractors for plumbing and heating in a building under construction, sub-let part of their contract to the R. Co., who manufactured the necessary material at Amherst, N.S., and at one time shipped a boiler-plate for use in executing their subcontract consigned to the McG. Co. at Montreal. The McG. Co. sent the advice note of the shipment to the R. Co.\u2019s local representative, who employed carters to get the plate from the railway company and carry it to the place where the works were being carried on. It was, under directions of the McG. Co.\u2019s foreman, leaned up against a pillar of the building and remained there for about one day in a position where it projected over a part of the cartway used for bringing materials into the building. T. applied for employment as a labourer on the works and was told to return next day which he did and, while waiting to be employed, stood near the plate. When a vehicle entered the cartway the plate fell upon T., causing injuries from which he died. In an action by his dependents to recover damages from the R. Co. and the McG. Co.,\u2014\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances, the McG. Co. were responsible for damages; that the fault from which the injury resulted was that of their foreman who, acting as their servant or agent, supervised the placing of the plate in a dangerous position, and that the plate itself was a thing which was, at the time, in the care of the McG. Co. Lucy v. Bawden ([1914] 2 K.B. 318), referred to. Held, also, Anglin J. dissenting, that the evidence shewing the circumstances stated justified the jury in finding that deceased was lawfully in the place where the accident occurred, that he had not been guilty of contributory negligence, and that the accident was due to negligence of the McG. Co. and the sub-contractors in placing the plate in a dangerous position.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of Greenshields J., in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal, whereby, upon a verdict in favour of the plaintiff, judgment was entered for the plaintiff for $5,000 damages, apportioned between the plaintiff and her minor children, with costs.\nThe action was brought by the respondent, plaintiff on her own behalf and as tutrix for her minor children, against the present appellants and the Robb Engineering Company, claiming from them, jointly and severally, damages sustained in consequence of the death of Joseph Tunley, deceased husband of the respondent and father of her minor children, his death having been caused, as alleged, on account of the negligence of both defendants in the circumstances stated in the head-note.\nThe trial took place before Mr. Justice Greenshields and a special jury, to which questions were submitted and answered, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cQuestion.\u20141. Was Joseph Tunley, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, the victim of an accident, on or about the 9th November, 1909, while within or upon the premises known as the Jacobs Building, on St. Catherine Street in Montreal?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014Yes.\n\u201cQuestion.\u20142. Was the plaintiff\u2019s husband lawfully in the place where he was injured at the time of the said accident? \u201cAnswer.\u2014Yes.\n\u201cQuestion.\u20143. Did the said Joseph Tunley die, on the 18th December, 1911, as a result of the said accident?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014Yes.\n\u201cQuestion.\u20144. Was the accident due to the sole fault, negligence and want of care of the said Joseph Tunley, and if so, in what did such fault and negligence consist?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201cQuestion.\u20145. Was the accident due to the sole fault and negligence of:\u2014\n\u201c(a) The Robb Engineering Company, Limited? \u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201c(b) Meldrum Bros., Limited?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201c(c) W. J. McGuire & Company, Limited?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201c(d) Emile Gellin?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201c(e) One or more of them, and, if so, in what did their respective fault and negligence consist?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014Due to the neglect, fault, want of care and lack of supervision of The Robb Engineering Company, Limited, and W. J. McGuire & Co., Limited, by placing the piece of iron in a dangerous position.\n\u201cQuestion.\u20146. Was the accident due to the combined fault and negligence of the said Joseph Tunley and\n\u201c(a) The Robb Engineering Company, Limited?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201c(b) Meldrum Bros., Limited?\n\u201cAnswer:\u2014No.\n\u201c(c) W. J. McGuire Company, Limited? \u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201c(d) Emile Gellin?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201cAnd if so, in what did their respective fault and negligence consist?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014No.\n\u201cQuestion.\u20147. Has the plaintiff, as well personally as in her quality of tutrix to her two minor children suffered damage by reason of the said accident, and if so, in what amount?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014Yes, $5,000 (five thousand dollars).\n\u201cQuestion.\u20148. If you have answered question 6 in the affirmative, that the accident was due to the combined fault and negligence of the late Joseph Tunley and any of the four defendants, in what amount do you fix the contribution of the said Joseph Tunley in the damage assessed by you in answer to question No. 7 and to what amount do you fix the contribution of the defendants or of any of them?\n\u201cAnswer.\u2014All unanimous.\u201d\nUpon the answers so given by the jury, His Lordship Mr. Justice Greenshields ordered judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiff, for the damages assessed, apportioned, as follows: $2,500 to the plaintiff personally, and $1,250 to each of her minor children, and condemned the defendants the Robb Engineering Company and the W. J. McGuire Company to pay the said sums jointly and severally, with interest and costs. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nMann K.C. for the appellants.\nAtwater K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Duff J. Idington J.\u2014There are two questions raised by this appeal. The first is as to the right of the deceased to be where he was when the metal fell upon him. This is hardly arguable upon the facts shewing an invitation to be there. The jury has passed upon it as they were entitled to upon such facts.\nThe other question is as to the scope of the authority which one Finlay had from appellants when he directed the placing of the metal where it was placed.\nThe appellant had a contract from the proprietor to do the work upon the building, and it was in the doing of such work that this accident was caused whereby the deceased was injured.\nPart of the work undertaken by appellant had been sub-let by it to the Robb Engineering Company. If nothing more had transpired for consideration possibly appellant might have relied upon this sub-contract to exonerate it.\nThe case is, however, by no means so simple in its character as that.\nThe appellant contracted with the proprietor:\u2014\nTo assume all liability for damage or injury occurring to any persons or property through neglect or illegal acts of the said party of the second part, his contractors, sub-contractors, agents or servants, and to indemnify and save harmless the party of the first part all claims caused by reason of said damage or injury.\nAs between the proprietor and deceased it might well be said that the invitation by which deceased came there was in last analysis what the proprietor authorized. Whether in law the proprietor could have been held liable need not be passed upon. He desired appellant should take all that risk and it did so. It was thus, as well as by implication of law in executing its contract with the proprietor, bound to take due care that the execution thereof should not lead to injury to others. It became the duty of its foreman in charge to do all that his master and his master\u2019s interest in the premises might call for in order to avert any possibility of risk to the master by reason of anything happening within the scope of the master\u2019s plenary authority as to the execution of the contract with the proprietor.\nIf the sub-contractor had attempted to do anything in execution of its share of the work which might have tended in any way not merely to render the appellant liable to an action upon its undertaking with the proprietor, but tended to involve it in the risk thereof, I think appellant would in such event have been entitled to insist upon desistment from such attempts so far as could reasonably be required.\nSuppose the appellant instead of being a corporation had been a person then in the building under such circumstances at the time the metal in question was brought by the carters he would have had a perfect right to have insisted upon the metal being placed back out of the way of doing any damage to any one.\nAnd even if there was no legal obligation resting upon such a man to interfere actively, regarding which I say nothing, his right, nevertheless, to interfere as against a sub-contractor insisting upon running such risks, would be undoubted unless, of course, he had contracted specifically not to do so; and in some classes of cases he might find he had rendered himself liable for the acts of his sub-contractor.\nWhat I wish to make clear is that though there is a line yet it is by no means a well-defined line, in law, which renders it safe for any man sub-letting his work to overlook the delinquencies of his sub-contractor in this regard.\nThen in view of all this and the reasonable expectations of a contracting employer to have his foreman look after his interests, how can I say that one who did so under such circumstances as existed here could be disavowed as acting without authority and beyond the scope thereof? And when we find that this foreman exercised his authority on more than one occasion by taking the gang under his charge, or four or five of them, to do the very thing now complained of, to help the sub-contractor, is it not drawing it rather fine to say he had authority on several occasions to do this, but yet none to direct how these men of the appellant should assist in such work? Is it not asking too much when appealing here to ask us to say he had authority to spend his master\u2019s money in this way, but none to direct the proper use of such service? To say he had authority to take the appellant\u2019s men to do the work, but none to insist upon its being done in a proper manner, seems illogical.\nNow there was one of these occasions on which the appellant\u2019s foreman induced the carter\u2019s men to place the goods in a proper place, but on this latter occasion the foreman neglected this duty or part of his duty. As to this later occasion he denies interfering in any way but by helping with his men acting in obedience to his orders. The carter\u2019s man says not only did he interfere, but actually directed where the gang, including his own, were to put the metal in question.\nIt was for the jury to say which of these men they believed, and I assume they believed the carter\u2019s man.\nAnd when we are asked to accept such denial of authority as the foreman did make I must assume on the facts that this jury had to act upon they had a right to discredit this part of his story and did so. Moreover, no one over this foreman has ventured to appear in the witness box and add to the force of his denial or give more definite meaning to the limits of his authority than what we may gather from the course of conduct he manifests and the definition he gives in his evidence quoted hereafter.\nThe jury were then face to face with such narrow line of authority as is implied in the substantial leading facts relative to appellant\u2019s relation to the whole matter in ways I have set forth and in addition thereto as appears in the following evidence of the foreman:\u2014\nQ. In the month of November, 1909, you were foreman for the W. J. McGuire Company, Limited, were you not?\nA. Yes.\nQ. In the Jacobs Building on St. Catherine Street?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You had been foreman for a long time before that?\nWitness: Foreman for the McGuire Company?\nCounsel: Yes, in that building?\nA. Since the building started.\nQ. When would that be?\nA. About May, 1909. No, I think it started in the fall.\nQ. Were you present in the month of November, 1909, when a delivery was made of a part of the end of a boiler?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What time of the day was that?\nA. That was just about ten minutes to twelve, or so.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. Did the lorry that brought this piece of iron in stop near this column?\nA. A little bit from it. Pretty near it, but a little bit away.\nQ. When it came in was it lying flat on the lorry?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Then your men with the Meldrum men canted it up and slid it down off the lorry?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You did not lift it clear? A. We had to slide it off the rig.\nQ. There was only one passage for a cart to come in from Alexandra Street into the building?\nA. One passage, yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. You were McGuire\u2019s principal foreman on the building, were you not?\nA. Yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. You and your men were present during the whole time this boiler front was being put into the position described by you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you not advise them at all in any way as to the manner in which this boiler plate should be placed against the pillar?\nA Yes. It was placed against the column, and I suggested that they had better move it a little farther back from the position that we had placed it. I thought it might make it a little safer.\nQ. You suggested, I think, that they should give it a little more cant?\nA. A little more cant.\nAnd speaking of the part taken in the unloading of the piece of metal which later fell on deceased, he says:\u2014\nQ. You had it taken off?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you have some of your men there to help you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How many?\nA. Well, I cannot say exactly how many.\nQ. Did you have ten of them?\nA. Oh, no. There were three or four of us, anyhow.\nQ. You and the men of the W. J. McGuire Company, Ltd., helped the Meldrum people to take that piece of boiler out of the wagon?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And, altogether you placed it where?\nWitness: The second piece?\nCounsel: Yes, that big piece of iron?\nA. We placed it against the column.\nI think this evidence, together with the circumstances I have adverted to shewing the relation of appellant to the work in question, form such evidence as could not be withdrawn from the jury. Upon their verdict so submitted the judgment rests and must be upheld.\nI, therefore, think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The question of agency is a question of fact and the point to be considered in this connection is whether there was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that in taking charge of the boiler ends Finlay acted as servant or agent for the appellants. Consider the facts:\u2014Jacobs, the owner, who was constructing the building, had let various contracts; one was a contract for doing the concrete work, that is, for putting up the frame of the building; another was a contract with the appellants for the plumbing. Under the latter contract the appellants were obliged to have certain boilers in operation according to a certain specification on a named date.\nThe appellants let to the Robb Engineering Co. a sub-contract for the erection and completion of these boilers which the Robb Company agreed to finish by the 30th of November, 1909. There can be no doubt, of course, that McGuire & Co. were entitled to sub-let a part of their contract with Jacobs, their relation to Jacobs being that of contractors merely who had undertaken to produce a certain result. The contract with Jacobs, which is in the evidence, obviously contemplated the letting of sub-contracts. On the other hand, McGuire & Company specifically covenant to\nindemnify and save harmless the owner from all claims, loss, or cost by reason of damage or injury to any persons or property through the negligence\nof these sub-contractors.\nThe Robb Engineering Company had their factory at Amherst, N.S., where the parts required for the execution of their contracts were made. These they shipped to Montreal, and they appear to have been in the habit of sending these parts to the building without making any express provision for their reception. Of this the appellants appear to have been complaining. It was obviously in the interest of McGuire & Co. to see that these parts were received and properly taken care of. In the first place they were under a contract to complete their work by a given time. In the next place, they were bound by the covenant to which I have already referred, and pieces of heavy machinery, carelessly placed by carters without proper directions may cause damage. In the third place, it might cause inconvenience to other contractors working in the same building and all the contractors so situated would be naturally interested in mutually accommodating one another in order to avoid unnecessary delays in executing the work; while Robb & Co. were sub-contractors, for whose actions they would not be directly responsible in a legal sense, still these sub-contractors had been engaged by McGuire & Co. to perform a part of their contract, and it was altogether natural that they and their workmen should take an interest in seeing that the sub-contract was not carried out in such a way as to give unnecessary trouble to others. All these points lend weight to the probability that McGuire & Co. would expect their foreman in their interest to exercise some supervision in the absence from the premises of anybody having authority from Robb & Co. in the placing of these pieces.\nComing now to the particular circumstances:\u2014the boiler ends in question were shipped by Robb & Co. to McGuire & Co. It is not explained why this was done in this particular case unless it was in accordance with the usual practice. At the request of Robb & Co.\u2019s manager in Montreal, the McGuire Company gave to a carter furnished by Robb & Co., the shipping documents shewing the articles directed to McGuire & Co. with instructions to obtain them from the railway company and deliver them at the premises in question. In the circumstances the carter naturally treated these goods as goods deliverable to McGuire & Co., and I think the jury would be entitled to find that they were so treated with the concurrence of McGuire & Co. When they reached the premises, there being nobody there representing Robb & Co., Finlay, McGuire & Co.\u2019s foreman, assumed control of them, and it is upon Finlay\u2019s negligence, assuming there was negligence, that McGuire & Co. are charged.\nTaking all the circumstances I have mentioned together, it appears to me that the jury would be entitled to find \u2014 and I must say that I do not think that it would be a conclusion In the least unreasonable \u2014 that Finlay was acting in the interest of and for McGuire & Co. with their authority, and not either giving his services to the Robb Co. or simply acting gratuitously in general interest.\nI have only one more word to add on this point, and that is with the object of emphasizing this:\u2014That the question as to whether Finlay was acting within the scope of some authority he had from the McGuires, is simply a question of fact, and for the purpose of determining this question I do not think that judicial decisions upon other states of fact can be of much value. The point upon which the jury had to pass was whether in view of all the circumstances Finlay was doing something which he and his employers understood he was there to do. That question was, I think, put to the jury with entire fairness and in such a way that I believe they could not fail to understand the nature of the question they were called upon to decide and being, indeed, far from certain that I should not have taken the same view as the jury did upon this question, I think there is here no good ground for setting aside their verdict.\nThen comes the question as to whether there was evidence of negligence. Now I think the test to be applied is this. The owner of the building as occupier owed a certain duty to persons invited to come upon the premises in the ordinary course of business. I think that, as regards positive acts, the responsibility of the concrete contractors would be the same as that of the owner, and I think, also, that any other person engaged in the work of construction, as the appellants were, would be under precisely the same responsibility as to his own positive acts in relation to such persons as the owner would be. To put the point a little more concretely:\u2014McGuire & Co., were, in my judgment, bound, as regards such acts, to use the same care, that is to say, they were under the same duty to persons properly on the premises in the course of their business with any of the contractors engaged in the construction of the building as the owner would be obliged to use with regard to persons invited by him or as any particular contractor would be obliged to use with regard to the safety of persons invited by that contractor himself. I am now speaking, let me repeat, of positive acts only. What then, is the measure of that duty? The nature of the situation with which we are dealing must not be left out of sight. Here is a building in course of erection. Different contractors are engaged at one and the same time in carrying on different operations. In the very nature of things the possibilities of injury are numerous. It would be most unreasonable that anybody going into such a place, in the ordinary way of business, should expect to find himself at every point protected against these possibilities as if he were a person incapable of taking care of himself. A person going into such a place assumes a certain amount of risk. He himself assumes the responsibility of exercising vigilance of a person of ordinary faculties and judgment in order to avoid the reasonably probable dangers of such a place, and the responsibility of the occupier must be considered in relation to this responsibility of the invitee. The result, I think, has been summed up by Mr. Justice Atkin in Lucy v. Bawden[1], in the proposition that the duty is to avoid setting traps.\nComing to the particular case before us, Bridget, so long as he kept to the way provided for persons coming on the premises, or apparently provided, was entitled to assume that there were no traps. I have had a great deal of difficulty in satisfying myself whether there was evidence in this case to convict Finlay of doing what could be fairly called setting a trap. I think the point is a very doubtful one, and I do not feel justified in going further than saying that I am not satisfied that there was not sufficient evidence to support the finding of the jury.\nAnglin.J. (dissenting).\u2014I am, with very great respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The deceased Tunley was, no doubt, upon the premises where he was injured as an invitee. Persons employed on the premises or lawfully there might reasonably be expected to be where he was when the boiler end fell upon him. If the placing of this boiler end where it was had been attributable to the appellants, I should not have been prepared to disturb the verdict and judgment against them. But I find nothing in the evidence to justify fixing them with responsibility either for placing or leaving the boiler end in the dangerous position in which it was.\nThe appellants were contractors with the owner of the premises for the installation of a system of plumbing and steam-heating. Their contract, however, contemplated that they might sublet any part of the work. They undertook with the owner Jacobs\nto assume all liability for damage or injury occurring to any persons or property through the negligence or illegal acts of the said party of the second part, his contractors, sub-contractors, agents or servants; and to indemnify and save harmless the party of the first part from all claims, loss, or cost, by reason of such damage or injury.\nThe appellants in fact sublet to their co-defendants, the Robb Engineeing Co., the contract for supplying and installing the boilers for the heating-system. Over that part of the work the appellants had no control or supervision. The Robb Engineering Co. were independent contractors.\nThe boilers were shipped in parts by the Robb Engineering Co. from their factory at Amherst, N.S. Through some unexplained mistake the end of the boiler which fell on the deceased Tunley was consigned to the defendants, The W. J. McGuire Co., instead of to the Robb Engineering Co. Immediately upon their being notified of its arrival at Montreal, the McGuire Company advised the Robb Engineering Company, and the latter company employed their co-defendants, Meldrum. Bros., Ltd., to deliver it at the Jacobs\u2019 building, as they had delivered other material. It is admitted that this boiler end was the property of the Robb Engineering Company, and it is clear that it was for them that the delivery was made by Meldrum Bros., Ltd.\nThere is nothing in the record to warrant an inference that there was any agreement or understanding whereby the appellants had undertaken to receive or to look after the Robb Company\u2019s material when it should be delivered at the Jacobs\u2019 building.\nWhen the lorry carrying the boiler end reached the building it was driven along a passage on the ground floor, to the third pillar, which, as Davidson C.J., says, was as far as its size would permit. There was nobody on the premises representing the Robb Engineering Company. The Meldrums\u2019 foreman, Little, went to the basement and informed one Finlay, foreman for the McGuire Company, who was engaged in installing the plumbing, of the arrival of the load.\nTo quote the learned Chief Justice:\u2014\nLittle swears he asked for instructions as to where the plate should be placed (and) got them. Finlay denies this and asserts that the only request was for assistance in the unloading. Some undisputed facts exist. Finlay took up three men and assisted in the unloading; the plate was stood up against the western face, sixteen inches wide, of the third octagonal pillar, with a space of about two feet between the base of the plate and the pillars, the end of which projected into the roadway; Finlay thought it might be knocked down and that for the sake of safety, it should be moved a little farther back from the road and also be given a little more cant; these suggestions were adopted. The plate still projected, however, about 18 inches into the roadway. So matters stood until shortly after seven of the following morning, when Gellin entered the passageway with his cart.\nIn passing the third pillar, Gellin turned to the right to avoid an outgoing cart, and his own cart probably struck the projecting boiler end which fell on top of Tunley and pinned him to the ground, causing injuries from which he died, some twenty-two months afterwards.\nUpon the evidence it is clear that in whatever Finlay may have done in the way of assisting to unload the boiler end \u2014 even if he directed where it should be placed \u2014 he was not engaged \u201cin the performance of the work for which he was employed\u201d by the appellants. Art. 1054, C.C. It was not part of their work to bring the material required for the boilers into the premises or to look after it when it had been brought there. Whatever Finlay did he did on his own responsibility and it was probably nothing more than rendering the friendly aid which one workman usually gives to another when help is required. If he suggested where the boiler plate should be placed \u2014 if he even undertook to direct that it should be put where it was \u2014 in doing so he was not acting as the servant or agent of the W. J. McGuire Co. If he made a mistake, if he did something which was negligent, there is, in my opinion, nothing to warrant a finding that the appellants were responsible for it. He was not discharging any duty which he owed to them. He was not acting for their benefit or within the scope of his employment. He was not \u201cunder the appellants\u2019 control\u201d within the meaning of article 1054 C.C.; nor was the boiler end a thing under their care. If he was acting for anybody other than himself it would be for the Robb Engineering Co. in whose interest he assisted the Meldrum employees. For collateral negligence of the Robb Company the appellants are not responsible, apart from the special provision in their contract above quoted. That clause of their contract might render the appellants liable to indemnify the owner, Jacobs, if he had been held responsible for the injuries sustained by Tunley. But it does not establish privity between Tunley and his representatives and the appellants.\nThe appellants should have their costs in this court and in the Court of Review and the action should be dismissed as against them with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014It is stated by the appellant company that the respondent\u2019s husband was a trespasser in the Jacobs building. The evidence shews, on the contrary, that the deceased had an implied invitation to go into that building to get employment. He was waiting for that purpose when he was struck by the end of the boiler in question. The jury were justified in finding that the respondent\u2019s husband was lawfully in the place where he was injured.\nAs to the question of negligence charged against the appellant company, the jury found that the accident was\ndue to the fault, want of care and lack of supervision of the Robb Engineering Company and W. J. McGuire & Co., Limited, by placing the piece of iron in a dangerous position.\nThe appellant, the W. J. McGuire Co., had the contract for the whole heating system in the Jacobs building. They could not sublet their contract without the written consent of the proprietor. They assumed also by their contract with Jacobs\nall liability for damage or injury occurring to any persons or property through the negligence or illegal acts of the said party of the second part, his contractors, sub-contractors, agents or servants.\nThe appellant made a sub-contract with the Robb Engineering Company, of Amherst, N.S., to supply and install the boilers that formed part of the heating system. One of the clauses of that sub-contract was to the effect that the appellant was\nto provide right-of-way, openings in buildings, fences, etc., and space necessary for the delivery and installation of the machinery.\nThe boilers were sent from Amherst to Montreal and consigned to the appellant company. It was, however, on the instruction of the local agent of the Robb Engineering Co. that the boilers were carted from the railway station to the Jacobs building. But there was nobody else representing the Robb Engineering Co. to receive the goods on the premises; and, as they were consigned to the McGuire Company, the carter applied to the McGuire Co.\u2019s foreman to get the place where those goods should be placed and the employees of the McGuire Co. also helped in unloading the goods and in negligently placing them in a part of the building where carts were constantly passing by.\nThe jury seems to have been properly charged by the judge presiding at the trial, since the counsel representing the appellants stated in answer to the judge\u2019s inquiry:\u2014\nMy Lord, I am thoroughly satisfied with your Lordship\u2019s charge.\nThe jury, with all those facts and circumstances in evidence have found that the appellants were guilty of negligence. That verdict has been upheld by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Review.\nThe jury could find the verdict they have rendered; and, in view of articles 498 and 503 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the appellants would not be entitled to have the plaintiffs\u2019 action dismissed or a new trial granted. I would refer to the case of Harold v. City of Montreal[2].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Foster, Martin, Mann & Mackinnon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davidson & Ritchie.\n[1] (1914) 2 K.B. 318.\n[2] (1) 3 L.C.L.J. 88.\n"

Williams v. Irvine (22 Can. S.C.R. 108); Hyde v. Lindsay (29 Can. S.C.R. 99) and Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving ([1905] A.C. 369) followed.\nMOTION referred to the court by the registrar for an order to have the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal affirmed.\nThe action was to obtain possession of goods or to recover their value. In the court of first instance judgment was given for the plaintiff with a reference to ascertain the value of the goods and report. This judgment was affirmed with a variation by the Appellate Division. Under the jurisprudence no appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada unless the amendment to the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which came into force on June 6th, 1913, applied to the case. The judgment of the trial judge was delivered on July 4th, 1913, and that of the Appellate Division on Nov. 21st, 1913, but the action was commenced before the Act came into force.\nW.L. Scott for the motion referred to Couture v. Bouchard[1], and attempted to distinguish Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving[2]\nCaldwell, contra, cited Williams v. Irvine[3]; Hyde v. Lindsay[4]; Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving 2.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and DAVIES J. were of opinion that the motion should be refused.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Having regard to the principles upon which this court proceeded in the case of Hyde v. Lindsay4, and other cases cited therein, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving2, I do not think this motion should succeed.\nDUFF J.\u2014I should refuse this motion.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This motion is concluded adversely to the appellant by the authority of Williams v. Irvine3, and Hyde v. Lindsay4. See, too, Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irvine2.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an application to affirm the jurisdiction of this court.\nThe whole point is whether the amendment of 1913 to the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d as to final judg- ments applies to a case in which the action began prior to the amendment, but where the judgment appealed against was rendered after the passing of the amendment.\nThat amendment has virtually created a right of appeal which did not exist before.\nThis court had decided in those last years that judgments ordering a reference were not final judgments and could not be appealed.\nClarke v. Goodall[5]; Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[6].\nThe Parliament at its last session declared that those judgments could be brought before this court.\nI would have been inclined to think that the right of appeal should be determined by the law in force at the time of the judgment and not by the date of the action. However a contrary jurisprudence of this court exists: see Hyde v. Lindsay[7]; Williams v. Irvine[8]; Mitchell v.

The judgment appealed from (25 West. L.R. 602, 14 D.L.R. 332) was affirmed. Per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington and Anglin jj.\u2014Where a mortgage has been registered, under the \u201cnew system,\u201d indorsed by the registrar as being subject to the caveat of a person claiming the right to have a mortgage in his favour executed affecting the same lands, the mortgagee who has been so registered cannot afterwards claim priority over the right of the caveator.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J. at the trial[2], maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nH. F. Tench for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Anglin J.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant had obtained a mortgage from his son upon some land which the son had agreed to mortgage to the respondent. To protect this agreement the respondent filed a caveat under the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d of Manitoba. The appellant then registered his mortgage and, as in duty bound, the registrar indorsed the following certificate thereon:\u2014\nAt the request of the mortgagee this mortgage is registered subject to caveat 62347.\nThe issue raised is whether or not the appellant is under such circumstances entitled to have it declared that his mortgage has priority over the right of the respondent. For the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge I think respondent was entitled to register his caveat and that the appellant cannot claim to have the same vacated and to have his mortgage prevail over the rights of the respondent in the premises.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The question on this appeal is whether a contract made by an owner of land in Manitoba, registered under the \u201cnew system,\u201d by which, for valuable consideration, he agrees to execute a mortgage on the land in favour of another will support a valid caveat under section 130 of the Manitoba \u201cReal Property Act.\u201d That section is as follows:\u2014\n130. Any person claiming an estate or interest in land, mortgage or incumbrance, under the new system, may file or cause to be filed on his behalf with the district registrar a caveat, in the form in schedule \u201cH\u201d to this Act, forbidding the registration of any person as transferee or owner of, or of any instrument affecting such real estate or interest, or unless such instrument be expressed to be subject to the claim of the caveator.\nThe appellant contends that the beneficiary of such a contract, claiming to enforce his right to have a mortgage executed in accordance with it, is not a person claiming \u201can estate or interest in land\u201d within this section. He puts his argument in this way:\u2014The mortgage when executed would not, he says, operate as a transfer of \u201cany estate or interest\u201d in the land and, consequently, a claim to compel the execution of a mortgage is not a claim to any such \u201cestate or interest.\u201d This argument is based upon section 100 of the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n100. A mortgage or an incumbrance under the new system shall have effect as security, but shall not operate as a transfer of land thereby charged, or of any estate or interest therein. I think the contention should be rejected. The effect of section 100 was fully considered in Smith v. The National Trust Co.[3]. It was there pointed out that, as regards land registered under the new system, title is consummated by registration and that the effect of section 100 is that the holder of a \u201cmortgage or incumbrance\u201d registered under the Act has not vested in him, in whole or in part, the registered title. The execution and registration of the mortgage, in a word, does not immediately effect any dismemberment of the mortgagor\u2019s registered title. In that sense the mortgagee has no estate or interest in the land.\nI entirely agree, however, with the learned trial judge, that it is something very much like a contradiction in terms to say that a mortgagee, having the powers of sale and foreclosure vested in him by the statute together with other rights as to the possession of the land which the statute gives him, has not, in the broader sense of the words, an interest in the mortgaged land. I do not think section 130 can properly be limited to those cases in which the claim is a claim to be registered as possessor, in whole or in part of the registered title. In other words, I do not think it can be properly limited to those cases in which an \u201cinterest\u201d is claimed in the restricted sense in which \u201cinterest\u201d is used in section 100.\nI think the respondent is within the section.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons which he assigns, I respectfully concur in the conclusion of Mathers C.J., affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the plaintiff had, under his agreement, an interest in lot 38 within the purview of section 130 of the Manitoba \u201cReal Property Act.\u201d\nThough not as clear or precise in its designation of the nature and extent of the plaintiff\u2019s interest as might be desired, the caveat lodged by him states the date of the agreement under which he claims and the parties to it. It also gives the name and address of a firm of solicitors representing him for the service of notices, etc. Its sufficiency for the purposes of the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d was presumably passed upon by the registrar before it was accepted and filed. The registration of the defendant\u2019s mortgage is expressly made subject to the caveat. Having regard to all these facts, I am not prepared to reverse the concurrent judgment of the two provincial courts which held it to be sufficient.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. F. Tench.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. E. Adamson.\n[1] 25 West. L.R. 602; 14 D.L.R. 332.\n[2] 22 West. L.R. 863; 8 D.L.R. 776.\n[3] 45 Can. S.C.R. 618.\n"

The company became insolvent and its liquidator brought action against the bank to set aside some of its securities which action was compromised, the bank receiving a certain amount, reserving its rights against the sureties and agreeing not to rank on the insolvent estate. The sureties were obliged to pay the bank and sought to rank for the amount.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (28 Ont. L.R. 481), that they were not debarred by the compromise of said action from so ranking.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], setting aside the order of Mr. Justice Middleton and restoring that of the local judge. The respondents, Coughlin and Irwin, sought to rank on the insolvent estate of the Stratford Fuel, etc., Co. as creditors for money paid to the Traders Bank for whom they were sureties for advances to the company. The bank, in settling an action brought by the liquidator of the company, had agreed not to rank on the assets and the claim of respondents was resisted on the ground that such agreement by the principal creditor was binding on the sureties. The matter came before Judge Barron, a local judge of the High Court, who decided that the respondents were entitled to rank and gave the following reasons:\u2014\n\u201cThe claim of Coughlin and Irwin is to rank on the estate of the Stratford Fuel, Ice, Cartage and Construction Company, Limited, in the hands of the liquidator, John Brown, for the sum of $5,624.80, of which the sum of $400 is admitted.\n\u201cThe claim is made, and it is opposed under the following circumstances: The company while in business became heavily indebted to the Traders Bank of Canada in the sum of $40,000 or thereabouts. They continued in business for some time, but on the 7th January, 1908, an order was made to wind up the said company under the R.S.C. 1906, ch. 144, and amending Acts.\n\u201cCoughlin and Irwin, with others, had become and were at the time of the liquidation proceedings, guarantors to the bank of the company for their full indebtedness. Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 contains this guarantee. The bank also held a mortgage dated the 27th August, 1907, from the company securing the full amount of its indebtedness. The liquidator, John Brown, brought an action against the bank, on the 13th February, 1908, to set aside the mortgage (and a second mort- gage) as void against the creditors, which action was settled on the eve of trial, and the settlement itself appears in the memorandum attached to the record. There still remains due to the bank, after this settlement, the sum of $......, or thereabouts, and the bank demanding payment from the guarantors on the guarantee bond, exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 the present claimants, Irwin and Coughlin, in pursuance of the demand, paid the sum of $6,624.80, of which they claim the sum above mentioned in regard to which there is no dispute.\n\u201cMr. Harding, in opposing the claim of Coughlin and Irwin contends, first: That the settlement made of the action of Brown against the Traders Bank had the effect in law of releasing the guarantors on their bond to the bank, and, therefore, that the payment by Coughlin and Irwin was a purely voluntary one on their parts, one which the bank could not legally insist upon, and sequitur, that Coughlin and Irwin cannot now legally rank on the estate in liquidation for a payment illegally made by them as against the liquidator. Secondly:\u2014Mr. Harding maintains that Coughlin and Irwin were privy to the settlement of the suit of Brown v. The Traders Bank, and, therefore, that they are bound by this settlement, and being so bound cannot now rank on the estate in the liquidator\u2019s hands. As to the latter contention the first question to be decided is one of fact, namely, were Coughlin and Irwin privy to the settlement in question. I do not find that they were. Hence it is neither necessary nor prudent to pursue the law applicable to a fact which is not found to exist.\n\u201cI may add, however, that in law information to a surety of time being given to the principal debtor by the creditor, when there is a reservation of rights against the surety, is no bar whatever either to the creditor proceeding against the surety or the surety proceeding against the debtor. (Webb v. Hewitt[2].)\n\u201cThen as to the first objection. The facts in this case must not be confused with a case of an absolute and unqualified release of a debtor without condition or proviso. In such a case the debt is gone and it is impossible to preserve a right against a surety when the debt is satisfied. It is said by Mr. Harding that though the entire debt is not entirely gone, yet a substantial security, namely, the mortgage referred to, is gone, and that the guarantors have lost the right to be subrogated to the bank in regard to this security. If there is anything in this, it is a matter for the guarantors, and they do not complain. If they have been deprived of the benefit of subrogation it is their loss and no one else need complain if they don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t. But of what benefit is it to be subrogated to a creditor in regard to a security which is paid off by the debtor to that creditor, and for which payment full credit is given by that creditor to the debtor? The security in question can only be paid once by the debtor. The company having paid it by the carrying out of the settlement they cannot be asked to pay it over again to the guarantors. The guarantors are already benefited by the payment. They gain, they do not lose. By the lessening of their liability on the amount of their indebtedness or their liability on the guarantee bond they happily have had so much less to pay on account of the debtor to the creditor.\n\u201cThe law of subrogation, as I understand it, has no application here. Broadly speaking, subrogation is this:\u2014A surety on paying the debt of his principal is entitled to be subrogated to all the securities, funds, liens and equities which the creditor holds against the principal debtor, or has a means of enforcing payment from him. The case in question is not a case of an obligation being extinguished by payment by a surety under such circumstances as entitled him to claim the obligation as still subsisting for his benefit. It is the simple case of payment by a debtor to his creditor of one of the securities that the creditor holds. I can quite appreciate that a creditor must not play pitch and toss with his security and negligently impair the position of the surety and increase the amount that the surety has ultimately to pay, but in this case it is not contended that the settlement made by the bank of the security in question, was other than a reasonable one under all the circumstances, and which, while it satisfied the bank pro tanto, likewise benefited the guarantors, the claimants, and lessened the amount of their claim as guarantors against the estate in liquidation.\n\u201cThen as to the settlement, while it extinguished the debt pro tanto there still remains a large portion of the debt due to the bank. It is said that as to this balance the bank lost its right by the settlement in question, that they can not in law pursue the guarantors, and that, therefore, the guarantors have no right to rank on the estate in regard to a payment by them for which they were not liable in law. But first, what is the contract of suretyship, and next, what does the settlement say?\n\u201cThe contract of suretyship is to be seen in exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and the settlement by the indorsement on the record. It is thus seen that the rights of the bank are specially preserved by both documents against the guarantors by the reservation of remedies against them. Now, what is the result in law of a reserve of remedies when the surety does not consent to the discharge of the debtor? Such a reservation prevents the discharge of the surety upon the principle that it rebuts the implication that the surety was meant to be discharged, and it prevents the rights of the surety against the debtor being impaired. (See Bateson v. Gosling[3].) The debtor may even be discharged and the surety held provided the contract between the surety and creditor so provides, and in this case the contract of surety does so provide. (See Cowper v. Smith[4].)\n\u201cThere is not in this case the element of novation as there was in Commercial Bank of Tasmania v. Jones[5], and in Perry v. National Provincial Bank of England[6]. In the cases cited there was substitution of one debtor for another as to portion of the debt, as to which portion there was held to be accord and satisfaction, and, therefore, to that extent the creditor could make no claim against the surety. In the case sub judice the bank by their settlement did not procure their claim in full Part of their original debt still remained unpaid. It is obvious, of course, that if the bank had been paid in full there would be an end of the matter. There was a balance still unsatisfied. This balance has been now partly satisfied by the payment of $6,624.80, of which $400 is admitted, and from which $1,000 has to be deducted, and for which balance I think the sureties should rank on the estate in liquidation.\n\u201cIt is said that the bank also claims the right to rank for dividend on the claim of $39,600, but while their claim of $39,600 was originally filed prior to the settlement of the suit, that settlement positively provides that they, the bank, shall not rank on the estate in the hands of the liquidator. In other words, they agree to abandon and forego one of their remedies. They carefully preserved their rights and remedies against the guarantors, whose right in turn to rank for dividend is not lost to them any more than they, the sureties, would lose their rights had the bank undertaken not to sue the company, which they could have done without impairing the remedies of the surety in regard to any sum that they have paid or may be called upon to pay.\n\u201cFor these reasons, then given in brief, I think that the claimants, Coughlin and Irwin, have the right to rank on the estate in question for the sum first mentioned, and a report by me as master will follow accordingly.\u201d\nAn appeal was taken to Mr. Justice Middleton, who reversed the local master\u2019s order, but it was restored on further appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.\nSir George Gibbons K.C. and R.T. Harding for the appellant.\nHellmuth K.C. and R.S. Robertson for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs. (See what Barron J. says, supra.) The appellant was the debtor of the Traders Bank at the time the agreement was made. The bank renounced its right to rank on the estate in consideration of the payment of $25,000, but reserved its recourse against the sureties among whom were the respondents. The latter being obliged to pay the debt now claim to rank against the estate of the principal debtor whose debt they paid. It appears to me obvious that they are entitled to rank on an estate of which they are creditors by reason of the payment made to the bank. The claim is not filed in subrogation of the bank\u2019s claim under section 69 of the Act, but as that of a creditor under section 76.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant, who is a liquidator of said company, which is in process of being wound up under the \u201cWinding-up Act,\u201d brought an action against the Traders Bank to set aside some securities obtained by it from said company and comprised the action by a brief memo indorsed on the record entered for trial of which clauses 1 and 5 are all that are material for consideration of the question raised herein.\nSaid clauses are as follows:\u2014\n1. The defendants to be entitled to the proceeds of the real estate and ice franchise, twenty-five thousand dollars referred to in the pleadings, but agree not to rank upon the estate in the hands of the plaintiff as liquidator.\n5. The bank to retain and hereby reserves all its rights against all securities in its hands and against the guarantors of its debt.\nThe respondents were sureties to the bank for the general balance due by the company to it.\nThe instrument by which they became such sureties has been lost, but is shewn to have, in the main at least, consisted of a general printed form in common use by banks to be signed by guarantors for securing payment of such general balance as may be found due by a customer of the bank.\nOne term thereof was as follows:\u2014\nThis is a continuing guarantee intended to cover any number of transactions, and we agree that the said bank may deal or compound with any of the parties to the said negotiable securities, and take from and give up to them again security of any kind in their discretion, and that the doctrines of law or equity in favour of a surety shall not apply hereto.\nThe questions raised herein must be solved by the correct appreciation of this power of compromise and the relation thereto of the said stipulations one and five above quoted from the memo of settlement between the parties thereto.\nCan it be maintained that the said memo of settlement was a compromise within the meaning of the guarantee whereby the claims of the bank as against the debtor were compounded and the principal debtor so absolved thereby that the sureties could have no resource against it?\nI do not think so. I assume the guarantee is possibly capable of some such operation, though I doubt such construction.\nI put it thus to test the only ground on which it seems to me the matter could be resolved in favour of appellant\u2019s contention.\nSo long as the debt exists and the surety is called upon to pay it, he must in law be entitled to pursue his usual remedies of a surety against the debtor when once he has paid his debt; unless he has contracted himself out of such right in some such way as I have suggested.\nThis ground not being open to appellant by virtue of what has transpired, what answer can he have to the statutory right of the surety to rank as a contingent creditor and in virtue thereof to rank for what he has been called upon to pay by the concurrence of appellant permitting the sureties to be pursued?\nIf the liquidator intended to avert such consequences it was open to him to have refused his assent to such recourse against the surety or to have insisted upon the sureties assenting to the settlement.\nI cannot see how the surety can, short of some such methods, be deprived of his right to rank in respect of what at the date of the winding-up order was a contingent claim which in light of what has transpired has become an actual claim against the debtor whose assets are in the appellant\u2019s hands.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014Unless precluded by agreement express or implied or by some equity or estoppel arising from some conduct of the parties the surety (by reason of the relation created by the contract of suretyship) is entitled to require the principal debtor to discharge his obligation to the creditor in so far as that may be necessary to relieve the surety. The debtor in other words comes under an obligation to the surety to save the surety harmless from any prejudice which might arise from the non-performance of the principal obligation. It is not disputed that the correlative right of the surety may be enforced in a winding-up where the principal obligation is to pay a sum of money and the principal debtor is the company in process of winding-up. I do not think it is really disputed either, at all events, it is obviously so, that the surety cannot by any act of the creditor alone be deprived of his right to compel the debtor to protect him by discharging the debt, or to indemnify him against the consequences of his failure to do so. The substance of the argument in this case is, that by the terms of the suretyship contract, the creditor, the bank, was made the agent of the sureties and as such agent empowered to enter into arrangements on their behalf with the principal debtor binding on the sureties as if made by them in person, and that by the agreement of June 15th, 1909, an arrangement was entered into pursuant to this authority between the creditor and the debtor whereby the creditor agreed on behalf of the sureties as well as on behalf of itself that no claim should be made in the winding-up in respect of the debt in question. There are two answers to that: The documents are as follows:\u2014\nTo the Traders Bank of Canada.\nIn consideration of the Traders Bank of Canada making advances to the Stratford Fuel, Ice, Cartage and Construction Company, Limited, either by the discount of negotiable securities consisting of bills of exchange or promissory notes, or by overdrafts, or otherwise, from time to time as the said bank may think fit; we jointly and severally hereby guarantee payment in full of such negotiable securities or overdrafts or other indebtedness provided, however, that the amount to be paid by us under this guarantee shall not exceed $38,000. This is a continuing guarantee intended to cover any number of transactions, and we agree that the said bank may deal or compound with any of the parties to the said negotiable securities, and take from and give up to them again security of any kind in their discretion, and that the doctrines of law or equity in favour of a surety shall not apply hereto. It is also agreed that the guarantors shall be liable for the ultimate balance remaining after all moneys obtainable from other sources shall have been applied in reduction of the amount which shall be owing from the Stratford Fuel, Ice, Cartage and Construction Company, Limited, to the said bank; provided, however, that they shall not be liable for a greater amount than the said sum of $33,000, but the said bank shall not be bound to exhaust all such resources against all parties previous to making demand upon us for payment, the intention being that the Traders Bank of Canada shall have the right to demand and enforce this guarantee in whole or in part from the guarantor whenever the principal debtor or any party or parties concerned fail to discharge any obligation they have entered into.\nThis guarantee shall subsist notwithstanding any change in the constitution of the company.\nAs witness our hands at Stratford this 24th day of October, 1907.

GIBBONS,\nFor Plaintiff.\nGIDEON GRANT,\nFor Defendants.\nJune 15\u201409.\nFirst, the document of the 24th October, 1907, above quoted, does not in express terms invest the bank with any authority to act as the agent of the sureties in dealing with the principal debtor. Nor does the document in apt terms limit the rights or the remedies of the sureties as against the debtor. The stipulation that \u201cthe doctrines of law or equity in favor of a surety\u201d shall not apply to compositions between the bank and the principal debtor, although it is perhaps capable of being read as applying to the rights of the surety as against the principal debtor does not necessarily relate to such rights, and the context would appear to indicate that such rights are not within the contemplation of the clause. Without analysing the language further I will simply say that I do not think the construction contended for accords with the real intendment of the stipulation. But assuming the appellant to be right in his contention as to the construction of this document, I think the compromise of June 15th, 1909, when rightly read, does not amount to a release of the sureties\u2019 rights. I think when the first paragraph is read with the last it becomes apparent that according to its true meaning the instrument only embodies a stipulation by the bank that the bank will not press its own claim to rank upon the assets of the company in the hands of the liquidator.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In order to give its full legal effect to the reservation in the document of compromise of the bank\u2019s rights against the sureties, its agreement not to rank on the debtor\u2019s estate in liquidation must be deemed similar in its results to a covenant not to sue. It does not operate as a release of the debtor. It is in fact an agreement that the bank will not claim to rank in the liquidation for the balance of its demand as a creditor. It is said that on payment the surety becomes subrogated to the rights of the creditor, and that it is only by virtue of such subrogation that his right to proceed against the primary debtor arises. It follows, the appellant maintains, that in the present case the sureties cannot rank on the estate in liquidation because the creditor had debarred himself from so ranking. But as the creditor\u2019s covenant not to sue the principal debtor does not preclude the surety who pays the creditor from bringing action against the debtor for indemnification, so the agreement not to rank in the present case left that right open to the sureties on their making payment. Moreover, while it would appear to be the purpose of the bond sued upon that dealings between the creditor and the primary debtor, which would ordinarily operate to discharge the sureties, should not have that effect, there is nothing in that instrument which, in the event of the sureties being compelled to meet the primary debtor\u2019s obligation, necessarily deprives them of the right, which the law otherwise gives them, to claim indemnification by the primary debtor or out of his estate in liquidation; and I do not think it should receive such a construction.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I fail to see how the guarantors who have paid the debt of the principal debtor could be prevented from ranking on the assets of the estate of the latter. The liquidator who is contesting the claim of the sureties invokes an agreement which he has made with the principal creditor who undertook not to rank upon the estate. But at the same time it is stipulated in the same agreement that the creditor could demand and enforce his right against the sureties.\nBy that agreement the principal creditor could not claim personally from the estate. And if he had not succeeded in collecting anything from the sureties he would lose the balance of his claim, but if he col- lects something from the sureties the latter become entitled to make a claim against the estate. The agreement was a personal one as far as the creditor was concerned, but it did not bind the sureties.\nThe reservation of rights against the sureties leaves the debt alive. Kearsley v. Cole[7]; Green v. Wynn[8].\nThe sureties\u2019 right to be indemnified by the principal debtor or his estate will not be held to have been abandoned unless a contract on their part to abandon it has been proved.\nThere is no evidence that such an undertaking exists in this case.\nThe reservation of the principal creditor\u2019s remedies against the guarantors necessarily implies the continuance of their right to be indemnified.

Anglin and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (30 Ont. L.R. 186) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant was lessee of land for a term expiring on April 30th, 1913. The lease provided that she could purchase the property at any time during the term for a specified price. In March, 1913, she accepted and signed a new lease for a year from May 1st, 1913, and shortly after tendered the purchase money for the property and a conveyance for execution to the owner who refused to convey, and in an action by the lessee for specific performance claimed that the option was abandoned by the acceptance of the new lease. The Appellate Division upheld this contention, reversing the judgment at the trial in the appellant\u2019s favour.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nW.C. McCarthy for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action for specific performance of an option agreement for the sale of certain property on Stewart Street, in the City of Ottawa. The option is contained in a lease dated April 30th, 1910, given to the appellant by the late Thomas A. Burns, under whose will the respondent is devisee of the property. The option is in these words:\u2014\nThe said Mary A. Mathewson to have the option of purchase at any time on or before the expiration of this lease for the sum of $2,800 (twenty-eight hundred dollars).\nThe lease was registered by the appellant on the 8th of February, 1911, after the death of the late Thomas A. Burns. Before the expiration of the lease, the appellant notified the respondent of her intention to exercise the option.\nThe learned Chancellor of Ontario, who tried the case, found that the appellant would not have taken the lease except upon the condition that she was given an option to purchase exercisable at any time during the period specified and holding that she acquired a vested right to purchase during the full term of her lease maintained the action. On appeal, the judgment was reversed on the ground that the appellant waived or abandoned her option to purchase by entering into an agreement on March 10, 1913, to rent the same premises for a term of twelve months from the first day of May, 1913.\nThe abandonment or waiver of the option to purchase would require to be proved like any other agreement in clear and unequivocal terms, and with all respect, I am entirely unable to appreciate how that second lease which would only begin to run at the expiration of the option period can be construed as an agreement to waive the right to purchase which the appellant admittedly had at the time the agreement was made. I cannot find evidence of anything done or said by the appellant by reason of which the position of the landlord was in any way altered. In accepting the lease, in March, 1913, the appellant cannot be held, in view of the relations then existing between her and the respondent, to have admitted more than that, at that time, the landlord had power, as the fact was, to rent the property at the expiration of the then current lease if she did not exercise her option in the meantime. There is no evidence that in consideration of the new lease she agreed to abandon her option, and taking a new lease in anticipation of a possible failure to exercise an option to purchase is not conduct evidencing an intention to abandon the right to the option when, as in this case, the lease was to begin to run only at the expiration of the option period. If there is any ambiguity or doubt, it should be construed in favour of the appellant who without legal advice was dealing with the respondent\u2019s solicitor.\nIf this case arose in Quebec, I would be disposed to hold that, in the circumstances, the agreement to abandon the option before the expiration of the delay would require to be in writing. The right to the option is not inconsistent with the right to a lease subject to the option which will only take effect if the option is not exercised. Both may run concurrently. It would be different if the appellant had taken a lease which began to run before the expiration of the option period. The taking of that new lease at that time might be said to be inconsistent with the intention to exercise the option, but I can see no reason why the intention to exercise the option should not continue to exist concurrently with the right to a lease of the premises if the option is not exercised in the meantime. I agree entirely with the Chancellor when he says:\u2014\nThere is no evidence of any waiver by the plaintiff of the option to purchase. The taking of a new lease to begin at the termination of the other was merely a provident act in case she did not think fit to purchase. Had she elected to purchase during the former lease that would ipso facto have determined the relation of landlord and tenant and a new relation of vendor and purchaser would have arisen. None other follows in regard to the second lease; it did not become operative on the plaintiff electing to purchase at the end of the first term.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons assigned by the learned Chancellor in which I entirely concur.\nIn the almost infinite variety of rights and interests which a man may acquire in or over real estate and enjoy concurrently there is nothing more common than an option to acquire either the whole estate or some new interest therein.\nIt is a novel doctrine that by the acquisition of some new interest his option must be presumed to have been waived unless there is some necessary in- consistency between what he has newly acquired and the continuation of the option.\nThere is no more inconsistency between the continued existence of an option for the time it has to run and a renewal or extension of a lease, than there was between the option to purchase during the currency of the lease in which the option to purchase was expressed, and that lease itself.\nThere might have been embodied in the renewal lease a term or condition that its acceptance ended the option, but there was not. Or there might have been in the negotiations between the parties leading to such renewal something agreed upon that would have rendered the exercise of the option so inequitable that a court would not enforce its specific performance, but there was nothing of the kind.\nIt might as well be argued that the renewal of the lease interfered with the appellant\u2019s right to enforce her mortgage when falling due during either term, as that the renewal in question extinguished the right to exercise her option as she did before the term thereof had expired.\nThe respondent never changed his position in such a way as to entitle him to claim that appellant had surrendered her right.\nThe learned Chancellor has so fully covered the ground that I can add nothing useful, and only add these remarks suggested by the course of the argument addressed to us for respondent.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the conclusion and the reasoning of the learned Chancellor of Ontario who tried the action. I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned Chancellor be restored. ANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014In taking in March, 1913, an unqualified lease for one year from the 1st of May, 1913, the appellant, in my opinion, entered into a contract wholly inconsistent with her right to exercise the option, expiring on the 30th April, 1913, contained in the three years\u2019 lease of the 30th April, 1910, of which she asserts in this action the right to avail herself. If that option should be exercised, the lease of March, 1913, could never become operative. In accepting the lease the appellant recognized the absolute title of the respondents to make it. She either meant, in consideration of the new lease, to forego all claim to exercise her option (it may be because she thought it unenforceable, or of such doubtful efficacy that a compromise on the basis of a new lease was advisable) and in that case waiver of it would seem to be clear; or she proceeded under the mistaken belief that her acceptance of the new lease without any reservation of her option to purchase the property would not affect her right to exercise that option, and in that case she would appear to be seeking relief against the effect of taking the new lease on a ground of mistake in law. That she cannot have.\nWith deference to those who take the contrary view, I am unable to read into the absolute and unqualified lease of March, 1913, the condition or qualification that it shall be of no effect if the lessee should exercise an option to purchase, the existence or efficacy of which was in dispute between the parties. That seems to me to be introducing by some sort of inference into a written contract a term so inconsistent with its express provisions that it is destructive of them. There is not even an attempt to adduce parol evidence (which in my opinion would have been inadmissible) that the appellant intended to make the new lease subject to the option. But if that term, not expressed in the document, may not be imported into it by explicit oral evidence that it was intended that the lease should be subject to it, I cannot see my way to import it as a matter of inference from extrinsic facts which, as I read the evidence, are quite as consistent with the intention that the option should be abandoned, as that it should be preserved. For my part I prefer to determine the rights of the parties by interpretation of the writing in which they have undertaken to express them.\nIn any event I do not consider this a proper case for the extraordinary and discretionary remedy of specific performance.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J.

Honorius Ricard (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nLa Ville De Grand\u2019m\u00e8re (Defendant) Respondent.\n1914: June 11, 22.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nContract\u2014Municipal corporation\u2014Exclusive franchise\u2014Renewal at expiration of term\u2014Right of inference\u2014By-law\u2014Approval by ratepayers.\nThe municipal corporation granted exclusive franchises to R. for supplying electric light, etc., to the inhabitants of the municipality for the term of ten years, with a proviso giving R. a preference over any other person tendering for such services, at the end of that term, at the rates mentioned in the competing tender, for an additional term of ten years. On the termination of the ten years mentioned in the contract, in pursuance of powers obtained from the legislature permitting the municipal corporation to supply electric light, etc., to the inhabitants, the corporation passed a by-law whereby it undertook to perform these services and refused to renew the contract for the additional term. In an action by R. to have the by-law set aside, a declaration that he was entitled to the renewal of his contract for the additional term, and for an injunction restraining the corporation from acting upon the by-law;\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 23 K.B. 97), that there was no obligation arising under the contract which prevented the corporation from exercising the new powers vested in it for the advantage of the inhabitants and that, in consequence of the exercise of those powers, R. had no contractual right to a renewal for the additional term.\nAs the by-law in question had been ratified by the provincial statute 3 Geo. V., ch. 67, during the time the suit was pending, the cross-appeal by the corporation was allowed and the by-law and a resolution of the municipal council based thereon were declared valid.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], varying the judgment of Tourigny J., in the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers, by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nIn regard to the issues raised upon the present appeal the circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note.\nP. N. Martel K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Rinfret K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action was wrongly conceived.\nIf at the expiration of the first ten-year period the contract was at an end, as was obviously the case, the action of the municipality in refusing to give effect to the \u201cpacte de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence\u201d might give rise, in a proper case, to a claim for damages, but certainly does not give the plaintiff a right to the relief asked for in this proceeding.\nThe impugned by-laws have been ratified and confirmed by the legislature and, except in so far as they affected the plaintiff in his contractual relations with the municipality, they are declared to be valid to all intents and purposes. It is quite true that the appellant alleges an interest as a ratepayer, but he can no longer, in view of the validating Act, invoke an interest as such in these proceedings. I would dismiss the appeal with costs here and below.\nDealing now with the cross-appeal., I am of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be modified and that the resolution of the twenty-eighth day of August, 1912, should be declared good and valid, the whole without costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant, in January, 1902, obtained from the respondent municipality an exclusive privilege of furnishing electricity in said municipality. The first two clauses of the contract were as follows:\u2014\n1. La Corporation de\n2.\n3. la Ville de Grand\u2019M\u00e8re accorde \u00e0 J. O. H. Ricard, \u00e9cr., m\u00e9decin, de la Ville de Grand\u2019M\u00e8re, le privil\u00e8ge exclusif, pendant dix ans, de fournir l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 pour les fins d\u2019\u00e9clairage, chauffage, pouvoir moteur, \u00e9lectrolyse, travail des m\u00e9taux, locomotion, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement toutes les fins auxquelles peut ou pourra se pr\u00eater l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\n2. Le dit privil\u00e8ge sera exclusif pour dix ans avec pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur tout autre concurrent, au bout des dix ans, au prix du dit concurrent pour dix autres ann\u00e9es.\nThe questions raised by this appeal turn upon the meaning to be given the second of said clauses.\nThe first ten years of the privilege were duly enjoyed by the appellant.\nThe municipality was enabled, during said term of ten years, by the legislature, to enter upon the business of electric lighting. It had always been enabled by law to do its own lighting but was, perhaps, not at liberty or enabled to supply lighting to the public generally.\nThe municipal council decided, at the expiration of said ten years, to exercise both its old and its new powers and, in executing such purpose, passed by-laws which were attacked by the appellant. It is not necessary to dwell upon the details of what was done, for the legislature confirmed these by-laws with a provision in the Act of confirmation that, if the appellant was in law entitled to insist upon the extension of his privilege and contract, as he claimed to be under said second clause of the contract, then the respondent was thereby bound to expropriate his electric light property.\nIt is to determine whether or not such right to extension exists that this appeal was brought.\nI am unable to find in said second clause anything in the way of a binding contract of such nature as claimed.\nIndeed, the entire contract was, as framed, ultra vires the powers of the respondent.\nThe respondent cannot be said ever to have bound itself to refrain from exercising its own undoubted powers at the expiration of ten years. It seems only to have said that if it followed the policy of letting the contract for town-lighting to others at the end of ten years to give the appellant a preference.\nIt has not let any contract to others and, hence, there is no semblance of ground upon which the proposed preference can become operative.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nThere is a cross-appeal which, admittedly, involves nothing but costs, save what relates to a resolution of the council passed in execution of the purposes of the confirmed by-law. I see no objection to the modification of the judgment so as to affirm the validity of such resolution, but it should be without costs and also without giving respondent any relief as to the costs involved in what is sought in the cross-appeal.\nThe costs involved in the appeal relative to the neat point first above referred to are all the costs in these proceedings which ought to be borne by appellant.\nDuff J\u2014I think the appeal fails. There is neither express nor implied obligation resting on the respondent corporation not to exercise the powers now vested in it for the advantage of the inhabitants according to the best judgment of the council. And these powers having been exercised in such a way that the contract with the appellant is inapplicable, the appellant has no ground of complaint capable of vindication in a court of law.\nAnglin J.\u2014I think it is abundantly clear that the appellant had not a contractual right to the renewal of his lighting contract with the respondent municipality. He may have some reason to complain of the treatment he has received, but I find nothing in the record which supports his claim that he was entitled to a renewal of his contract.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Je suis d\u2019opinion de renvoyer l\u2019appel principal avec d\u00e9pens pour les raison donn\u00e9es par le juge en chef. Sur le contre-appel, je vois que la l\u00e9gislature ayant ratifi\u00e9 les r\u00e9glements en question, la r\u00e9solution du 28 aout, 1912, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019un de ces r\u00e9glements, est \u00e9galement ratifi\u00e9e, le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel qui casse cette r\u00e9solution doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer cette r\u00e9solution bonne et valable. Il ne devrait pas y avoir de frais sur le contre-appel.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal allowed in part without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P. N. Martel.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret & Genest.\n[1] Q.R. 23 K.B. 97.\n"

The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company was incorporated by Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, chapter 75, 1884, and under that Act was authorized to construct a railway from a point in or near the City of Toronto to a point in or near the City of Hamilton, and thence to some point at or near the International Bridge, or Cantilever Bridge, in the Niagara River, and with full power to pass over any portion of the country between the points aforesaid, and to carry the said railway through the Crown lands, if any, lying between the points aforesaid.\n\u201c2. By chapter 86 of the statutes of 1891, passed by the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, the undertaking of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, reserving to the company all the powers, rights, immunities, privileges, franchises, and authorities conferred upon it under and by virtue of the above recited Acts of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario.\n\u201c3. By section 4 of the federal Act all the provisions of the \u2018Railway Act\u2019 were made to apply to the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, in so far as they were applicable to the undertaking, and except to the extent to which they were inconsistent with the provisions of the said Acts of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario.\n\u201c4. By-law No. 755, passed by the municipal council of the City of Hamilton on the 25th day of October, 1894, and confirmed by Ontario statute, 58 Victoria, 1895, chapter 68, and by Dominion Act, chapter 66, 1895, fixed a definite location of the company\u2019s line in the City of Hamilton. The conditions of the by-law were complied with and the line constructed along Hunter street, in the City of Hamilton, in accordance with the provisions of the by-law referred to, and in accordance with the map or plan duly approved under the provisions of the \u2018Railway Act.\u2019\n\u201c5. The present application on behalf of the city is for an order requiring the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company to divert its line of railway into the city from Hunter street to a location in the north end of the city in common with the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway companies.\n\u201c6. The application was heard at the sittings of the Board held in Hamilton on the 10th day of October, 1913, at which counsel representing the city, the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, the Canadian Pacific and Grand Trunk Railway Companies, and certain property owners, were present. Counsel for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company contended that the Board was without jurisdiction to make the order applied for.\n\u201c7. After hearing argument and reading the submissions filed, and taking time to consider, the Board came to the conclusion that, for the reasons set out in the judgments of the Chief Commissioner and the Assistant Chief Commissioner, it had power, if so advised, to make such an order; and this conclusion was announced to the parties interested.\n\u201c8. At the request of counsel for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, who expressed his intention of appealing from this decision, the merits of the application were not gone into, and counsel was asked to proceed to perfect his appeal without delay.\n\u201c9. A draft form of order upon which to base an application for leave to appeal was submitted by counsel for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, and order No. 21087, dated December 24th, 1913, issued as a result of this application. The said order No. 21087 is not in terms in the form of the draft order submitted by counsel, and for that reason counsel refuses to perfect his appeal, but raises the objection that the Board is without power to act in the premises.\n\u201c10. The only order made by the Board was the order No. 21087, referred to, declaring that it had jurisdiction to entertain the application and to make an order directing the deviation of the line of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company within a distance of one mile from its present location. The merits of the case were not gone into.\n\u201c11. The city objects to this order, contending that the Board\u2019s power to order a diversion in the premises was not limited to a diversion within one mile from the present location of the railway.\n\u201c12. The statutes relating to the said company contained in the printed volumes of the statutes of the Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, the judgments and proceedings herein, shall be deemed to be and shall be read as part of this case.\n\u201c13. The questions involved being, in its opinion, questions of law, the Board, under section 55 of the \u2018Railway Act,\u2019 may of its own motion state a case in writing for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada; and, in pursuance of this power, the questions submitted for determination by the Supreme Court of Canada are as follows:\u2014\n\u201c(1) Whether, as a matter of law, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada has the power, on an application by the City of Hamilton, to make an order directing the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company to divert its line of railway from its present location in the City of Hamilton to some other location in the said city?\n\u201c(2) Whether, if the Board has power to order such diversions, such power is limited to a diversion within one mile from the railway as already constructed?\u201d\nThe issues raised on the argument in the Supreme Court of Canada are referred to in the opinions of the Judges now reported.\nM. K. Cowan K.C. and F. R. Waddell K.C. were heard on behalf of the City of Hamilton.\nHellmuth K.C. and J. A. Soule for the railway company.\nThe hearing took place on the 22nd of May, 1914, when the court was pleased to take the matter into consideration and, on the 19th of June, 1914, the majority of the judges answered the first question in the negative and, consequently, considered that it was unnecessary to give any answer to the second question. His Lordship Mr. Justice Anglin answered the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative.\nThe following reasons for their opinions were delivered by the judges who heard the reference.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nIdington J.\u2014The answers to the questions submitted relative to the jurisdiction of the Railway Commissioners of Canada must be chiefly dependent upon whether the legislation contained in 58 & 59 Vict. ch. 66, is to be held a \u201cspecial Act\u201d within the meaning of that term in the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nThe applicant passed a by-law No. 755, in 1894, granting a bonus of $225,000 in aid of respondent upon the terms and conditions set out therein and agreed on between said parties.\nPart of said terms and conditions thereby imposed was that the railway should pass through the City of Hamilton by a southerly route which is set out with great detail in the specifications forming part of the said by-law. Another clause in the said terms and conditions provides that the said company should build by the 1st September, 1895, and always maintain a first-class passenger station in a central part of the City of Hamilton and all regular passenger trains on said railway running from or through Brantford to Toronto, or from Toronto to or through or from Brantford to Welland, or Welland to Brantford, should stop at such principal passenger station of the company in Hamilton, and that all regular passenger trains running through Hamilton should stop at such station, and should build and maintain a second passenger station within said city at or near Locke street south of Main street.\nAll this was declared by said Act confirming said by-law to be binding upon the parties to this litigation and respondent seems to have conformed to the said terms and conditions.\nIt is proposed by the applicant now to change the location of all this part of the line so definitely exacted by the terms of said by-law, so validated by said Act, and direct the line of railway to be so \u201cdiverted, changed or altered\u201d that the railway shall run, instead of on the routes so adopted, along the Grand Trunk Railway route on the north side of the city where that road and station existed long before the existence of the respondent.\nI think said legislation must be held to be \u201ca special Act\u201d within the meaning of that term as interpreted in section 2, sub-section 28, of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and applied by giving thereto the effect designed by section 3 of said Act, which is as follows:\u2014\n3. This Act shall, subject to the provisions thereof, be construed as incorporate with the special Act, and, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act, where the provisions of this Act and of any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada relate to the same subject-matter, the provisions of the special Act shall, in so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act, be taken to override the provisions of this Act. 3 Edw. VII., ch. 58, secs. 3 and 5.\nIt seems to me that the subject-matter of this special Act involves the definite and permanent location of the railway at the place in question and that \u201cthe provisions of said special Act\u201d must, in so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act, be taken to override the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d relative to the location of railways or changes in regard thereto.\nSection 6 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d, which may be applicable to the railway in question does not restrict the operation of this section three, which may be read therewith.\nThe case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[1], relied upon by applicant has hardly any resemblance to this case. There was presented in that case a tripartite agreement validated by Parliament which possibly covered a small part of the field of public safety there in question but by no means that which was involved in applying section 238. There the special Act covered only a small corner of the subject-matter of public safety. Here the special Act covers absolutely the whole question of location which is the subject-matter involved.\nIt is made clear by the judgment of the Chief Commissioner that everything relative to public safety is eliminated from the question. And nothing is left but the subject-matter of location of the railway which seems to me identical with that determined by the by-law and contract and conditions made permanently binding by the special Act. No one has ventured to distinguish the subject-matter of the special Act, from that of section 167 relied upon, by setting up that the subject-matter in the latter is not location, but change of location. If such a suggestion occurs to any one, I may repeat what I have just pointed out that this special Act was by its terms intended to be perpetual, and thus overrides anything providing for change of location and leaves the section 167 to operate where there can be no such conflict.\nIt is suggested by the judgment of the Chief Commissioner that as this special Act, by section 8, provides that nothing in the Act contained shall affect any rights or powers conferred by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d on the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, to which the Board may be considered the statutory successor, therefore, this power now invoked has been excepted from the operation of the special Act.\nWhen we turn to the then existing \u201cRailway Act\u201d and consider the provisions thereof relative to the rights or powers of the then Railway Committee, the only semblance of any such \u201cright or power\u201d therein, such as now appears in section 167, is to be found in section 11 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888, sub-section (b),\nchanges in location for lessening a curve, reducing a gradient or benefiting the railway or for other purposes of public advantage.\nI cannot think this provision should ever have been resorted to in way of justifying the Railway Committee in directing such a change as now contemplated.\nAnd it may be observed that the restriction, in said section 8, upon the operative effect of the rest of the special Act can only be read in light of the then existing \u201crights and powers of the Railway Committee.\u201d\nLater extensions of powers to the railway company or even to the committee, of which I can find none bearing hereon, could not affect the question presented. Moreover, the right of changing location within a lateral mile\u2019s limit, originally rested with the railway company and the restrictions now existent are results of later enactments.\nIt is not necessary that I should here trace out in detail all these changes by means of which the curious evolution has taken place whereby the present jurisdiction of the Board was first given in way of restriction upon the railway company and then it was given the power of its own motion to direct that to be done which the railway company had got power to do with its sanction.\nA study of this legislative development does not help in way of finding jurisdiction in the Board and for doing what it is now alleged it can do relative to old established things, including contracts, and the correlative rights, duties and obligations arising therefrom.\nI conclude upon the foregoing grounds alone that there is no jurisdiction such as claimed.\nOn the narrower ground of the actual meaning of section 167 as it stands, and assuming no special Act in the way, I should doubt very much indeed if any such change as involved in doing what is contemplated was ever the purpose of the section.\nThere are a great many pieces of parallel railway lines lying within a mile or a few miles of each other which public opinion, if enlightened and well directed, might well have prevented the building of and saved millions of wasted capital entailed in such building. Economic pressure may ultimately eliminate much of this duplication.\nIf we should answer the first question submitted in the affirmative and the second in the negative, I can conceive of the Board being urged to use that measure of power, so implied, and its other extensive powers to ameliorate the conditions of things brought about by such improvidence. But should any court say, looking at the purview of the provisions creating and empowering the Board as provided by this \u201cRailway Act\u201d in Canada, that such an attempt by the Board would properly fall within its jurisdiction?\nI put this illustration of what seems to me the logical and perhaps not undesirable outcome of the answers applicant seeks herein to the questions submitted in order to test the validity of the argument that rests upon a reading only of the two or three sections referred to, without looking at their place and purpose in the Act as a whole. Tried by such a test I do not think section 167 was ever by its framers dreamt of as going so far.\nI also desire to illustrate thereby the view I take of the right now challenged in argument to submit these questions.\nI have no doubt regarding the right of the Board under the 55th section of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to submit as a question of law a case involving only a question of its jurisdiction.\nIn some cases it may conceivably be most expedient to do so before involving a costly investigation that may do no good and indeed do much harm.\nAt the same time the concrete case might often bring into their true relation many of the facts, circumstances and considerations that need sometimes to be weighed in order to apprehend the true bearing of the question of jurisdiction.\nI should answer the first question in the negative and in doing so the second question needs no answer. Duff J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners states the following case:\u2014\n\u201cThe following case which, in the opinion of the Board, involves questions of law, is stated by the Board for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014\n1. The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company was incorporated by Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, ch. 75, 1884, and under that Act was authorized to construct a railway from a point in or near the City of Toronto to a point in or near the City of Hamilton, and thence to some point at or near the International Bridge, or Cantilever Bridge, in the Niagara River, and with full power to pass over any portion of the country between the points aforesaid, and to carry the said railway through the Crown lands, if any, lying between the points aforesaid.\n2. By ch. 86 of the statutes of 1891, passed by the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, the undertaking of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, reserving to the company all the powers, rights, immunities, privileges, franchises, and authorities conferred upon it under and by virtue of the above recited Acts of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario.\n3. By sec. 4 of the federal Act all the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d were made to apply to the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, in so far as they were applicable to the undertaking, and except to the extent to which they were inconsistent with the provisions of the said Acts of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario.\n4. By-law No. 755, passed by the Municipal Council of the City of Hamilton on the 25th day of October, 1894, and confirmed by Ontario statute, 58 Vict. 1895, ch. 68, and by the Dominion Act, ch. 66, 1895, fixed a definite location of the company\u2019s line in the City of Hamilton. The conditions of the by-law were complied with and the line constructed along Hunter street, in the City of Hamilton, in accordance with the provisions of the by-law referred to, and in accordance with the map or plan duly approved under the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\n5. The present application on behalf of the city is for an order requiring the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company to divert its line of railway into the city from Hunter street to a location in the north end of the city in common with the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway companies.\n6. The application was heard at the sittings of the Board held in Hamilton on the 10th day of October, 1913, at which counsel representing the city, the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, the Canadian Pacific and Grand Trunk Railway Companies, and certain property owners, were present. Counsel for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company contended that the Board was without jurisdiction to make the order applied for.\n7. After hearing argument and reading the submissions filed, and taking time to consider, the Board came to the conclusion that, for the reasons set out in the judgments of the Chief Commissioner and the Assistant Chief Commissioner, it had power, if so advised, to make such an order; and this conclusion was announced to the parties interested.\n8. At the request of counsel for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, who expressed his intention of appealing from this decision, the merits of the application were not gone into, and counsel was asked to proceed to perfect his appeal without delay.\n9. A draft form of order upon which to base an application for leave to appeal was submitted by counsel for the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, and Order No. 21,087, dated December 24th, 1913, issued as a result of this application. The said Order No. 21,087 is not in terms in the form of the draft order submitted by counsel, and for that reason counsel refuses to perfect his appeal, but raises the objection that the Board is without power to act in the premises.\n10. The only order made by the Board was the Order No. 21,087, referred to, declaring that it had jurisdiction to entertain the application and to make an order directing the deviation of the line of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company within a distance of one mile from its present location. The merits of the case were not gone into.\n11. The city objects to this order, contending that the Board\u2019s power to order a diversion in the premises was not limited to a diversion within one mile from the present location of the railway.\n12. The statutes relating to the said company contained in the printed volumes of the statutes of the Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, the judgments and proceedings herein, shall be deemed to be and shall be read as part of this case.\n13. The questions involved being, in its opinion, questions of law, the Board, under sec. 55 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d may of its own motion state a case in writing for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada; and in pursuance of this power, the questions submitted for determination by the Supreme Court of Canada are as follows:\u2014\n(1) Whether, as a matter of law, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada has the power on an application by the City of Hamilton, to make an order directing the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company to divert its line of railway from its present location in the City of Hamilton to some other location in the said city.\n(2) Whether, if the Board has power to order such diversion, such power is limited to a diversion within one mile from the railway as already constructed. The questions submitted relate to the jurisdiction of the Board and it is contended on behalf of the railway company that a question touching the jurisdiction of the Board can be raised before this court only in one way:\u2014viz., by an appeal under section 56(2). I agree with the learned Chief Commissioner that section 55 confers upon the Board authority \u201cof its own motion\u201d to state a case for the opinion of this court upon any question of jurisdiction which, in the opinion of the Board, is a question of law.\nI do not think it is necessary to pass upon the question whether the provisions of the by-law of October 25th, 1894, which had the force of statute by virtue of 58 Vict. ch. 68 (Ont.) and 58 Vict. ch. 66 (Dom.) constituted a \u201cspecial Act\u201d within the meaning of section 2(28) of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d or whether \u201cthe subject-matter\u201d of section 167 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is within the meaning of section 3 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d \u201cthe same subject-matter\u201d or one of \u201cthe same subject-matters\u201d as those in respect of which provision is made by the by-law and validating enactments; I shall assume for the purpose of this judgment that the rights of the parties now in controversy are governed by the enactments of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nI will only add that the authority conferred by section 167 must, in my opinion, be exercised subject to the provisions of any special Act. Section 3 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d makes it imperative to hold that, in so far as the situs of the railway line or railway works is rigorously fixed by the special Act, the special Act must govern. To what extent the special Act does define the situs of the railway to the exclusion of the authority of the Board under section 167 is a question which, of course, must be determined by the proper construction of the special Act itself.\nOn this assumption I have not been able to convince myself that the proposed diversion would not be a \u201cdeviation, change or alteration\u201d within the meaning of section 167 and within the authority of the Board to sanction on the application of the railway company. I can see no valid reason\u2014that is to say no reason on which I am entitled to act judicially\u2014why a \u201cdeviation\u201d authorized by section 167 after the construction of the railway must be confined within the limits expressly laid down in respect of a \u201cdeviation\u201d permitted by section 159 before construction. It is, of course, a proper subject for comment that on the reading of section 167, which I think is the right reading, the discretion of the Board, subject to the provisions of the special Act is unqualified as regards the physical limits of lateral deviation; while by section 159 a limit of one mile is specifically laid down. Various explanations of this seeming inconsistency of policy may be suggested, but the discussion of such possible explanations does not appear to me to be relevant to the only question before us. Our duty is to construe the language which Parliament has used. I find in section 167, as regards this matter of the limits of lateral deviation, words which are quite unequivocal. I cannot refuse to give effect to them because, when read according to their plain meaning, they give a result which does not appear to be entirely consistent with inferences that may be derived from other parts of the Act as to the policy of Parliament. To do that would be legislating. Before proceeding to discuss what appears to me to be the real point in controversy, it should be observed that the learned Chief Commissioner in his reasons for judgment has made it very plain that this is not a case for the exercise of the powers given by sections 237 and 238 and that the jurisdiction of the Board to grant the application, if it exists, must be rested upon section 167.\nThat section is in the following terms:\u2014\n167. If any deviation, change or alteration is required by the company to be made in the railway, or any portion thereof, as already constructed, or as merely located and sanctioned, a plan, profile and book of reference of the portion of such railway proposed to be changed shewing the deviation, change or alteration proposed to be made, shall, in like manner as hereinbefore provided with respect to the original plan, profile and book of reference, be submitted for the approval of the Board, and may be sanctioned by the Board.\n2. The plan, profile and book of reference of the portion of such railway so proposed to be changed shall, when so sanctioned, be deposited and dealt with as hereinbefore provided with respect to such original plan, profile and book of reference.\n3. The company may thereupon make such deviation, change or alteration, and all the provisions of this Act shall apply to the portion of such line of railway so at any time changed or proposed to be changed, in the same manner as they apply to the original line.\n4. The Board may, either by general regulation or in any particular case, exempt the company from submitting the plan, profile and book of reference as in this section provided, where such deviation, change or alteration, is made or to be made, for the purpose of lessening a curve, reducing a gradient, or otherwise benefiting the railway or for any other purpose of public advantage, as may seem to the Board expedient, if such deviation, change or alteration does not exceed three hundred feet from the centre line of the railway, located or constructed in accordance with the plans, profiles and books of reference deposited with the Board under this Act.\n5. Nothing in this section shall be taken to authorize any extension of the railway beyond the termini mentioned in the special Act.\nRead alone, that is to say apart from the provisions to which I am about to refer, the contention that the Board has authority under this provision to order a \u201cdeviation, change or alteration\u201d against the opposition of the railway company, would hardly be susceptible of plausible statement. The real point to be determined is:\u2014What is the effect of this section when interpreted by the light of sections 26(2) and 28? These last mentioned sections are in the following words:\u2014\n26. (2). The Board may order and require any company or person to do forthwith, or within or at any specified time, and in any manner prescribed by the Board, so far as is not inconsistent with this Act, any act, matter or thing which such company or person is or may be required or authorized to do under this Act, or the special Act, and may forbid the doing or continuing of any act, matter or thing which is contrary to this Act, or the special Acts; and shall for the purposes of this Act have full jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters whether of law or of fact.\n28. The Board may, of its own motion, or shall upon the request of the Minister, inquire into, hear and determine any matter or thing which, under this Act, it may inquire into, hear and determine upon application or complaint, and with respect thereto shall have the same powers as, upon any application or complaint, are vested in it by this Act.\n(2) Any power or authority vested in the Board under this Act may, though not so expressed in this Act, be exercised from time to time, or at any time, as the occasion may require.\nThe argument in favour of jurisdiction, is that by the combined operation of these two last quoted sections, whatever the Board has power to sanction or authorize at the request or upon the application of the railway company, it has power to order of its own motion against the will of the railway company; and if that is the effect of them there can be no doubt upon the question of the jurisdiction here. In Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The Department of Agriculture of Ontario[2], the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Girouard and Mr. Justice Anglin adopted the view just expressed as to the effect of these provisions. Of the other three members of the court, who took part in that decision, Mr. Justice Davies and Mr. Justice Idington expressed no opinion on the point. My own opinion, which I stated in my judgment in that case, was against the proposed construction of these sections. As in duty bound, I have re-considered carefully the opinion I then formed in light of the discussion of the subject by the learned Chairman of the Board in his reasons now before us and the conclusion I then formed is unchanged. I will briefly re-state my opinion as to the real meaning of these sections. As to section 26(2): it will be observed that the power there given is expressly made exercisable only in so far as is \u201cnot inconsistent with this Act,\u201d and, therefore, when it is suggested that an authority given by some particular section of the Act that on its face is only an authority to pronounce permissive orders is by the operation of this provision converted into an authority to pronounce mandatory orders, it is necessary in each case to ascertain from the section by which the specific authority is given, whether or not such a result is consistent with the true intendment of that section. This consideration alone, in my opinion, would forbid the application of section 26(2) to section 167 in the manner now contended for: for the language of section 167 itself contemplates, it appears to me, the initiative of the railway company as a substantive condition of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, which is merely to \u201capprove\u201d and \u201csanction\u201d something \u201cproposed\u201d by the railway company.\nI think, however, with respect, apart altogether from this, that the application of section 26(2) in the manner proposed is inconsistent with the real purpose and meaning of section 26(2) itself, which is, it appears to me, to give to the Board a power to make mandatory orders for the strictly limited purpose or regulating the time and manner in which some authority shall be exercised which has been conferred by Parliament directly or mediately through the action of the Board. The section does not say that\nthe Board may order and require any \u201ccompany to do any act\u201d * * * \u201cwhich such company * * * is or may be authorized to do.\u201d\nWhat the section provides is that where the company is or may be authorized or required to do something by an Act of Parliament or by the Board\u2014the Board may order that it shall be done\nforthwith or within or at any specified time and in any manner prescribed by the Board.\nThe section authorizes the regulating of companies and persons when exercising powers conferred by the Act or by the Board by prescribing the time and manner in which such powers shall be exercised. To read the section as authorizing the Board by & mandatory order to convert a permissive authority to do something, into a obligation to do it, is to go beyond the necessary scope and meaning of the language used. Applying the section according to the proposed construction to the provisions of the Act as a whole it becomes reasonably clear that the construction extends the effect of the section far beyond the real purview of it. The learned Chairman of the Board in the opinion now before us, has called attention to some of the provisions which bring into relief the difficulties of this construction. Coming now to section 28:\u2014I think that is a section dealing with procedure only. Where power is given to the Board to investigate and make consequential orders upon application, the Board may of its own motion investigate and order. But the language of the section is hardly the language that would have been used to provide that in every case in which a railway company is authorized to do something, with the sanction of the Board, the Board is to have authority by mandatory order to compel the company to do it. How inapt the words are for such a purpose appears when one attempts to apply those words to section 167. Section 28 provides that\nthe Board may, of its own motion, inquire into, hear and determine any matter or thing, which under this Act it may inquire into, hear and determine upon application or complaint.\nNow what is the \u201cmatter or thing\u201d in respect of which the Board has jurisdiction by the express terms of section 167 to \u201cinquire into, hear and determine\u201d? The \u201cmatter\u201d of the inquiry, hearing and determination is:\u2014Shall the Board give or withhold its sanction to a deviation, change or alteration proposed to be made by the railway company, as shewn upon a plan, profile and book of reference which have been submitted by the railway company for the Board\u2019s approval. Granting sanction or refusing sanction to something proposed by the railway company is the matter which the Board is to investigate under this section. Reverting now to the language of section 28, this, then \u2014 the giving or withholding of its sanction\u2014is the matter which the Board\nmay of its own motion inquire into, hear and determine\nand with respect to which it shall have the same powers as upon applications by the railway company. Such is the result of a strict application of the language of section 28 to section 167, and the result is in itself sufficient to demonstrate that the earlier section has no proper application to the later.\nFor these reasons, I think the first question should be answered in the negative. What I have said will indicate what my answer to the second question would have been if I had answered the first in the affirmative.\nAnglin J.\u2014Although the questions submitted in the stated case concern the jurisdiction of the Railway Board, I think it clear that they are also questions of law and, as such, properly the subject of a stated case under sub-section 1 of (section 55 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d It is true that in section 56 a distinction is made between questions of law and questions of jurisdiction, the right of appeal upon the latter being made conditional on the leave of a judge of this court being first obtained. But section 56 provides for cases in which the Board has already professed to exercise jurisdiction by making an operative order, or has dismissed an application on the ground that it lacks jurisdiction to entertain it. Its decision in either case may properly be made the subject of an appeal. Section 55, on the other hand, provides not for appeals but for cases in which, before pronouncing on order or otherwise dealing with the matter pending before it, the Board desires to be advised by this court upon some question arising in such matter. It is immaterial that the question is one which affects its jurisdiction. The Board is authorized by section 55 to state any question which is in its opinion a question of law. If authority for this view be needed it is to be found in Essex Terminal Railway Co. v. Windsor, Essex and Lake Shore Rapid Railway Co.[3], cited by the learned Chief Commissioner, as more fully appears in the judgment of the late Chief Commissioner Killam, reported in 7 Can. Ry. Cas. 109, 124.\nFor the reasons assigned by me in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Department of Agriculture of Ontario[4], I am of the opinion that the Board has jurisdiction to order, on the application of any other person or body interested, or of its own motion, any deviation, change, or alteration which section 167 empowers it to sanction or authorize on the application of a railway company. While the power and discretion entrusted to the Board under such an interpretation of the Act may seem very wide, it must be borne in mind that considerations of public safety or public convenience may sometimes imperatively require a deviation, change or alteration to which the railway company affected may, from motives of economy or for other reasons, be opposed. To restrict the jurisdiction of the Board under section 167 to cases in which the company applies for its sanction of a deviation, change or alteration, might, therefore, prove very undesirable, and might defeat the purpose of Parliament in enacting section 28 and section 26(2) of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d Moreover, the company always has the right of appeal to the Governor in Council under sub-section 1 of section 56 in any case in which it feels that due regard has not been paid to its interests. There is, no doubt, an incongruity in restricting the power of the Board, when sanctioning the plan, profile and book reference under section 159, to authorizing a deviation of not more than one mile from the location approved by the Minister of Railways (even this limited power it may not exercise where the Minister so directs) and the unrestricted power to\nsanction any deviation, change or alteration * * * in the railway or any portion thereof as already constructed or as merely located\nwhich section 167 purports to confer. When proceeding under the latter section the location of the entire railway or of any part of it may be changed without the approval of the Minister of Railways being required, provided there is no extension beyond the termini mentioned in the special. Act (sub-section 5), I was at first disposed to think that, inasmuch as section 167 applies to a railway \u201cmerely located and sanctioned\u201d as well as to a \u201crailway already constructed,\u201d it should be read as subject to a restriction similar to that imposed by the proviso to sub-section 3 of section 159, because otherwise, while the power of the Board to authorize a deviation would be restricted by the limitation of one mile when it is sanctioning the plan, profile and book of reference, upon that sanction being given authority to sanction a deviation not so restricted would at once arise. But while the existence of such an anomaly is difficult to understand, in view of the fact that in sub-section 4 Parliament expressly restricts the power of the Board, when proceeding by general regulation, to sanctioning deviations not exceeding 300 feet, and by sub-section 5 provides that extensions beyond the termini fixed by the special Act may not be authorized as deviations, changes or alterations, I am unable to treat the omission of any other limitation on the power conferred by sub-section 1 as accidental, or to justify reading into it the restrictions contained in the proviso to sub-section 3 of section 159. Here again the right of appeal to the Governor in Council, given by sub-section 1 of section 56, affords what may well have been deemed a sufficient guarantee and protection against the exercise of the very wide powers conferred on the Board in such a manner as unduly to prejudice the interests of the railway companies or of the public.\nAlthough the proposal of the City of Hamilton is novel in its character and involves a more extensive change than the Railway Board is usually asked to sanction, having regard to the fact that section 167 provides for\nany deviation, change or alteration * * * in the railway or any portion thereof,\nand to the restrictions expressly imposed by sections 4 and 5 adverted to above, I am unable to understand how it can be successfully maintained that the suggested scheme is not within the purview of sub-section 1. What is proposed is the deviation of a portion, of the respondents\u2019 railway. There is no suggestion of an extension beyond the termini fixed by the special Act. The Board may grant the application in whole or in part, or in some amended form, or may reject it in toto as undesirable, or extravagant, or unnecessary in, or contrary to, the public interest.\nHaving regard to the provisions inserted in the statutes confirming the agreement between the rail- way and the City of Hamilton, which expressly save the powers conferred by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d on the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, to which the Board of Railway Commissioners has succeeded, and to the decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Toronto, and Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5], I agree with the Board of Railway Commissioners, that there is nothing in these special Acts which ousts its jurisdiction under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to deal with the present application of the City of Hamilton.\nThe merits of that application have not yet been considered by the Board and it must of course be assumed that, if it should be granted in whole or in part, it will be only upon such terms as will do justice between the parties and afford to the respondent company\u2019s interests every protection to which they may be entitled.\nIn a country such as this, with its vast extent of territory, and conditions varying in its different provinces and constantly changing owing to its rapid development, it is necessary that the powers of a body such as the Railway Commission should be very wide. Much more must be entrusted to its discretion than may be found necessary in older lands where fixed and settled conditions are to be encountered. In dealing with questions affecting the jurisdiction of the Board great care should be taken that judicial decisions do not impose upon it fetters and restrictions which Parliament did not intend, and which might impair its usefulness and seriously hamper its exercise of the beneficent control which it was meant to have.\nI would, for these reasons, answer the first question of the stated case in the affirmative and the second in the negative.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a reference by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe respondents contend, at first, that we have no jurisdiction to hear this case because the matter in controversy is not a question of law, but a question of jurisdiction.\nSection 55 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d empowers the Board of Railway Commissioners to state a case in writing for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada upon a question which, in the opinion of the Board, is a question of law.\nIn this case the Board was called upon to decide whether an application by the City of Hamilton is within the contemplation of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d That application is made for the purpose of diverting the line of railway of the respondents from a certain location in the City of Hamilton.\nThe main point raised on the merits of the application is that the diversion of a line of railway can be ordered only when such deviation is asked for by the railway company itself, and that the Board is without jurisdiction to order such a diversion where the proceedings are instituted by a municipal corporation, as in this case.\nThe Board, in order to decide that point, had to construe the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d especially the provisions of section 167. In their op- inion that was a question of law and they had power to refer the matter to this court in order to have it determined.\nIn general principle questions involving the jurisdiction of a tribunal are questions of law because they involve the application of a statute to some particular proceedings.\nThis court, therefore, is competent to hear the reference and to decide the issue in law raised.\nHaving disposed of this preliminary objection, I will now consider the question whether the Board had the power, on the application by the City of Hamilton, to make an order directing the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company to divert its line of railway from its present location in the City of Hamilton to some other location in that city.\nParliament, by a special Act, determines at first in a general way where a railway company might build its railway. Then a map shewing the general location of the line requires to be approved by the Minister of Railways.\nThe company, after the approval of that general location of its line must obtain from the Board of Railway Commissioners an approval of a plan and of the book of reference that shews the precise location of the line.\nThe Board, in considering the plan and book of reference, is bound by the general location as approved by the Minister with the exception, however, that a deviation of not more than one mile from any one point of that general location may be determined by the Board. But this power of the Board to order a deviation is not absolute; for the Minister may direct that a location which he has approved will not be altered.\nThere is no evidence before us that such a restriction has been provided by the Minister.\nThe plans were approved several years ago and the railway was then located and built.\nNow the City of Hamilton asks for an order from the Board to divert that line of railway.\nIn my opinion the Board cannot grant such an application, because the diversion is not asked for by the railway company itself. The section of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d which deals with the matter is section 167 which reads as follows:\u2014\nIf any deviation, change or alteration is required by the company to be made in the railway, or any portion thereof, as already constructed, or as merely located and sanctioned, a plan, profile and book of reference of the portion of such railway proposed to be changed, shewing the deviation, change or alteration proposed to be made, shall, in like manner as hereinbefore provided with respect to the original plan, profile and book of reference, be submitted for the approval of the Board, and may be sanctioned by the Board.\nSuch changes as that requested by the City of Hamilton in the location of the line of railway in question can be made only at very great cost, and there may be cases where the financial situation of a company would not authorize such a large expenditure. It is only fair, just and equitable that the initial application should come from the company itself.\nThe evident object of the city is to concentrate all the lines of railway passing through the city. It may be a desirable object. But I fail to find in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d the power for the Board to order the closing of some lines and the exclusive use of some other. That could be done only by a common agreement or at the request of the company itself.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the first question submitted should be answered in the negative.\nIt does not become necessary for me then to answer the second question.\nThere should be no costs on this reference.\n[1] [1911] A.C. 461.\n[2] 42 Can.

There was also a provision allowing any subordinate lodge to become incorporated, and in 1890 Pioneer Lodge No. 1 was incorporated and all its property vested in the corporate body. In 1908 a vote was taken on the question of amalgamation with a kindred society for which Pioneer Lodge was overwhelmingly in favour. The amalgamation was rejected by the Grand Council and the lodge then surrendered its charter, practically all of its members joining the other body.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed against (46 N.S. Rep. 417) that the incorporation of the subordinate lodge did not constitute it an independent body; that it still remained a constituent part of the Association; that the surrender of its charter was a dissolution within the meaning of the provision in respondents\u2019 charter above referred to; and that its property on such dissolution became vested in the Grand Council for the purposes mentioned.\nLeave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused, 4th Aug., 1914.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], varying the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The facts affecting this appeal are stated by Mr. Justice Russell in the court below as follows:\u2014\nThe Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association consists of a number of lodges in various parts of the province, or of the members of the various lodges; it makes no difference which for the purposes of this appeal. The scheme of incorporation is that a Grand Council, which is the governing body of the Association, was incorporated by Act of the Legislature in 1882 \u201cfor the purpose of managing the pecuniary affairs of the Association\u201d and for the promotion of the objects of the Association. Subordinate lodges might become incorporated upon the vote of two-thirds of the members present at a regular meeting, and amongst other conditions the filing in the office of the Provincial Secretary of a certificate of its good standing over the hand of the Secretary of the Grand Council. The Grand Council has power to adopt such constitution and by-laws for its government, and subordinate lodges as the lodges shall deem necessary not being inconsistent with the Act or laws of the province, and such subordinate lodges are to have the like powers subject to the approval of the Grand Council. There is a little confusion of idea manifest ill this provision, but the general purpose of maintaining the subordinate position of the lodges is sufficiently indicated nevertheless. Upon the dissolution of any subordinate lodge, its property not theretofore disposed of by the lodge in accordance with its by-laws, is to be forthwith vested in the Grand Council to be applied, first, in payment of any debts of the subordinate lodge and the balance, if any, in such manner as the Grand Council of the Association may deem best for the general interests of the order in the province. Pioneer Lodge No. 1, of the Association, was incorporated under the provisions of the above cited Act, and although the validity of the proceedings seems to have been attacked in the trial before Mr. Justice Graham no point was made of that sort on the argument of the appeal. But in 1890 an Act of incorporation was passed by the Legislature which, it was contended, created a new juristic person with a new name. The only ground for this contention is what seems to have been a clerical mistake in the substitution of the term \u201cworkingmen\u201d for. \u201cworkmen\u201d in the name of the corporation. The fourth section, conferring power to adopt a constitution and by-laws, expressly states that the exercise of this power is to be subject to the approval of the Grand Council of the Provincial Workingmen\u2019s Association, meaning obviously the body incorporated by the Act of 1882, and shewing clearly that the Act of 1890 did not create any new corporation, but merely continued the corporate existence of the subordinate body under the new provisions, in so far as they were new, contained in the Act of 1890.\nThere was no new organization of the lodge under the Act of 1896. The lodge continued its work with the old organization, and treated the Act as a mere continuation of the existing incorporation.\nSection 2 of the Act vests the real and personal property of the lodge in the corporation \u201ccreated\u201d by the Act, and provides that the corporation may inter alia \u201csell, mortgage, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of the same for the benefit of the lodge.\u201d\nSometime in or before the year 1908 a movement was started to amalgamate the Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association with another body, the United Mine Workers of America, and a poll was held which was without statutory authority and was, of course, a wholly unofficial and informal proceeding. The result was that a majority of the members who voted favoured the amalgamation, but eighteen of the lodges voted against the amalgamation, while only seventeen voted for it, and the lodges all having, I suppose, the same representation on the Grand Council, the vote of the latter body was opposed to the amalgamation. Pioneer Lodge voted by a large majority in favour of the amalgamation, 539 for and only 39 against, with 6 rejected votes. The poll was held on June 24th, 1908, and the result announced by the returning officer on July 6th.\nThe vote of the Grand Council, I infer, was taken at the meeting in September, 1908.\nIn pursuance of the policy adopted by the lodge, as I have no doubt, and for the purpose of carrying out a policy of secession, the trustees of the lodge in. October, 1908, conveyed the real estate to one David Colwell in trust for the grantors, and on the express condition that the grantee should grant and reconvey the said land and premises to the said McPherson, Blue and Boss (the trustees who conveyed to Colwell), their successors and assigns on demand. The money of the lodge, amounting to upwards of twenty-seven hundred dollars, was also transferred to Colwell on the same trust. The lodge shortly after, in December, 1908, by unanimous resolution, returned its charter to the Secretary of the Association, and its members proceeded to form themselves into a union of the United Mine Workers. Ralston for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. and Hellish K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent is a trade union incorporated by chapter 74 of the statutes of Nova Scotia, 1882. And appellant, the Pioneer Lodge No. 1 of Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association, is or was a subordinate lodge of the respondent. Of the other appellants some are officers and others alleged trustees of a hall built for lodge purposes and a sum of $2,700, which was once the property of said subordinate lodge.\nThe only question raised herein deserving of serious consideration is whether or not section 7 of the Act of 1882, incorporating respondent, entitled it to claim said real and personal property.\nThe said section reads as follows:\u2014\n7. Upon the dissolution of any subordinate lodge so incorporated, the property held by it at the time of the dissolution which shall not have been disposed of by the lodge in accordance with the bylaws, shall forthwith be vested in the Grand Council of the Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association, to be applied first in the payment of any debts or liabilities of such subordinate lodge, and the balance, if any, in such manner as the Grand Council of the Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association may deem best for the general interests of the order in this province.\nThe Pioneer Lodge No. 1 Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association is the corporate name of said appellant as it appears in section 1 of the Act of 1890, ch. 135, incorporating nine persons named,\nand such other persons as are and shall become members of the lodge hereby incorporated according to the rules and by-laws thereof, created a body corporate, under the name of Pioneer Lodge No. 1, Provincial Workingmen\u2019s Association, for the purpose of holding the property and managing the affairs of the lodge.\nThe question raised herein is whether or not upon the facts in evidence herein the property come to the hands of this corporate body has by virtue of the first quoted section passed to the respondent.\nPrior to this latter Act of incorporation there had been a lodge formed before 1882 named \u201cThe Pioneer Lodge No. 1, Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association,\u201d and at all events from 1882 till the time of this latter Act of incorporation it was in actual affiliation with respondent as a subordinate lodge of that association.\nThe respondent would seem at the trial to have assumed that this Pioneer Lodge No. 1, and that incorporated in 1890 were identical and hence there does not seem to have been adopted the simple methodical plan of proving that identity by books and documents.\nThe appellant, McPherson, says in his evidence as follows:\u2014\nQ. You are a member of Pioneer Lodge Number 1? A. Yes.\nQ. It was the lodge originally organized in 1879? A. Yes.\nQ. As Pioneer Lodge Number 1? A. Yes.\nQ. When did you come there? A. About 1884.\nQ. From that time on until December, 1908, you were a member of Pioneer Lodge? A. Yes.\nQ. You are one of the Trustees? A. Yes.\nThen one Piggott tells of his connection with Pioneer Lodge No. 1, for a period of twenty-six years, beginning in 1882, and says as follows:\u2014\nQ. You know in 1890 the Act where the lodge was given power to sue for its dues? A. Yes. I think Pioneer made that request and it was brought up in Grand Council.\nQ. Did you have any new organization under the Act? A. No, just went on as we went before. Q. I understand the object of the Act was to sue for dues? A. (Objected to) That was the main object.\nThere is a certificate in evidence of date 1882, apparently from the Grand Secretary, that Pioneer Lodge No. 1, is in good standing in Provincial Workmen\u2019s Lodge.\nMr. Justice Graham, the learned trial judge, found the lodge to have been incorporated in 1882 by virtue of the powers in the Act of that year.\nIt does not seem to me necessary to pass any opinion upon that question further than to say that the presumption, from its long continued relation with the parent association, is most cogent in favour of its incorporation by virtue of section 3 of the Act of incorporation in 1882.\nIt seems to me that Pioneer Lodge No. 1, of which we hear in 1882 and earlier was the same which then became affiliated with respondent and, as a subordinate lodge in that association, so continued down to the time that the real and personal property held by its trustees had been directed, in the way complained of, to be conveyed or transferred to the appellant Col-well.\nThat being the case I do not think it makes any difference whether or not there were two incorporations of the same body for that is what in my reading of above, partly quoted, section one, of the Act of 1890, it comes to.\nI need hardly say that the slight difference between the name by which it was incorporated by the special Act of the legislature and that used in the transaction of 1882, by substituting the word \u201cworkingmen\u201d for \u201cworkmen\u201d can in face of such facts affect the determination of this case. The continuous relation between the parent association and the subordinate lodge cannot be affected by such trifles as that. Nor do I think that the Act of incorporation of 1890 either impaired or put an end to the relation that had been created by the affiliation.\nAnd the argument for appellant derived from the omission in that Act of incorporation of anything relative to what was to be done with the property held by the corporation when it ceased to exist by reason of having no longer any members to keep it alive, seems to me entirely wanting in foundation.\nWhat the lodge wanted and hoped for from legislation was to give its acts relative to property while living some force and effect. When dead and its course had ended there was no need for any provision to dispose of its remaining property.\nThat had already been provided for by the legislature in the terms of section 7 above quoted from the Act incorporating the parent association. The argument to be derived from the omission to provide in the later incorporation of 1890 seems entirely the converse of that put forward by appellants.\nIt seems to furnish, further, such cogent evidence of the presumption I have adverted to, as to make it unanswerable.\nAs the property was by the terms of section 7 to vest in the respondent in the events which have happened, there seems an end to the contention set up by this appeal.\nIt was admitted by counsel for appellant that every member of this lodge had joined another association, in breach of the constitution; and that to my mind ipso facto dissolved the corporation and so brought it within the meaning of the apt term \u201cdissolution\u201d used in section 7, and rendered that section operative.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the fallacy in Mr. Balaton\u2019s able argument lies in the assumption that Pioneer Lodge as a corporate body is a body independent of the Grand Council and of the Order as a whole, having a \u201cbut organis\u00e9\u201d of its own. I think that cannot be sustained. As I read the statutes, the incorporation of the Grand Council and of the individual lodges is merely for the purpose of machinery. The incorporated subordinate lodge as a corporate body has its powers limited by the objects of the incorporation, the grand object being to serve the purposes of the subordinate lodge itself as a member of the order. Any attempt to deal with the property of the lodge inconsistently with this object is in my judgment ultra vires. The transaction in question was, as regards the incorporated body, an ultra vires transaction.\nI think the Grand Council as representing the order as a whole has a sufficient interest to entitle it to sue.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree with the disposition made of this case in the provincial courts, and, speaking generally, with the conclusions stated by Graham E. J., and Russell J.\nI cannot regard the statute of 1890 as meant to confer upon Pioneer Lodge, which had been incorporated as a subordinate lodge under the Act of 1882 (which also incorporated the Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association) a status independent of that association of which it was a constituent part. The reference in the statute itself to the Grand Council \u2014 admittedly the executive body of the Provincial Workmen\u2019s Association \u2014 and the subsequent conduct of Pioneer Lodge, make it abundantly clear that it was always intended and understood that the lodge should retain its subordinate position in the association with all the rights, duties and liabilities which that position entailed. Among these were the liabilities and correlative advantages resulting from the provisions of section 7 of the Act of 1882. It is to me inconceivable that the Legislature could have intended to do anything so palpably unfair to the other lodges of the association as to permit Pioneer Lodge to enjoy all the advantages and benefits of membership in the association and at the same time to be free from the obligations and restraints which such membership Imposed upon other lodges.\nI am satisfied that what occurred in connection with the surrender of its charter by Pioneer Lodge to the Grand Council was equivalent to dissolution of the lodge within the purview of section 7 of the Act of 1882, and that on such dissolution happening the trustees of the lodge held its property for transfer to the Grand Council to be by it dealt with and disposed of for the purposes stated in section 7. Having sought and had the benefit of membership in the Provincial Association the members of Pioneer Lodge must accept the countervailing hardships, if they be such, which that membership imposes. They should have counted the cost of abandoning their membership in the defendant association before deciding to do so \u2014 or better still, perhaps, before joining the association.\nI would for these reasons dismiss this appeal with costs. Brodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Russell in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J. L. Ralston.\nSolicitor for the respondents: D. A. Cameron.\n[1] 46 N.S. Rep. 417.\n"

L.R. 378, 384, 391), Duff J. dissenting, that the application of this legislation is not confined to the case of a by-law passed under the general powers of a municipality, but it applies to limit the effect of a special by-law exempting a company from all municipal assessment \u201cof any nature or kind whatsoever\u201d beyond an amount specified as its annual assessment, even when the by-law was confirmed by an Act of the legislature which declared it to be legal, valid and binding, \u201cnotwithstanding anything contained in any Act to the contrary.\u201d Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Winnipeg (30 Can. S.C.R. 558), distinguished.\nHeld, per Idington J.\u2014The by-laws granting exemption did not conform to the statutory requirements and were, therefore, invalid.\n(Applications for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council by the Canadian Niagara Power Co. and the Electrical Development Co. were refused, 4th Aug., 1914.)\nAPPEAL from decisions of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming in each case the order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board which dismissed an appeal from the Court of Revision confirming the assessment on appellant\u2019s property for school purposes.\nIn 1903 the Council of the Township of Stamford passed the following by-law.\n\u201cBy-law No. 9, 1903.\n\u201cA by-law relating to the assessment and taxation of the property of the Canadian Niagara Power Company.\n\u201cWhereas the undertaking and works of the Canadian Niagara Power Company are calculated to con- tribute materially to the prosperity and well-being of the ratepayers of the municipality of the Township of Stamford and it is expedient to grant the request of the said company to the council, to exempt the said company and its property within the municipality from municipal assessment in part, and to agree to and fix the assessment as hereinafter set forth and apportioned as hereinafter set forth.\n\u201cBe it therefore enacted by the Municipal Council of the Township of Stamford, acting under and by virtue of section 8 of 55 Victoria, chapter 8, and all and every other authority enabling it in that behalf, for itself, its successors and assigns, and it is hereby enacted that the annual assessment of all the real estate property, franchises and effects of the Canadian Niagara Power Company, situate from time to time within the municipality of the Township of Stamford be and the same is hereby fixed at the sum of one hundred and sixty thousand dollars ($160,000), apportioned as follows, namely: One hundred thousand dollars upon tunnels, wheelpits, power house, inlets and inlet bridges, and other principal works of the said company, from time to time situate in the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, and sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) upon the other property of the said company from time to time situate in the said Park or elsewhere in the said municipality, for each and every year of the years 1903 to 1923, both years inclusive, and that the said company and its property in the municipality be, and they hereby are exempted in each year of the said years, from all municipal assessment or taxation of any nature or kind whatsoever beyond the amount to be ascertained in each such year by the application of the yearly rate levied by the municipal council in each such year, to the said fixed assessment of $160,000, apportioned as aforesaid.\n\u201cAnd be it further enacted that if the said company shall refuse to pay taxes on the above assessment in any of the above years, the corporation or any lawful authority on its behalf may, if the same are not paid within the time limited for the return of the collector\u2019s roll, thereafter assess and collect taxes upon the said company and its property as if no exemption or commutation had been made.\u201d\nThe by-law was passed in 1903, and, from that date up to 1913, the amount demanded and paid yearly for school rates, as well as for the other rates and taxes, was based upon the fixed assessment of $160,000.\nIn the year 1913 the said township placed the assessment in respect of school rates at $900,000, which assessment forms the subject matter of the proceedings herein.\nSimilar by-laws were passed in 1904 in favour of the other appellant companies and were acted upon in the same way.\nThe by-law in favour of the Ontario Power Co. was validated by special Act of the legislature which provided that it should be legal, valid and binding notwithstanding anything in any Act contained to the contrary. The other companies claimed that their respective by-laws were made valid by the provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d authorizing exemptions from taxation.\nAfter being assessed for school rates in 1913 in addition to the amount fixed by the by-laws each company appealed to the Court of Revision which affirmed the assessment. Further appeals to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board and thence to the Appellate Division being unsuccessful they brought this appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nNesbitt K.C., Grier K.C., and Glyn Osler for the several appellants.\nKingstone for the respondent.\nCANADA NIAGARA POWER CO. v. STAMFORD[2].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The jurisdiction of this court herein must be found in section 41 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d Whether all the questions raised in argument or suggested by the opinion judgments of the court below can fall within the said section may be very doubtful. In the absence of any argument it would be difficult to draw any satisfactory line defining just what is implied in the phrase \u201cconcerning the assessment of property.\u201d Originally no doubt it was intended to be relative to the amount assessed or assessable as against some person.\nSince that enactment was framed, 10 Edw. VII., ch. 88, section 19 has been passed to define the jurisdiction of the courts below relative to such appeals as they have heard.\nI doubt if the range of what is opened thus for the consideration of the courts below is not much more extensive than that which section 41 has assigned to us to hear and determine.\nOf course it is only within the latter we can act.\nIn the view I am about to express these considera- tions may be of no consequence yet I do not wish to be considered hereafter as now holding that the appellate jurisdiction in each of these enactments is exactly co-extensive with the other.\nThe liability of the appellant to pay school taxes is what the parties no doubt desire to have determined. The assessment roll as it stands and as it has been maintained will if upheld herein no doubt so operate as to maintain the levy for school rates, objected to herein.\nThe eighth section of the Act incorporating the appellant is as follows:\u2014\nIt shall be lawful for the corporation of any municipality, in any part of which the works of the company or any part thereof pass or are situate, by by-laws specially passed for that purpose, to exempt the said company and its property within such municipality, either in whole or in part, from municipal assessment or taxation, or to agree to a certain sum per annum, or otherwise, in gross, or by way or commutation or composition for payment, or in lieu of all or any municipal rates or assessments to be imposed by such municipal corporation, and for such term of years as to such municipal corporation may seem expedient, not exceeding twenty-one years, and any such by-law shall not be repealed unless in conformity with a condition contained therein.\nThis was passed in the same session of the legislature in 1892, as was an Act dealing with public school questions and of which section 4 was as follows:\u2014\nNo municipal by-law hereafter passed for exempting any portion of the ratable property of a municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind whatsoever.\nIn this session the legislature also repealed by the \u201cMunicipal Assessment Act,\u201d 1892, sec. 28, the long standing legislation which had empowered the municipalities to grant bonuses in aid of manufacturers.\nAnd, such means of aid having been so obliterated in same session, the municipal Acts were consolidated and what was intended as a complete code was enacted of which section 366 provided that municipal councils might by a two-thirds vote grant exemption from taxation (except as to school taxes) for a term of ten years renewable for the like term.\nThe incorporating Act in which the above quoted section 8 is found, formed chapter 8 of the statutes for the said session, and these other enactments are all in later chapters of the legislation of same session.\nAnd curiously enough in the same session there was passed as chapter 48 of the Acts of said session, the \u201cConsolidated Assessment Act,\u201d the result, if I am not mistaken, of a special commission to consider the questions of assessment and taxation.\nThis Act defined the duties of the assessor and amongst other things directed the assessment roll to be made in a form which provided for the assessment to be set out under columns shewing the actual values of each parcel of land, and then by section 49 thereof the assessor was required to swear that he had done so.\nThere are numerous provisions for specific exemptions and reductions, but nothing that could justify any assessor or anybody else presuming to comply with such a by-law as before us herein discarding these provisions and inventing something else to work out this provision of section 8, possessing many alternative powers.\nIt was absolutely impossible for the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d and this by-law to stand together.\nBut the alleged power to make any such by-law was not invoked till eleven years later. Meantime, (almost impossible as it would seem from the beginning to have carried into execution such a statutory privilege by way of meddling with the assessment roll and all else that is the basis of what we have herein to deal with,) the legislature by the \u201cMunicipal Amendment Act,\u201d 1900, sec. 8, added to section 366, above referred to, section 366(a) by which it is declared that:\u2014\nTo render valid a by-law of the municipality for granting a bonus in aid of any manufacturing industry, the assent shall be necessary of two-thirds of all the ratepayers, etc., etc.\nAnd by section 9 the bonus system was revived in the form and subject to the stringent requirements therein set forth for determining the matter.\nThen section 10 defines what is to be held to be a bonus within said section 366(a), and other sections. And by sub-section (g) thereof:\u2014\nA total or partial exemption from municipal taxation or the fixing of the assessment of any property for a term of years, etc., etc.,\nis the gist of the definition relative to taxation, but the term is limited to ten years\u2019 renewal and exemption from taxation for school purposes is expressly excluded from the operation of the Act.\nThe scope of this legislation is such as to leave no doubt of the purpose of the legislature in relegating to the people the power to pass any by-law in the nature of a bonus.\nThe section 8 of the Act relied upon by appellant in its relation to this later legislation may be considered in a two-fold aspect.\nIn the first place it is to be observed that the language thereof as above quoted which renders it\nlawful for the corporation of any municipality * * * by by-laws specially passed for that purpose does not expressly enable the council to pass such by\u2011law. The council never had any power but that expressly given it to represent the corporation and this was ever subject to such variation as the legislature chose to enact and to empower. The very language used excludes anything but the corporation itself making such a by-law. That corporate existence has always been the collective body of the inhabitants. Within this very language the old form of town meeting would in absence of any other enabling provision be alone what could determine anything relative to \u201ca by-law specially passed\u201d for any purpose.\nThe legislature has the right from time to time to vest such power of passing by-laws in such inhabitants or those representing them, and to declare who, as electors or otherwise, shall represent them, and enable the corporate body to speak and act. The mode or forms assigned by the legislature to do so must be observed.\nThose acquiring from the legislature privileges by way of statute must above all others be presumed to know that the conditions upon which their privileges depend and that the mode of obtaining the enjoyment of such privileges, must be that assigned by the legislature and that the mode may vary from session to session.\nIf the appellant had chosen to act upon the privilege given it in 1892, then it might have been arguable that by section 10 of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d of that time, the council might have had power to express the will of the municipal corporation.\nAt the time when the by-law in question was enacted this mode of expressing the will of the municipal corporation had ceased to exist in relation to the sub- ject matter of conferring upon any one the benefit of such privilege as sought to be conferred.\nIn the next place the right to claim any of the benefits alternatively contemplated by section 8 of the appellant\u2019s incorporating Act, seems to me so much in conflict with all this later legislation that it has been thereby impliedly repealed.\nIt may be arguable that the privilege was in substance within the scope of what might have been conferred by the \u201cMunicipal Amendment Act,\u201d 1900, for the appellant may be held to be carrying on a manufacturing industry within same, but all such privileges became subject to the mode adopted by said Act for expressing the will of the corporation which involved the assent of the ratepayers, which was never got.\nAgain of the many forms alternatively given by said section 8, the parties chose that which was least defensible in law and had been rendered impossible by the enactment of the \u201cConsolidated Assessment Act\u201d to which I have already adverted.\nThe appellant having failed to procure the due enactment according to law of \u201ca by-law specially passed for the purpose,\u201d I am of opinion that the by-law relied upon was wholly void and gave no such privilege as claimed.\nThe greater, of course, includes the less and leaves the appellant liable to the assessment complained of relative to school taxes.\nIf the legislation in conflict with the provisions upon which the appellant relies and the by-law rests, had been only that of the same session, I might have found it necessary to enter upon the question of the effect of such a conflict. But when we find all that so conflicting re-enacted at later sessions either directly or by implication before the alleged by-law was passed and such a definite settled form given to such conflicting legislation as appears in the enactments of 1900, as to render it impossible to conceive of such an ancient privilege being preserved merely by the supposed continuation of the powers of the council out of keeping with aught else bearing upon the subject, we must conclude that the section relied upon has been impliedly repealed.\nThe conflict is to my mind quite as expressive as that which was held in the House of Lords in the case of Duncan v. Scottish North Eastern Railway Co.[3], in 1870, or in the case of Great Central Gas Consumers\u2019 Co. v. Clarke[4], in 1863, where the privilege was the other way about, to have such repealing effect.\nI only refer to these as typical of many more, some of which are collected in the more recent case of Sion College v. London Corporation[5].\nI also agree with the further reasoning applied in the courts below.\nI think there is no resemblance between this case and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Winnipeg[6], so much pressed upon us.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the foregoing the May number for 1914 of the law reports brings a report of The Associ- ated Newspapers v. Mayor, etc., of London[7], which I have read and considered. Though I find nothing therein to vary my opinion yet the Sion College Case[8] is, I observe, doubted therein, and a number of authorities are referred to which are instructive.\nDUFF J.

It shall be lawful for the corporation of any municipality, in any part of which the works of the company or any part thereof pass or are situate, by by-laws specially passed for that purpose, to exempt the said company and its property within such municipality, either in whole or in part, from municipal assessment or taxation, or to agree to a certain sum per annum, or otherwise, in gross, or by way of commutation or composition for payment, or in lieu of all or any municipal rates or assessments to be imposed by such municipal corporation, and for such term of years as to such municipal corporation may seem expedient, not exceeding twenty-one years, and any such by-law shall not be repealed unless in conformity with a condition contained therein.\nA considerable amount of the property of the appellant company is within the Township of Stamford and, on the 11th of May, 1903, the following by-law was passed by that township:\u2014\nWhereas the undertaking and works of the Canadian Niagara Power Company are calculated to contribute materially to the prosperity and well-being of the ratepayers of the municipality of the Township of Stamford, and it is expedient to grant the request of the said company to the council, to exempt the said company and its property within the municipality from municipal assessment in part, and to agree to and fix the assessment as hereinafter set forth and apportioned as hereinafter set forth.\nBe it therefore enacted by the Municipal Council of the Township of Stamford, acting under and by virtue of section 8 of 55 Victoria, chapter 8, and all and every other authority enabling it in that be- half, for itself, its successors and assigns, and it is hereby enacted that the annual assessment of all the real estate property, franchises and effects of the Canadian Niagara Power Company, situate from time to time within the municipality of the Township of Stamford be and the same is hereby fixed at the sum of one hundred and sixty thousand dollars ($160,000), apportioned as follows, namely: One hundred thousand dollars upon the tunnels, wheelpits, power houses, inlets and inlet bridges, and other principal works of the said company, from time to time situate in the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, and sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) upon the other property of the said company from time to time situate in the said Park or elsewhere in the said municipality, for each and every year of the years 1903 to 1923, both years inclusive, and that the said company and its property in the municipality be, and they hereby are exempted in each year of the said years, from all municipal assessment or taxation of any nature or kind whatsoever beyond the amount to be ascertained in each such year by the application of the yearly rate levied by the municipal council in each such year, to the said fixed assessment of $160,000, apportioned as aforesaid.\nAnd be it further enacted that if the said company shall refuse to pay taxes on the above assessment in any of the above years, the corporation or any lawful authority on its behalf may, if the same are not paid within the time limited for the return of the collector\u2019s roll, thereafter assess and collect taxes upon the said company and its property as if no exemption or commutation had been made.\nRead a third time, and passed in Council this 11th day of May, A.D. 1903.\nFrom 1903 to 1913 the provisions of this by-law were observed. In 1913 the appellant company\u2019s property was assessed at $900,000 in the assessment roll of the township. On behalf of the township it is now contended and this contention has been upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that this by-law must be construed as providing for a fixed assessment not for all purposes but for purposes other than that of determining the amount of taxes payable for school purposes. I have already referred to the provisions of the law bearing upon the point touching the assessment and taxation of property within the limits of municipalities in the Ontario Power Company case (see page 198). Leaving out of view for the moment section 77 of the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d of the year 1901, which was first enacted in the year 1892, the relevant provisions of the law touching the assessment and taxation of real property were in substance the same in 1892 as those to which I have referred in that case; and it will not be necessary for the purposes of this judgment to quote the provisions in detail. The foundation of the system of municipal taxation was the assessment roll, in which was entered the actual value of all property within the limits of the municipality not exempt from taxation. It was the duty of the council in each year to levy on the whole ratable property within its jurisdiction a sufficient sum to pay the debts of the corporation falling due within the year, the sums payable being calculated at the rate of so much in the dollar for the actual value of the property. The valuation of the property and generally the compilation of the assessment roll were entrusted to an officer, appointed by the corporation, called the assessor whose duties are laid down in the \u201cAssessment Act.\u201d The valuation by the assessor was subject to revision in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It was the duty of the clerk of the municipality to prepare a roll known as the collector\u2019s roll in which was entered the assessed value of each parcel of property assessed and the amount of taxes payable calculated according to the rate for the year, the amounts payable in respect of any special rate, such, for example, as local improvement taxes or school rates being entered in a separate column with an appropriate caption. This roll is delivered to an officer called the collector whose duty it is to collect the sums set down as the taxes chargeable. The assessed value of the property is spoken of sometimes in the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d as \u201cthe assessment,\u201d which term is also applied to the process of constituting the assessment roll.\nThere can, I think, be no doubt that according to the proper construction of this by-law, reading it with reference to the assessment system prevailing at the time that the by-law was passed, it effectively provides that the sums mentioned are to be entered as the assessed value of the property referred to in the assessment roll and that that sum is to be taken as the assessed value of such properties for all the purposes of the collector\u2019s roll. That, I say, seems to be the meaning of the words. I shall consider in a moment the effect of section 4 of chapter 60 of 1892, otherwise section 77 of the \u201cPublic Schools Act,\u201d 1901. If that enactment applies then the effect of the by-law must be limited as thereby ordained; but giving the words of the by-law their own proper effect, interpreting the word \u201cassessment\u201d with reference to the machinery established by the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d and the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d for the assessment and taxation of property, I think there is nothing ambiguous in the by-law, that it has one meaning and only one meaning, viz., that indicated above. Before passing on to the question which appears to me to be the point of substance in the appeal, I may refer to the suggestion that in the common understanding the language used in this by-law would be read as applying in the limited way contended for by the respondents. I am quite unable to concur in that view. Ratepayers in Ontario municipalities accustomed to receiving annually their notices of assessment, each of which is an extract from the assessment roll, provisionally constituted by the assessor himself and before revision by the Court of Revision, shewing the assessed value of their ratable property, know quite well the meaning and significance of the term \u201cassessment.\u201d They understand that it is by reference to the assessed value as it appears in the assessment roll that the amount of taxes, whether in respect of the general rate or of any special rate, such as the school rates will be determined; and a by-law providing for fixing the annual assessment of given property at a named sum would be commonly understood to mean one thing and only one thing, viz., the fixing of the assessed value of such property for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of the taxes to be paid in respect of it.\nIt should be observed (I am still leaving out of consideration the amendment of the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d above referred to) that by sections 117 and 118 of the \u201cPublic Schools Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1887, ch. 225, the municipal councils are required to levy and collect the moneys needed for school purposes on \u201cthe taxable property\u201d within the municipality \u201cin the manner provided\u201d in the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d and in the \u201cMunicipal and Assessment Acts.\u201d An exemption from assessment, therefore, in whole or in part, necessarily took the property exempted out of the category of property assessable for school purposes.\nWhat I have just said will be sufficient to meet the contention that the authority conferred upon the municipality by the company\u2019s special Act to\nexempt * * * either in whole or in part from municipal assessment or taxation\ndoes not include the authority to exempt from assessment or taxation for school purposes. The assessment is one, the machinery for taxation is a single machinery in each municipality. The whole system is worked by the officers of the corporation. It is true that the law requires the council to collect the funds requisitioned by the school trustees and to pay over to the school trustees the funds collected. But the assessment is none the less a municipal assessment, the taxation municipal taxation. The taxes payable in respect of the school rates or otherwise are a debt due to the municipality (sec. 131, ch. 48, 55 Vict.) And the fund realized is a product of municipal taxation as much as any other fund produced by a special rate and required by law to be devoted to a particular purpose. I may add that apart from the amendment of 1892 to which I am about to refer, I think the reasoning of the judgment of this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Winnipeg[9], applies and is conclusive.\nI now come to the real point on the appeal. It is contended that notwithstanding the provisions of section 8 of chapter 8, 55 Vict., above quoted, the courts are constrained by an enactment passed in the same year, section 4 of chapter 60 of the statutes of 1892, to hold that this by\u2011law does not operate to fix the assessment of the property in question for the purposes of determining the amount to be paid in respect of it for school rates. The three statutes to which I am about to refer were all assented to on the same day, and may, I presume, be taken to have been passed contemporaneously. The first is the enactment to which I have just referred and it reads as follows:\u2014\n4. No municipal by-law hereafter passed for exempting any portion of the ratable property of a municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind whatsoever. The second is section 366 of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act\u201d as follows:\u2014\n366. Every municipal council shall by a two-thirds vote of the members thereof have the power of exempting any manufacturing establishment or any water works or water company, in whole or in part, from taxation, except as to school taxes, for any period not longer than ten years, and to renew this exemption for a further period not exceeding ten years,\n\u2014this last mentioned enactment being a reproduction of section 366 of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d ch. 184, R.S.O., 1887, with this exception, viz., that the words \u201cexcept as to school taxes\u201d are not found in the earlier Act and now for the first time appear.\nThe third is the incorporating statute, the relevant provision of which is quoted above.\nWe have here then the general provision introduced in 1892 into the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d above quoted. We have the amendment of section 366 of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d limiting the power of exemption from taxation to bring that section into harmony with the first mentioned provision, and we have the special Act dealing with the appellant company\u2019s property and the municipalities in which it may happen to be situated. The point to be considered is\u2014the language of the company\u2019s Act being in itself sufficient and appropriate for empowering the municipalities referred to, to enter into a special arrangement with the appellant company in respect of the assessment of the company\u2019s property, whether those municipalities must be taken in the exercise of the special power thus conferred to be governed and controlled by the general provision inserted in the \u201cPublic Schools Act.\u201d I think the canon of construction generalio specialibus, etc., applies. I think it is a case in which the legislature having given its attention to a special case and provided for that special case in a special Act by language, the meaning of which in itself is unmistakable, the special Act must be held to govern notwithstanding the provisions of some enactment of general application passed either before, or at the same time, which provisions can be given reasonable and sensible operation without interfering with the powers conferred by the special Act. I think, in other words, that it is a case in which the general provision must be read as subject to the implied exception of those cases with which the legislature has specially dealt by special enactment. It is quite true that this rule being only a canon of construction must give way where a contrary intention appears. But I have been unable to find any evidence properly cognizable by a court of law (whose duty is limited to construing Acts of the legislature) of any such contrary intention. On the contrary, looking at these three statutes assented to on the same day, I find what appears to me to be evidence of the existence in fact of an intention conformable to the presumed intention upon which the canon above indicated is postulated. I find that evidence in the fact that section 366 of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d upon which is based the general power of the municipalities to exempt from taxation was specifically amended in order to make it clear that the power to grant exemptions did not extend to taxation for school purposes. That was done while at the same moment the provisions of the appellant company\u2019s special Act conferring an unqualified power to exempt from taxation or assessment were allowed to go into effect.\nI refer only briefly to the point made with regard to the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d of 1909. I do not think that the legislature in re-enacting this provision first passed in 1892 in terms obviously intended to make it clear that it applied to by-laws passed after the date of the first enactment of it, can be held to have extended the operation of this provision to by-laws to which in its original form it did not apply. If I am right in my view that the amendment of 1892 as it stood when it was passed in that year did not apply to by-laws passed under special powers relating to special property, then I can see no reason for holding that with regard to such by-laws the subsequent re-enactments of it have in any way widened its operation. I ought perhaps to refer to the suggestion\u2014I do not think it was seriously pressed\u2014that the provisions of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d relating to bonuses governed this municipality in the exercise of this special power. I think those provisions are limited in their application to the exercise of the powers under the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having regard to the relations between school boards and municipal corporations in Ontario and to the manner in which the legislature of that province has dealt with school taxes, I am satisfied that its legislation, whether general or special, empowering municipal councils to exempt from taxation, enacted at or after the session of 1892, however broad and general in its terms, should not be construed as authorizing exemption from school taxation, in any form or to any extent, unless taxation for school purposes is expressly mentioned in such legislation. By a clause inserted in the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d in that year (55 Vict., ch. 60, sec. 4), it is enacted that no municipal by-law hereafter passed for exempting any portion of the ratable property of a municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind whatsoever.\nI respectfully concur in the construction put upon this provision by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in his judgment in the Ontario Power Company\u2019s case. A corresponding restriction on the powers of exemption was at the time introduced into the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d (55 Vict., ch. 42, sec. 366). Both these provisions have since been continued in the legislation of Ontario and are now to be found in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, ch. 266, sec. 39, and ch. 192, sec. 396(e).\nHad there been similar legislation in force in Manitoba when the by-law of the City of Winnipeg considered by this court in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Winnipeg[10], was enacted, I cannot think that it would have held that the exemption from\nall municipal rates, taxes and levies and assessments of every nature and kind whatsoever,\nfor which that by-law provided, would have been held to include exemption from school taxes.\nAs pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in his judgment in the Canadian Niagara Power Company\u2019s case, section 4 of chapter 60, of the statutes of 1892, is not\nan enactment prohibiting the granting of an exemption from school rates, but a mandate to all courts to hold and construe by-laws exempting from taxation as not extending to school rates.\nThe proper construction of the by-laws in question and of the legislative authorization on which they depend for their validity being that they do not ex- tend to exemption from school taxation, we are not confronted with the difficulty which would be presented, did these cases involve attempts to derogate from the effect of prior special statutes by subsequent general legislation.\nThe authority of the judgments of Divisional Courts in Stratford Public School Board v. Stratford[11] (which is probably distinguishable on other grounds), and Way v. St. Thomas[12], relied on by Mr. Nesbitt, is overborne by the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Pringle v. Stratford[13], and that of the Appellate Division in this case.\nNotwithstanding Mr. Osler\u2019s ingenious attempt to differentiate the case of his clients, the Ontario Power Company, from the cases of the other appellants, if the view I take of the proper construction of exempting municipal by-laws passed since 1892 is correct, there is no real ground of distinction between them.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014In these three cases the same question is in issue. We are asked to determine whether the municipal corporation respondent could exempt from school taxes the company appellant.\nPrior to 1874 the school boards in Ontario made their own assessment, levied and collected their own taxes. In 1874 the legislature authorized the school boards to have their taxes collected by the municipalities.\nIn 1879 the power for the school boards to collect their own taxes was discontinued and was vested in the municipality. The school boards have since that time the right to determine the amount of money necessary to meet their expenditures; they would inform the municipality of the money required and the latter in collecting its taxes would at the same time levy the amount of money that would satisfy the needs of the school board.\nUnder that legislation it is evident that an abuse sprung up by which industrial establishments that were exempt from taxation by the municipality did not pay anything for school taxes, for the legislature, in 1892, by chapter 60, section 4, declared that\nno municipal by-law hereafter passed for exempting any portion of the ratable property of a municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind whatsoever.\nThat policy adopted by the legislature has been re-enacted several times since and there seems to be not the least shadow of a doubt as to the intention of the province in that respect.\nThe appellants in order to defeat that intention rely on special Acts conferring upon municipalities in which the works of the companies are situate, the power to exempt them from municipal assessment or taxation and they claim that those special Acts override the general provisions of the law. I am unable to accept such a conclusion. Of course, the legislature could have the right to exempt from school taxes any industrial establishment. But, in view of its settled policy it would require a formal enactment.\nThe instructions given by the legislature to the courts are to construe the by-laws providing exemption from taxation in such a manner that the exemptions should not cover school rates. With such instructions the courts are powerless to find in any by-law an exemption from school taxes unless the legislature would formally declare by a special Act that the school taxes would be included in the exemption.\nThe appellants rely on the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. City of Winnipeg[14], decided by this court. But in the Province of Manitoba, in which that case was instituted, there was no legislation similar to the one we find in Ontario.\nI am of opinion that the appellant companies were not exempt from school rates and that their appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A. Munro Grier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ingersoll & Kingstone.\nELECTRICAL DEVELOPMENT CO. v. TOWNSHIP OF STAMFORD[15].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s claim to exemption from assessment for public school rates differs somewhat from that made in the case of The Canadian Niagara Power Co. v. Township of Stamford.\nIn the assumption, however, that the ordinary municipal rates and school rates and the assessments upon which they respectively rest are identical, these cases present the same fundamental errors of law and fact.\nThe municipal corporation in its relation to the school rates is but the servant or agent of the Public School Board. The latter formerly collected its own rates and later had an option either to do so or require the municipal council and its officers to do so.\nThere existed in the early stages of public school history great division of public opinion on the question of free school education based upon the principle that everything taxable, whether or not its owner had children to educate, should bear an equal proportionate share of the burden of the support of the public schools.\nThe school boards had to resort to the collection of rates in a variety of ways determined by the ratepayers of the section.\nWhen the principle I have just adverted to became fully recognized and established by law the old forms of proceeding for levying the school rates existed in law, though gradually falling into disuse.\nIt was stated and not contradicted in argument that this survival in law of old methods of collection ceased in 1879.\nThere are yet instances such as in the unorganized districts where the school boards have to see to both assessing and collecting. And I am not sure but in regard to separate schools there still remains a survival in law relative to the collection of school rates.\nAll I am concerned with herein is to shew that it is simply as a matter of public expediency that the machinery of the municipal councils is used for the levying of the rates required to support the public schools, and that it is a long time since the obligation of property owners to contribute their share in proportion to their means to the maintenance of the free public schools, was finally established and fully recognized.\nThe argument presented by counsel for appellant that it had no children to educate and that its existence or non-existence was a matter of indifference to the school board, who could not suffer thereby, sounded like an echo of that fierce argument, and vehement expostulation, heard half a century ago upon the wickedness of taking the money of the rich childless man to educate the pauper\u2019s child.\nWhen due heed is paid to the history of the relations between the school board and the municipal corporation, and the settled policy of Ontario, in relation to the system of taxation to execute it, we are not so ready to assume that exemption from municipal assessment or taxation as a matter of course must involve all assessment and taxation carried into execution by municipal councils and their officers.\nIn order to make the matter clear the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d was amended by chapter 60, section 4, of the Ontario statutes, in 1892, which expressly declared as follows:\u2014\nNo municipal by-law hereafter passed for exempting any portion of the ratable property of a municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind whatsoever.\nAnd when the \u201cAssessment Act\u201d was consolidated in 1894, it was declared by section 22 defining the duties of the assessor that he should set out in separate columns of his roll, each parcel of land assessed, the actual value of the parcel exclusive of the buildings, the total of the actual value of the parcel of real property, the total amount of taxable real property and\nthe total value of the parcel if liable for school rates only.\nThis continues substantially the same in the Act under which the roll in question was made up. It is clearly implied that there is to be no diminution of the assessment so far as the basis for school rates, though there might be a \u201ctaxable value\u201d as basis for other rates.\nIt was the next session after this consolidation that the curious Act now relied upon was passed and the attempt made thereby to ratify and confirm a by-law which respondent\u2019s council had passed in the previous month of September, 1904, without any authority.\nThe by-law itself which this enactment is alleged to have validated, by the last clause thereof, says:\u2014\nAnd be it further enacted that this by-law and the provisions thereof shall come into full force and effect immediately after the municipality shall be authorized by sufficient legislative or other authority to pass the same.\nIf, as we are strongly urged to do in other matters herein, we are to apply the strict reading of the Act relative thereto, then as the legislature never \u201cauthorized\u201d such a by-law to be passed, it never has been brought into force.\nI place no stress upon this beyond shewing that we must apply common knowledge and common sense or we should never make much out of some Acts of the legislature by an absolute adherence to the letter thereof.\nBut it is to be observed relative to this by-law and statute, as to all statutory enactments conferring privileges, that the enactment establishing such must be clear and express, and it is somewhat difficult in light of the foregoing considerations to find that this by-law and statute are so.\nThe language can be given a reasonable meaning without going so far as to read therein a privilege quite repugnant to the sense of right of that portion of mankind in Ontario as evinced by its legal history and the persistent Acts of its legislature.\nFor these reasons alone I should hold that the municipal assessments and taxes had in view were those strictly such in the sense of the term ordinary men understand to be such, and not such as would extend it to such as concerned the school boards acting by and through the municipal machinery, even though in a wider sense a school board might be spoken of as a municipal corporation.\nIt must never be forgotten that the council representing and acting for the corporation, and the school board though acting for and on behalf of those within the same territorial area, had for their respective constituents a different set of electors, and entirely different purposes and powers to execute.\nAll the ratepayers elected the school board, but only a limited number thereof elected the councils, and a still more restricted class had a voice in determining the concession of special privileges to any one.\nThe substantial difference of qualification between the two former classes, may not be great, but it illustrates the contention that the constituent bodies are not the same. And whilst the municipal corporation consists of all the inhabitants, the school board is constituted a corporation by itself.\nThen if there be any doubt of the correctness of my view when I hold that upon all the foregoing grounds the appellant must fail, we find the legislature has in very expressive terms put an end to the contention set up, by the following enactment in the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d of 1909:\u2014\n39. No by-law of a municipal council passed after the 14th day of April, 1892, or hereafter passed, for exempting any part of the ratable property in the municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind.\nThis enactment surely puts an end to all argument of the question. It was enacted after the alleged validation of the by-law in question, and comprehends it as well as others of a like kind.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed. I think it is unnecessary to do more than to refer to the reasons already given in the other two cases.

TOWNSHIP OF STAMFORD[16].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal was argued at the same time as the appeals of the Canadian Niagara Power Co. and of the Electrical Development Co. against same respondent, and the appellant seeks similar relief to that claimed therein relative to exemption from assessment for school rates.\nThe council of respondent, acting without authority passed a by-law fixing \u201cthe annual assessment\u201d (whatever that may mean) of appellant\u2019s property. The same curious form is adopted as in the case of the by-law relative to the Electrical Development Company. Both were passed on the same day.\nThe Act of the legislature validating same was more direct in its language than in the by-law and Act involved in the latter case, and not so absurdly retrospective in its form.\nI need not repeat what I have said in regard to the appeals in each of the other cases.\nMuch that I said in my opinions in same applies herein. Indeed, all that I have said in regard to the claim of the Electrical Development Company, except the statement of one of the arguments by counsel for the appellant, is applicable to this appeal. Counsel for this appellant did not use same argument, yet what I was led, as result thereof, to say may be well applied here.\nAnd I think that the following section, 39, of the \u201cPublic School Act\u201d of 1909,\n39. No by-law of a municipal council passed after the 14th day of April, 1892, or hereafter passed, for exempting any part of the ratable property in the municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind,\nis destructive of the possibility of any such claim as made herein. This enactment is but a reiteration of what had previously been enacted but operates from this later date and impliedly repeals if there was anything in regard to school rates in the legislation relied upon to repeal.\nIt would seem as if there was one small corner of the legislative domain in which the privilege hunter has, in Ontario, no ground for hope. The legislature seems to have been persistent and emphatic.\nThe cases I cited in the case of the Canadian Niagara Power Co. seem to answer the appellant\u2019s pretensions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014Before the construction of the appellant\u2019s works and pursuant to an agreement between the appellants and the respondent municipality, the municipality passed a by-law on the 10th October, 1904, in the following terms:\u2014\nBy-law No. 11.\u2014A by-law relating to the assessment and taxation of the property of the Ontario Power Company:\u2014\nWhereas the undertaking and the works of the Ontario Power Company are calculated to contribute materially to the prosperity and well-being of the ratepayers of the municipality of the Township of Stamford, and it is expedient to grant the request of the said company to the council and fix the assessment of the property within the municipality as hereinafter set forth and the apportionment thereof as hereinafter set forth.\nBe it therefore enacted by the municipal council of the Township of Stamford for itself, its successors and assigns, and it is hereby enacted that the annual assessment of all the real estate, property, franchise and effects of the Ontario Power Company, situate from time to time within the Municipality of the Township of Stamford, and used for the corporate purpose of the company, be and the same is hereby fixed at the sum of $100,000, apportioned as follows, namely: $30,000 upon the gates, houses, penstocks, inlets, inlet bridges and other principal works of the company, situate in the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, and $70,000 upon the other property of the said company, situate in the said park or elsewhere in the said municipality, for each and every year of the years 1904 to 1924, both years inclusive, and that the said company and its property in the municipality shall not be liable for any assessment or taxation of any nature or kind whatsoever beyonds the amount to be ascertained in each such year by the application of the yearly rate levied by the municipal council in each such year to the said fixed assessment of $100,000, apportioned as aforesaid.\nAnd be it further enacted that if the said company shall refuse to pay taxes on the above assessment in any of the years the corporation or any lawful authority on its behalf may, if the same are not paid within the time limited for the return of the collector\u2019s roll, thereafter assess and collect taxes upon the said company and its property as if this by\u2011law had not been passed.\nAnd be it further enacted that this by-law and the provisions thereof shall come into full force and effect immediately after the municipality shall be authorized by sufficient legislative or other authority to pass the same.\nRead a third time and passed the 10th day of October, 1904.\nThis by-law was confirmed by a special Act of the legislature, chapter 78 of the statutes of 1905, in the following terms:\u2014\nWhereas the Ontario Power Company, of Niagara Falls, has, by petition, represented that a certain by-law of the Corporation of the Township of Stamford, in the County of Welland, being By-law No. 11, and passed by the municipal council of the said township on the 10th day of October, 1904, should be confirmed and made in all respects legal and binding in accordance with the intent and meaning thereof; and whereas it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petition;\nTherefore His Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. By-law No. 11, of the Municipal Corporation of the Township of Stamford set forth as Schedule \u201cA\u201d to this Act, is legalized, confirmed and declared to be legal, valid and binding, notwithstanding anything in any Act contained to the contrary.\nFrom the year 1905 to 1912 the provisions of the by-law were observed, but in the year 1913 the municipality proceeded to assess the property at the sum of $650,000, setting up for the first time the contention that the by-law must be read as limiting the \u201cannual assessment\u201d provided for, to assessment for purposes other than the purpose of determining the amount of school rates. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has sustained the respondent\u2019s contention. The first question to decide is: What, apart from section 77 of chapter 39, 1 Edw. VII., is the meaning of the \u201cannual assessment\u201d of the property of the company referred to in this by-law? The statutory provisions in force in 1904 relating to the assessment and taxation of lands within the limits of municipalities are mainly to be found in the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d ch. 224, of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897. Section 6 of that Act provided:\u2014\n6. All municipal, local or direct taxes or rates, shall, where no other express provision has been made in this respect, be levied equally upon the whole ratable property, real and personal, of the municipality or other locality, according to the assessed value of such property, and not upon any one or more kinds of property in any particular or in different proportions.\nThe \u201cassessed value\u201d of property was determined by an annual valuation made by an officer denominated the assessor recorded in a document known as the assessment roll which was subject to revision as provided for by the Act. The process of determining the valuation as well as the value so arrived at are described by the term \u201cassessment.\u201d The \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d sec. 402, requires that the council of every municipal corporation shall in each year levy, on the whole ratable property within its jurisdiction a sufficient sum of money to pay all its valid debts. By section 403 the rates are to be calculated at\nso much in the dollar upon the actual value of all the real and personal property liable to assessment therein.\nBy section 71 of the \u201cPublic Schools Act,\u201d already referred to, the council of every municipality was required to levy and collect on the \u201ctaxable property\u201d in the manner provided by the \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d and in the \u201cMunicipal and Assessments Acts,\u201d such sums as might be required by the trustees for school purposes; and by section 129 of chapter 224 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d R.S.O., 1897, it was provided as follows:\u2014\n129. The clerk of every local municipality shall make a collector\u2019s roll or rolls as may be necessary, containing columns for all information, required by this Act to be entered by the collector therein; and in such roll or rolls he shall set down the name in full of every person assessed, and the assessed value of his real and personal property and taxable income, as ascertained after the final revision of the assessment roll, and he shall calculate, and opposite the assessed value, he shall set down in one column, to be headed \u201cCounty Rates,\u201d the amount for which the person is chargeable for any sums ordered to be levied by the council of the county for county purposes, and in another column to be headed \u201cTownship Rate,\u201d \u201cVillage Rate,\u201d \u201cTown Rate,\u201d or \u201cCity Rate,\u201d as the case may be, the amount with which the person is chargeable in respect of sums ordered to be levied by the council of the local municipality for the purposes thereof, or for the commutation of statute labour, and in other columns any special rate for collecting the interest upon debentures issued, or any local rate or school rate or other special rate, the proceeds of which are required by law, or by the by-law imposing it, to be kept distinct and accounted for separately; and every such last mentioned rate shall be calculated separately, and the column therefor shall be headed \u201cSpecial Rate,\u201d \u201cLocal Rate,\u201d Public School Rate,\u201d \u201cSeparate School Rate,\u201d or \u201cSpecial Rate for School Debts,\u201d as the case may be.\nThis roll when completed is delivered to the \u201ccollector,\u201d whose duty it is to collect the amounts chargeable according to the roll.\nNow I think it is reasonably clear that the \u201cannual assessment\u201d in respect of which this by-law makes provision, means the assessed value of the property \u201cascertained\u201d in the manner mentioned in section 129 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d that is to say, the sums provided for in the by-law are the sums to be entered in the assessment rolls by the assessor as the \u201cassessed value\u201d of the property mentioned and in each case this \u201cassessed value\u201d is to be that to which the clerk of the municipality is to have regard for the performance of his duties under section 129. It is upon that value that the amounts payable in respect of the rates of every description referred to in that section are to be calculated. Reading this by-law, therefore, as intended to govern the municipality and the officers of the municipality in the working of this machinery for assessment and taxation which is set up by the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d and the \u201cPublic Schools Act,\u201d it seems clearly enough on its face to provide that the sums which are thereby fixed as the \u201cannual assessment\u201d of the property referred to are to be in each case the \u201cassessed value\u201d of such property for the purpose of calculating among others the public school rate, or the separate school rate, as the case may be.\nThe amount payable in respect of any particular property depends upon the assessed value of the property. The \u201cassessed value\u201d of the property is the actual value unless it is otherwise provided by law. This by-law is an effort to provide otherwise. And the validating enactment quoted above seems to make this attempt effective. The enactment seems to provide that the by-law according to its true construction is to be legally valid notwithstanding anything in any Act to the contrary. It seems very clearly to be a case of a special Act making special provision for a particular case. And the general rule whereby the provisions of such a statute are not to be derogated from by the provisions of any general Act is emphasized as applicable to this statute.\nNow the point on which the court below has proceeded is this: The \u201cPublic Schools Act\u201d above re- ferred to contains a provision, section 77, in the following words:\u2014\n77. No by-law passed by any municipality after the 14th day of April, 1892, for exempting any portion of the ratable property of a municipality from taxation in whole or in part shall be held or construed to exempt such property from school rates of any kind whatsoever.\nThe contention is that this enactment applies to the by-law in question. I cannot concur in this view. On the face of it is a general provision applying to by-laws passed in exercise of general powers by any municipality. It has no necessary application to this special by-law dealing with a particular case validated by a special statute. It was suggested during the course of the argument that it ought to be treated as laying down a binding rule of construction. To that it seems to me that there is this unanswerable objection. The terms of the special statute of 1905 exclude the operation of any such general rule of construction.\nANGLIN J.\u2014(The opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin is reported at page 187, ante.)\nBRODEUR J.\u2014(The opinion of Mr. Justice Brodeur is reported at page 189, ante.)\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ingersoll & Kingstone.\n[1] 30 Ont.

L.R. 154), and restoring that of the Divisional Court (27 Ont. L.R. 87), Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that an apartment house intended for occupation by several families was not a \u201cdetached dwelling house\u201d within its meaning.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought for an injunction to restrain the respondent from erecting an apartment house on lot 32 on the east side of Maynard Avenue in the City of Toronto, and which adjoins the lands upon which the appellant has erected a valuable private residence.\nThe lands now owned by the appellant and re- spondent respectively were formerly owned by the Reverend George Maynard.\nThe executors of the reverend George Maynard conveyed lot 32 above mentioned to one John Williamson by deed dated the 18th April, 1888, the material portion of which is as follows: \u201cAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises (describing them) to be used only as a site for a detached brick or stone dwelling house to cost at least two thousand dollars to be of fair architectural appearance and to be built at the same distance from the street line as the houses on the adjoining lots.\u201d\nThe respondent\u2019s title is derived through this conveyance to Williamson.\nWhen the appellant purchased the land now owned by him it was one of the few remaining vacant lots on Maynard Avenue, and he did so with the knowledge that there were restrictions on that street governing the class of buildings to be erected thereon and also knowing from his personal inspection that the houses on the street were all private dwellings and worth from $7,000 to $10,000. The appellant erected a first-class private dwelling house costing approximately $14,000, over and above the value of the land, which he would not have done had he not believed that there were building restrictions sufficient to prevent the erection of such a building as is proposed by the respondent.\nThe respondent proposes to construct what is called an apartment house upon lot 32, and the plans and specifications which he had prepared shew that it is intended to include the construction of six separate and distinct suites or sets of rooms, each cut off from the others by its own front door and composed of a living room, four bed rooms, a bath room, a dining room and a kitchen.\nThe appellant believing that his property would be very greatly depreciated and damaged if the respondent were permitted to construct the proposed building, commenced this action.\nBy assignment dated the 9th April, 1912, Adelaide M. Maynard, one of the executors of the reverend George Maynard and one of the grantors in the deed to Williamson from which the respondent derives his title, assigned to the appellant all her rights as grantor in the said conveyance to enforce the conditions imposed thereby and authorized the appellant to take such legal proceedings as he might deem necessary to prevent the respondent from violating the said condition by the erection of an apartment house on the said lands.\nAfter the commencement of the action the appellant moved for an interlocutory injunction. The motion was by consent turned into a motion for judgment and on the 3rd May, 1912, judgment was pronounced by Mr. Justice Middleton dismissing the action with costs.\nThe learned judge considered that he was bound by the decision in Re Robertson and Defoe[3], and dismissed the action. This judgment was reversed by the Divisional Court (composed of Falconbridge C.J.K.B., Britton and Riddell JJ.), Britton J. dissenting.\nThe judgment of the Divisional Court was reversed by the Appellate Division (R. M. Meredith, Garrow, Maclaren, Magee and Hodgins JJ.A.), Maclaren and Magee JJ.A., dissenting.\nFrom the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGlyn Osler and J.H. Cooke for the appellant. The conveyance to Williamson contains a restrictive covenant limiting the use of the land by the grantee and his assigns. Mackay v. Dick[4], at page 263; Rawson v. Inhabitants of School District[5], Brookes v. Drysdale[6], at page 60.\nThe words used are to be interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense. Rogers v. Hosegood[7], at page 409; Hext v. Gill[8]; Ex parte Breull[9].\nJ.M. Godfrey for the respondent referred to Kimber v. Admans[10]; Robertson v. Defoe[11]; Neill v. Duke of Devonshire[12], at page 149.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent claims that he is entitled within the terms of a grant of certain lands conveyed to be\nused only as a site for a detached brick or stone dwelling house to cost at least two thousand dollars, to be of fair architectural appearance and to be built at the same distance from the street line as the houses on the adjoining lots to erect on said site half a dozen dwelling houses so attached together and covered in that they may wear the external appearance of one house.\nIf this is to be construed as a covenant I conceive and respectfully submit that respondent is simply attempting by a juggling use of the word \u201capartment\u201d to seem to keep the promise to the ear yet break it to the hope.\nIt is part of the office of the law to defeat such like attempts and see that what was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties to a contract as expressed in their use of the words thereof, is so adhered to that neither the purpose nor the language is frittered away by over refinement.\nIt is the use of the site and not the use or abuse of the detached dwelling when built that is in question. The illustrations pressed in argument of what might be done in way of overcrowding even a detached dwelling, against which this stipulation is not aimed, are therefore of no avail.\nBut I must not by multiplying words darken the meaning of what is so plainly expressed in the deed.\nIn arguing that this term is so expressed in the deed as to constitute a condition instead of a covenant, it may possibly be that a fairly arguable proposition is put forward.\nIt certainly, in view of the later covenant contained in the same deed, specially directed to the restrictive use of the premises and wherein this stipulation is not included, does suggest a doubt.\nBut there is nothing in the later covenant inconsistent with this stipulation. And when it is pressed on argument that there is no right of re-entry reserved for a breach of the condition, one is tempted to say that if it had been intended merely as a condition, such a right of re-entry would likely have been found in the deed.\nIt is necessary if possible to give due effect to the purpose of the parties and as this can only be given some effect by holding it to be a covenant, I think it must be held to be a covenant.\nNo particular form of words beyond such as shew, the parties\u2019 concurrence in agreeing to abide by some specific course of conduct in future, are needed to constitute a covenant. Indeed, as has been said by high authority, the same words in some cases may constitute both a condition and a covenant.\nWe must look at the whole instrument and doing so here I have no doubt the grantor and grantee intended the latter should be bound to use the land in the manner stipulated, and for this purpose I presume the grantee executed the deed.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The covenant in this case, in my judgment, has no application to the building in question. The building is, undoubtedly, a house. It is a dwelling house because it is constructed solely for housing people as dwellers. The contention that because the house contains a certain number of apartments in which separate families might conveniently live, it is therefore not a \u201cdetached\u201d dwelling house is a contention which if not wholly irrelevant must involve the proposition that the building is not a dwelling house but an assemblage of dwelling houses. I think it is rather extravagant to affirm that a given house is not a \u201cdetached\u201d house solely be- cause it contains a number of apartments capable of separate occupation.\nI think the considerations which ought to govern the determination of the case are set forth very satisfactorily in the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith in the court below.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It is common ground that the terms of the \u201ccovenant\u201d in question should be given the meaning ordinarily attached to them when used in common parlance. Rogers v. Hosegood[13]; Hext v. Gill[14], at page 719. It is urged by the appellant that the construction put by the respondent upon these terms is technical and refined; the respondent makes a similar complaint of the construction insisted upon by the appellant.\nIt would be a most extraordinary description of a modern apartment house, such as the defendant proposes to erect, to call it \u201ca detached dwelling house\u201d\u2014a description that nobody would ever dream of using colloquially. No purchaser of a property, which he had not seen but had bought relying on the vendor\u2019s description of it as \u201ca detached dwelling house,\u201d would expect to have foisted upon him or be compelled to take, as answering that description, an apartment house such as the defendant\u2019s plans provide for. If further evidence were required of the purview of the restriction intended to be imposed upon the user of the property in question as a building site, it is furnished by the fact that, his purpose being to ensure that Maynard Avenue should maintain its character as a first-class residential street, the vendor stipulated that on the site now owned by the respondent there should be erected nothing other than a dwelling house of brick or stone costing at least $2,000. What sort of modern apartment house built of brick or stone could be constructed for $2,000? The amount of this minimum price seems to shew conclusively that the purpose was that nothing other than a single dwelling house in the ordinary acceptation of that term should be erected on the land.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that the decision in Robertson v. Defoe[15], relied on by the respondent cannot be sustained. Each apartment in the modern residential apartment building is a residence. I cannot understand how such a building can be deemed in compliance with a covenant that \u201cevery residence erected on the land shall be a detached house.\u201d \u201cHouse\u201d was the word considered in Kimber v. Admans[16]. \u201cDwelling-house\u201d was the term dealt with in Rogers v. Hosegood[17]. See, too, Ilford Park Estates v. Jacobs[18]. As I read Rogers v. Hosegood17 it supports the view which I take of the proper construction of the stipulation with which we have to deal, although it is not on all fours with the present case because of the provision there found that each messuage to be erected should be \u201cadapted for and used as and for a private residence only.\u201d\nI have no doubt as to the right of the plaintiff to maintain this action. It is shewn that part of the consideration for his purchasing his adjacent property was the existence of the building restriction in question as affecting all the lots on Maynard Avenue. He bought the benefit inter alia of the covenant of the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title. Moreover, he has an express assignment of that covenant from one of the covenantees. See Rogers v. Hosegood[19], at pages 394, 407-8; Formby v. Barker[20], at page 551; Child v. Douglas[21].\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Riddell in the Divisional Court I agree with his conclusion that the provision in question should be deemed a covenant and not a condition. The fact that, no right of re-entry for breach being reserved, the stipulation, treated as a condition, would be ineffectual, affords another reason for treating it as a covenant; ut res magis valeat. To the authorities cited by Riddell J., I would merely add a reference to Hodson v. Coppard[22], and Stevinson\u2019s Case[23].\nI would, for the foregoing reasons, with respect, allow this appeal with costs in this court and the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the Divisional Court.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The appellant is the owner of a lot on Maynard Street in the City of Toronto and the respondent is the owner of an adjoining lot on the same street. These lots were sold with the covenant that each of them \u201cwould be used only as a site for a detached brick or stone dwelling house to cost at least $2,000, to be of fair architectural appearance and to be built at the same distance from the street as the houses on the adjoining lots.\u201d The respondent proposes to erect an apartment house and the appellant, as transferee of the rights of the original vendor, claims an injunction to restrain the respondent from building that apartment house. He claims that the apartment proposed to be erected is not a detached house and is, in that respect, an infringement of the covenant above referred to.\nThe respondent submits, on the other side, that the proposed building is a detached dwelling house and is in no way infringing the said covenant.\nWhen the contract was made, in 1888, apartment houses were not being built in the City of Toronto. There were flats and tenements which were used or leased by a certain class of the population.\nThere was also the detached house which was used for the residence of one family. Those detached houses were necessarily more expensive than the others and were supposed to be used by a wealthier class of the community.\nThere is no doubt that Mr. Maynard, when he opened the street in question and sold those lots, had in view the establishment of a nice residential quarter and those covenants were stipulated evidently for that purpose. He did not want to have any flats nor any tenements erected on those lots which would be occupied by two or three lessees.\nThe only difference I see between the apartment house which the respondent proposes to build and those flats is that in the case of an apartment house there is a common entrance from the street and in the other there are two or three entrances, or as many as there are lessees in that house.\nI consider that apartment houses were not within the covenant and that its construction is an infringement of that covenant. Rogers v. Hosegood[24].\nThe apartment proposed to be built might be a house and a detached house; but being a series of separate dwellings, it is not the detached dwelling house which the parties had in view, viz., a house for the residence of one family. The apartment is more connected with the idea of flats than with the idea of a detached dwelling house.\nI consider that the words in the covenant should be given their ordinary popular meaning. Rogers v. Hosegood, at page 409; Ex parte Breull; In re Bowie[25].\nFor these reasons I think that the injunction prayed for should be granted.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.H.

APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe original plaintiff, Sir Richard Cartwright, brought action to have a sale of his land for unpaid taxes set aside as irregular for want of notice by the defendant\u2019s council of the city\u2019s intention to purchase and for other irregularities, or, if the sale was held valid, for a declaration that the defendant only held the land in trust for the plaintiff as security for the unpaid taxes. The defendant examined the plaintiff on discovery and at the trial, the plaintiff being dead and the action having been revived by his executors, the latter sought to use the deposition on the examination on discovery, but the trial judge refused to receive it.\nJudgment was given for the defendant at the trial and affirmed by an appeal to the Appellate Division, which also held that the deposition was properly rejected.\nGeorge Bell K.C. for the appellants.\nGeary K.C., and Colquhoun for the respondent.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the proposed judgment to dismiss this appeal. I think we are bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of City of Toronto v. Russell[2], and that, in the face of that decision, it is not open to us to limit the curative effect of the remedial statute of 3 Edw. VII. ch. 86, sec. 8, amended by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 99, sec. 8. On the question raised as to the admissibility in evidence of Sir Richard Cartwright\u2019s depositions on discovery, we were all of the opinion on the argument that those depositions were properly excluded by the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It may have been fairly arguable before the decision in the case of City of Toronto v. Russell2, that the omission to give the notice required by the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1897, ch. 224, sec. 184(3), to be given by the municipality of its intention to purchase the land in question for the taxes in arrear did not fall within any of the many curative provisions of the validating Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 86, in question herein.\nIt might well have been argued with much force that the words\na failure or omission on the part of an official of the said city\nwas meant only to cover failure to give some routine notice or omission of such like duty prescribed by the statute to be observed by any of the city\u2019s officials and could not be extended so far as to cover an unusual step such as required in consequence of a determination which the council was enabled to take in the way of buying land offered for sale for taxes, but subject to the condition precedent to the power becoming operative of giving the special notice which the Act imposes.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has, however, in said decision, put a construction upon that Act which, notwithstanding other facts and circumstances also relied upon in the decision, seems to me to preclude our giving effect to any such argument as suggested.\nTheir Lordships seem to have rested the judgment not only upon the peculiar facts and circumstances absent in this case, but also upon their construction of the statute.\nAnd a later amendment to same curative provision seems to render any attempt to distinguish this case still more difficult.\nThe judgments in the courts below render it quite needless to say any more.\nThe point I have referred to is the only one which was not disposed of on the argument before us.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant seeks to shew that the late Sir Richard Cartwright entered into an agreement with Mr. Biggar, then City Solicitor of Toronto, and for the purpose of proving this he offers in evidence certain statements in the examination of Sir Richard Cartwright for discovery. The principle upon which he relies is this: Where a witness has given evidence in the course of litigation, such evidence may be used in other litigation relating to the same subject matter between same parties if the witness have, in the meantime, died, provided the party against whom it is offered has had an opportunity of cross-examining the witness.\nI think the rule has no application. The examination for discovery is in the nature of a cross-examination; but the rule relating to the admission of evidence given on such examination entitles the cross-examiner to proceed with the absolute assurance that no part of the examination can be used against him, unless he on his part seeks to make use of it for his own purposes.\nIt is not a cross-examination with a view of testing and setting in a proper light the whole of the evidence of the party examined. It is an examination alio intuit\u00fb. I think it is not a cross-examination such as contemplated by the rule sought to be invoked.\nOn the merits of the case I think all the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant are disposed of by the decision of the Privy Council in City of Toronto v. Russell[3]. I see no reason to doubt that the passages of the judgment at page 501 form a part of the ratio decidendi. The effect of these passages, in my judgment, is to explode the notion which appears to have been founded on some decisions of this court, that statutes of this character are subject to some special canon of construction based, apparently, upon the presumption that all such statutes are prim\u00e2 facie monstrous. The effect of the judgment of the Judicial Committee is that particular provisions in such statutes must be construed according to the usual rule, that is to say, with reasonable regard to the manifest object of them as disclosed by the enactment as a whole.\nANGLIN J.\u2014On the questions raised as to the admissibility in evidence on behalf of the executors (now plaintiffs) of the depositions on discovery of the original plaintiff, the late Sir Richard Cartwright, and as to the obligation of the municipality to account to their former owners for any surplus proceeds realized on the re-sale of lands bought by it at tax sales, it was made sufficiently clear during the argument that the court is of opinion that the position taken on behalf of the appellants is not tenable.\nThe purposes for, and the conditions under which, evidence is taken on discovery make it impossible that such evidence should be admissible on behalf of the party giving it except as provided by Consolidated Rule 461. Such evidence is not within the proposition enunciated in Taylor on Evidence (9 ed.), para. 464, relied on by counsel for the appellants. It is also clearly distinguishable from evidence taken de bene esse.\nThe statute under which the municipality is authorized to buy in at tax sales (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 224, sec. 184(3)), empowers it to become a purchaser without any restriction upon its rights of ownership, except the obligation to sell within three (now seven) years. The effect of the purchase is to extinguish the personal obligation of the former owner for the arrears of taxes. If the municipality sells for less than the amount of taxes, it has no right to recover the deficiency; if it sells for more, the surplus belongs to it and it is under no obligation to account for it.\nThe only objection taken to the proceedings by which the municipality became purchaser that calls for consideration is the failure of the municipality or its officers to give to the owner the personal notice of the intention of the municipal council to purchase at the tax sale, which the Judicial Committee, concurring in the views expressed in the Ontario courts, held, in the Russell Case[4], at page 501, is required by sub-section 3 of section 184 of the \u201cAssessment Act,\u201d ch. 224, R.S.O. 1897. In that case the same sale for taxes which is here attacked was dealt with, but in respect of another property. It is true that upon the special facts of that case their Lordships were of the opinion that the plaintiff had waived the notice of intention to buy, but they rest their judgment disposing adversely of his objection that such notice had not been given to him equally on the provisions of the curative Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 86, on which the respondent relies. Their Lordships\u2019 view of the effect of the statute, which they assign as a ground of their decision, cannot be treated as obiter dictum. New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[5], at page 184; Membery v. Great Western Railway Co.[6], at page 187. I agree with the learned judges of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario that the decision in the Russell Case[7] is conclusive on this point against the appellants. The statute, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 86, sec. 8, was so amended by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 99, sec. 8, that it extends to failure or omission by the city itself or the council to comply with the requirements of the assessment Acts, as well as failure or omission to do so by any official of the city. As amended, this legislation, given the effect required by the decision in the Russell Case7, clearly covers the failure to give notice of which the appellants seek to take advantage, whether the default is ascribable to the municipality, its council or its officials.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action to impeach a tax sale made by the City of Toronto on the 10th of April, 1901, and for a declaration that the respondent, the City of Toronto, was holding the lands sold in trust for the owner.\nThe action was instituted in 1909 and was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Ontario in 1913. That judgment was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.\nThree questions have been submitted to us.\nThe first question is this: Can the evidence on discovery given by one of the parties be used in this case when the party dies?\nAs a general rule a witness giving oral testimony under oath in a judicial proceeding in which the adverse litigant could cross-examine his evidence may be used in any subsequent suit between the same parties if the witness himself is incapable of being called. (Taylor on Evidence (9 ed.), para. 464.)\nBy the rules of court in the Province of Ontario a party to an action may be examined on discovery, but his evidence can be used only at the request of the opposite party. (Rules 431-460 and 461.)\nThose rules are statutory and must be restricted to the provisions of the statute. The opposite party, according to those rules, is the only one who can use that evidence on discovery and at the request of the representative of the party put in evidence the examination on discovery given by that party cannot be received.\nThe second question is as to the effect of the remedial statute, passed by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 86, sec. 8, which validated the tax sales made during certain periods of time mentioned in the said Act and which periods of time included the tax sale in question in this sale. The bearing of that statute was considered in the case of City of Toronto v. Russell[8], and it was decided by the Privy Council that those tax sales were validated and could not be impeached for the reason which is now contended by the appellant.\nBesides, by a statute passed in 1906, 6 Edw. VII. ch. 99, sec. 8, the above legislation of 3 Edw. VII. ch. 86, was extended in order to make still more certain the validity of those tax sales.\nAs to the claim of the appellants that those tax sales are subject to redemption or that the city becomes purchaser in trust for the former owner, I do not see that the statute may be construed to cover such a contention.\nThe City of Toronto had been authorized to purchase the lands at those tax sales. A right of redemption exists for a certain period of time, but after that period of time the city becomes the absolute owner of the property and does not hold it subject to any trust.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: George Bell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William Johnston.\n[1] 29 Ont.

A car was coming from the east and the motorman saw him when he left the curb at a distance of about fifty yards. Twenty yards further on he threw off the power and when L., still abstracted, crossed the devil strip and stepped on the track reversed being then about ten feet from him. The fender struck him before he crossed and he received injuries causing his death. On the trial of an action by his widow the jury found that the motorman was negligent in not having his car under proper control, that L. was negligent in not looking out for the car, but that the motorman could, notwithstanding, have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care. A majority of them found, also, that L.\u2019s negligence did not continue up to the moment of impact.\nHeld, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the jury were entitled to find as they did; that when the motorman first saw L. he should have realized that he might attempt to cross the track and it was his duty, then, to have the car under control; and that his failure to do so was the direct and proximate cause of the accident for which the railway company was liable.\nHeld, per Davies J.\u2014The motorman was not guilty of negligence prior to the negligence of L. which consisted in stepping on the track when the car was near and it was then too late to prevent the accident.\nHeld, per Anglin J.\u2014The findings of the jury, especially the finding that L.\u2019s \u201cnegligence was not a continuing act up to the moment of the accident,\u201d were not satisfactory and there should be a new trial.\n(Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused, 4th Aug., 1914.)\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial and dismissing his action.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nRaney K.C., for the appellant. The jury could and did find that though the plaintiff was negligent the motorman could, by exercising reasonable care, have prevented the accident. This being so the plaintiff is entitled to the verdict. Pollock on Torts (9 ed.), pages 471 et seq. Radley v. London & North Western Railway Co.[1], at page 759; The Bernina[2].\nDewart K.C. for the respondents. On the evidence given the case should not have gone to the jury. See Davey v. London & South Western Railway Co.[3]; Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[4]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McAlpine[5].\nWe also rely on Jones v. Toronto & York Radial Railway Co.[6]; Brenner v. Toronto Railway Co.[7], at page 556.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In view of the admitted negligence of the deceased, the question to be decided is: Could the motorman have prevented the accident by the exercise of ordinary prudence? The jury found in answer to questions 4, 5 and 6 that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was negligent in not looking for the car, but that notwithstanding such negligence, the accident might have been prevented if the car had been under proper control and the brakes had been put on. Those answers would have been more helpful if the jury had fixed the period of time at which this precaution with respect to the brakes should have been taken. But to appreciate their full significance, the answers must be considered in the light of the evidence. For instance, the motorman says that he had the deceased in view from the time the latter left the sidewalk up to the very moment of the accident, and that\nhe kept straight on crossing the street with his head down in the direction of the car absolutely absorbed, not thinking of what he was doing,\nand this, notwithstanding the insistent ringing of the gong. The motorman also admits that he realized almost immediately when he first saw the deceased that there might be trouble, and notwithstanding, at a distance of thirty yards from the point of the accident, the car was moving at the rate of ten miles an hour. The motorman adds that\nhe realized the deceased was not going to stop in his attempt to cross the track when he was only ten feet from him,\nand he then reversed his power and applied the brakes. In these circumstances, the unfortunate man is run down and the jury find that the car was not under proper control at the time of the accident and that the brakes should have been applied sooner.\nIt would be difficult to reach any other conclusion unless the jury were prepared to say that the motor- man who admits he was fully aware of the possibility of trouble at a time when, by the exercise of reasonable care, he might have avoided the accident, was entitled to run the pedestrian down because the latter was negligently unconscious of the coming of the car.\nThe general effect of the answers to the first six questions is: Assuming that the negligence of the deceased began apparently when he left the sidewalk and continued until the moment of the accident; the motorman who says he anticipated danger from the moment he first saw the deceased coming towards the tracks was under a duty to be on the alert, and he should, in the circumstances have expected that the deceased would attempt to cross the track\u2014which was indeed the only danger to be anticipated\u2014and have been prepared for that emergency. The jury find that he failed in that duty. His negligence was, therefore, the immediate cause of the accident.\nThe answer to question seven, which was put by the judge of his own motion, has a tendency to create some confusion. That question and the answer thereto are as follows:\u2014\n7. Could the motorman and the deceased each of them up to the moment of the collision have prevented the accident by the use of reasonable care\u2014in other words, was the negligence of deceased a contributing act up to the very moment of the accident?\nAnswer.\u201410 say \u201cNo,\u201d and 2 say \u201cYes.\u201d\nIn his charge to the jury, the effect of that question is thus explained by the trial judge:\u2014\nNow, the seventh question is a very peculiar one. Could the motorman and the deceased each of them up to the moment of the collision have prevented the accident by the use of reasonable care\u2014in other words, was the negligence of the deceased a contributory act up to the very moment of the accident? I do not think I can make it any clearer than I have made it there. Did the unfortunate deceased\u2019s act contribute up to the moment of the accident? Well, in a sense, it did, physically, because he went right on, but that is not what is meant by this question. The question is: Did he become aware that the car was approaching and was he able to avoid the danger? That is the sense in which that question is put. We do not know anything about his condition of mind at all. Apparently there is a question of whether he was under the influence of liquor or not. The policeman says he was a short time before. The man who was with him says he was not. I do not think it makes a great deal of difference in any event, it is just what his state of mind was, which you are the judges of, from the best information that can be placed before you.\nAlthough not completely satisfactory, I am disposed to think that the effect of the answer is that, at the moment of impact, the deceased was unconscious of the near approach of the car, and that the motorman who had the last opportunity to avoid the accident, failed in his duty.\nThe general effect of the verdict when read with the evidence and the charge of the trial judge is, therefore; that, notwithstanding the negligence of the deceased the motorman might have avoided the accident by the exercise of ordinary prudence and, in that view, the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below. Tuff v. Warman[8]; Radley v. London and Northwestern Railway Co.[9]\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the judgment of the Court of Appeal was correct and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nIn my opinion the evidence and the findings of the jury upon it are conclusive that not the negligence of the company, but the reckless negligence of the deceased caused his death.\nIn answer to the questions put to them the jury found, first, that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband was not caused by any negligence on the part of the respondent company prior to the negligence of the deceased; secondly, that the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s husband (deceased) which caused or contributed to the accident, was such that without it the accident would not have happened; and thirdly, that such negligence consisted \u201cin not looking for the car.\u201d\nThe last answer necessarily refers to the moment when the deceased stepped on to the car track in front of the car.\nThese three findings of the jury negativing negligence on the company\u2019s part prior to the negligence found on the deceased\u2019s part which caused or contributed to his death, seem to me to settle the question that up to the moment when the motorman ought reasonably to have apprehended that the deceased was going to step on to the track in front of the car, there was no negligence on the company\u2019s part.\nIn this connection I may say that it was proved to be the daily practice for people to cross the street from the sidewalks out to the car tracks and there await the passing of the car. The street was double tracked. People were, of course, within their rights in so acting and this practice did not ordinarily call for any special precaution on the part of the motorman of the cars. Special conditions and circumstances no doubt would call for special precautions, such for instance as a man evidently running so as to cross the tracks, or a drunken man incapable of taking full care of himself and looking as if he intended to cross the tracks, or a child apparently so small and young as to be incapable of appreciating danger. In this case it was contended that the deceased was crossing the street slowly with his head bent down and not looking for the car, and that this condition threw an additional onus upon the motorman as to the degree of care he was to take, especially as he admitted throwing off the power and so reducing the speed when he saw the deceased approaching the car tracks. But there was nothing to indicate any intention on the part of the man to cross the tracks in front of the car and the throwing off of the power was at the most only a commendable and prudent precaution.\nReliance, however, was placed upon the findings of the jury in answer to questions 5 and 6, that notwithstanding the deceased\u2019s negligence in stepping on the track without looking for the car, the defendants could by the exercise of reasonable care have averted the collision\nby putting on the brakes and having the car under proper control.\nThese findings of negligence, properly construed, seem to me without any evidence whatever to support them. They cannot be construed as imputing negligence to the defendants prior to that of the deceased because the jury\u2019s answer to question one emphatically negatived any such negligence. They can only mean that after the motorman ought to have apprehended danger from the deceased stepping on the track he should have put on the brakes. But it was not until the man was in the act of stepping from the south track on to the devil strip and the north track, that the motorman should have apprehended any such action, and any attempt to stop or control the car\u2019s speed at that moment by putting on the brakes would have been perfectly useless. The motorman\u2019s evidence is to the effect that the deceased was about ten feet in front of the car when he first apprehended that de- ceased intended crossing the track and that he immediately reversed. If he was right, or approximately right, in this no doubt can exist that the action he took in reversing was the only possible effective action he could have taken. Putting on the brakes at that moment would have been absolutely useless.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel contended that at the inquest the motorman had stated that when he reversed the car was a car length or a car length and a half from the deceased and that the jury had a right to believe the statement alleged to have been made at the inquest as to the distance. But Stevens, the motorman, when questioned at the trial respecting this alleged statement read to him from the reporter\u2019s notes of the evidence, swore that the report was a mistake and that he never did say that. No attempt was made to contradict him or to prove that he had said so.\nNo witness suggests even that the deceased was a car length or a car length and a half in front of the car when he stepped on the track. If he had been he would certainly, in view of the speed at which the car was moving at the time, have got safely across, Charles Allen, who saw the accident, says:\u2014\nI seen the gentleman just as he stepped on to the car tracks, just as he seemed to put his foot on to the car track, the north track.\nAnd being asked what then happened, he said:\u2014\nI seen the gentleman seemed to throw out his hands as though he had realized his danger on the instant and the round part of the fender on the north side seemed to catch him.\nBeyond the cross-examination of the motorman as to his statement at the inquest, our attention was not called to any evidence of any kind as justifying the contention that the deceased was further away from the car when the motorman reversed than he said he was. The width of the car tracks, the speed of the car, and the distance the car ran after the accident, coupled with the evidence I have quoted above, compel the conclusion that the motorman\u2019s statement of the distance the deceased was from the car when he first apprehended he was stepping on to the track was approximately correct. I do not see any ground or justification for any inference to the contrary.\nI, therefore, conclude that there was no evidence whatever to support the jury\u2019s answer to question 6 if the meaning and effect of that answer is that the accident could have been averted after the motorman ought reasonably to have apprehended that the deceased man contemplated stepping on the track in front of the car.\nI think the motorman took the only possible effective means of averting the accident by reversing when he did and that to have applied the brakes instead would have been necessarily ineffective and useless.\nI confess myself unable to understand the real meaning of the seventh question even when read in light of the charge of the trial judge. It seems to me clear that considering the distance between the deceased and the car at the time he stepped on the track his negligence in so stepping without looking for the car must be held to be contributory negligence and is so found by the jury. Nothing that then or afterwards could be done by the motorman could have averted the accident. The deceased might possibly have stepped back and so averted it, but that the negligence of the deceased in stepping on the track in front of the car without looking, and attempting to cross, as found by the jury, was a continuing contributory act up to the moment of the accident, I have not heard anything to cause me to doubt.\nIt is important to observe that there is no finding that the motorman did not sound his gong, as he swears he did, or that he did not reverse as soon as he should have done. The finding that he should have applied the brakes and had the car under better control can only mean, read in the light of their previous findings, that the motorman should have applied the brakes instead of reversing when he did. But there is not a scintilla of evidence to warrant that finding. Indeed, the evidence shews that reversing was then the only possible available means of averting the accident under the circumstances proved.\nThe contributory negligence of the deceased being a direct and effective cause of the accident is a complete answer to the action, unless there was something done or omitted afterwards by the motorman which he ought not to have done or omitted which could have prevented the accident.\nThe jury do not say that the motorman did not reverse as soon as he ought reasonably to have apprehended that the deceased intended to step on the track. If, instead of reversing when he did, he had then applied the brakes he might well have been found guilty of negligence.\nThen with reference to the throwing off of the power and so reducing the speed of the car at about 35 or 40 yards before reaching the place of the accident which the motorman swears he did as a matter of precaution, the jury do not find that there was any negligence with regard to that.\nMy own judgment is that the jury intended their answer, as to want of reasonable care in not putting on the brakes, to apply to a period anterior to the negligence of deceased in stepping on the car track, because it seems absurd to apply it to a time coincident with or subsequent to the deceased\u2019s negligence, when it must have been ineffective in preventing the accident. The plan adopted of reversing was much more effective then and was apparently the only possible thing to have done. But if that is what the jury meant, as I think it was, then it is not only in direct conflict with their first finding that the defendant company was not guilty of any negligence prior to the negligence of the deceased, but it could not, in my judgment, have any effect given to it in this action where subsequent contributory negligence constituting a direct and effective cause of the accident is found. If, on the contrary, it meant, what the question and answer read together seem reasonably to imply, that \u201cnotwithstanding the negligence of the deceased\u201d the company were guilty of negligence in not afterwards applying the brakes, then I think the finding is utterly without evidence or warrant to support it and that what was done after deceased\u2019s negligence, namely, \u201creversing,\u201d was the only possible effective thing that could be done.\nThe answers of the jury, therefore, to questions 5 and 6, whether held applicable to a time anterior to the contributory negligence of the deceased man or subsequent to it, cannot affect the result. There is no evidence whatever to justify a finding that the brakes should have been applied after the contributory negligence of the deceased occurred or that such action could possibly at that time have averted the accident. If, on the other hand, the finding applies to the time anterior to the contributory negligence of the deceased which was a direct and effective cause of the accident, it cannot entitle the plaintiff to succeed.\nThat has been the principle on which this court has for years acted and it is one sanctioned and approved by the highest authorities in England.\nThe London Street Railway Co. v. Brown[10]; Brenner v. Toronto Railway Co.[11]; Spaight v. Tedcastle[12], at page 226; The Bernina[13], and specially pages 88 and 89.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I accept the law as being correctly laid down in Pollock on Torts, 9th ed., page 473, as follows:\u2014\nIf the defendant could finally have avoided the mischief by ordinary diligence, it matters not how careless the plaintiff may have been at the last or any preceding stage.\nThe deceased according to evidence the jury were entitled to accept was crossing from the southerly to the northerly side of Queen street, in an oblique line tending westerly when respondent\u2019s car, running from the east to the west, struck and killed him.\nThe line thus taken by deceased tended to prevent him, when evidently from some cause or other in an unobservant mood, from as readily seeing the coming car as he otherwise might have done.\nThe motorman says he saw him from the time he stepped off the sidewalk to pursue the path he took, and kept him in his eye till he was struck.\nThe story is a striking one and, to comprehend clearly and accurately the issue now presented for our solution, better be given in the language of the man who ought to know the facts. The same man had been examined before the coroner, who had held an inquest. The stenographer\u2019s report of his examination at the inquest was referred to at the trial hereof and material parts of it read to him and his assent, or dissent, as the case might be, got. This is to be borne in mind in estimating both the value of the witness\u2019s evidence and his integrity. The following are extracts from the stenographic record at the trial.\nMr. Raney: Q. This is what you said at the inquest, Mr. Stephen, page 13, the question was: \u201cTell us how the accident happened as you saw it,\u201d and your answer was, \u201cWell, as I was going west on Queen street between John and Peter streets or Soho street, I seen a man leave the sidewalk with the intention of crossing the track. I guess I was about 50 yards from him when I see him first, well, I started ringing my gong and he was going with his head down, looking downwards. He never paid any attention and I throwed off my power and kept ringing my gong, but he did not seem to take any notice at all. So when I seen that there was danger I reversed my car, but it did not stop quick enough to save hitting him and he was struck with the north-west corner of the fender\u201d\u2014\n* * * * * * *\nQ. Was that a truthful answer, Mr. Stephens? A. Yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. You said your speed on this night when you came up from John to Peter was about fifteen miles an hour\u2014I suppose that is more or less of a guess, is it? A. Yes, just about the ordinary.\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Raney: Q. And you threw your power off, and when did you begin to ring your gong. A. Just when I threw my power off.\nQ. Just when you threw your power off\u2014and did you throw your power off as soon as you saw the man stepping off the sidewalk with his head down? A. I just threw my power off after I seen him coming towards the track.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. How long after? A. Just as soon as he got off.\nQ. At the inquest you were asked, \u201cwhen did you change your speed\u201d\u2014how far did you go when you changed your speed? A. I threw my power off\u2014when I started ringing my gong.\nQ. When did you start ringing your gong? A. When I saw him approaching the track.\nQ. How far were you from him then? A. \u201cI was about, when I seen him approaching the track I was about fifty yards\u201d\u2014is that right? A. When I seen him first I was about fifty yards.\nQ. Would you say it was as near? A. I was about fifty yards when I seen him first.\nQ. It was then you threw your power off? A. Well, I was getting closer all the time.\nQ. We will read what you say? \u201cYou did not throw off your power then did you? Did you throw your power off fifty yards from him? A. Well, as soon as I seen he was going to approach the track I threw off my power. Q. And then you were fifty yards away? A. Of course, I was getting closer, you know, I would be about thirty at that time. Q. And he seemed still to keep on walking in a northwesterly direction,\u201d and you say, \u201cYes,\u201d of course it must be northwesterly according to your evidence. Now was there anything to obstruct your view of the man 1 A. No.\nQ. You had a clear view of him all the time? A. Yes.\nQ. From the moment he left the sidewalk until you hit him? A.\nYes.\nQ. And during that time you had him always in sight? A. Yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. And did he ever give the least sign of apprehending the approach of your car\u2014did he ever give the least sign that he knew that your car was approaching him? A; No, I do not think he did.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. If any car passed would it pass east before? A. Before I saw him?\nQ. Before you got him in line? A. Yes.\nQ. No traffic at all in the street? A. No.\nQ. Then you were asked again\u2014these are the Crown\u2019s questions to you\u2014page 15, two\u2011thirds of the way down\u2014\u201cHow far were you from him when you started gonging? Were you the full fifty yards away?\u201d And you said, \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cAnd you kept gonging him until you got to Soho street?\u201d and your answer was \u201cYes, gonging him all the time.\u201d \u201cQ. Did he give any sign of having heard you?\u201d and your answer was, \u201cNo, he never heard at all, kept going ahead with his head down.\u201d These answers are true? A. Well, yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. Now how far were you away from him when you reversed? A. Ten feet.\nQ. Ten feet? A. I reversed as soon as I seen he was in danger.\nQ. How long is your car? A. About thirty feet.\nQ. About thirty feet long? A. Yes.\nQ. Now I see on page 17 of your evidence at the inquest you were asked, \u201cHow far away were you from him when you reversed?\u201d and you answered, \u201cAbout a car length.\u201d A. That is a mistake, I never did say that. Q. Then at page 21 you were asked that question, \u201cHow far\u201d\u2014I had better read the question before to get the context. \u201cQ. Then what did you do? A. Well, as soon as I seen he was in danger, as soon as I seen he was stepping on to my track I reversed. Q. How far were you from him then? A. About a car length and a half\u201d A. That is a mistake.\nQ. That is a worse mistake? A. I never said that.\nQ. That is a worse mistake than the former one? A. Yes.\nQ. Now you say that you were within ten feet of him when you reversed? A. Yes, that is where I was.\nQ. Then how far did the car go after you hit him? A. Pretty near half a car length.\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Raney: Line 10. Q. \u201cYou were about one hundred and fifty feet back east of him when you first saw him? A. Yes. Q. And he left the south side of Queen street with his head down in this way, absolutely absorbed, not thinking what he was doing? A. Yes. Q. And he walked across the street? A. Yes. Q. And in a northerly direction? A. North\u2011westerly direction?\u201d A. North-easterly.\nQ. You mean north-easterly? A. Yes.\nQ. \u201cYou had him in view all the time? A. Yes. Q. Did you begin to gong him as soon as you saw him? A. As soon as I saw him. Q. That was at one hundred and fifty feet away? A. Yes. Q. Then you thought that there might be trouble and you threw off your power? A. Yes. Q. How far were you away when you threw off your power? A. Probably forty or thirty-five yards\u201d\u2014now are these answers correct with the exception of the correction you have just made, north-easterly for north-westerly? A. Well, I never thought he was going to cross in front of the car.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. So the first thing you did was to gong him with your foot? A. Yes.\nQ. And then as he did not pay any attention you threw your power off? A. And kept gonging him repeatedly.\nQ. Now what was the character of the gonging that you did\u2014was it a slow pressure or did you give it a rapid pressure A. Rapid pressure.\nQ. All the time. A. Repeatedly.\nQ. For the whole hundred and fifty feet, or fifty yards? A. Repeatedly.\nQ. And was that for the whole distance? A. Yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. Did this man hesitate at all as he came across the street? A. No, I do not think he did, he was walking so slowly.\nQ. Never hesitated and never looked up? A. No, he was just going with his head kind of hung. Q. This is a question from a juror, \u201cQ. This man that was crossing the track, did you notice he hesitated at all or did he keep going an even pace? A. He never hesitated at all. Q. Kept going slowly? A. Kept moving slowly. Q. Gave no sign that he heard you coming? A. Never looked up\u201d\u2014these answers are true? A. Yes.\nQueen street is unusually wide and from the south curb to the track the car ran on is shewn to be twenty-eight feet six inches.\nThe issue presented to us is whether or not the man seeing another he thus described as so dead to his surroundings as to fail to respond to such desperate efforts as were made to arouse him, had duly and properly run him down. If we can say so then the judgment appealed from is quite right. And it seems to me we must be able to say so before we can uphold it.\nIt seems according to past instances from Davies v. Mann[14], down to the recent case of O\u2019Leary v. The Ottawa Electric Railway Co.[15] (appeal from which judgment was dismissed by an equal division in this court) in a great variety of cases to have been held that it was for the jury to say whether or not, in a case where the defendant had apprehended, or ought to have apprehended, danger of injury to another who had been negligent of his person or his property, he (the defendant) had exercised ordinary care to avert such injury. Hence the law has hitherto been taken to be as laid down in the passage above quoted from Pollock.\nThe jury has said deceased was negligent but by answering another question, No. 5, seems clearly to intend that ultimately the respondent had not taken proper care to avert the accident\u2014in other words\u2014had not used that ordinary care the law required. Question No. 7, though, I submit with great respect, unhappily framed, yet evoked a reply confirmatory of the same view and minimized the negligence of deceased as viewed by the jury.\nSuch read in light of the charge seems clearly to be the result of these findings. And so read there can be no judgment dismissing the action unless the court comes to the conclusion it should never have been submitted to a jury but dismissed.\nI cannot think that a man who realized, as the motorman professes, for such a length of time and space the danger he was in of injuring the deceased, whose movements and conduct he had kept steadily in his eye, was justified in running him down.\nHowever that may be I can still less think that there was no case to submit to the jury.\nI can conceive of men taking, as in fact the members of this very jury did, opposite views in such a case. And it seems to me that the learned Chief Justice who tried the case realized all the difficulties, used his long and wide experience of such cases, and ruled according to the law as it has been administered by him and others for a quarter of a century. The Court of Appeal has gone a long way in the direction of establishing (what railway companies have struggled so long to establish) the hard and fast rule of \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d as an impassable barrier in the way of future recovery by any persons, or their representatives, in cases where the so-called rule has not been observed.\nIt has never hitherto formed part of English or Canadian law. Each case with its attendant circumstances has been dealt with independently of such rule, though elements in it may have formed part of the basis acted on in many cases.\nThere may be in the motorman\u2019s story a good deal of fiction. He may not in fact have been so very apprehensive and realized so well the danger as he says. Indeed, it would seem charitable to doubt it in looking at the results.\nIt does not, however, lie in the mouth of respondent to say we should do so.\nNor does his own intimation that he did not think the man would attempt to cross, conclude the matter, for the judge and jury were entitled to consider his acts of throwing off the power and continually ringing his gong as conclusive evidence that he thought there was danger of his crossing and being run down. And yet he failed to use that ordinary diligence motormen feeling such danger should have used.\nIf he had continued at the high rate of speed he was going, before realizing the danger, he would have passed the man without hurting him.\nApprehending what his conduct says he did, ordinary common sense dictated his doing more than he did.\nThere is in the evidence another and entirely different story which if correct might have been well accepted by the jury to justify a verdict for the defendant.\nI am not concerned at all with that for it lay within the province of the jury to determine which story was right.\nI am only concerned with the law and for the maintenance of the law and long established means of applying it by leaving to the jury the facts unless so clear beyond peradventure that there is nothing to try.\nIt has been suggested this motorman exercised his judgment. Again it was for the jury to say whether such judgment could be held to be in conformity with what men of common sense exact, under the name of ordinary care or diligence.\nThe motorman\u2019s amending version that the deceased travelled north-easterly in his crossing, is in conflict with the evidence and surrounding circumstances. But if correct, then the deceased was facing the light of the coming car and a greater object of the motorman\u2019s pitying care than if going obliquely to the northwest. Is a man seeing another in such state entitled to shout at him and knock him down if he won\u2019t get out of the way?\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nI wrote the foregoing opinion shortly after the first argument herein a year ago, and though a longer line of authorities has been cited on the second argument than on the first, I have heard nothing to shew that there has been any change in the operation of the clear legal principles so long established which I have referred to in the foregoing.\nDUFF J.\u2014Broadly, the rule as regards the effect of a plaintiff\u2019s negligence is that his want of care, assuming it to be of such a character as to constitute what is understood in law to be negligence, is a complete answer to a claim founded on the defendant\u2019s negligence, if it was in whole or in part the \u201cproximate\u201d or \u201cdirect cause\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s misfortune. In Walton v. London, Brighton & South Coast Railway[16], at pp. 429 and 430, Mr. Justice Willes in the course of a discussion of the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Tuff v. Warman[17], says:\u2014\nIf there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff, then the only question is whether there has been negligence on the part of the defendant. But in cases where there has been negligence on the part of the plaintiff, the question is whether that was the direct cause of the accident or proximately contributed to it.\n* * * * * * *\nIf there was evidence of negligence on the part of the plaintiff, the further question arises whether that negligence was the proximate or direct cause of the accident.\nIn his judgment in The Bernina[18], at p. 61, Lord Esher states the rule in these words:\u2014\n(5) If, although the plaintiff has himself or by his servants been guilty of negligence, such negligence did not directly partly cause the accident, as if, for example, the plaintiff or his servants having been negligent, the alleged wrongdoers might by reasonable care have avoided the accident, the plaintiff can maintain an action against the defendant. (6) If the plaintiff has been personally guilty of negligence which has partly directly caused the accident, he cannot maintain an action against any one.\nAnd at pp. 88 and 89 Lord Justice Lindley discusses the subject in the following passage:\u2014\nIf the proximate cause of the injury is the negligence of the plaintiff as well as that of the defendant the plaintiff cannot recover anything. The reason for this is not easily discoverable. But I take it to be settled that an action at common law by A. against B. for injury directly caused to A. by the want of care of A. and B. will not lie. As Pollock C.B. pointed out in Greenland v. Chaplin[19], the jury cannot take the consequences and divide them in proportion according to the negligence of the one or the other party. But if the plaintiff can shew that although he has himself been negligent, the real and proximate cause of the injury sustained by him was the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff can maintain an action, as is shewn not only by Tuff v. Warman17, and Radley v. London and North Western Railway Co.[20], but also by the well-known case of Davies v. Mann[21], and other cases of that class. The cases which give rise to actions for negligence are primarily reducible to three classes as follows:\u2014\n1. A. without fault of his own is injured by the negligence of B., then B. is liable to A. 2. A. by his own fault is injured by B. without fault on his part, then B. is not liable to A. 3. A. is injured by B. by the fault more or less of both combined, then the following further distinctions have to be made: (a) if, notwithstanding B.\u2019s negligence, A. with reasonable care could have avoided the injury, he cannot sue B.: Butterfield v. Forrester[22]; Bridge v. Grand Junction Railway Co.[23]; Dowell v. General Steam Navigation Co.[24]; (b) if, notwithstanding A.\u2019s negligence, B. with reasonable care could have avoided injurying A., A. can sue B.: Tuff v. Warman17; Radley v. London and North Western Railway Co.20; Dames v. Mann21; (c) if there has been as much want of reasonable care on A.\u2019s part as on B.\u2019s or, in other words, if the proximate cause of the injury is the want of reasonable care on both sides, A. cannot sue B. In such a case A. cannot with truth say that he has been injured by B.\u2019s negligence, he can only with truth say that he has been injured by his own carelessness and B.\u2019s negligence, and the two combined give no cause of action at common law.\nI think the jury was entitled to find in this case the following facts: That the motorman became aware some time before the collision that if the deceased, Frank Long, continued in the direction in which he was going there was risk of collision between him and the car. He also became aware that the deceased was absorbed and quite inattentive to his surroundings. They were further entitled to take the view that if the motorman was a person competent to take charge of an electric car running on such a thoroughfare as Queen street, he ought to have realized (early enough to have enabled him to stop his car or to bring it under such control as would enable him to stop it without risk of injury to the pedestrian) that in the circumstances it was his duty not to assume the risk of proceeding without taking such measures. They were also entitled to find that Long in fact did not become aware of the proximity of the car until the moment he was struck or immediately before. As to the question, these facts being established, as between Long\u2019s heedlessness and the motorman\u2019s failure to do his duty in the circumstances, Long\u2019s heedlessness was a direct or proximate cause of the accident, the broad common sense of the matter seems to dictate the answer that the negligence of the motorman (who saw Long\u2019s failure to realize the peril of pursuing his course and his state of abstraction, and who ought himself to have realized the peril) was, to use the language of Lord Justice Lindley, quoted above, \u201cthe real and proximate cause of the accident.\u201d\nOn the law the respondent\u2019s contention is that, assuming the facts to be as just stated, the case is within the specific rule (a) enunciated in the passage quoted above from Lord Justice Lindley\u2019s judgment as applicable to the third class of cases mentioned by him, viz., where A. is injured by B. through the fault more or less of both combined, then if notwithstanding B.\u2019s negligence, A. with reasonable care could have avoided the injury, he cannot sue B.; and that it is not within the rule enunciated by the Lord Justice as Rule (b). It cannot be doubted that if we take the moment when Long stepped across the south rail, or the latest moment, whenever it was, at which by hurrying across the track he could have escaped the car, as being the crucial moment, and confine our attention to the physical possibilities of the situation at the moment so taken, the case appears to be literally within the Ian- guage of the rule (a). Considered with reference exclusively to an external standard, Long\u2019s conduct at either of these moments unmistakably exhibits a want of ordinary care, and at either of these moments by the observance of such ordinary care the avoidance of the accident would have been physically possible. I should mention in passing that I am excluding the hypothesis of drunkenness, I think that after what occurred at the trial and before this court on the first argument the appellant\u2019s right to recover cannot properly be rested upon any such hypothesis.\nFurthermore, treating Long\u2019s failure to observe ordinary precautions at these critical moments as negligence, within the meaning of rule (b), it seems to be literally true that from the first of those moments on, the motorman did everything that could be done to avoid the mishap, and that at that stage of the business he must be acquitted of negligence.\nBut I think the fallacy in this line of argument lies in the tacit assumption that the rules referred to as rules (a), and (b), constitute an exhaustive code of rules applicable to the third class of cases mentioned by the Lord Justice. It will be observed that Lord Justice Lindley is careful, as are Mr. Justice Willes and Lord Esher in the passages I have quoted from them respectively, to insist upon the broad general principle that the victim\u2019s negligence to be an answer must be a direct or proximate cause of the accident. Rules (a) and (b) are particular examples of the application of the general principle; rule (c) is in effect a restatement of the general principle. But\u2014assuming that rule (b) is not applicable to the circumstances of this case, there are elements present here, the motorman\u2019s knowledge of facts from which he ought to have foreseen the peril in time to have avoided the injury, the victim\u2019s ignorance of the peril and the motorman\u2019s knowledge of that ignorance, which cannot, I think, be left out of account in determining whose conduct was the proximate cause for the purpose of assigning responsibility which are not to be found in the cases in which the specific rule (a) has heretofore been enunciated and applied. I do not think there is any decision requiring one to hold that in a case in which such elements are present these specific rules (a) and (b) literally interpreted must be regarded as furnishing an exhaustive or exclusive interpretation of the general principle; on the other hand, there are decisions of this court, Calgary v. Harnovis[25], and Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Hinrich[26], supporting the view that in such cases such elements of knowledge and ignorance must be taken into account and that the victim\u2019s conduct must be viewed in its relation to the conduct of the defendant in determining whether it was a causa proxima. That view is supported by the decision of Municipal Tramways Trust v. Buckley[27], in the High Court of Australia. It receives some support also from the case of Springett v. Ball[28], and in Mitchell v. Caledonia Railway Co.[29], at p. 519, Lord Dunedin and Lord Kinnear seem to give the weight of their authority in favour of this way of looking at such cases. Perhaps the same may also be said of the judgments of Lord Cairns and Lord Penzance in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[30], at pp. 1166, 1167, and 1174. The subject has also been fully dis- cussed in Ontario in Sim v. City of Port Arthur[31]; Rice v. Toronto Railway Co.[32], and Herron v. Toronto Railway Co.[33] I ought also, I suppose, to refer to my own judgment in the case of Brenner v. Toronto Railway Co.[34], upon which Mr. Dewart strongly relied. I was there, of course, dealing only with the phase of the law of negligence which came into play in that case. Having re-examined the whole matter for the purposes of this appeal, I do not think I can honestly charge myself with inaccuracy, but it should be observed that the point of the observation quoted by Mr. Dewart (in its application to the present case) is that negligence of the victim, in order to be an answer, must be a \u201cdirect and effective contributing cause.\u201d In that case, I had no manner of doubt that the negligence of the unfortunate victim, who attempted to pass across the track in front of a car which she knew to be approaching, without looking at the last moment to see whether she could do so in safety and without giving any sign of intention to cross until it was too late for the motorman to stop his car, was a direct contributing cause. In this case, considering the conduct of the victim, in relation to the conduct of the motorman, and the elements of knowledge on the one hand, and ignorance on the other, above mentioned, I think the proper view is that the causa proxima or direct cause, or if you like, the cause, in the legal sense, was the failure of duty on the part of the motorman, and that Long\u2019s want of care ought rather to be considered one of the conditions or circumstances on which the motorman\u2019s failure of duty took effect. As to the facts: with great respect, I am unable to agree with the view of the facts taken by the Court of Appeal. I have read the evidence more than once with care and I will only say that I think the evidence of the motorman and of the superintendent support the verdict. One consideration appears to me to have been overlooked. There is no doubt that the motorman was placed in a difficult situation, and full allowance should be made for that. It is very important also in such cases to avoid confusing excusable error of judgment, the error being proved by the event, with want of competence or diligence; but on the other hand, a reasonable measure of competent judgment may be required from the respondent\u2019s employees in such emergencies. This is sufficient to dispose of the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant. As to the matter of a new trial, I have only to say, that, agreeing as I do with the opinion of the learned Chief Justice who tried the case as to the law applicable, I think the charge was admirably calculated to instruct the jury fully and effectively as to their duties. No doubt the 7th question on its face is open to criticism. But I do not think the explanation given by the learned Chief Justice of the point he desired them to consider under that head could have been misapprehended. Even if I had felt some difficulty as to the construction of the answers\u2014which I do not\u2014I should have hesitated long about directing another trial of the action in view of the attitude of the very able counsel who appeared for the respondent who at no stage of the proceedings has suggested the propriety of a new trial, or taken any exception to the charge of the learned trial judge except to impugn the principles of law upon which he proceeded, an exception which if successful must have led to the dismissal of the action.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014After careful consideration and not without some doubt, I have come to the conclusion that there should be a new trial of this action, on the grounds that the finding of the jury, that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was \u201cguilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the accident,\u201d read in the light of the admission on which it was based and the presentation of this branch of the case to the jury, is not satisfactory, and that it is not clear that all the considerations which should have affected their minds in dealing with the 5th question (in answer to which they found that, notwithstanding the negligence of the deceased, the defendants\u2019 motorman could by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented the collision) were presented to the jury, and also because of the unsatisfactory character of the 7th question and of the uncertainty, in view of the frame of that question, as to the meaning of the answer thereto.\nThe questions submitted to the jury with their answers are as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband caused by any negligence of the defendants, prior to negligence of plaintiff\u2019s husband? A. No.\n2. If so, wherein did such negligence consist?\n3. Was the plaintiff\u2019s husband guilty of negligence which caused the accident or which so contributed to it that but for his negligence the accident would not have happened? A. Yes.\n4. If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to the last question, wherein did his negligence consist? A. In not looking for a car.\n5. Notwithstanding the negligence, if any, of the deceased, could the defendants by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented the collision? A. Yes.\n6. If so what should they have done which they did not do or have left undone which they did do? A. By putting on the brakes and having the car under proper control. 7. Could the motorman and the deceased, each of them, up to the moment of collision have prevented the accident by the use of reasonable care\u2014in other words, was the negligence of deceased a continuing act up to the very moment of the accident? A. Ten say \u201cNo\u201d and two say \u201cYes.\u201d\n8. If the court should on your answers think the plaintiff entitled to damages what sum do you assess as damages, distributing it:\u2014\n(a) To the mother of the deceased, aged 71 years?\n(b) To the wife, aged 38 years?\n(c) To the daughter, age 8 years? A. Ten for $4,000.\nUpon these findings the learned trial judge entered judgment for the plaintiff. In the Appellate Division that judgment was set aside on the ground that there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s answers to the 6th and 7th questions, and that, upon those answers being set aside, the finding of negligence on the part of the deceased precluded recovery.\nThat there was no negligence on the part of the defendants prior to the moment at which the peril of the deceased became or should have been apparent to the motorman, was undisputed. The first and second questions were put to the jury pro form\u00e2.\nThe evidence disclosed that the deceased left the sidewalk on the south side of Queen street in an abstracted state of mind and that he continued in that condition until he was upon the car track in front of and only a few feet away from the approaching car, when he appears to have suddenly realized the danger, but too late to escape being struck by the north corner of the fender. The evidence of Charles Allen, apparently an independent witness and the only person other than the motorman who seems to have seen the deceased come upon the track, is as follows:\u2014\nQ. And you were four or six paces from the east sidewalk on Soho street? A. Yes, that is it.\nQ. What did you see? A. Right out near the edge.\nQ. What did you see? A. I seen the gentleman just as he stepped on to the car tracks, just as he seemed to put his foot on to the car track.\nQ. What track? A. The north track.\nQ. That is the one upon which the westbound car was coming? A. Yes, the westbound car.\nQ. Then what happened? A. I seen, the gentleman seemed to throw out his hands as though he had realized his danger on the instant and the round part of the fender on the north side seemed to catch him. I could not say which leg it was, but it was perhaps on both, or one, but it seemed to throw him, twist him around, throw him and I ran for the car immediately.\nQ. Yes, when you speak of the round part of the fender do you mean the north-west corner of the fender? A. Yes,\nThe evidence of Alexander Johnston makes it reasonably clear that the deceased left the sidewalk on the south side of Queen street about 20 yards east of the line of the face of the west wall of the house on the east side of Soho street. According to the diagram verified by the motorman, when struck he was almost opposite the kerb on the east side of Soho street. If so, it is clear that he was proceeding in a northwesterly direction as the motorman had originally stated at the inquest and not in a north-easterly direction as he stated at the trial and as the point of his departure from the sidewalk as marked upon the diagram would indicate. It follows that his back was partly towards the approaching west-bound car which struck him. The evidence of the motorman makes it clear that the deceased when leaving the sidewalk and up to a moment or two before he was struck, when the witness, Allen, saw him \u201cthrow out his hands,\u201d was unaware of the approaching car and that the persistent efforts which the motorman made to attract his attention were futile. After the close of the evidence, counsel for the plaintiff made this statement to the trial judge, which was taken as an admission of negligence on the part of the deceased, the deceased was not wary in approaching the car tracks in crossing the street,\nand he suggested that the first four questions should be eliminated and that question 5 should be put in this form:\u2014\nNotwithstanding the admitted negligence of the deceased, could the defendants by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident or the collision?\nThis is the only record of an admission of negligence on the part of the deceased.\nIn presenting the case to the jury the learned Chief Justice, whose charge was not objected to on this branch, said,\nshe (the plaintiff) admits frankly that her unfortunate husband who met with his death instantaneously on that occasion certainly was guilty of some negligence causing or contributing to the accident, but she says that after that negligence of the deceased there was supervening or ultimate negligence on the part of the motorman which caused the accident.\nIn submitting the 3rd and 4th questions to the jury, after reading them, the learned Chief Justice said:\u2014\nWell, admittedly, the plaintiff says that he (the deceased) proceeded from that curb on his way unwarily (which is the phrase used by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel) you can say recklessly, carelessly or without giving sufficient attention to what was going on, or any phrase that occurs to you to meet the circumstances. No doubt there was something that must be understood in some such word (sic).\nIn dealing with the 7th question, after reading it, the learned judge said:\u2014\nI do not think I can make it any clearer than I have made it there. Did the unfortunate deceased\u2019s act contribute up to the moment of the accident? Well, in a sense it did, physically, because he went right on, but that is not what is meant by this question. The question is, \u201cDid he become aware that the car was approaching and was he able to avoid the danger?\u201d that is the sense in which that question is: put. * * * Now, you will understand the sense in which that question is launched\u2014that while it is true that physically, as far as his actions went, he did contribute, to it up to the last moment, but did he do it in that negligent sense that he became aware that the car was approaching and was he able then to avoid the danger? * * * If you answer \u201cYes\u201d to that question, so far as the deceased is concerned, that is the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case. What the plaintiff says you ought to answer is, that up to the last moment the motorman was negligent, but that the deceased was not up to the moment of the collision. It is for you to say.\nUpon the admission as made by counsel for the plaintiff above quoted and the statement of that admission by the learned Chief Justice to the jury, having regard to what he said in discussing the 7th question, I find it difficult to understand just what the jury meant when they found in answer to questions. 3 and 4 that the plaintiff\u2019s husband had been guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the accident \u201cin not looking for the car.\u201d Did they mean that he was negligent in\nthat he proceeded from that curb on his way unwarily,\nas put by the learned Chief Justice? Did they mean that the deceased was\nnot wary in approaching the car tracks in crossing the street,\nas put by counsel for the plaintiff? Read in the light of the charge and the admission upon which they were instructed to act it is questionable whether the jury meant more than this. Did they mean that the deceased was negligent in stepping upon the car track itself? Negligence in stepping from the kerb and in crossing the street did not proximately cause or contribute to the accident. It was only in the act of stepping in front of the moving car that there could have been negligence on the part of the deceased of that kind. If, as the motorman says, the car was then only ten feet away and he immediately reversed and did all in his power to stop, it is difficult to understand the findings of the jury in answer to the 5th and 6th questions, unless they meant that the motorman should have apprehended that the deceased was likely to step in front of the car and should sooner have taken measures to stop it. Unfortunately it does not seem to be sufficiently clear that this was what the jury really meant to find. Having regard to these findings, read in the light of the charge bearing upon them, and to the answer to the 7th question, I rather incline to the view that by the answer to the 4th question the jury meant, not that the deceased was negligent in stepping upon the car track, but that he was negligent in not looking for the car when he was leaving the sidewalk and crossing the street approaching the tracks. If that is the proper interpretation of the finding\u2014and I think it is open to that view having regard to the admission of counsel for the plaintiff and the charge dealing with that admission\u2014it is not, in my opinion, a satisfactory finding of\nnegligence on the part of the deceased which caused or contributed to the accident.\nI am, with great respect, unable to agree with the learned Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment of the Appellate Division, that there was no evidence to support the findings in answer to the 5th and 6th questions. According to his own story the motorman saw the deceased leave the kerb and had him continuously in view until he was struck by the fender. Immediately upon his leaving the kerb he says he thought there might be trouble and he, therefore, threw off his power and began to ring his gong to warn the deceased. He says the car was then 50 yards from the point at which the unfortunate man was struck. The motorman says that he did his best to attract his attention with the gong; that he kept ringing it continuously; that the deceased\ndid not give the least sign that he knew that the car was approaching;\nthat he\nwalked straight on slowly with his head down;\nthat he\nnever heard at all, kept going ahead with his head down * * * absolutely absorbed\nnot thinking what he was doing. Although he is reported to have said at the inquest that when the deceased stepped in front of the car he was a car length and a half from it, at the trial he said that the car was then only ten feet away from him. He says he applied the reverse the moment the deceased stepped upon the south rail of the north track. The car stopped in one\u2011half a car length after it struck the deceased. The motorman says that when he applied the reverse the car was running about six miles an hour. A witness, Marshall, however, who was a passenger on the car and felt the jar of the reverse, says that he noticed the speed immediately before he felt the jar of the reverse and would fix it at ten or twelve miles an hour. From all this evidence I think it was open to the jury to infer that the motorman was aware of the absorbed and abstracted state of mind of the deceased, that he knew that the strenuous ringing of the gong had failed to arouse his attention and that it was not improbable that a man crossing the street in that state of mind would walk in front of the car before he realized his danger, and that he should, therefore, have reversed his power or applied the brakes and endeavoured to stop the car sooner than he did. I do not wish it to be understood that if trying the case myself such would have been my finding. Nor would that be a proper consideration in dealing with this appeal. The question is\u2014was there evidence upon which a jury of reasonable men might draw such an inference? Was there evidence upon that aspect of the case which could not properly have been withdrawn from the jury? With great respect for the Appellate Division and for my learned colleague who entertains the contrary view, I am of the opinion that there was.\nBut I should have been better satisfied with the findings of the jury in answer to the 5th and 6th questions if it had been explained to them that the motorman should not be found to have been negligent merely because he had erred in judgment\u2014that, before convicting him of negligence, they should be satisfied that, with the knowledge of conditions which he admittedly had, he had not merely erred in judgment but had taken an unnecessary and improper chance where human life was in peril. That idea probably underlies the statement of the learned Chief Justice that the question for the jury was whether\nthere was negligence on the part of the motorman after the time when he apprehended or ought reasonably to have apprehended that man was going to cross his track.\nBut it would have been more satisfactory, I think, had the attention of the jury been pointedly drawn to the distinction between mere error of judgment and an improper taking of chances on the part of the motorman.\nAgain, it is possible that the jury may have ac- cepted the motorman\u2019s story at the inquest\u2014that the car was a car length and a half from the deceased when he stepped on the track in front of it\u2014as more likely to be correct than his version at the trial. Believing the former, they may have thought that the motorman could and should have stopped his car before it hit the deceased\u2014that he should have applied the brakes or reversed his power not when only ten feet from the deceased, but when forty-five feet\u2014a car length and a half\u2014away, and that if he had done so the accident would have been avoided.\nWith very great respect it seems to me that the 7th question must have tended to confuse the jury. In it they are first asked:\u2014\nCould the motorman and the deceased each of them up to the moment of the collision have prevented the accident by the use of reasonable care?\nand then an interpretation is put upon the question in its concluding phrase which confines it to the conduct of the deceased\u2014\nin other words, was the negligence of the deceased a contributory act up to the very moment of the accident?\nThe answer to this questions is,\nTen say \u201cNo\u201d and two say \u201cYes.\u201d\nIt is impossible to know whether the jury meant to answer the question as it was first put covering negligence of both the motorman and the deceased, or whether their answer is to be taken as confined to the interpretation put upon the question in the latter part which restricts it to negligence of the deceased. Assuming the latter to be the correct view, upon the evidence of Charles Allen it is clear that the deceased, after stepping upon the track and an instant or two before he was struck, awoke to his danger. It was too late then for him to save himself. Does the answer to this question mean merely that he was not negligent after so becoming aware of his danger? It is clearly open to that interpretation upon the charge as quoted above, and upon all the evidence that would seem to be a fair conclusion. Does it mean that in stepping on the track and up to the moment when he became so aware of his danger the deceased had been actively negligent? If so, and if the accident could not then have been averted is he entitled to recover? Brenner v. Toronto Street Railway Co.[35] Or does it mean that although negligent in leaving the sidewalk and approaching the tracks he was not negligent in actually stepping in front of the car? It is perhaps a little difficult to understand how the jury could thus differentiate between the degrees of responsibility on the part of the deceased in the several stages of his progress across the street. On the other hand, if the deceased was actively negligent up to the moment when the accident became inevitable it is still more difficult to understand how the motorman could be guilty of \u201cultimate negligence\u201d such that it was the only true proximate cause of the collision and rendered the defendants liable notwithstanding the continuous negligence of the deceased.\nInstead of asking whether the negligence contributed up to the very moment of the collision or accident it would, I would respectfully suggest, be better to ask whether the negligence actually contributed up to the moment when the accident or collision became inevitable, and to put separate questions covering this point with regard to the motorman and the deceased, or to confine it to the deceased.\nThe difficulty which I find in the way of entering judgment for the plaintiff on the 5th and 6th findings of the jury is that I am not satisfied that by them the jury really meant to impute to the motorman what would in law amount to \u201cultimate negligence.\u201d It is not clear that they meant to do more than find against him a fault similar to that which was suggested in the Divisional Court on the part of the motorman in the Brenner Case[36], but was held by this court, affirming the Court of Appeal, to be insufficient to warrant a verdict of ultimate negligence against the defendants. I am not certain that the jury meant in the present case that after the danger of the deceased became or should have been apparent to the motorman he could by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided running him down. It is uncertain whether they meant to find that the negligence of the motorman was the sole efficient cause of the accident which was really proximate.\nOn the whole I think that the result of the trial is not satisfactory and that it would be in the interests of justice that there should be a new trial, in the hope that it may result in findings such that, if not wholly free from doubt, it may at least be less doubtful than it now seems to be, whose fault or negligence was really the proximate cause of the accident.

Cedars Rapids Manufacturing Co. v. Lacoste ((1914) A.C. 569), referred to.\nAPPEAL from a decision of an Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario varying an award of arbitrators appointed to fix the value of land expropriated and remitting the case to them for further consideration and assessment on one branch of damages as to which they had held that they had no jurisdiction.\nOn and prior to the 13th day of July, 1912, the respondent Ernest Holditch was the owner of a block of land situate in the Town of Sudbury, in the Province of Ontario, which block of land had been sub-divided into different lots laid out upon a registered plan. In expropriation of their right of way the railway by their notice expropriated and took absolutely lots according to the registered plan numbered as follows (the numbers follow).\nAn arbitration was had, pursuant to the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d before three arbitrators, Robert Spence Mitchell, appointed by William Ernest Holditch; David Marr Brodie, appointed by the Canadian Northern Railway Company; and His Honour John James Kehoe, Judge of the District Court of the District of Sudbury, the third arbitrator chosen by Messrs. Brodie and Mitchell. The arbitrators heard a considerable amount of evidence, examined the property and subsequently an award was made by the majority of the arbitrators, His Honour Judge Kehoe and Robert Spence Mitchell, which award is exhibit No. 21 at page 109 of the appeal case. By this award the majority arbitrators awarded the respondent William Ernest Holditch the sum of $5,315 for the lands entirely taken by the railway. The majority arbitrators found as a fact appearing on the face of the award that the following additional lands of William Ernest Holditch, namely, lots (numbers), in the subdivision, by reason of being severed from the other lands, and on account of their being rendered more difficult of access by reason of the construction of the railway and the grade thereof, and their being impaired in value, were injuriously affected to the extent of $4,800, but they made no award as to this, as they considered they were not warranted under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d or by law in making any such award, finding further that they could not make any award as to damages claimed by the respondent on account of lands injuriously affected on account of vibration that would be caused by trains and by noise and smoke.\nMr. David Marr Brodie, the other arbitrator, filed a minority award, in which he gives his opinion as to the value of the lands taken at $3,415, being $1,900 less than that by the majority arbitrators. He further places the damages to the other lots mentioned in the majority award at a less sum than the majority arbitrators, he stating a figure of $3,432 in lieu of the figure of $4,800 stated by the majority arbitrators, the difference of $1,368, and concurs in awarding no damages for smoke, noise or vibration.\nThe present respondent, William Ernest Holditch, appealed from the award of the majority arbitrators on the grounds, amongst others, that compensation should be allowed for the property of the owner not taken by the company, but injuriously affected by the construction of the railway in question, such property being the remaining lots in the subdivision, and for damages or compensation for the intercepting and destroying of the ingress and egress from the remainder of the subdivision; also for damage sustained by the construction of the roadbed and grade higher than the natural level of the property and for the blocking of the streets; that upon a consideration of the physical characteristics of the land and the running of the railway immediately north of a base line of high rock on the property, the access was seriously interfered with and the value of a number of lots thereby depreciated.\nUpon appeal the Appellate Division, after argument and upon a consideration of the authorities, were clearly of the opinion, first, that they would not upon the evidence disturb the findings as to the value of the land taken, and secondly, that as a matter of law upon the finding of the majority arbitrators the respondent was clearly entitled to $4,800 found by the majority arbitrators; that for the same reasons, and it appearing on the face of the award that there was some damage by smoke, noise and vibration, the respondent was entitled to an allowance of damages on this heading, and counsel for both the appellant and the railway company agreed that they would prefer a reference back to the arbitrators upon this heading rather than having the Court deal with it upon the evidence already in, and the Appellate Division directed that on this heading there should be a reference back to the arbitrators to ascertain the amount of damage to the lots enumerated in paragraph three of the judgment.\nArmour K.C. and G.N. Macdonnell for the appellants.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs. I agree with Mr. Justice Idington. IDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal raises the questions of whether an owner of land expropriated under and by virtue of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d has as an incident to such expropriation the right to claim damages for injury done to his other lands beyond the bounds of the lot so expropriated by reason either of the railway crossing the street or highway leading to such other lands and rendering them thereby less easily accessible and hence less marketable, or of the smoke, noise and vibration incidental to the use of the railway when constructed.\nThe lands expropriated and those other lands alleged to be so injuriously affected formed part of the same subdivision according to a registered plan, or registered plans which I assume harmonized with the first plan of subdivision.\nIt is not made quite clear in the evidence whether the major part of such subdivisions had been made by the respondent or his father through whom I infer he claims.\nNo importance seems to have been attached at the trial to any such distinction and possibly in law nothing in question herein can be made to depend on any distinction such as I suggest.\nIn considering the opinion judgments delivered by some of their Lordships in the case of Cowper-Essex v. Local Board for Acton[1], if this case had to be governed thereby a good deal might be made to turn upon such distinction in the origin of the subdivisions made, though in appearance constituting now one scheme of subdivision.\nIn the view I take of this case it is not necessary I should dwell upon such considerations or in detail upon the facts of the numerous sales of lots in such survey which render those lots in question remaining anything but a connected compact piece of land. They can be joined only by the imagination to those actually taken.\nThe respondent\u2019s contentions herein were discarded, by the arbitrators who made the award, because in their opinion the \u201cRailway Act\u201d under which they acted did not authorize them to make any allowance in respect of injurious affection suffered in respect of those other lands.\nThe appellant expropriated the entire lots touched by the railway allowance according to the route plan approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners, and thus there is no question raised as to the severance of any such lot injuriously affecting the land of which part has been taken.\nThe Cowper-Essex Case1 referred to and which is relied upon by respondent, and no doubt that upon which the judgment appealed from was rested, though we have no written reasons given therefor, was dependent upon the peculiar facts there in evidence and the construction of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d 1845, secs. 49 and 63, which are as follows:\u2014\n49, Where such inquiry shall relate to the value of lands to be purchased, and also the compensation claimed for injury done or to be done to the lands held therewith, the jury shall deliver their verdict separately for the sum of money to be paid for the purchase of the lands required for the works, or of any interest therein belonging to the party with whom the question of disputed compensation shall have arisen, or which under the provisions herein contained he is enabled to sell or convey, and for the sum of money to be paid by way of compensation for the damage, if any, to be sustained by the owner of the lands by reason of the severing of the lands taken from the other lands of such owner, or otherwise injuriously affecting such lands by the exercise of the powers of this or the special Act or any Act incorporated therewith.\n63. In estimating the purchase money or compensation to be paid by the promotors of the undertaking, in any of the cases aforesaid, regard shall be had by the justices, arbitrators, or surveyors, as the case may be, not only to the value of the land to be purchased or taken by the promotors of the undertaking, but also to the damage, if any, to be sustained by the owner of the lands taken from the other lands of such owner, or otherwise injuriously affecting such other lands by the exercise of the powers of this or the special Act or any Act incorporated therewith.\nI cannot think that section 155 of our \u201cRailway Act\u201d and the sections therein provided for giving it effect, especially as interpreted and construed in many other cases, can be said to have contemplated any such results as that decision upon said sections.\nThe said section 155 is as follows:\u2014\n155. The company shall, in the exercise of the powers by this or the special Act granted, do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation, in the manner herein and in the special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers.\nLet any one carefully read and compare the language of this section and the said two sections and then observe and consider the reasoning of the judgments in that case, and if that does not lead to the conviction that the decision should not govern this case, I fear I cannot hope to convince.\nThe section 155 of our \u201cRailway Act\u201d was taken I rather think from section 16 of the \u201cEnglish Railway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d though the word \u201ccompensation\u201d is used where the word \u201csatisfaction\u201d was placed in section 16. Then the case of Hammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand[2], decided that said section 16 of the English Act would not give relief to any one whose lands or part thereof had not been taken.\nWhen the matter is thus reduced by judicial construction, from which Lord Cairns dissented, to a question of the taking of such lands then we must read the section accordingly and turn to the specific provisions of sections 192, 193, and 194 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d upon which the jurisdiction of the arbitrators rests.\nThe second of these sections, 193, is as follows:\u2014\n193. The notice served upon the party shall contain,\u2014\n(a) a description of the lands to be taken, or of the powers intended to be exercised with regard to any lands therein described; and,\n(b) a declaration of readiness to pay a certain sum or rent, as the case may be, as compensation for such lands or for such damages.\nRead this as if both lands and power were combined though apparently disjoined, and whence can we draw the power of the arbitrators to asses and award damages in respect of other lands? Each lot taken by appellant is an. independent, separate and complete property in itself. It is easily conceivable that a number of such properties might be so united together as to render them one compact whole, but that is not what in fact exists here.\nIn the Act upon which the Cowper-Essex Case[3] turned, it will be observed that the injuries to \u201clands held therewith\u201d and \u201cother lands\u201d than taken and the \u201csevering\u201d of those from lands taken, are expressly provided for as subjects of compensation. I may repeat what I have said in the case of same appellant v. Billings, heard this term, that if the views probably held by Lord Cairns when forming part of the court which decided the Hammersmith Case2, and expressly so by Lord Westbury in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[4], relative to the meaning of section 16, had prevailed, then the language of section 155 might have been held as wide enough to cover what is claimed herein.\nHammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand4 is decisive of any claim founded upon the crossing of streets per se being a ground of claim under our \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nIndeed, it so restricts the operation of that Act that the only sensible meaning to be given it must relate, so far as injurious affection of any kind is concerned, to those lands physically connected with the part taken and not even then as in cases of subdivision for general sale to the public where the owner is thereby treating each parcel as a special lot.\nWith the claim, for injuries to other lands than those taken or directly interfered with, thus failing, as I hold it must, falls also the claim relative to what might arise herein from smoke, noise or vibration, even if such claims founded on the use of the works can ever found a claim for compensation.\nAnd with these claims failing there is no need to consider the question of the power to refer back to arbitrators.\nAnd the right given by recent legislation amending the \u201cRailway Act\u201d so as to modify the injustice often done heretofore to owners of properties abutting upon streets over which railways ran without touching such lands must be pursued before the tribunal empowered by such remedial legislation to deal therewith.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014Two questions are presented on this appeal: the first, whether some 49 building lots owned by the respondent were so \u201cheld with\u201d certain other lots in the same building subdivision which have been taken from him by the appellant railway company as to entitle him to compensation in respect of them as lands which, though not physically injured, will be injuriously affected by the construction of the proposed railway and its future operation; the second, whether it is within the power of a court hearing an appeal from arbitrators under section 209 of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d to refer the whole subject of the arbitration, or any part of it back to the arbitrators for further consideration.\nThe respondent and his predecessor in title had laid out the property in question as a building subdivision some years before the advent of the railway. It contained upwards of 500 lots fronting on thirteen streets. The plan had been registered and more than 200 lots had been sold to purchasers, some of them fronting on each of the streets laid down on the plan. The railway took the whole of every lot which its projected right of way touched and against the award in respect of lots so taken no appeal has been launched. The concluding paragraphs of the award of the majority of the arbitrators are as follows:\u2014 And further, we find that as to the following lands, on account of their being severed from the other lands of the said William Ernest Holditch in the said subdivision, and on account of their being rendered more difficult of access by reason of the construction of the railway, and the grade thereof, and their being impaired in value as appears by the evidence of witnesses for both parties, the said witnesses agreeing upon the proportions in which the said lands hereinafter mentioned were so lessened in value, though differing in the values given by them in evidence, the said lands being as follows:\u2014\nLots 96, 97, 100, 102, 103, 109, 111, 115, 117, 119, 122, 124, 125, 127, 129, 131, 132, 184, 185, 186, 187, 353, 355, 356, 379, 378, 370, 372, 373, 507, 510, 516, 517, 519, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 193, 194, 196, 197, and 198, are injuriously affected to the extent of four thousand eight hundred dollars ($4,800), but we make no award as to the same, as we consider that we are not warranted under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d or by law to make any such award.\nAnd further, we find that we cannot and we make no award as to damages claimed by the said William Ernest Holditch on account of lands injuriously affected on account of vibration that would be caused by trains and by noise and smoke.\nThe Appellate Division held the plaintiff entitled to the $4,800 damages assessed by the arbitrators in respect of the 49 enumerated lots. The court, being also of the opinion that the claimant is entitled to damages in respect of other lots, inserted the following paragraph in their order:\u2014\n3. And this court doth further order that it be referred back to the arbitrators, John James Kehoe, Robert Spence Mitchell, and David Marr Brodie to ascertain and state the amount of damage sustained by the said Ernest Holditch on account of the lands situate on the north and south sides of Hickory Street and the north side of Poplar Street, consisting of lots numbers 145, 144, 140, 139, 136, 364, 362, 380, 381, and 384, on the north side of Hickory Street, and lots numbers 148, 149, 151, 152, 154, 155, 333, 336, 337, 334, 340, 395, 396, 397, 385, and 386 on the south side of Hickory Street and lots numbers 163, 162, 160, 158, 157, 331, 330, 347, 348, 343, 341, 392, 391, and 390 on the north side of Poplar Street, according to plan of subdivision of lots of the said Ernest Holditch, filed as an exhibit upon the said arbitration, by reason of the construction of the railway of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, this court declaring that the said Ernest Holditch is entitled to recover all damages sustained by him to the said property by reason of the construction of the said railway. The case was disposed of in the Appellate Division at the conclusion of the hearing and we are without the advantage of having before us the reasons on which the court proceeded.\nDealing with the first branch of the appeal, the appellant insists that by the sale of lots fronting upon each of the streets of the registered plan that plan has become binding on the claimant in its entirety; that the streets have become fixed and are not subject to deviation and may not be closed without the consent of the purchasers of such lots; that the claimants\u2019 lots have been so separated one from another that there cannot be in respect of them a claim for severance because some of them have been taken from him; and that the only interference with access to the lots which he retains is what will be due to the construction of the railway across the streets, which does not afford a ground for compensation under the statute. As a matter of fact only one of the 49 lots in respect of which damages have been awarded is contiguous to an expropriated lot. Lot 519 lies next to lot 520. Each of the remaining 48 lots is separated from the expropriated lots either by a street or by an intervening lot sold by the claimant.\nThis branch of the case must, however, in my opinion, be dealt with on the rule formulated by the House of Lords in Cowper-Essex v. Local Board for Acton[5]. As stated in the head-note that rule is as follows:\u2014\nThe lands taken and the lands injuriously affected being held by the same owner so that the unity of ownership conduced to the advantage of the property as one holding, the lands injuriously affected were \u201cheld with\u201d the lands taken within the meaning of section 49 of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845.\u201d\nThe following passages occur in the judgments: Halsbury, L.C., says at p. 163:\u2014\nIt is in each case a question of fact dependent upon its own circumstances whether what I have called the unity of the estate is interfered with.\nLord Watson at p. 167:\u2014\nWhere several pieces of land owned by the same person are so near to each other and so situated that the possession and control of each gives an enhanced value to all of them, they are lands held together within the meaning of the Act; so that if one piece is compulsorily taken and converted to uses which depreciate the value of the rest the owner has a right to compensation (for the depreciation).\nLord Bramwell, p. 168:\u2014\nThe lands have one owner. I cannot think it matters that they are separated by a railway; I suppose it would hardly be said that one part of a park separated from another part by a railway was not land held with that other part. Here the lands are close; what is done on one part must or might affect what would be done on the other. For example, what I mean is this: Houses of a particular class or character built on one part would influence the class or character of what would or might be built on the other. The class of occupants of one part would in like way influence the character of that on the other. On these considerations I am of opinion that the land in respect of which the claim is made here was land held with the piece taken.\nLord Macnaghten at p. 175:\u2014\nLands in respect of which a claim for compensation may arise are referred to in the Act, in contradistinction to the lands taken or purchased from the owner thereof, as lands \u201cheld therewith\u201d or as \u201cthe other lands\u201d of such owner. The Act says nothing about their being held along with the lands taken or purchased for one and the same purpose, nor does it require that they should be in contact with those lands. Apparently it is enough if both parcels of land are held by one and the same owner, and if the unity of ownership conduces to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding.\nLord Fitzgerald concurred in these views.\nI have no doubt that the possession and control of the lots which have been expropriated gave an enhanced value to the claimant\u2019s other, lots in the building subdivision. The taking of the expropriated lots and putting them to the use proposed will depreciate the value of the rest. Inasmuch as it gave him power to control the use to be made of his expropriated lots the claimants\u2019 ownership of them\nconduced to the advantage or protection of the property as one holding.\nHad he retained the ownership of the lots taken, it would have enabled him to prevent such a use being made of them as would tend to depreciate the value of his remaining property.\nThe finding of the arbitrators that the 49 lots would in fact be \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d and the quantum of their assessment are unchallenged. Upon this branch the appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nOn the other question I am, with great respect, of the opinion that the Appellate Division had no jurisdiction to make the order for a reference back. Meredith, J., so held in Re MacAlpine and Lake Erie and Detroit River Railway Co.[6], and his decision was approved by the Court of Appeal in Re Davies and James Bay Railway Co.[7], at page 568. It is true that in the recent case of Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[8], the Judicial Committee ordered a reference back as to part of the subject of an arbitration to which the provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d applied. But, so far as can be ascertained from the report of that case, the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have been raised before their Lordships and their attention was not directed to the grounds on which the Ontario decisions above referred to are based or to the difficulties presented by the provisions of the statute to which they call attention. Apparently in the present case the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re Davie\u2019s and the James Bay Railway Co.7 was not brought to the attention of the Appellate Division.\nAlthough counsel for the respondent asserts in his factum that when before the Appellate Division counsel for both parties agreed that a reference back in respect of the lots mentioned in the third paragraph of the order of that court would be more desirable than to have the court deal with the matter on the evidence, this is denied on behalf of the appellants. At all events nothing appears to have occurred which would be tantamount to a new submission, as an agreement of counsel was deemed to be in Demorest v. Grand Junction Railway Co.[9] With respect, I am of the opinion that the part of the judgment in appeal which directs a reference back cannot be supported.\nOn the evidence, giving due weight to the views of the Appellate Division, so far as they can be gathered from an order such as they have made, I find no sufficient reason for interfering with the unanimous conclusion of the arbitrators that the lots owned by the claimant other than those enumerated in the award of the majority would not be injuriously affected by the construction and operation of the railway.\nBut the arbitrators have expressly excluded from their award any allowance for damage which would be caused by vibration of trains and by noise and smoke. The $4,800 assessed by them as damages were confined to injury to the lands from other causes. I agree with the declaration in the order of the Appellate Division that the claimant\nis entitled to recover all damages sustained by him to the said property by reason of the construction of the said railway,\nwhich, I assume, was intended to include damages to arise from the operation of the railway as well.\nSo far as the lands of the claimant were \u201cheld with\u201d the lands expropriated he is entitled to damages arising from \u201coperation\u201d as well as from \u201cconstruction.\u201d These would include damages for injury caused by vibration, noise and smoke which the arbitrators excluded. For further depreciation in the value of the lots enumerated in the arbitrators\u2019 report due to smoke, noise and vibration, a further sum should therefore be awarded. It is, however, unnecessary to determine the amount of this allowance, since the majority of the court is of the. opinion that none should be made.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is a question of compensation under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nThe respondent has divided a piece of land a few years ago in town lots at Sudbury. The line of railway of the company appellant is passing through that piece of land and has taken over for its right of way some of those lots. Some others have not been touched at all, though they may have been injuriously affected.\nThere is no dispute as to the value of the land which has been taken by the company; but we have to decide whether the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario was right in awarding damages for the lots which were not touched or severed by the railway.\nIt is a jurisprudence very well established that in order to be entitled to compensation the claimant must shew that some of the land injured has been taken. In re Devlin and Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway Co.[10]\nIf the property on which the railway passes has not been divided in town lots, the respondent could be entitled to damages because then his land would have been severed.\nBut as it is divided in town lots, as the severance has taken place through the action of the respondent himself, those lots cannot be treated any more as one parcel of land; but they must be considered as separate and independent lots and it is only in case where part of one of those lots has been taken that the balance of the lot could give rise to a claim for compensation.\nHammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand[11].\nNow the respondent claims that he is deprived of the easy access he had to the street and that upon that ground he should be compensated.\nThe crossing or blocking of a street is not a ground, on the part of abutting owners, for claiming damages. That question came up in the case of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Fort William[12], and it was held that a provision for compensation to those owners embodied in the Board of Railway Commissioners\u2019 order was illegal and should be set aside. As a result of the judgment in the Fort William Case12, the \u201cRailway Act\u201d was amended so as to enable the adjacent abutting land-owners to receive compensation when the railway passes along or across a street. This amendment is section 6, 1 & 2 George V., ch. 22, which reads as follows:\u2014\nSubject to the company making such compensation to adjacent or abutting landowners as the Board deems proper, the railway of the company may be carried upon, along or across an existing highway upon leave therefor having been first obtained from the Board.\nSupposing that in this case the respondent would be entitled to compensation as to the use of the street in question, it would be for the Board to determine and that question of compensation then was not within the powers of the arbitrators.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario awarding damages for those lots which had not been taken, but which were injuriously affected and ordering a reference as to some of the lots about which the arbitrators did not grant any damages is not well founded.\nThe appeal then should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the award of the majority of the arbitrators should be confirmed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Armour & Mickle.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Joseph Fowler.\n[1] 14 App. Cas. 153.\n[2] L.R. 4 H.L. 171.\n[3] 14 App. Cas. 153.\n[4] L.R. 2 H.L. 175.\n[5] 14 App. Cas. 153.\n[6] 3 Ont.

L.R. 593) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of an Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial and dismissing his action.\nThe action was brought by the appellant on behalf of all ratepayers of the Town of Brampton to compel the municipality to collect arrears of taxes from the Dale estate, florists in said town. The facts are stated by Mr. Justice Latchford in giving judgment at the trial as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff adopted the suggestion of the Divisional Court, on appeal from the judgment of Sutherland J., and elected to add, and did add, the Municipal Corporation of the Town of Brampton as defendants. The case thereupon came before me for trial upon the issue whether the municipality rightly or wrongly abstained from collecting certain arrears of water rates which the plaintiff contends it was their duty to have collected from the defendants, the executors of the Dale estate, during the period between 1903 and 1910, when the water system of the town passed into the control of commissioners elected under the \u201cMunicipal Water Works Act.\u201d\nOn May 30th, 1901, the executor of the Dale estate, as a result of a conference with a committee of the municipal council, made a proposition in writing offering fifty dollars per year for water service instead of the thirty-two dollars then paid, if the town corporation would at their own expense place a four-inch main and hydrant in Vodden Street, and would agree that the rate of fifty dollars would not be exceeded in the future, even should the premises be extended.\nAn alternative proposition was also submitted, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cOn the understanding that the present rate of $32 be increased to $40 per year, and will not be increased now nor in the future, we will do the excavating and filling in and furnish the necessary four-inch iron pipe; you to make the connection, lay the pipe, fur- nish the hydrant and all else necessary excepting the pipe.\u201d\nThe Water, Fire and Light Committee of the corporation considered the letter, and on June 3rd, reported to the council in favour of the adoption of the second proposition, excepting the clause \u201cnor in the future\u201d; and on the same day the council adopted the report as amended.\nThe municipality thus agreed that in consideration of the carrying out by the estate of the proposed work, the rates be not now increased above forty dollars a year.\nIt is not suggested that this was not a proper contract on the part of the town under the law as it stood at the time.\nThe Dale estate expended nearly one thousand dollars in putting in the main on Vodden Street and other mains, some or all of which were afterwards tapped by the corporation to supply water to householders. The estate also paid the forty dollars a year to the town.\nBy-law No. 272 came into effect on September 30th, 1903, and imposed a heavy burden upon greenhouses. The fame which Mr. Dale had won for the roses and other commercial flowers produced at Brampton continued to increase after his death under the capable management of the business by his executor, Mr. T.W. Duggan, and it became necessary greatly to extend the area under glass. When Mr. Duggan learned that the town had in contemplation the imposition of the rates subsequently fixed by By-law No. 272, $11.12 for the first thousand feet of glass and $1.25 for each additional thousand feet\u2014he wrote reviewing the arrangement of 1901, pointing out the importance, growth and advantages of the industry, and asking for a fixed rate. He suggested at the same time that if any legal difficulties prevented such an arrangement the matter should be submitted to the ratepayers.\nA legal difficulty had arisen owing to the definition of the word \u201cbonus\u201d by the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act of 1903,\u201d which came into force on the 27th of June. The supplying of water at rates less than those charged to other persons in the municipality was declared to be included in the word \u201cbonus,\u201d section 591 (a), sub-section (e); and the granting of a bonus was prohibited unless the assent of the electors should be obtained. Section 591, sub-section (12a).\nThere were other greenhouses in Brampton besides those of the Dale estate; and all became subject to the rate imposed by the by-law of the 30th September. By a resolution of the municipal council passed on December 21st, 1903, the collector of water rates was instructed \u201cnot to collect from the Dale estate in excess of fifty dollars for the past quarter (except such sums as may be charged for private dwellings) and that the balance of the charge for the current quarter, and future charges, be deferred so as to conform to the by-law passed by this council.\u201d\nThe charge on the greenhouses of the Dale estate, at the rates imposed by the by-law for the quarter referred to, was $111.22, based on an area of 348,000 feet.\nHow the matter stood in the following year is well stated in a letter which Mr. Duggan addressed to the council on November 7th, 1904. \u201cYou will remember\u201d he says, \u201cthat the matter of our water rate was up last year. Up to that time we had been paying forty dollars per annum in terms of a verbal agreement made with the council when our large extensions were being entered into. After the new by-law of last year our premises were rated at a very much higher figure. The matter was subsequently inquired into by the council, and a recommendation was made by the committee of an increase from forty dollars to two hundred dollars per annum, net, in addition to the rating for the house. I consented to this compromise; but owing to some technicalities which were in the way, the council were unable to make the arrangement for more than the balance of the year ending December, 1903. It was intended, however, that no more than that rate should be charged us, but I do not think that the necessary means have been taken to put it in proper shape. Up to the last quarter of this year we were asked to pay only the fifty dollars per quarter, as arranged for; but for the last quarter we have had a much larger bill rendered us, with an item for alleged arrears, which, of course, practically do not exist, but we presume that they appear because of the matter not having been properly disposed of.\u201d\nThe letter closed with a request for an interview. Nothing definite appears to have resulted from the interview, if indeed it was had. But it is clear that no effort was for some years made to collect more than the fifty dollars a quarter, or to dispose of the arrears that had been accumulating upon the collector\u2019s roll.\nOn April 3rd, 1906, the council adopted a report of the Water, Fire and Light Committee instructing the collector \u201cnot to collect any arrears over fifty dollars per quarter from the Dale estate for water used in their greenhouses\u201d; and instructing the clerk \u201cnot to place any amount on the rate book in excess of fifty dollars per quarter.\u201d\nBetween 1903 and 1906 additional greenhouses had been erected, but no change in the area of glass was recorded in the collector\u2019s books.\nAt a meeting of the council held on April 2nd, 1906, a report of the Water, Fire and Light Committee was adopted, recommending that the collector be instructed not to collect any arrears over fifty dollars a quarter from the Dale estate for water used in the greenhouses, and that the clerk be instructed not to place any amount on the rate book in excess of $50 a quarter. Thereafter, up to the end of 1909, a charge of but fifty dollars per quarter was entered and collected. The area of the glass assessable was continued upon the roll at 348,000 feet, though in fact new greenhouses had been added every year.\nOn these facts His Lordship held that the municipality was entitled to collect from the Dale estate all the taxes assessable in the past exceeding the amounts paid each year and ordered judgment to be entered accordingly. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division and the appellant\u2019s action dismissed.\nW.N. Tilley for the appellant. The municipal council is trustee for the town and subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Paterson v. Bowes[2]; City of Toronto v. Bowes[3]. The water rates imposed on the consumers must be uniform. Attorney-General for Canada v. City of Toronto[4]; City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Brewing Association[5], and a discriminatory by-law passed by the council would be quashed. In re Bate and City of Ottawa[6]; In re Morton and City of St. Thomas[7]; In re Campbell and Village of Lanark[8].\nArmour K.C. for the respondents. The action of the appellant is not maintainable. Sharp v. San Paullo Railway Co.[9]; Slattery v. Naylor[10]; Parsons v. City of London[11].\nIn the circumstances the measure of relief could be only a declaration for the future. See Pringle v. City of Stratford[12].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant suing on behalf of himself and all other ratepayers of the Town of Brampton obtained as result of the trial a declaratory judgment that two of the respondents, executors of the Dale estate, were and are indebted to the corporation of the Town of Brampton, another respondent, in the sum of $1,591.72 for water rates which the town corporation was entitled to collect but wrongfully abstained from collecting. This judgment has been reversed by the Court of Appeal and hence this appeal. The executors of the Dale estate had applied in 1901 to the council of said town, possessed of a waterworks system, to extend its mains so as to give the property of the estate a more efficient service. The council could not see its way to so extending its mains at the expense of the municipality and accepted the following alternative proposition:\u2014\nOn the understanding that the present rate of $32 be increased to $40 per year, and will not be increased now nor in the future, we will do the excavating and filling in and furnish the necessary four-inch iron pipe; you to make the connection, lay the pipe, furnish the hydrant and all else necessary excepting the pipe.\nafter striking out the words \u201cnor in the future\u201d therein.\nThe executors of the estate acting upon the faith of this, expended at least a thousand dollars in extension of said mains upon the street of the town referred to in the proposition, and the town council, I infer, collected the rate so fixed therein, for a year or more.\nBut in September, 1903, a by-law was passed by the council fixing a general rate which if considered operative as against the Dale estate would have wrought a gross injustice.\nThe legislation of that year had prohibited exemption or commutation of water rates by way of bonus. And the parties concerned seemed to imagine there was no other way out of the difficulty than to agree to collect a rate of fifty dollars a quarter and leave the balance uncollected.\nWhy this sort of method was resorted to would puzzle any one inexperienced in the ways of municipal management. On the whole it is well done, but on too many occasions lapses not unlike this will happen.\nThe main on Vodden Street on which the estate had expended the thousand dollars, had no doubt become the property of the town and there was nothing in the amendment to the law restricting bonus concessions, which prevented the council from doing justice by compensating the estate for this expenditure by way of an allowance in its rates.\nOf course it could not have gone beyond that discharge of what was a plain obvious duty of common honesty in the premises; and under pretext thereof fix a permanent rate.\nThe striking out of the words \u201cnor in the future\u201d in the original proposition raised no barrier to this being done, but only left the matter in a loose, unbusinesslike condition to be dealt with by future councils of the town.\nThe situation thus created has continued for years, but nothing so far as I can see has intervened to prevent the council from doing in substance that which that body could have done and, if I may be permitted to say so, ought to have done in the first place.\nI cannot think that the law ever contemplated that the council of a municipality is bound to take a dishonest advantage of any one in its dealings.\nAnd such certainly would be the effect of its enforcing the judgment pronounced at the trial.\nThe rates uncollected would not, so far as I can see, if interest is to be allowed on the original expenditure by the estate, exceed the money so expended.\nAt all events a compromise of that kind is clearly within the honest judgment that the council might properly exercise without exceeding its powers.\nIf the matter had been in substance a resort to a dishonest subterfuge to defeat the provisions of the law relative to giving of a bonus, then I assume the courts would be bound in a properly constituted suit to enforce the law.\nThis case does not give occasion for a consideration of the delimitation of the powers of the court in this regard at the suit of a ratepayer.\nHowever, I am disposed to think that if the ratepayers were more alert in asserting their undoubted rights and invoking the aid of the court to keep councils within the path of law and duty, we would perhaps have better municipal government.\nIt seems to me that the proceedings of the successive councils of Brampton acting in this matter have conducted their business in such an irregular manner as to invite litigation, and if it were not that the settled jurisprudence of this court forbids interference in mere matters of costs, I should have felt disposed to modify in that regard the judgment appealed from.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the view of the Court of Appeal that the appellant had no status to maintain the action. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014If the plaintiff had succeeded in establishing that what the municipal council did was within the \u201cbonus\u201d prohibitions of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d and therefore an illegal disposition or abandonment of the property of the municipality, as a ratepayer he might have successfully maintained his action. But it is reasonably clear that nothing of that kind has been attempted. The council of the defendant corporation merely recognized a moral, if not a legal, obligation incurred towards its co-defendants by its predecessors, and, in consideration of those co-defendants having given to the municipality what it deemed substantially of equivalent value, determined, acting within its discretion, to adhere to an understanding with them for a commutation of water rates somewhat indefinite, but deemed by it sufficient to impose an Obligation. Over the exercise of such discretion by a municipal corporation the courts do not assert control or right of supervision.\nNeither in the general \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d nor in the special Act (41 Vict. ch. 26 (Ont.)) do I find anything which renders the action of the municipal corporation illegal or ultra vires.\nThe Statute of Limitations probably also affords a defence to so much of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as represents arrears due more than six years prior to the addition of the municipal corporation as a party after the judgment of the Divisional Court rendered in November, 1911.\nAs to the alleged arrears of $190.20 for the year 1909, it would appear from the account rendered by the municipal corporation to the Dale estate (exhibit 15), that on the 30th of October, 1909, $53.34 was accepted as payment in full of water rates for that year presumably in pursuance of the understanding above referred to, and that there were no such arrears.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014It is one of those actions which could be instituted by the corporation and the corporation alone, and if it is found that the council does not properly exercise its functions and fulfil its duties, it is for the ratepayers to make a change and put in persons who will fulfil their duties according to what the majority of the ratepayers think best.\nThe judgment of the court below should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: B.F.

During the absence of H., in September, 1912, and without authority from him to do so, W. obtained a renewal of the lease for three years, from the 1st of May then following, which was repudiated by H. on his return to Montreal. In action by H. to have the renewal lease declared null and void:\u2014\nHeld, (the Chief Justice and Brodeur J. dissenting), that the plaintiff had a sufficient interest to enable him to maintain the action and obtain a declaration that the lease was not binding upon the partnership or upon himself as a member of the firm. Per Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting.\u2014In the Province of Quebec distinct and consistent pleading is essential and, as the plaintiff did not bring his action to obtain relief from his obligation under the renewal lease, but merely to have that lease declared null and void, he could not, in the action as brought, have a declaration that the lease was not binding upon him. Forbes v. Atkinson (Pyke K.B. 40) referred to.\nPer Brodeur J. dissenting.\u2014As the partnership was benefited by the renewal of the lease it should be declared valid and binding; on all the partners.\nJudgment appealed against (Q.R. 23 K.B. 1) reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Lafontaine J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nThe action was brought by the appellant, in the circumstances mentioned in the head-note, against the respondent to have the renewal lease declared null and void and set aside on the ground that it had been obtained clandestinely and without authority, and the mis-en-cause was impleaded for the purpose of hearing judgment rendered to that effect. At the trial, in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, Mr. Justice Lafontaine dismissed the action, on the following grounds:\u2014\n\u201cThat, as the partnership between plaintiff and defendant, according to their agreement, was to expire on the 31st of December, 1912, and as the lease of the premises occupied by the firm was to expire on the 1st of May, 1913, only so that a sufficient time was left to the partnership after its expiration, up to the expiration of said lease, for the liquidation of the affairs of the partnership, without the necessity of a renewal of said lease the defendant had no authority in the absence of his partner, and without having consulted him, to enter into negotiations, with the landlord, in the month of September, and conclude with him a renewal of the lease of the premises occupied by the firm, on behalf of the firm for a period of three years beginning on the 1st of May, 1913, viz.: four months after the dissolution of the partnership;\n\u201cThat the lease made by the defendant, although in the name and on behalf of the firm, but without authority from plaintiff, could not and does not bind the partnership, unless plaintiff chooses to ratify the act of his partner and approves of it, and that the plaintiff, on the contrary, having repudiated the conduct of his partner, said lease quoad plaintiff, is res inter alios acta, and consequently does not effect him (arts. 1855 and 1727 C.C.);\n\u201cThat plaintiff not being bound by said lease, the question of its existence and its validity cannot be raised by him, but can arise only between the parties to the deed, viz., the defendant and the mis-en-cause, that plaintiff has no interest to interfere with the agreement between them and ask that a lease which does not concern or effect him, be set aside, especially, when the landlord does not try to enforce said lease against plaintiff, and when defendant is ready to assume alone all its responsibility and to guarantee the plaintiff against any liability;\n\u201cThat although it appears by the evidence that plaintiff, prior to defendant, having entered into a conversation with the mis-en-cause\u2019s agent to have a lease of the premises occupied by the firm in his own name, and for himself alone, that all that defendant could obtain was a lease on behalf of the firm only while lease would have been granted to plaintiff for himself alone, that if the present lease was not blocking the way, plaintiff could still obtain from the mis-en-cause a lease in his own name, as shewn by the correspondence filed in the record, that such a lease would confer on plaintiff a material benefit of a great commercial value, in permitting plaintiff to carry on after the dissolution of the partnership, in the premises occupied by the firm, the same business that was done by the firm, this advantage plaintiff could have obtained and can still obtain, does not contsitute an interest in the lease, in the sense of the law, giving plaintiff the right to complain of it and that it be set aside;\n\u201cThat no person can bring a suit at law, unless he has an interest therein (art. 77 C. Pr. C.);\n\u201cThat during the existence of the partnership it was not allowed for any of the partners to secure for himself a renewal of a lease of the partnership property and that a renewal could be obtained only the way it was done, viz., for and on behalf of the firm.\u201d\nBy the judgment now appealed from the judgment in the Superior Court was affirmed.\nThe questions in issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nMignault K.C. and E. G. Place for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014This is an action to set aside a lease. The real point in issue is, in my opinion, largely one of practice and procedure; and, in that view, it is important, as we have the concurrent judgments of both courts below, to carefully consider the relief which the plaintiff prayed for. The conclusions of the declaration are as follows:\u2014\nWherefore the plaintiff brings suit and prays that the said agreement purporting to be a lease between the defendant acting on behalf of the firm of Hyde and Webster, and the mis-en-cause, be declared null, void and of no effect, to all intents and purposes que de droit, that the mis-en-cause be called in to hear the said judgment rendered to the same end, the plaintiff reserving his right to take such further action against the defendant as he may be advised in damages or otherwise. This prayer of plaintiff\u2019s declaration toy which he is bound contains a clear unambiguous statement of his position in this action. He asks that the lease entered into under the circumstances hereinafter set forth should be declared null for all purposes and there is no conclusion for a declaration that the lease is not binding upon the partnership or upon the plaintiff personally.\nIt is a settled rule of the Quebec law that the court cannot adjudicate beyond the conclusions of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration (art. 113 C.P.Q.) and no amendment can be allowed even before judgment by the trial court which changes the nature of the demand. (Art. 522 C.P.Q.)\nThe parties to the action (plaintiff and defendant) were partners under the firm name of Hyde & Webster and as such occupied under a lease certain premises for the purposes of their business. During the existence of that partnership and before the expiration of the then current lease, the defendant obtained in the name of the firm a renewal of the lease for a further period of three years from the date of its expiration.\nThe partnership expired by lapse of time before the new lease began to run and the defendant remained in possession of the leased premises. The plaintiff, as I have just said, brings this action not to be relieved of his obligations under the renewal lease, as was his right, but to have that lease declared \u201cvoid, null and of no effect for all purposes,\u201d on the ground that the defendant without his consent took in the name of the firm a lease which would begin to run after the expiration of the partnership. There is no doubt that the plaintiff was not bound to accept the benefit of the new lease and could not without his consent be made subject to its provisions. This is admitted by the defendant in the letter written by his attorneys before the institution of the present proceedings. But the plaintiff could not object to the defendant continuing in the possession of the premises in his own individual right after the expiration of the partnership if the landlord was content to keep him as a tenant. That was a matter which concerned the landlord and the defendant exclusively and the plaintiff, relieved of all liability the moment he gave notice to the landlord that he repudiated the action of his partner, was without interest to interfere. The landlord only could complain and he is content to allow the defendant to remain in possession of the premises. The defendant was thereafter solely bound to the due fulfilment of all the obligations of the new lease when the plaintiff repudiated his authority to enter into it (art. 1855 C.C.). Planiol in his commentary on the corresponding article of the Code Napoleon, art, 1764, states the law with his usual lucidity and accuracy in these words:\u2014\nL\u2019engagement est pris au nom de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par un seul des associ\u00e9s. Cet engagement ne lie pas les autres \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne lui aient donn\u00e9 pouvoir \u00e0 cet effet.\nIn view of what I understand is the opinion of the majority of this court I deem it necessary to emphasize the fact that the defendant does not in his pleadings or in his factum say that the lease is binding on the late firm or on his partner the plaintiff appellant, and no such contention was put forward by his counsel during the argument before this court. His position throughout has been that his partner was free to accept or decline the benefit of the lease and that in the latter alternative he, the defendant, was entitled to remain in possession of the premises under the renewal.\nI venture to insist upon the nature of this action because apparently some misconception exists as to it.\nIn the Quebec system of procedure, distinct and consistent pleading is held to be essential to the right administration of justice. As far back as 1810, Sewell C.J. in Forbes v. Atkinson[2] found it necessary to draw the attention of the bar to the difference in this respect between the French and English systems. The Chief Justice said:\u2014\nIn the law of England it is a general rule in pleading that a mere prayer for judgment without pointing out the appropriate remedy is sufficient, and that, the facts being shewn, the court, ex officio, is bound to pronounce the proper judgment. But the reverse of this rule is the principle of the law in Canada. With us the conclusions are held to be essential to the proceedings, and must contain, \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9, all that the judgment of the court must comprehend. For although the conclusions may by the court be allowed or rejected in toto, or modified or allowed in part, and rejected in part, still what is omitted in the conclusions cannot be supplied by the court, not even if it appears in substance in the body, or libel, of the pleading.\nThe rule in Forbes v. Atkinson2 is still followed in Quebec. See Pr\u00e9fontaine v. Cie de Publication de La Patrie[3].\nIt did not occur to any one, in the Quebec court to ask for leave to amend because no effective amendment could be made except by substituting one form of remedy for another which obviously could not be permitted.\nThis case affords an apt illustration of the necessity of adhering to the rule that this court is bound by the issues raised in the courts below. If this action had been brought to obtain relief of his obligation under the lease, different issues of fact would have been raised, the plaintiff would have been met by the offer of the defendant\u2019s solicitors to relieve him of all obligation under the lease to which I have already referred and the issue would have been limited to a mere question of costs.\nAs a result of this judgment the plaintiff gets what he did not ask for and the defendant is mulcted in heavy costs on an issue which is not raised by the pleadings.\nI agree entirely with the two courts below and am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant and respondent were partners in a firm holding a lease running three months beyond the terms of the existing partnership.\nThe respondent, without authority, secured in the name of the partnership a renewal of the lease for three years.\nIt is admitted neither could by the law of Quebec acquire such an advantage to himself as to have acquired such an embarrassing renewal in his own interest.\nWhen the renewal secured in the name of the firm came to the knowledge of appellant be made a protest against such dealing and by this suit sought to have it set aside. The lessors stand neutral and make no objection to the rescission.\nIt is, of course, admitted that under the circumstances they are entitled to hold respondent liable to them and to indemnify them against loss for his unauthorized conduct of the business in hand. It is said appellant has no interest such as to entitle him to maintain this suit.\nIt is pretended, notwithstanding that alleged want of interest, that to put himself in a position to obtain a new lease or deal with the lessors therefor, he must be held bound to treat with this quondam partner on the basis of said lease being a valid renewal for such purpose.\nI am with deference, unable to assent to such impotent conclusions as existing in law. The interest seems to me self-evident. In applying the law to the practical affairs of life we must see that the consequence of our reading and interpretation of the law is not such as to defeat its very purpose by means of some illusory dialectical skill in the use of words.\nI, therefore, submit that the appeal should be allowed with costs without prejudice to the lessors\u2019 right to insist, if necessary, upon respondent\u2019s liability to fully indemnify them.\nThis latter it is quite clear, in view of the correspondence had with appellant, is a matter of no consequence in this case.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent (without authority as regards the appellant) professed in the name and on behalf of the appellant (as well as on his own behalf) to execute the lease in question. I think the appellant is entitled to come into court to obtain a declaration that the instrument produced by this wrongful exercise of pretended authority is not binding on him.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs in all courts.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant and the respondent were engaged in business in the City of Montreal as partners. The partnership terminated by effluxion of time on the 31st December, 1912. The business was carried on in premises No. 43 Common Street, leased from the Grey Nuns, the lease of which expired on the 30th April, 1913. In September, 1912, in the absence of the plaintiff Hyde, the defendant, Webster, approached St. Cyr, the agent for the Grey Nuns, seeking a renewal of the lease in his own name. Hyde had already spoken to the agent with a view to obtaining a lease for himself on the expiration of the partnership. When Webster saw St. Cyr the latter refused to give him a lease in his own name, but offered to give him a three years\u2019 lease from the 1st of May, 1913, for the partnership. This Webster agreed to take. A formal agreement which bears date the 20th September, 1912, was accordingly prepared and executed.\nOn returning to Montreal, Hyde repudiated this action of his partner, Webster, on the ground that he had acted without authority, and he brought the present action on the 7th November, 1912. In the conclusion of his declaration he prays\nthat the said agreement purporting to be a lease between the defendant acting on behalf of the firm of Hyde & Webster and the mis-en-cause be declared null and void and of no effect to all intents and purposes que de droit that the mis-en-cause be called in to hear said judgment rendered to the same end, etc.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the action holding that the defendant had not authority to make the lease in question and that it did not bind the plaintiff or the partnership unless the plaintiff should choose to ratify and approve of it, and that, having repudiated the conduct of his partner, the lease quoad the plaintiff is res inter alios acta and consequently does not affect him and that he, therefore, has no interest to maintain this action. This judgment was confirmed on appeal, Lavergne and Gervais JJ. dissenting.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which he claims in his declaration, at least in part. Article 1855 C.C. which appears to govern the rights of the parties is as follows:\u2014\n1855. A stipulation that the obligation is contracted for the partnership binds only the party contracting when he acts without the authority, express or implied, of his co-partners, unless the partnership is benefited by his act, in which case all the partners are bound.\nIn the French version the concluding clause of the article reads as follows:\u2014\nA moins que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019ait profit\u00e9 de tel acte, et dans ce cas tous les associ\u00e9s en sont tenus.\nIn the corresponding article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, No. 1684, we find this similar provision:\u2014\n\u00c0 moins que la chose n\u2019ait tourn\u00e9 au profit de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nFrom the English version it might be deduced that the partnership would be bound by any advantageous contract made by one of the partners on its behalf; but, from the French version, and more particularly in the form which the excepting clause takes in the Code Napol\u00e9on, it seems reasonably clear that an unauthorized contract made in its behalf will bind the partnership, in the absence of ratification, only if it has in fact derived profit from it. Laurent, commenting on the article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, in vol. 26 at page 353, says:\u2014\nSi cependant il agit et que l\u2019acte soit profitable \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la loi valide l\u2019acte, mais seulement dans une certaine mesure, en tant que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a profit\u00e9; elle donne donc action \u00e0 l\u2019associ\u00e9; mais ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019action du mandat, c\u2019est une action moins favorable, que\u2019 l\u2019on appelle l\u2019action de in rem verso; nous en avons trait\u00e9 au chapitre des quasi-contrats; c\u2019est une esp\u00e8ce de gestion d\u2019affaires, donc un quasi contrat; il en nait une obligation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. L\u2019associ\u00e9 a agi au nom de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans pouvoir, il ne l\u2019oblige pas; mais l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019enrichisse \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens; la loi la d\u00e9clare oblig\u00e9e en tant qu\u2019elle s\u2019est enrichie.\nIn the present case it is clear that the lease was made for the partnership, and it has been properly found that, in making it, Webster acted without authority, express or implied, from his co-partner. It is also clear that the lease is upon advantageous terms and would be of value to the partnership if its business should be continued and is an asset which can be profitably disposed of for the benefit of the partnership to one or other of the partners. On the other hand it has not been shewn that the partnership had actually derived any benefit from the lease at the time the action was instituted, i.e., nearly two months before the partnership expired and five months before the lease in question would become operative. In his plea the defendant says:\u2014\nThe extension of the said lease creates a valuable asset of the firm of Hyde & Webster.\nHaving regard to the following considerations:\u2014\n(1) That the defendant in professed exercise of his authority as a partner of the plaintiff undertook to bind the partnership by an instrument in writing evidencing a lease of real property;\n(2) That such a lease subjects the lessee to obligations towards his lessor;\n(3) That, although made without authority, the lease might become binding on the partnership by ratification, express or tacit (art. 1727 CO.);\n(4) That, although made without authority, the lease may be binding on the partners to the extent to which the partnership is benefited by it:\u2014\nthe plaintiff, in my opinion, had a sufficient interest to enable him to maintain this action for a declaration that the lease is not binding upon the partnership. That is in substance the relief he asks.\nWe are not at present concerned as to the ultimate consequences of such a judgment\u2014whether it will leave the lease binding upon the defendant or will open the door for the granting by the landlords of a new lease to either the plaintiff or the defendant. In his declaration the plaintiff states that\nthe mis-en-cause through their authorized agents have declared their willingness to lease the premises to the plaintiff alone from and after the 1st of May, 1913.\nThis allegation is not admitted in the plea of the defendant. The mis-en-cause are not made parties to the action for any other purpose than that they may be \u201ccalled in to hear the judgment rendered.\u201d They have not pleaded or been represented in the action and there is nothing before us to shew whether they are or are not willing that the lease, if binding only on the defendant, Webster, should stand as a lease to him individually. Without their assent Webster cannot hold them bound to accept him as sole tenant. Neither is it clear that if the landlords should decline to accept Webster as their tenant and should execute a lease in favour of Hyde, he would not be bound to account for any profit made by him out of such lease on the ground that he had acquired it by reason of his having been a member of the firm of Hyde & Webster. That question is not before us for determination, and has not been tried.\nUpon the findings that Webster made the lease without the authority, express or implied, of his partner Hyde, and that Hyde has not ratified, but on the contrary, has repudiated his act, and it not having been shewn that the partnership had profited (a profit\u00e9) by the lease at the time this action was brought, I am of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to have it declared that the lease was not binding on the firm of Hyde & Webster, or upon himself as a member of that firm. Beyond that nothing should or can be determined in this action.\nI would, for these reasons, with respect, allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant and the respondent were carrying on business in Montreal in partnership on premises which they had leased from the mis-en-cause, L\u2019h\u00f4pital-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. The contract of partnership was to expire on the 1st January, 1913. The lease which they had was to expire on May 1st, 1913.\nIn the month of August or September, 1912, the appellant, Hyde, went to see the agent of the lessor with a view to securing the premises for himself alone after the expiration of the partnership agreement. He did not, however, communicate his intention to his partner and nothing was said by Hyde to his partner about his intent to dissolve the partnership.\nMr. Hyde left in the month of September to take his holidays; and, during his absence, a large quantity of building materials arrived for the firm. As it was a matter of importance that these goods should not have to be removed after the 1st of May, 1913, Mr. Webster saw St. Cyr, the agent for the owner, and secured in the name of the firm a renewal of the lease for three years after the 1st of May, 1913.\nThe lease was then made to the firm of Hyde & Webster. When Mr. Hyde came back, he protested against the lease, and wrote to that effect to the mis-en-cause, the lessor; at the same time he got from the lessor a promise that a lease should be made in his favour, in case the lease in favour of the partnership should be resiliated.\nHe then took the present action to set aside the lease, claiming that his partner was not authorized to pass it and had exceeded his authority.\nThe lessors were mis-en-cause and did not resist the action, shewing their willingness to see the lease cancelled.\nThe defendant, Webster, claimed by his plea that the lease should stand.\nThe lease was proved to be advantageous to the partnership.\nI would have been inclined to think that the partner, Webster, acted within the sphere of his authority in making such a renewal of the lease, because he was doing that for the purpose of securing a safe place for the warehousing of the goods of the company. Those goods could not be consumed during the few months which were left for the existence of the partnership. However, they had been purchased by the partners for the benefit of the partnership and it was the duty of the partner who had the management of the affairs, in the absence of his co-partner, to look after the storing of these goods. But it is not necessary to decide this point in the present case.\nIf the partnership is benefited by the renewal of the lease then it should be declared valid (art. 1855 C.C.).\nMr. Hyde wants, of course, to secure the premises for himself, which would be contrary to justice and would put the other partner in a very awkward position when the partners would come to dissolve partnership and divide the assets.\nWe have, then, undoubtedly a lease which is a good asset for the firm.\nWe have, on one side, a partner who wants to set it aside for his benefit and we have, on the other side, the defendant who is anxious to have a partner\u2019s share in the transaction.\nSupposing that the lease should be resiliated then what would be the position of Mr. Hyde? Of course, he could, as it has been understood with the lessor, take the lease in his own name. But he would be bound then to give to his partner a share of the profit that this, lease would represent. Then virtually the lease would become an asset of the partnership.\nIn these circumstances, I am of the, opinion that the action to set aside the lease should be dismissed and that the appeal from the judgment confirming the dismissal of that action should also be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Greenshields, Greenshields & Languedoc.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Place & Stockwell.\n[1] Q.R. 23 K.B. 1.\n[2] Pyke K.B. 40.\n2 Pyke K.B. 40.\n[3] 6 Que.

In case of sale the purchaser\u2019s title became absolute on issue of the letters patent. Such title was good, even if unregistered, against a purchaser from the original locatee after the issue of letters patent who had notice of the prior sale.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Without the approval of the Crown Lands Department, a locatee of Crown lands was incapable of transferring any jus in re therein while the location was vested in him. Nevertheless he could make a contract for the sale of his rights in the located land, while he remained locatee thereof, which, under the provisions of article 1488 of the Civil Code, would have the effect of transferring the land upon the issue of letters patent thereof to him by the Crown. On the proper construction of article 2098 of the Civil Code, where the title of the transferror does not come within the classes of rights exempted from the formality of registration by article 2084 C.C. and has not been registered a transfer of that title does not take effect until the prior title deed has been registered.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 23 K.B. 80) reversed, Davies J. dissenting.\nPer Davies J. dissenting.\u2014A transfer by the locatee of his rights is void if made to a person or a company who could not become a bon\u00e2 fide settler and, therefore, could not, himself or itself, obtain a location ticket for colonization land. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe facts which gave rise to the litigation are as follows:\u2014\nOn the 29th April, 1908, lot 35, range 1, of the Township of Arago, was granted by location ticket to one Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Thibault.\nOn the 11th August, 1909, Thibault sold to the Austin Lumber Company all his rights of property, of clearance and occupation, and other rights which he might have in the lot.\nThe deed states that the vendor has handed to the purchaser the location ticket and other titles relating to the land. The sale was made for $325, of which $275 were paid in cash, the balance payable on the patent for the lot being handed to the company. The deed contains a covenant to the effect that the vendor, on receiving written instructions from the company, will burn up the slashing without responsibility for damages and that the company will clean the clearance after the fire and will pay the remaining instalments necessary to obtain the patent.\nThe company having given no instructions to Thibault, having failed to pay the remaining instalments and otherwise fulfill the conditions necessary to enable the letters patent to be issued, the Crown, on the 26th of March, 1910, gave notice that the location ticket would be revoked.\nIt would appear that the Austin Lumber Company was at that time in liquidation. Nothing having been done by the company to enable the letters patent to be issued, Thibault, himself, fulfilled the remaining obligations, paid the instalments due and, on the 27th April, 1913, obtained letters patent from the Crown for the lot in question.\nOn the 5th of June, 1912, Thibault sold the lot, for the sum of $900 paid in cash, by the respondent.\nThe respondent entered into possession of the lot and cut about 900 cords of pulpwood in the course of the summer, autumn and early winter of 1912-13.\nOn the 24th of February, 1913, the appellant caused a writ of revendication to issue and seized the wood cut claiming it to be his property. The declaration alleged that he is the only true proprietor of lot 35, of range 1, of the Township of Arago, and of all the wood which had been cut thereon; that the respondent had illegally caused the wood to be cut and was about to remove it; and by his conclusions he asked to be declared the proprietor of the wood and that the attachment be declared binding.\nThe respondent pleaded to the action alleging that the wood was worth $5 a cord, of which $3.25 represented the cost of cutting and removing it to the place of seizure, and $1.75 the value in the forest. He further pleaded that, the lot having been granted by location ticket to Thibault, he had purported to sell it to the Austin Lumber Co.; that the sale was null and void because the company had bought the lot for commercial purposes, contrary to law, because the company already possessed at the time of the sale more than three lots held under location ticket obtained from the Crown, and because no transfer of the lot or location ticket from Thibault to the company had been made as required by law; that the pre- tended sale by the liquidator of the Austin Lumber Co. to the appellant was void for the same reasons; that the Austin Lumber Co. had failed to fulfill the conditions under which it had acquired Thibault\u2019s rights, and that, thereupon, Thibault had himself fulfilled the necessary conditions and had obtained the patent in his own name. That the respondent had purchased from Thibault, who was, and always had been, the sole owner of the lot; that in any event, the appellant could not revendicate the wood or obtain the ownership thereof without paying to the respondent the sum of $2,925, which he had paid for the manufacture of the wood and its cartage to the river banks.\nThe respondent further pleaded, that though under no obligation to do so, he would be prepared, provided the appellant withdrew his action, to pay the sum of $275 which had been paid to Thibault and $50 interest, and deposited the sum of $325. By his conclusion, the respondent asked that the pretended sale of the 11th of August, 1909, of Thibault\u2019s rights under the location ticket should be declared illegal and void, that the sale of the lot by the liquidator of the company to the plaintiff should also be declared illegal, and that he, the respondent, should be declared the true proprietor of the lot, that the writ of revendication be quashed and the plaintiff\u2019s action dismissed and, alternatively, that if the plaintiff\u2019s title was declared good he should be condemned to reimburse the sum of $2,925, cost of manufacture and transportation of the wood.\nThe appellant answered admitting that the wood was worth $5 a cord, alleging that the illegality of the transfer by Thibault to the company could only be raised by the Crown and he further pleaded the chain of title in favour of the company and from the liquidator to him already referred to The trial judge held that the Austin Lumber Co., its liquidator, and the plaintiff had all failed to fulfil the obligation which the company had contracted towards Thibault and that, the Crown Land Department having given notice of the revocation of the location ticket, Thibault himself had fulfilled the required conditions and had obtained in his own name the letters patent for the lot, and had thereupon sold the same to the respondent; that, notwithstanding that the respondent was aware of the previous transaction with the Austin Lumber Co., it could fairly and legally purchase the lot from Thibault, who had acquired the complete title from the Crown; that neither the appellant nor the Austin Lumber Co. ever were proprietors of the lot, and that the respondent had cut the wood after having acquired the lot and the wood was, therefore, his property and the action was dismissed and the attachment set aside.\nOn the 15th of November, 1913, this judgment was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Cross, J., dissenting.\nThe Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, who gave the judgment of the court, held that the respondent, having acquired the lot from the grantee from the Crown, had a perfect title as against everybody; that all the rights of the holder of the location ticket ceased as soon as the Crown had made a grant of the lot, such rights being effective only so long as the location ticket was in force and until letters patent were issued, that, though the transfer made by Thibault to the company conferred on the latter the right to obtain the letters patent on fulfilling the conditions required by law, the company had not chosen to fulfill these conditions, and that Thibault, on notice of cancellation of the sale of the lots, had himself fulfilled the conditions. If Thibault had been able to obtain the patent in his own name, it was because the company had not registered the transfer in its favour at the Crown Land Office. That the legal relations existing between the Austin Lumber Co. and Thibault in no way affected the respondent\u2019s right to purchase the lot from Thibault, who had a perfect title thereto.\nThe learned judge further held that the transfer by Thibault to the Austin Lumber Co., of the location ticket issued in his favour was void because the company already held more than 300 acres of Crown lands in virtue of location tickets transferred to it, and he was of opinion that this fact was the reason why the company did not register the transfer obtained by it.\nMr. Justice Cross would seem to have rested his judgment on article 1488 of the Civil Code, and to have been of opinion that the issue of letters patent in favour of Thibault availed to perfect the appellant\u2019s title even as against third persons. He was also of opinion that the prohibition contained in the law against acquiring more than 300 acres of land under location ticket was one of which the Crown alone could avail itself.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. and Ferdinand Roy K.C. for the appellant.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and Rousseau for the respondent.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec confirming a judgment of Cimon J. of the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe contest was between the parties claiming as assignees of one Thibault, a location ticket holder of a farm or lot of land in the Province of Quebec, of which he subsequently became the patentee. The plaintiff appellant claimed as a purchaser from the liquidator of the Austin Lumber Company, to which company, before the liquidation, Thibault, the location ticket holder, had assigned the located farm or holding. The respondent claimed as assignee of Thibault after he had acquired a title to the farm or lot by letters patent from the Crown.\nThe crucial question which arises on the facts to my mind is whether the assignment from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company operated to convey to the company all Thibault\u2019s interest in the land which he possessed under his location ticket at the date of the assignment, or if it did not and could not convey any such interest whether it operated to assign to the company any interest he might subsequently acquire if he became patentee of the lands.\nI have, after much consideration of the facts and the statutes bearing upon them, reached the conclusion that the alleged assignment from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company was invalid and null and that the respondent, Stewart, as the purchaser of the lot from Thibault after he had become its patentee had a right to the timber cut and in dispute.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I have not deemed it necessary to touch upon the other interesting questions which were raised and argued at bar. The important facts and their dates are as follows:\u2014 Location ticket granted Thibault 29 April, 1908\nAustin Lumber Company incorporated under letters patent from the Dominion, of\nCanada \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.......................... 12 March, 1909\nSale and assignment from Thibault to company \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 11 August, 1909\nWinding-up order, Austin Lumber Company prior to \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Feb., 1910\nAuthority to sell assets of company granted liquidator \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 2 Feb., 1910\nSale by liquidator to Howard, including lot in question \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 19 Oct., 1910\nLetters patent of lot to Thibault \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 27 April, 1912\nConveyance Thibault to Stewart (deft.) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 5 June, 1912\nSuit commenced \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 23 Feb., 1913\nStatute of 1909 assented to \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 29 May, 1909\nThe ground upon which I hold this appeal must fail is that the interest of the locatee, Thibault, was not such as could be assigned by him to the Austin Lumber Company, because that company was incompetent to become a settler of lots or locations within the statute, and incompetent to become the assignee of a bon\u00e2 fide settler who had obtained a location ticket. Such company was incompetent to fulfil the conditions necessary to enable a location ticket holder to obtain a patent of the lot located.\nIn other and shorter words, I am of the opinion that it was equally impossible for such a commercial company as the Austin Lumber Company to become a location ticket holder or the legal assignee of one who had become such and that the attempt to become the latter as in the case before us was in direct violation of the policy of the law.\nI am also of the opinion that the sale and assignment from Thibault to the company cannot be supported on the ground that it was a sale of future rights which he might acquire by fulfilling personally the conditions of his location ticket and obtaining his patent. No such contract was contemplated by the parties and no such contract can, in my judgment, he evolved out of the assignment. Thibault gave the company what the parties intended and what I think they fairly expressed in the transfer, and that was an assignment of\nall the rights of property, clearing, occupation, or other rights, whatsoever, which the seller may have on lot No. 5, in the first range of the Township of Arago, County of L\u2019Islet, and also the buildings thereon erected and the seller has this day remitted to the company the location tickets and other titles relating to said land.\nHe was selling and assigning his interest in the lands he held under his location ticket and handing over and assigning the ticket itself, the evidence of his ownership. That interest at the time was doubtless small, but by continued occupation and the clearing of a certain quantity of the land yearly it would in five years ripen into a right to obtain a patent. But such rights as might subsequently mature or arise by virtue of the subsequent performance by him of the conditions of the location ticket as to which the agreement said nothing were not intended to be assigned and were not assigned.\nThere was not the least intention in my judgment in the minds of either party that Thibault was selling and the company was buying a future interest only in the land dependent on and arising out of the patent if it ever was earned and issued. What they were dealing in and with were the then present existing rights of Thibault as a location ticket holder, and these are just the rights which I say the Austin Lumber Company was incompetent to purchase and which the policy of the law did not permit Thibault as a location ticket holder to sell to any person but a bon\u00e2 fide settler.\nThe right to become patentee of the homestead lot depended, as I have said, upon the performance of subsequent conditions as to clearing the land and paying the purchase money to the Crown. It was not stipulated or intended that Thibault should do those things or any of them. He was transferring all his then interest in the location and he agreed to do what in him lay to obtain the patent if and when the subsequent conditions were performed by, the transferee. If the company was a \u201cbon\u00e2 fide settler\u201d within the meaning of the statute it could then take a legal assignment of the interest of Thibault, the original settler. That would create a very different condition of things, and the construction to be put upon the assignment might in such case be different in the event of Thibault subsequently getting the patent in his own name. But if the company could not become a transferee, not being a bon\u00e2 fide settler, then I take it that the assignment, being illegal as against the policy of the law, could not be invoked to create a right as arising out of the subsequent granting of the patent.\nI take it that the location ticket holder could by apt words in his contract of assignment assign to one admittedly not a bon\u00e2 fide settler any future interest which might accrue to him if and when a patent of the land issued to him. The policy of the law did not prevent that. Being patentee he became the owner with all an owner\u2019s rights and, of course, there was nothing to prevent him selling those contingent rights before they accrued or came into being. But as a locatee only he was in a sense a ward of the State, protected by law against speculators and others and prohibited as a matter of public policy from parting with his rights to others than bon\u00e2 fide settlers with whom it was the clear and expressed policy of the legislature to settle the \u201clands of the province suitable for cultivation.\u201d\nThe fact that in 1909 the legislature enacted a further amendment to the then existing statute providing that lots sold or otherwise granted for settlement after the first day of July, 1909, should not for five years following the date of the location ticket or otherwise be alienated wholly or in part \u201cexcept by gifts inter vivos or by will or by ab intestate succession,\u201d and that in these cases the donee, heir or legatee should be subject to the same prohibition as the original grantee; and that every transfer made in contravention of that article should be absolutely null between the parties only seems to me to accentuate my argument as to the policy of the law. It is now illegal for a locatee subsequent to July, 1909, to sell even to another bon\u00e2 fide settler. Before this such a sale was or might be valid if approved of by the Commissioner of Lands, Since then not even such a sale could be upheld.\nThe enlargement of the prohibition from a partial to an absolute one cannot be invoked as an argument against the previous existence of the partial prohibition\u2014and so it will not do to assume that because the legislature in 1909 enacted absolute prohibition of the transfer of these location tickets that partial prohibition did not previously exist. Altogether apart from the right of the locatee to assign, I cannot see where or from whence the Austin Lumber Company received the power or capacity to enter into such a contract as that made by it with Thibault, the locatee.\nThat company was incorporated by letters patent from the Dominion of Canada and from these its powers and capacities must be determined.\nThese letters patent express and define the purposes and objects of the company as follows:\u2014\n1. To own or lease or operate and develop timber limits and water powers.\n2. To carry on the business of lumberers, or manufacturers of, and dealers in logs, timber and lumber of every description, and products thereof and anything in which the products of the forest forms a part.\n3. To acquire as a going concern or otherwise all the assets and good will of the partnership formerly existing and known as \u201cThe Austin Lumber Company, Limited.\u201d\n4. To carry on any other business germane to the aforesaid objects.\n5. To manufacture electric current, electric or other heat or power for the purposes of the company.\n6. To hold and own shares or securities in any other company carrying on business similar to that which this company is hereby authorized to carry on.\nI frankly confess myself unable to understand what construction of these purposes and objects can be made to include the purchase of a lot of a location ticket holder under the Quebec Act, such as Thibault was, a homesteader, as he is called in other parts of Canada. The\nowning, leasing, operating and development of timber limits and water powers, carrying on of the business of lumberers, etc.,\nand\nthe carrying on of any other business germane to the aforesaid objects cannot in my judgment, under the most liberal construction of these powers, be extended to embrace the purchase by the company of the lots set apart and given to a locatee for a homestead and for settlement These locations were for a special object and purpose clearly defined and set forth in the statute. They were to be given only out of lands \u201csuitable for cultivation\u201d and only to \u201cbon\u00e2 fide settlers.\u201d The purpose and policy of the legislature was to create homesteads for the persons to whom they were given and such other qualified persons as they might legally assign them to.\nIt is contrary, in my judgment, to the clearly declared policy of the Act that persons and companies disqualified from receiving these location tickets should become the owners of them by purchase from the locatee. Only such persons as were entitled to become locatees could become assignees of the locatee until, of course, the patent for the location was granted.\nPrior to the amending Act of 4 Edw. VII. (1904), ch. 13, the statute, sec. 1269, R.S.Q, (1888), authorized the granting of a \u201clocation ticket\u201d subject to the approval of the Commissioner, to\nany person who asks to purchase a lot of public lands for colonization purposes.\nThat amending Act of 1904 made some vital changes in the policy to be adopted in the granting of these location tickets. By article 7 it was provided that the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council might make a classification of public lands in the following manner:\u2014\n1. Lands suitable for cultivation;\n2. Lands for forest industries; and provided (art. 1268(b)) that no sale could after the classification authorized by the preceding article be made for colonization purposes outside the lands suitable for cultivation and classified as such.\nSection 8 of this Act replaced article 1269 of the Revised Statutes as amended by a new clause as follows:\u2014\n1269. Upon the conditions and for the price established by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, the Crown lands\u2019 agent, if there is no contestation, is bound, after the classification authorized by art. 1268(a) to sell the lands suitable for cultivation and classified as such and before such classification lands suitable for cultivation, to any bon\u00e2 fide settler who applies for the same. No such sale can be made of more than two hundred acres to the same person.\nThis was the law in force when the location ticket was issued to Thibault and the assignment made to the Austin Lumber Company. Since that time lands either classified as suitable for cultivation, or if before classification, lands suitable for cultivation could be located to bon\u00e2 fide settlers only\u2014and only to such bon\u00e2 fide settlers in quantity not more than 200 acres, subsequently increased to 300.\nThe policy here defined of limiting such sales to bon\u00e2 fide settlers only, necessarily in my judgment limited the power of assignment given to the locatee to other persons who could come within the same category, namely, bon\u00e2 fide settlers, until the locatee by his clearances and payments earned his right to his patent. Any other construction would defeat the policy, object and purpose of the Act. The object of the amendment clearly was to insure that lands suitable for cultivation should be kept out of the hands of speculators and of lumbermen and lumber companies whose business would be confined to the second classification, namely, \u201clands for forest industries.\u201d It was a well intentioned effort to place bon\u00e2 fide settlers upon those lands of the province \u201csuitable for cultivation\u201d and to provide against speculators or other than bon\u00e2 fide settlers getting location tickets for those lands either directly or indirectly. It was not, therefore, in my opinion, open to an ordinary lumberman not desiring to become a bon\u00e2 fide settler and a fortiori not to any of the large lumber companies or to speculators in lands to obtain the lands settled by bon\u00e2 fide settlers by assignments from them after they obtained their location tickets and before getting their patents. I do not, for one, feel disposed to thwart the clearly declared and defined policy of the legislature by a construction limiting the granting of the location ticket to a bond fide settler and at the same time permitting any one not such to obtain from the settler an assignment of all his rights in the land immediately after the issue of the ticket or license.\nIf the slightest doubt is felt upon the point, it will, I think, be set at rest by reading section 1269(a), which says:\u2014\n1269(a). Before making the sale the Crown lands\u2019 agent shall require the settler to make a declaration under oath in the Form E.; and the Crown lands\u2019 agent is authorized to receive the settler\u2019s oath.\nTurning to Form E. in the Schedule to the Statute of 1904, we find that the desiring locatee is required to swear to his age and residence, his wish to acquire a specified lot, his opinion\nthat it is fit for cultivation and does not derive its chief value from the timber thereon,\nthat he is already the owner of certain lots under location ticket specifying them and that he is not lending his name to any person for the purpose of acquiring such lot, and that he is not acquiring such lot for the sole purpose of trafficking in the timber, but with a bon\u00e2 fide object of settling thereon.\nThis was the law in force at the time this location ticket to Thibault was granted and the assignment made by him to the Austin Lumber Company and I cannot myself yield to the argument submitted by the appellant\u2019s counsel to us that while that company could not become a locatee it could legally become the assignee of one.\nSuch an argument, if accepted, would defeat and destroy the whole policy of the law as clearly declared and defined by the legislature, a policy so meritorious and in the public interest that I decline to be a party to defeating it by frittering away the express terms of the statute.\nI do not, therefore, think the Lumber Company was a competent locatee or could become the legal assignee of one. I do not think the Austin Lumber Company, by the terms of its charter, was any more competent to accept an assignment of one of these locations given to a bon\u00e2 fide settler for the purpose of settlement, than it was for it to purchase an interest in a coal or silver mine or in one of the large mercantile or shipping establishments of Montreal. Such a dealing was clearly outside of the express purposes and objects for which it was incorporated and also of those necessary and incidental powers which flow from them. It was not \u201cgermane\u201d to any of the specified powers granted to the company by letters patent. I deny, therefore, the competency of this company to enter into this contract or to accept this assignment. If I am right that contract was wholly void. See Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[2]. In that case Lord Chancellor Cairns quotes with approval as summing up and exhausting the whole question the following statement of law as stated by Mr. Justice Blackburn:\u2014\nI do not entertain any doubt that if, on the true construction of a statute creating a corporation it appears to me to be the intention of the legislature, expressed or implied, that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every court, whether of law or equity, is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal, and therefore wholly void, and to hold that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified.\nNor apart from that can I accede to the argument which I understand has found favour with at least one of my colleagues, that while the assignment of the location ticket and the locatee\u2019s interest under it was inoperative or ineffective, it should be so construed as to operate as an assignment of the interest of the assignor as and when he became the patentee of the lands.\nI have already shewn that the assignment only professed to deal with the assignors\u2019 then present interest, and that such an interest only was what the parties were bargaining for and had no relation to any subsequent interest he might obtain by a payment subsequently of his own moneys and the performance subsequently by him of those homestead duties necessary to obtain a patent and with respect to which naturally no reference was made in the assignment and lastly, that if the assignment or transfer is in itself illegal and void so far as relates to the interest of Thibault as a locatee it cannot be made the basis on which to construct an argument that it operates to assign the subsequent interest accruing to Thibault under his patent. Such an interest might be granted by locatees to parties competent to receive them\u2014 but if so the intention to reach such ulterior interest must be fairly shewn on the face of the assignment and by apt language.\nI would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Superior Court and Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIdington J.\u2014Each of the parties hereto claims title through Thibault, who was admittedly the locatee of the Crown pursuant to the provisions of the sections of the law concerning the sale and administration of public lands.\nIt is contended for appellant that the locatee was a purchaser from the Crown of the lands in question and entitled to make a sale of the land he so acquired, and that he did so in such manner that the moment he got his patent therefor, the title enured to the benefit of appellant.\nThis is denied by respondent, who further contends that the sale by Thibault being to a commercial company which could not itself do settlement duties, was illegal.\nIf this latter proposition is well founded the appellant\u2019s claim must fail as resting upon an illegal transaction.\nIt is clear that a locatee could sell to one who could perform the duties. It is impossible to say that there is any express legislative enactment prohibiting the locatee in question from selling to another who was not qualified to settle or perform settler\u2019s duties.\nSuch an enactment, article 1281(a), R.S.Q., was passed by the legislature in 1909, but it only extended to lots sold or otherwise granted for purposes of colonization after the 1st of July, 1909, although assented to May, 1909.\nThis location now in question was made in 1908.\nI do not think it can be laid down as law that simply because the legislature so expressly enacted, it must necessarily be held that the prohibition had not previously existed by implication or otherwise.\nI do think, however, that the first express enactment being so framed is very suggestive.\nIndeed it puzzzles one to see why if it was always illegal there should have been any hesitation about declaring it so, and, that instead thereof, the legislature should put, as it did, an express limitation upon the time of its becoming operative.\nIt was by the same enactment that the rights of selling in any case were much curtailed and transfers were limited to cases of donation inter vivos or by will or succession, etc., etc., or by the express authority of the minister, etc.\nIt seems to be suggested by all this that there had been abuses, yet that these transactions which had constituted the abuse, were to be permitted to stand, though the policy of the legislature was to be changed as to the future.\nIt is said that there was no means of registration in the Crown Lands Department of any such transfer as the Austin Lumber Company got from Thibault. Assuming that to be so, how does it constitute prohibition of such a contract? The inability to register does not in the absence of some express legislation on the subject invalidate a contract or in any way affect its operation as between the parties thereto. And registration only furnishes security against possible third parties claiming under some provision of the \u201cRegistry Act,\u201d priority, by virtue of registration.\nMoreover we have this curious piece of legislative history bearing upon that very question. In 1904 it was enacted by section 1275(a) that transfers by first purchasers must be transmitted to the department within thirty days on pain of nullity, but this was repealed in 1906 and so far as I can find, never again re-enacted.\nThen it is said that the policy of the law in relation to the locatee and his right to transfer is such as to render the transfer from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company illegal.\nI am unable to see how we can find such alleged policy of the law unless by express legislation, or clear implication thereof, cutting out the usual operative effect which the law gives to the contracts between parties.\nAll that has been done by way of legislation relative to the relations between the Crown and such purchasers as Thibault is to require that he settle on the land, and from year to year, for a term of years, perform specified duties in the way of clearing and building and residence, before he becomes entitled to receive his patent.\nThose duties he binds himself to the company to fulfil and thus discharged all that the policy of the law required, by its express provision. To read something further into the law is to put something there not provided or implied by the language of the statute.\nThis leaves it open to the settler to contract with third parties in regard to the lands either in way of sale or promise of sale.\nThe form of contract adopted in this case certainly was not a mere promise of sale. It would be doing violence to the language so to construe it.\nIt is as absolute in form in the first part of the instrument as words can make it. In the latter part of it there is a sentence binding Thibault to perform the duties required to be done by him to entitle him to get the patent and thereby complete the title he has warranted.\nIt seems to fulfil the terms of article 1025 of the Code, which expressly anticipates the possibility of non-delivery.\nThen the obligation of Thibault is thereby rendered possible of performance without impeding the effect designed by said article to be given to the sale.\nThis article, as well as article 1026, is by article 1027 shewn to be applicable to the rights of third parties, saving in relation to immovable property, the special provisions contained in the \u201cCode for the registration of titles to and claims upon such property.\u201d\nI shall presently advert to that phase of the questions involved herein, but before doing so desire to point out that the several sections of the statute governing the management and sale of the Crown lands expressly treat the transaction between the Crown and the locatee as a sale.\nIn section 1268, R.S.Q., 1888, provision was made for the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council fixing the price per acre of public lands and the terms and conditions of sale and settlement and payment, and subject to minor changes and modifications such has remained the key-note, as it were, to dealing with Crown lands.\nSection 1269 provided for Crown lands\u2019 agents selling upon the conditions and for the price regulated.\nSection 1270 of same statute provided as follows:\u2014\nThe Commissioner may issue, under his hand and seal, to any person who has purchased, or may purchase, or is permitted to occupy, or has been entrusted with the care or protection of any public land or to whom a free grant was made, an instrument in the form of a license of occupation, and such person, or the assignee, by an instrument registered under this chapter or any other law providing for registration in such cases, may take possession of and occupy the land therein comprised, subject to the conditions of such license, and may thereunder, unless the same shall have been revoked or cancelled, maintain suits at law against any wrongdoer or trespasser, as effectually as he-could do under a patent from the Crown.\nSuch license of occupation shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of possession by such person or the assignee under an instrument registered as aforesaid in any such suit, but the same shall have no force against a license to cut timber existing at the time of the granting thereof.\nSection 1274 provided for the registration of transfers made by the original purchaser or locatees of their rights.\n4 Edw. VII., ch. 13, sec. 7, directed the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to make a classification of public lands. And 1268 (b), in the same section was as follows:\u2014\n1268(b). No sales can after the classification authorized by the preceding article, be made, for colonization purposes, outside the lands suitable for cultivation and classified as such.\nSection 8 contains the following provision in substitution of previous legislation on the same subject:\u2014\n8. Article 1269 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Acts 60 Victoria, chapter 22, section 14; 63 Victoria, chapter 14, section 1, and 1 Edward VII., chapter 8, section 7, is replaced by the following: \u201c1269. Upon the; conditions and for the price established by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, the Crown lands\u2019 agent, if there is no contestation, is bound, after the classification authorized by article 1268(a), to sell the lands suitable for cultivation and classified as such, and before such classification lands suitable for cultivation, to any bon\u00e2 fide settler who applies for the same. No such sale can be made of more than two hundred acres to the same person.\n\u201cThe sales made by the agents take effect from the day upon which they are made; but, if the location ticket contains any clerical error or an error in the name, or an incorrect description of the land, the Minister may cancel the location ticket and order the issue of a new one, corrected, which will take effect from the date of the former one.\n\u201c1269(a). Before making the sale the Crown lands\u2019 agent shall require the settler to make a declaration under oath in the Form E; and the Crown lands\u2019 agent is authorized to receive the settler\u2019s oath.\u201d\nThen by section 1588 of the R.S.Q., 1909, we find the following provision:\u2014\n1558. Before making the sale, the Crown lands\u2019 agent shall obtain from the settler an affidavit according to Form A; and the Crown lands\u2019 agent or a notary may receive the same. R.S.Q., 1269(b); 9 Edw. VII., ch. 24, sec. 2.\nThat affidavit has been varied slightly, but the substance of it shews as it existed at the time of the grant of this location in question that the applicant wished to acquire a lot fit for cultivation, not deriving its chief value from the timber thereon and to acquire in his own name for the purpose of clearing and cultivating for his own benefit, and that he was not lending his name to any person for the purpose of acquiring such lot, and had no understanding with any one in that respect and was not acquiring it for the sole purpose of trafficking in the timber, but with the bon\u00e2 fide object of settling thereon.\nIn argument stress has been laid upon this affidavit. All it amounts to is that the applicant has an honest purpose at the time of making the application as specified in the affidavit. There is no pledging or promising in reference to the future disposition of the lot or the improvements. If it had been shewn that this locatee, Thibault, had conceived the purpose of selling to the Austin Lumber Company when he made his affidavit, the transaction, of course, would be fraudulent. Nothing of the kind appears in this transaction. I, therefore, fail to see any argument that can be founded upon this affidavit when we have in view the actual facts of this case. The affidavit itself is in harmony with the general expressions relative to sales used in the foregoing statutes.\nIn face of such legislation as I have recited at length in order to realize its purport and the nature of the right acquired thereunder, it seems to me impossible to treat the location ticket as a mere license of occupation or something less than a sale.\nOnce the locatee had observed the obligations imposed upon him he was entitled as of course to get his patent. If he failed in discharging these obligations the Minister might under the provisions of some of the Acts now appearing in article 1574 of the Revised Statutes, revoke the sale.\nSuch is the letter of the law and I ask how can we constitute the transaction other than a sale? True, the cancellation does not proceed upon the basis of the ordinary right of dissolution of a contract for non-fulfilment of conditions. Article 1576 of the statute excepts it from the operation of article 1537 of the Civil Code.\nBut no other provision I can find seems to take the transaction in other relations out of the operations of the Civil Code.\nThat brings us to what seems to me the crucial question in this case which arises from the fact that the transfer from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company was registered, and also that from the assignee of that company to appellant (which it may be noted was judicially directed) before the patent, and before the transaction between Thibault and respondent, by virtue of which he claims.\nIf the registry provisions of the Code had expressly provided that they must be held as restricted to titles acquired subsequently to the issue of the patent, then the registrations antecedent thereto could be treated as of no avail. But I can find no such restriction. They treat all titles alike and consequently the title which begins with the location ticket is to be treated as the root of title when effect is to be given to registration controlling the operation of article 1025 as provided in article 1027.\nLeaving the latter provision and all implied therein out of the question, there was a sale by the Crown to Thibault and by him to the Austin Lumber Company and its assignee or the judicial sale which he was directed to effect to the appellant, which, on a proper application of the principles laid down in the Code, precluded respondent from acquiring any title.\nThibault had thereunder none to give and he could confer none.\nIt is suggested default had been made by the Austin Lumber Company in failing to make the necessary payments the contract provided for and, hence, liable to rescission. But there was no term of the contract within article 1536 which enabled Thibault as of course to dissolve and disregard his contract of sale and no other way such as provided by article 1557 was pursued by him. His grantee, the respondent, can be in no better position. And, therefore, it seems to me such default did not give respondent what he claims.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs, but subject to such terms of repaying the respondent for his improving the value of the property by the expenditure in cutting of the timber as he may be found entitled to.\nDuff J.\u2014I am unable to concur in the view of the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. I can find no evidence in the record to shew that the Austin Lumber Company are holders of more than the permissible number of location tickets. I am also unable to concur in the view that the rights of the Austin Lumber Company were extinguished by the issue of the patent. I think the assignment to the Austin Lumber Company had not the effect of presently transferring any jus in re in the property in question. I have no doubt that the locatee\u2019s right was in the nature of a droit r\u00e9el, but a right nevertheless which was subject to all the conditions and characteristics arising out of the provisions of the statute under the authority of which the right was created. As I read the statute the locatee, so long as he remains locatee, that is to say, so long as the location is vested in him, is incapable of creating any jus in re in respect of it. He may transfer his location, it is true, and with a proper approval, the location may become vested in the transferee, but it is only by such a transfer that any proprietory interest in the location can before the issue of the patent be effectually vested in another.\nIt does not, however, by any means follow from this that the locatee may not enter into a contract of sale before the issue of the patent under which the provisions of article 1488 C.C., will have the effect of transferring the property as soon as the patent issues; and that I think is what happened in this case. The moment the patent issued the title of the patent became vested by virtue of the existing contract in the Austin Lumber Company. That brings us to the question which has given rise to the only difficulty I have felt in the case, viz., whether the right of the Austin Lumber Company was lost by reason of the registration of Stewart\u2019s deed of sale. The point which presents itself to my mind is this: Article 2098 C.C., provides:\u2014\n\u201cSo long as the right of the acquirer has not been registered, the registration of all conveyances, transfers, hypothecs or real rights granted by him in respect of such immovable is without effect.\nDoes this mean that the registration whose validity is in question is simply inoperative; or does it mean that it is not effective until the registration of the prior title If the first, then the registration of the transfer to the Ausin Lumber Company before the issue of the patent would have no effect, if this is one of the class of cases to which the article above qnoted applies. Now it seems a fair construction of this article, taken together with article 2084, C.C., to hold that it has no application to cases in which the prior title rests upon an instrument to which the provisions of article 2084, C.C., apply. In that view the registration of the patented title would not be required. I think, however, the more satisfactory construction of article 2098, C.C., is that, where the prior title is not registered, the registration of a transfer of that title does not take effect until the prior title is registered. On this construction the appellant is relieved from any difficulty that might arise as to the provisions as to registration.\nAnglin j.\u2014The question for determination in this action is the ownership of lot 35, range 1, Arago, in the County of L\u2019Islet. The following appear to be the material facts which are uncontested:\u2014\nA location ticket for the lot was duly issued by a Crown lands\u2019 agent to one Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Thibault on the 29th April, 1908. In disposing of the land to Thibault the Crown lands\u2019 agent proceeded under the statute then in force (art. 1269 of the Revised Statutes, as enacted by 4 Edw. VII. ch. 13, sec. 8) which empowered Crown lands\u2019 agents to sell lands suitable for cultivation and classified as such and declared that the sales made by the agents take effect from the day on which they are made. Thibault paid to the agent the first of the four instalments into which his purchase money was divided. On the 11th of August, 1909, he sold and conveyed his rights and interest in lot 35 to the Austin Lumber Company for $325, of which he received $275, the balance being made payable on the issue of the Crown patent for the lot. By the deed Thibault undertook to burn the fallen timber (l\u2019abatis) on the property and the company to clear the land afterwards and to pay to the Crown the three further instalments necessary to procure the issue of the grant, which Thibault promised diligently to facilitate. The Austin Lumber Company becoming insolvent, its liquidator on the 19th Oct., 1910, with judicial sanction, sold and conveyed the lot in question, with other property of the company, to the plaintiff Howard. These two deeds appear to have been recorded in the registry office at St. Jean Port Joli, as Nos. 37757 and 38616 respectively, but they were not registered in the Department of Lands and Forests, as is provided for by articles 1563 et seq. of the R.S.Q., 1909, The Austin Lumber Company did not fulfil the conditions of the sale by the Crown to Thibault, and notice was given on the 26th of March, 1910, of the intention of the Crown to cancel the location ticket of the lot. But actual cancellation did not take place and Thibault upon paying the balance of the price and satisfying the Department as to the fulfilment of the conditions of sale, obtained a Crown patent for the lot in his own name on the 27th of April, 1912. On the 5th of June following Thibault sold the lot to the defendant Stewart for $900. The conveyance to Stewart was registered. Stewart knew when he purchased of the prior sales by Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company and by the liquidator of that company to the plaintiff Howard.\nIn the Superior Court Cimon J. held that the issue of letters patent to Thibault enabled him to confer an incontestable title on the defendant Stewart. In the Court of King\u2019s Bench Archambault C.J., who spoke for the majority of the court (Cross J. diss.), affirmed the judgment for the defendant on the ground taken by Cimon J. and also on the additional ground that at the time of the transfer to it from Thibault the Austin Lumber Company already held 300 acres of unpatented colonization lands and that the transfer to it of lot 35 by Thibault was therefore null and void under art. 1565, R.S.Q., 1909.\nAt bar it was also argued that article 2085, C.C., is conclusive in favour of the title of the defendant; that the transfer to the Austin Lumber Company was void because that company acquired the land for commercial purposes and not for the purpose of colonization and that the transfer from Thibault to the company was of a property which he did not own and therefore void under article 1487, C.C.\u2014that it was not a sale, but a mere promise of sale and that article 1488, C.C., does not apply to it.\nI shall deal with these several points in the order which seems most convenient.\nPrior to the legislation, 4 Edw. VII., ch. 13, sec. 8, there appears to have been some doubt in the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec whether the transactions evidenced by location tickets obtained by settlers from Crown lands\u2019 agents should be deemed conditional sales or merely promises of sale. The judgments of Meredith, C. J., Casault and McCord JJ., in Dinan v. Breahey[3], favour the former view; whereas in Gilmour v. Paridis[4], Dorion C.J. says that such location tickets are in effect promises of sale, and Tessier J. speaks of the settlers holding them as quasi-proprietors. On appeal to the Privy Council the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was affirmed, but the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s title was not adverted to further than in the statement that it was sufficient to carry with it the right of protection by injunction[5]. But since the legislation of 1904 I have little doubt that the transactions evidenced by location tickets issued under it to settlers by Crown lands agents are sales\u2014conditional, it is true, but veritable sales.\nIn several of the articles of the Revised Statutes, 1909, notably articles 1556, 1557, 1558, 1563, and 1574, these transactions are designated as sales. In article 1574 provision is made for their cancellation and by article 1576 it is declared that this\nright of revocation shall not be deemed an ordinary right of dissolution of a contract for non-fulfilment of conditions. But whatever may be the true legal concept of the contract entered into between the Crown and the settler, the statute clearly recognizes in articles 1563 and 1565 that the latter has a saleable and transferable interest in the land. In article 1563 he is spoken of as the purchaser and in article 1565 as the proprietor. By the statute, 9 Edw. VII., ch. 24, sec. 4 (art. 1572, R.S.Q.), restrictions were placed on the sale of land subsequently located by settlers. While all these provisions seem to uphold the view that what took place in April, 1908, was in reality a sale of lot 35 to Thibault, it is perhaps unnecessary to determine whether under his location ticket he held as upon a sale subject to resolutory conditions or as upon a promise of sale. In either case it is clear that he had a saleable and assignable interest. I incline to the view that his transfer of that interest to the Austin Lumber Company was not within article 1487 C.C.\u2014that he sold and transferred something of which he was the proprietor. But if he had only such an interest as is conferred by a promise of sale\u2014his transfer of that interest was absolute and no mere promise to sell it; it was in form and substance a sale present and out and out, and I see no reason why article 1488 C.C., should not apply to it, or why, upon Thibault obtaining his patent, if what he had held theretofore was merely a promise of sale, the property should not under his title thus perfected have been forthwith vested in the plaintiff as purchaser from his assignees (articles 1025, 1473 and 1488 C.C.). The declaration of article 1556 of the R.S.Q., that \u201csales made by (Crown lands\u2019) agents take effect from the day on which they are made\u201d is at least consistent with this view. Article 1488, C.C., appears to be declaratory of the law as it stood before that article was enacted. See 6 Marcad\u00e9, p. 217. No. V.; 1 Troplong, \u201cVente,\u201d No. 326. Although they are not collocated in any table of concordance which I have seen, the first paragraph, article 1025, C.C., is not dissimilar in substance to the main provision of the second paragraph of article 1138, C.N.\nThe issue of the Crown grant to Thibault, in my opinion, served to perfect and confirm Howard\u2019s title and apart from the effect of the registry laws, did not clothe Thibault with capacity to confer upon a purchaser, who took subsequently and with notice of the transactions between Thibault and the Austin Lumber Company and the liquidator of that company and Howard, a title adverse thereto and incontestable by Howard.\nAs already stated, prior to 1909 (see article 1572, R.S.) the law clearly contemplated and provided for the sale and transfer of the rights of settlers before the issue of letters patent. (Articles 1563 et seq.) It has been the constant practice in the Province of Quebec to recognize the right of settlers located prior to July, 1909, to sell and transfer their holdings to purchasers who assume the performance of the conditions upon which the location tickets issued (article 1556). The fact that such purchasers intend, after obtaining patents, to cut the timber on the land for commercial purposes has never been deemed to invalidate such transfers, and if it were now to be held that it did, many titles in the province would be jeopardized. The fact in the present case is that no timber was cut before patent issued and there is nothing in the record to warrant an inference that the Austin Lumber Company when purchasing intended to cut the timber before obtaining the patent for the land. I am not prepared, therefore, to deny the validity of the title advanced by the plaintiff on the ground that the transfer from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company was contrary to public policy.\nNeither does article 2085, C.C., in my opinion, preclude the plaintiff\u2019s title being set up against the defendant. That article makes the registered title of a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration good as against an unregistered right of a third party which is subject to registration, although the subsequent registered purchaser has taken with notice or knowledge of such right. If the rights of the Austin Lumber Company were \u201csubject to registration\u201d or susceptible of registration in the registry office of the registry division before patent issued, they were so registered. If their registration there was irregular and ineffectual it was because they were not then susceptible of such registration and not subject to it. Article 2085, C.C., deals with registration in the registry division under the provisions of the articles grouped under the 18th title of the Civil Code, articles 2082 et seq. It does not refer to the special registration provided for interests in unpatented lands by articles 1563 et seq. of the R.S.Q., 1909. While failure to register under the provisions of the \u201cPublic Lands Act\u201d may subject the assignee of an interest in unpatented lands to the risk of losing it in favour of a subsequent transferee before patent who registers his transfer (article 1569), or of a grantee from the Crown after a forfeiture, under article 1574, of the rights of the original or prior locatee, there is no provision in the \u201cPublic Lands Act\u201d which protects a person who subsequently to the issue of the patent takes from such original or prior locatee with notice of the earlier transfer of his interest. For a short time (1904-1906) failure to register in the department within thirty days a transfer of unpatented land rendered it void. Article 1275(a) of the R.S.Q., 1888, as enacted by 4 Edw. VII., ch. 13, sec. 9, so provided; but that provision was repealed by 6 Edw. VII., ch. 15, sec. 2, and has not been re-enacted. Non-registration in the Department of Lands and Forests did not invalidate the transfers from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company and from that company to the plaintiff. If those instruments were not originally, and did not, upon issue of the patent, become subject to registration in the registry division article 2085, C.C., affords no protection against them; if upon issue of the patent they became subject to and susceptible of such registration, although the recording of them may have been irregular and ineffectual, when it took place, I see no reason why upon issue of the patent to Thibault it should not have been held to have become regular and efficacious. If so, a further answer to defendant\u2019s plea under article 2085, C.C., is afforded by the implications of that article itself.\nI find nothing either in the articles of the Civil Code or in the provisions of the Revised Statutes invoked by the defendant which warrants the view that a purchaser of patented land from the original locatee thereof who has full knowledge of instruments transferring the locatee\u2019s interest in such land executed by him and recorded in the office of the registry division before patent issued may disregard tliem with impunity and, notwithstanding such knowledge, obtain a title which the persons interested under such instruments cannot successfully contest.\nA critical examination of the documents put in evidence to shew the lands held by the Austin Lumber Company, checking them one with another and with the evidence of the Crown lands agent, Michon, has satisfied me that it is not established that when that company acquired lot 35 (100 acres) from Thibault it already held more than 200 acres of unpatented lands. Except this lot and possibly lots 30 and 36 in the same range of Arago it would appear to have held no unpatented lands. Lots 30 and 36 are mentioned in two documents filed as still unpatented. But Michon says lot 30 was patented as to one-half in 1889 and as to the other half in 1908. The deed from Lefaivre to Howard shews that the Austin Lumber Company acquired lot 36 only on the 27th August, 1909, whereas it acquired lot 35 on the 11th August, 1909. All the other property mentioned in the deeds produced is shewn to have been either land patented before the date of the Thibault deed, land acquired by the company after that date, or land over which it held only the right to cut timber. While I fully agree with the learned Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench that, if the defendant had shewn that the Austin Lumber Company possessed more than 200 acres of unpatented land in March, 1909, the burden would have been upon it to establish that it had dispossessed itself of such surplus land before taking the Thibault deed in the following month, I am, with respect, unable to accept the view on which the learned judge proceeds that the documents produced clearly establish that the company owned more than 200 acres of unpatented land in March, 1909. I find that this allegation of the respondent was contested in the factum of the appellant in the Court of King\u2019s Bench as it was at bar in this court. It has, therefore, not been established that the deed from Thibault to the Austin Lumber Company was in contravention of the third paragraph of article 1556 of the R.S.Q.\nIf the notice of intention to cancel given under articles 1577 and 1578, R.S.Q., had been followed by actual cancellation under article 1574, so that the title of Thibault under his patent might be deemed the outcome of a new sale by the Crown, it may be that the rights acquired by the Austin Lumber Company and the plaintiff would have been thereby extinguished. But no such steps were taken. On the contrary, as is deposed to by Crown lands agent, Michon, lot 35 always remained registered in the department in the name of Thibault from the date of his location ticket, April 11th, 1908, and the grant which he obtained on the 27th April, 1912, was made in fulfilment of the contract of sale evidenced by that location ticket.\nIn my opinion the title of the plaintiff Howard has been fully established and is not open to attack upon any of the grounds preferred by the defendant. The appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment should be entered for the plaintiff, granting the conclusions of his declaration.\nThe appellant does not contest the right of the defendant to be reimbursed the cost of cutting and floating the timber in question.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer dans cette cause si un colon peut, avant r\u00e9mission des lettres patentes vendre sa terre et nous avons aussi \u00e0 l\u2019examiner si le d\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement, au d\u00e9partement des Terres, de cette vente peut emp\u00eacher l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de r\u00e9clamer contre un tiers qui a aussi un titre du m\u00eame colon.\nJe dois dire de suite que si la concession du lot avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite apr\u00e8s le ler juillet, 1909, la question se r\u00e9soudrait bien facilement; car l\u2019article 1572 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1909 d\u00e9clare bien formellement que\nles lots vendus ou autrement octroy\u00e9s pour fins de colonisation apr\u00e8s le ler juillet, 1909, ne peuvent pendant cinq ans, \u00e0 compter de la date du billet de location, \u00eatre vendus par le porteur du billet de location.\n\u00e0 moins que la vente ne soit autoris\u00e9e par le ministre.\nMais le billet de location dans la pr\u00e9sente cause \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, en 1908. Voici d\u2019ailleurs les faits importants du litige.\nLe 29 avril, 1908, le nomm\u00e9 Thibault a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agent des Terres de la Couronne \u00e0 Montmagny de lui vendre le lot No. 35 du premier rang du Canton Arago. L\u2019agent, aux termes de l\u2019article 1269 des Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888, tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9 par la loi de 1904, ch. 13, sec. 8, lui a vendu le terrain en question aux conditions ordinaires d\u2019habitation, de paiement et d\u2019\u00e9tablissement, avec pouvoir pour le ministre de r\u00e9silier la vente et d\u2019annuler le billet de location si le colon ne remplissait pas ces conditions.\nLe 11 ao\u00fbt, 1909, Thibault a transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la corporation \u201cAustin Lumber Company,\u201d par acte notari\u00e9, tous les droits qu\u2019il avait dans ce lot de terre, pour $325, dont $275 comptant et la balance payable lors de la remise des lettres patentes que Thibault s\u2019engageait d\u2019obtenir en son nom du d\u00e9partement des terres.\nCette compagnie devait, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, faire les trois paiements annuels que Thibault devait encore au gouvernement. Peu d\u00e9 temps apr\u00e8s ce contrat entre Thibault et la Compagnie \u201cAustin Lumber,\u201d cette derni\u00e8re fut mise en liquidation; et le liquidateur, le 29 octobre, 1910, vendait, par autorisation de justice, \u00e0 Howard, rappelant, l\u2019actif de cette compagnie, y compris le lot No. 35.\nL\u2019acte de vente de Thibault \u00e0 la compagnie \u201cAustin Lumber,\u201d ainsi que l\u2019acte de vente du liquidateur a Howard, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 2098 de Code Civil; mais, par contre, ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enrigistr\u00e9s ou D\u00e9partement des Terres d\u00e9 la Couronne, suivant les dispositions des articles 1563 et suivants des Statuts Refondus de 1909.\nLes paiements qui devaient \u00eatre faits annuellement n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s, le d\u00e9partement donna avis \u00e0 Thibault qu\u00e9 la ministre allait r\u00e9silier la vente, et alors ce dernier, s\u2019autorisant du fait que la Compagnie \u201cAustin Lumber\u201d ne lui donnait pas d\u2019argent pour faire ses paiements, ainsi quelle s\u2019y \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e, a fait les versements avec son propre argent et a pris la patente.\nAu lieu cependant d\u2019aller remettre cette patente \u00e0 la compagnie, comme il y \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 en vertu de son contrat du 11 ao\u00fbt, 1909, il a revendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 Stewart.\nCe dernier a, dans l\u2019hiver suivant, coup\u00e9 environ 850 cordes de bois sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9; et Howard le poursuit pour \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de ce lot et du bois qui y a \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9 par Stewart et accompagne sa demande d\u2019une saisis-revendication.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019Appel, le juge Cross dissident, ont renvoy\u00e9 cette action. Howard appelle devant cette Cour de ce jugement.\nJ\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion, apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 aux questions qui se soul\u00e8vent beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9tude et de consid\u00e9ration, que Howard devrait r\u00e9ussir et que le jugement a quo devrait \u00eatre renvers\u00e9.\nLa position l\u00e9gale se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 ceci, suivant moi:\u2014\nUn tiers peut acqu\u00e9rir la terre d\u2019un colon qui la d\u00e9tient par billet de location \u00e9mis avant le ler juillet, 1909, pourvu que cette acquisition ne lui donne pas plus de trois cents acres de terre.\nPour \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e contre une autre personne qui a \u00e9galement un titre de colon, cette vente devra \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9, en vertu du principe que de deux acqu\u00e9reurs du m\u00eame immeuble du m\u00eame vendeur celui dont titre est enregistr\u00e9 le premier a droit d\u2019en r\u00e9clamer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCette vente, pour \u00eatre valable, n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e au bureau des Terres de la Couronne.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019Appel ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en la pr\u00e9sente cause, que la compagnie \u201cAustin Lumber\u201d n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire du lot en question, et que les lettres patentes donnaient \u00e0 Thibault un titre parfait qui l\u2019autorisait de disposer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en favour de qui il voudrait.\nOn a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 aussi en faveur de Thibault dans ces jugements la n\u00e9gligence de la compagnie de remplir ses obligations.\nCeci nous am\u00e8me \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la nature du titre que poss\u00e8de de colon.\nJe crois qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019origine il \u00e9tait incertain si le billet de location qui \u00e9tait alors remis au colon pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une vente. Par ce billet de location le colon avait le droit d\u2019aller s\u2019installer sur une terre de la Couronne avec la permission de cette derni\u00e8re: et, s\u2019il y faisait certains d\u00e9frichements, y construisait certaines b\u00e2tisses et faisait certains paiements, il pouvait, apr\u00e8s un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es, devenir acqu\u00e9reur de cette terre.\nLa Cour d\u2019Appel, en 1887, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Gilmour v. Paradis[6], que ce contrat constituait une promesse de vente.\nDans une cause de Dinan v. Breakey, d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en 1881[7], la Cour de R\u00e9vision,\u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le billet de location \u00e9tait une vente conditionnelle.\nMais depuis 1904 il ne peut pas y avoir de difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la nature du contrat. C\u2019est une vente conditionelle. En effet, l\u2019article 1269 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888 a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 en 1904 par le chapitre 13 qui d\u00e9clare que l\u2019agent des terres est tenu de vendre au colon de bonne foi les terres propres \u00e0 la culture et que\nles ventes faites par les agents prennent leur effet du jour qu\u2019elles sont faites.\nL\u2019article ajoute cependant que si le billet de location renferme quelque erreur cl\u00e9ricale, le minist\u00e8re peut l\u2019annuler pour qu\u2019il soit \u00e9mis un nouveau billet corrig\u00e9 \u201cqui a son effet de la date du premier.\u201d\nNous sommes donc dans le cas actuel en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une vente qui est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9e par le vendeur si l\u2019acheteur ne remplit pas les conditions stipul\u00e9es dans le contrat.\nMais du jour o\u00f9 le billet de location a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis le colon est devenu le propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9 son lot \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de certaines restrictions \u00e9dict\u00e9es par la loi statutaire et le colon peut se pr\u00e9valoir de tous les privil\u00e8ges que l\u2019acheteur poss\u00e8de en vertu du Code Civil. Plus tard, quand il aura rempli ses conditions de paiement et d\u2019\u00e9tablissement, il pourra avoir des lettres patentes, qui ne constitueront pas pour lui une nouvelle acquisition de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais la confirmation, cette fois sans condition, de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le lot vendu.\nC\u2019est ce que Cour d\u2019Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Handley v. Foran[8], o\u00f9 le juge Hall, parlant au nom de la cour, disait:\u2014\nIt has often been held that a location-ticket or promise of sale, with possession, was equivalent to a title, and the subsequent delivery of letters patent in exchange for the location-ticket whose conditions had been complied with, did not establish the date of the creation of a new right, but only the recognition of a pre-existing one.\nDans une cause de Leblanc v. Robitaille[9], jug\u00e9e par cette Cour en 1901, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que sous l\u2019article 1269 tel qu\u2019en force alors le billet de location n\u2019avait aucun effet tant que le ministre ne l\u2019avait pas approuv\u00e9.\nMais trois ans plus tard cet article 1269 \u00e9tait rappel\u00e9 et cette approbation du ministre disparaissait pour faire place \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration que \u201cles ventes faites par les agents prennent leur effet du jour qu\u2019elles sont faites\u201d; et l\u2019intervention du ministre n\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que dans le cas o\u00f9 il y auriat en erreur cl\u00e9ricale dans le billet de location. Dans ce cas, le ministre \u00e9tait tenu de corriger cette erreur.\nIl y a aussi une autre cause d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette Cour, Green v. Blackburn[10], o\u00f9 les droits du colon quant aux mines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s. Mais l\u00e0 encore il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un billet de location \u00e9mis en 1901, avant la loi de 1904, par cons\u00e9quent.\nMais on dit: La compagnie Austin n\u2019ayant pas rempli ses conditions d\u2019achat, Thibault pouvait les ex\u00e9cuter lui-m\u00eame et devenir propri\u00e9taire absolu de son lot.\nLa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention est bien facile. Elle se trouve dans l\u2019article 1536 du Code Civil qui dit que le vendeur d\u2019un immeuble ne peut demander la r\u00e9solution de la vente faite par l\u2019acheteur d\u2019en payer le prix, \u00e0 moins d\u2019une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 cet effet. Or, nous ne trouvons pas de telle stipulation dans l\u2019acte de 11 ao\u00fbt, 1909;. et, par cons\u00e9quent, Thibault ne pouvait pas proprio mot\u00fb r\u00e9silier cette vente qu\u2019il avait faite \u00e0 la compagnie Austin et assumer le r\u00f4le de propri\u00e9taire absolu.\nEn Cour d\u2019Appel, l\u2019honorable juge-en-chef a d\u00e9clare que le vente \u00e0 la compagnie Austin \u00e9tait nulle parce que cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9tenait alors plus de 300 acres de terre de la Couronne.\nIl est bien vrai que la loi \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, 1275(c) tel qu\u2019\u00e9dict\u00e9 par 4 Edw. VII., ch. 13, sec. 9, et amend\u00e9 par 9 Edw. VII., ch. 24, sec. 3, d\u00e9clarait que les transports faits en faveur d\u2019une m\u00eame personne pour plus de 300 acres non-patent\u00e9s \u00e9taient nuls et ne conf\u00e9raient aucun droit au cessionnaire pour le surplus des 300 acres. Mais je ne vois pas que la preuve de ce fait ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nJ\u2019ai analys\u00e9 avec soin la preuve et je trouve qu\u2019au 11 ao\u00fbt, 1909, la compagnie Austin avait en sa possession le lot 30 du premier rang Arago; mais ce lot avait \u00e9t\u00e9 patent\u00e9 en 1899 et 1908; elle avait aussi les lots 26 et 27a du 3\u00e8me rang Arago; mais ces lots \u00e9taient patent\u00e9s depuis 1892 et 1897. Elle avait aussi partie du lot No. 33 et le No. 32 du 6\u00e8me rang du Canton Patton; mais ces lots avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 patent\u00e9s en 1908 et 1909. Mais on dit qu\u2019elle avait des droits de coupe sur un grand nombre d\u2019autres lots.\nLa preuve, en effet, constate que cette compagnie avait le droit de couper du bois sur plusieurs lots qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore patent\u00e9s; mais ce droit ne donnait pas \u00e0 la compagnie la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des lots euxm\u00eames, et il ne peut pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9 par la prohibition de la loi.\nMaintenant le d\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement du transport au bureau des Terres de la Couronne n\u2019effecte pas sa validit\u00e9. En 1904, la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les transports qui ne seraient pas transmis au d\u00e9partement seraient absolument nuls et de nul effet; mais cette l\u00e9gislation fut abrog\u00e9e en 1906, demonstrant par l\u00e0 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re \u00e9vidente qu\u2019en 1909 les transports non enregistr\u00e9s au d\u00e9partement \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme valides entre les parties contractantes.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu aussi que l\u2019enregistrement de la vente de Thibault \u00e0 la compagnie Austin au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 est sans effet parce que le contrat d\u2019acquisition de Thibault lui-m\u00eame n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9. Il se base sur la derni\u00e8re partie de l\u2019article 2098 du Code qui dit:\u2014\nJusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019enregistrement du droit de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur ait lieu, l\u2019enregistrement de touts cession, tout transport, toute hypoth\u00e8que ou tout droit r\u00e9el par lui consenti affectant l\u2019immeuble est sans effet.\nIl faut lire cet article avec l\u2019article 2084, qui d\u00e9clare que les titres originaires de concession sont exempts des formalit\u00e9s de l\u2019enregistrement. Par cons\u00e9quent, les lettres patentes \u00e9mises par la Couronne n\u2019ont pas besoin d\u2019\u00e9tre enregistr\u00e9es.\nIl en \u00e9tait probablement de m\u00eame de la vente que l\u2019agent des terres de la Couronne faisait sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 1269 S.R.P.Q. de 1888 tel qu\u2019amend\u00e9 en 1904.\nEn supposant que les dispositions formelles de l\u2019article 2098 devraient pr\u00e9valoir et qu\u2019il faudrait enregistrer m\u00eame les lettres patentes pour qu\u2019un colon puisse faire la vente de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne serait pas dans une meilleure position que le vendeur. Il ne pourrait pas lui aussi pr\u00e9tendre que son titre, quoiqu\u2019-enregistr\u00e9, aurait plus de valeur que celui de la compagnie Austin. Car si l\u2019enregistrement des lettres patentes est n\u00e9cessaire pour la compagnie Austin, il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 Stewart.\nNous serions donc, suivant les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, en pr\u00e9sence de deux acheteurs dont les titres n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9ment enregistr\u00e9s. Alors dans ce cas-l\u00e0 celui qui devrait l\u2019emporter serait le premier acqu\u00e9reur. Le second acqu\u00e9reur, en effet, d\u00e9clare la premi\u00e8re partie de l\u2019article 2098, ne peut r\u00e9clamer contre le premier acqu\u00e9reur que si son titre est enregistr\u00e9.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis donc d\u2019opinion que le jugement a quo doit \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de cette Cour et des Cour inf\u00e9rieures.\nLe.demandeur appelant doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire du lot No. 35 du ler rang du Canton Arago et il doit \u00eatre aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire des 850 cordes de bois qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisies revendiqu\u00e9es.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que la d\u00e9fendeur intim\u00e9 avait coup\u00e9 ce bois et l\u2019avait transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens. Il aurait, \u00e0 raison de cela, augment\u00e9 la valeur du bois au montant de $3.25 la corde. Il a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 sur ces 850 cordes de bois la somme de $2,762.50. Il aura donc la droit de retenir le bois, sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 441 du Code Civil, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le remboursement de cette somme ait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Roy, Gannon, Parent & Fitzpatrick.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Maurice Rousseau.\n[1] Q.R. 23 K.B. 80.\n[2] L.R. 7 H.L. 653.\n[3] 7 Q.L.R. 120.\n[4] M.L.E. 3 Q.B. 449.\n[5] 14 App. Cas. 645, sub nom.

Ter. Ord. No. 20 of 1901\u2014Construction of statute. Where the directors of a joint-stock company organized under the Alberta \"Companies Ordinance\" (N. W. Ter. Ord. No. 20 of 1901), have violated the provisions of article 57, Table \"A,\" of that enactment, (as to vacating the office of directors,) the consequences involve not only the disqualification of the directors, but also give a right of action on the part of any shareholder for a declaration of such disqualification and for an account of the moneys improperly received by them as profits under contracts between them and the company. Such contracts, being prohibited by the ordinance, could not be ratified by a majority of the shareholders, as the matter is not one merely of internal management. Burland v. Earle ((1902) A.C. 83), distinguished.\nThe judgment appealed from (25 West. L.R. 905) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing in part the judgment of Harvey C.J., at the trial.\nThe action was brought,. against the Theatre Amusement Company, Barney Allen, Julius Allen, Jay Junior Allen and a partnership firm known as The Canadian Film Exchange, by the present respon- dent, a shareholder in the Theatre Amusement Company, who had also been a partner in the Canadian Film Exchange, but had retired from that partnership previous to the illegal contracts complained of by which the appellants, the Aliens, being the remaining shareholders in the Theatre Amusement Company and its directors, had obtained profits improperly from the last-mentioned company. The plaintiff sought a declaration that, by their misconduct, the Aliens had become disqualified as directors of the said company, for a refund to the company of moneys received by them as salaries, an account of the moneys improperly received by them, and the appointment of a receiver to carry on the business of the company. At the trial the learned Chief Justice decided that the salaries had been voted by the directors to themselves without proper authority, that they were liable to account to the company for profits made by them in dealing between the company and themselves, that the shareholders could ratify, if they wished, what the directors had done, and that, in the meantime, the court should not interfere because interference should be for the benefit of the company and not for that of a single shareholder whose interests were less than those of the defendants as holders of the majority of the stock. Consequently an order was made for the refund of the amount of the salaries in question, but the plaintiff failed on the other branches of his action. On an appeal to the full court, this judgment was varied by the judgment now appealed from by a direction that, unless a new trial was agreed to, there should be an accounting for the profits improperly obtained by the directors. The questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. A. Ritchie and Hannah for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE agreed with Idington J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent and the three defendants, named Allen, owned in equal shares the corporate appellant and composed the partnership firm known as The Canadian Film Exchange. The interest of respondent in the latter concern was bought by the Aliens, who continued the business.\nThe firm had, both before and after the respondent's retirement, sold goods to the appellant corporation, of which the Aliens were the directors.\nThe ordinance under which the incorporation of the Theatre Amusement Company was procured prohibited the directors from doing so at a profit. And, so long as respondent was a member of the firm, they did not sell to the corporation at a profit.\nSo soon as respondent retired from the firm these directors alone constituting the firm charged a profit in the sales of goods of the same class supplied to the corporation. They admit doing so disqualified them as directors, but claim it was honest to do so and that respondent has, therefore, no remedy except by means of a suit in the name of the corporation, which their ownership of a majority of the stock rendered impossible. I think they are mistaken in their morals and law.\nTheir first practice of selling at cost price was honest. As things then stood it cost them nothing to be honest.\nThe change from that to selling at a profit involved what was clearly illegal and a breach of trust. Their partner had a right to believe his trustees would not so change as to adopt illegal practices merely to beat him out of a fractional advantage.\nI cannot say that their devious courses developed a very high standard of honesty. And I do not think, in law, the respondent is to be driven to trust to the honest voting of such fellow shareholders as his only hope of relief.\nNo one can question the law as laid down in Burland v. Earle[2], and the other like cases, but the extension of the doctrine to making it the systematic daily method of doing business so that those possessing the majority of the stock can so use their power and opportunity to drain the corporate body of all its sources of profit giving, and render dividends impossible, or the possibility thereof to be the measure of the rapacity of the directorate, is something not yet recognized in law. Yet such seems to be what is involved in the principle to be maintained in allowing this appeal.\nIndeed, I am tempted to suggest that lest other honest men be also led astray by the like application of the apparently logical reasoning put before us on behalf of the appellants, and alleged to rest on such high legal authorities, the sooner every legislative body can obliterate from its incorporating Acts the power of any shareholder by his own vote to help himself to sell his property to the company in which he is a shareholder, the better it will be for the moral health of the business community.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal is disposed of by reference to article 57 of Table \"A.\" That article declares the effect of a director entering into a contract with the company or being interested in a contract with the company; the effect is that the director becomes divested, as between himself and the company, of his de jure authority as director. If, therefore, the transactions in question are to be treated as contracts made between the directors and the company the effect of the very first transaction was to divest each of them of his authority as director. These persons having during this series of transactions continued to act in the capacity of directors they cannot, in my opinion, be allowed to say as against the company, or as against any shareholder of the company, that they were wrongfully in office, in other words, they cannot be permitted to deny that, in purchasing the goods in question, they were acting as agents for the company or that they are accountable, as such, for the profits. It is contended, however, that this is a position which only can be taken by the company itself. This contention rests upon an entire misconception of the effect of the articles of association of a company incorporated under the \"Companies Act\" of Alberta. The articles of association are binding upon the company, the directors and the shareholders, until changed in accordance with the law. So long as they remain in force, any shareholder is entitled, unless he is estopped from taking that position by some conduct of his own, to insist upon the articles being observed by the company, and the directors of the company. This right he cannot be deprived of by the action of any majority. In truth, the articles of association constitute a contract between the company and the shareholders which every shareholder is entitled to insist upon being carried out.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal on two grounds.\nThe contracts complained of were in violation of article 57 of the Articles of Asosciation. N. W. Ter. Ordinances, 1901, ch. 20, sch. \"A.\" The penalty of disqualification for the offending directors is imposed by that article. But that does not exhaust the consequences of an infraction of its provisions. The making of such contracts by the directors was prohibited. They could, therefore, be ratified only by a unanimous vote of all the shareholders and not by any majority however great. The question is not one of internal management and, as such, subject to the control of the majority.\nOn the evidence, the changes in the dealings between the company and the partnership, known as the Film Exchange, after Stone had ceased to be a member of that partnership, whereby profits from those dealings resulted to the partnership, was a fraudulent breach of trust on the part of the directors which no majority of the shareholders could render binding on the company. Other than the films, as to which there is no complaint, the articles supplied by the partnership to the company would appear to have been purchased by the partnership for the very purpose of being re-sold to the company. On these grounds this case is distinguishable from Burland v. Earle (1), relied upon by counsel for the appellants.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 25 West. L.R. 905.\n[2] [1902] A.C. 83.\n"

Belanger (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Montreal Water and Power Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1914: May 18, 19; 1914: October 13.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Contract with company\u2014Franchise for water supply\u2014Protection against fire\u2014Negligence\u2014Liability of company to ratepayer\u2014D\u00e9lit\u2014Damages.\nA municipal corporation, with assent of the ratepayers, entered into a contract by which it gave the defendant company the exclusive privilege for twenty-five years of maintaining a system of water supply to the municipality. The company was authorized to fix rates for water supplied for domestic purposes and was obliged, for protection against fire, to have hydrants at certain places and at all times, in case of fire, except when the plant was undergoing necessary repairs, to maintain a specified, capacity and pressure of water. The property of B., a ratepayer, was destroyed by a fire which attained serious dimensions owing to the pressure being at the outset much less than that required by the contract.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 22 K.B. 487) which affirmed the Court of Review (Q.R. 41 S.C. 348), Brodeur J. dissenting, that there was no contractual relation between B. and the company; that the contract did not evidence any intention by the parties to it to give a right of action against the company to each ratepayer in case of violation of the provisions for fire protection; and that B., therefore, could not maintain an action for the value of his property so destroyed.\nHeld, also, Brodeur J. dissenting, that B. could not maintain an action for damages on the ground that the failure to maintain the pressure stipulated for in the contract constituted a d\u00e9lit or quasi-d\u00e9lit under the law of Quebec. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, of the Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review at Montreal[2], by which the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial was set aside and his action dismissed.\nThe facts are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nThe action was brought against the defendant company and the Town of St. Louis. It was dismissed as against the town at the trial in which judgment the plaintiff acquiesced. The action was maintained against the company and the damages assessed at $16,712. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Review and the action dismissed in toto. The Court of King\u2019s Bench affirmed such dismissal.\nMigneault K.C. and Duranleau for the appellant. By the contract the municipal corporation covenanted on behalf of the ratepayers which it represents, Stevenson v. City of Montreal[3]; and see Wilshire v. Village of St. Louis du Mile End\u2019[4].\nThe cases deciding against a right of action in a case like this where there is a penalty for non-performance do not apply. The clause in the contract providing for forfeiture in case of non-performance is not a penal clause. The forfeiture is conditional on the municipality buying the plant which it may not do. See Simpson v. South Oxfordshire Water and Gas Co.[5], referring to Atkinson v. Newcastle and Gateshead Water Co.[6], relied on by respondents. The question is peculiarly one of Quebec law and the decisions in France should be followed. See Fuzier-Hermann, Code Civile Annot\u00e9, Ad. 1121, No, 30; Dalloz Eep. 20, \u201cObligations\u201d No. 273.\nThe following English decisions, among others, are in the plaintiff\u2019s favour. Campbell v. East London Water Works[7]; Dawson v. Bingley Urban District Council [8].\nThe defendants may be liable on the contract and also to an action ex delicto. See 20 Laurent No. 463; Fuzier-Hermann C.N. Supp. Arts. 1382, 1383, No. 854. Turner v. Stallibrass[9]; Quebec Railway Light and Power Co. v. Recorders Court[10].\nAs to liability for d\u00e9lit in this case see Guardian Trust and Deposit Co. v. Fisher[11].\nAtwater K.C. and Buchanan K.C. for the respondents. The appellant might, possibly, have had a right of action if the respondents had failed to supply water for domestic purposes, but could have none for failure in the public supply. Johnston y. Consumers\u2019 Gas Company of Toronto[12]; Atkinson v. Newcastle and Gateshead Waterworks Co.[13], at page 448.\nMigneault K.C. and Duranleau for the appellant.\nAtwater K.C. and Buchanan K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was a ratepayer and inhabitant of the Village of St. Louis du Mile End when a fire destroyed his property whilst that muni- cipal corporation held a contract from respondent to supply the inhabitants thereof with water.\nHe sued both the municipal corporation and respondent to recover damages resulting from this destruction of his property by said fire.\nThe municipal corporation was discharged from such claim by the learned trial judge dismissing the action as against it, and no appeal has been taken, but respondent was held liable by said learned judge to the appellant.\nThis judgment against respondent was reversed on appeal to the Court of Review and such reversal has been upheld by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe question raised is the liability of the respondent to a party with whom it never had any contract.\nIt is said that the contract made between respondent and the municipal corporation was made on behalf of each and all of the inhabitants, members of the municipal corporation, and that though technically made with, the corporation must be held to enure to the benefit of the appellant.\nWithout investigating fully the possibility of such a corporation, which is a mere creature of a statute and therefore possessing only such powers of action in way of contracting for itself or others as the statute may have given it, I cannot pass any opinion relative to such possibility.\nI am content thus to indicate what may, on such investigation, be found to be an insurmountable barrier to the possible right of action founded on what may be an unauthorized transaction on the part of the municipal corporation. In the view I take of the contract and the possibility of its founding any such obligation on the respondent to indemnify the appel- lant as claimed, it is quite unnecessary for me to enter upon such an inquiry, much less express an opinion thereupon.\nThe contract provides, in a way that is quite usual, for the respondent supplying to the inhabitants water for domestic and other public purposes for the term of twenty-five years.\nThe necessary powers for executing such purposes are provided by the contract and, its counterpart, a by-law approved by the electors of the municipality; and the frame of the contract as well as the mode of compensation is such as to suggest that there may be created an obligation by the respondent to each of the ratepaying inhabitants for and in respect of which they may have, on default, personal remedies.\nI express no opinion as to that either. All I am concerned with here is to point out that in the contract there clearly seems to be expressed some such purpose or intention on the part of the framers thereof and of the formal parties thereto.\nThere is also in the \u201cMunicipal Code\u201d enabling the village to enter into such a contract much that would suggest that the municipality itself, undertaking the duty of furnishing such a water-supply, would become liable in many ways for its failure to discharge the duties incidental to the execution of such an undertaking.\nBut when we consider its powers and responsibilities in furnishing, if it should undertake to furnish, the needed fire protection, we do not find it so easy to see how it could become thus indirectly an insurer against fire which would give rise to the right of action against it in case of failure sufficiently to execute such a purpose. Though there does seem something possible in way of liability for such supply of good water for domestic purposes there is not, I submit, a shred of reason to impute liability for non-maintenance of pressure of water in case of fire.\nWhen, instead of doing either of these things, the municipal corporation, so constituted, delegated, by way of contract, these privileges and duties to another, surely such considerations, exhibiting the vast differences of law and fact between what is usually involved in the execution of each of such purposes in relation to either of these respective fields of action, must be had in view when we come to the interpretation and construction of such a peculiar contract and have to determine what was the intention of those entering into it.\nIt is by this intention so far as we can gather it from the contents of the instrument and the surrounding circumstances of law and fact existent at its execution, and aiding its interpretation wherein it may be ambiguous, that I think we must be bound.\nThe first article seems only to contemplate the supply of a\ncontinuous and sufficient supply of good, wholesome and drinkable water to the said municipality and its inhabitants, both for public and domestic use.\nHydrants are to be erected at specified distances apart.\nThen, in article 5, we have the following:\u2014\nWater from the said hydrants shall be used only for the extinguishing of fire and the practice of the fire engines, for watering the roads and streets, and the ordinary requirements of the police and fire stations and of the Municipal Hall and generally for all strictly corporation purposes now existing or which may hereafter exist during the term of this agreement, the whole gratuitously, except as provided in this article. And later on we have the article 8, as follows:\u2014\nThe said water works shall at all times, except whenever and so long as absolutely necessary repairs must be made, be of a sufficient capacity to throw upon the flames, in case of fire, from three hydrants simultaneous streams of water from a hose three hundred feet long and two inches and a half in diameter with a one inch nozzle to the height of not less than seventy-five feet.\nIn these features of a very long contract there is to be found all that lends any colour to the contention that there was such a legal relation, contractual or otherwise, constituted between respondent and appellant whereon to found such an action as this.\nI cannot conceive of such a purpose having been within the contemplation of the parties being so expressed.\nIf it was intended that each of the inhabitants was to enjoy such, a right of action one would have expected the parties to such an unusual form of liability or obligation to have expressed it in some form or other.\nSo far from that being the case there is nothing but a capacity in equipment equal to the emergency of supplying, if needed, a pressure of water directed through such equipment.\nIt does not provide for constant pressure of any kind. Are we to read into the contract what it does not contain even as between the parties thereto, and then imply, upon such implication something, which common knowledge of the world and its ways in regard to municipal government, tells us no one ever dreamed of in framing any such like contract?\nGenerally in such like contracts special care is taken specifically to provide for a constant pressure of such degree as agreed upon and, on notice of fire, an adequate increase of pressure measured by the requirements agreed upon.\nThis contract certainly is not a model for any municipality to adopt. And its expressly gratuitous nature and general attitude does not help the appellant.\nWe have had able argument presented in support of the appellant\u2019s claim, but unfortunately the foundation upon which it has of dire necessity to rest is most slender indeed.\nI have for argument\u2019s sake assumed the possibility of a better contract, but any direct contract of this sort with any municipal corporation which does not indicate a clear purpose of its being so framed for the personal benefit of each of the inhabitants that it must give rise to a legal obligation towards each of such persons, must meet with great difficulty of its being so enforced.\nMoreover, there is an express alternative given in case of default which seems of such a restrictive nature as to forbid such action as this.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant bases his right to relief upon the proposition that the respondent company\u2019s covenant contained in the contract between the company and the municipality requiring a specified pressure to be maintained was a covenant exacted by the municipality for the personal benefit of all inhabitants and ratepayers. I think this contention cannot be sustained. The municipal council, of course, in entering into a contract of this description, acts in the interests of the ratepayers if not of the general body of the inhabitants of the municipal district. In a loose sense it may be said to be a trustee for these. But that is a very different thing from saying that every stipulation in the contract in question is intended to create and does create an obligation which is a vinculum juris between the company and every such ratepayer or inhabitant. The conclusion to which I have come is that as regards such a stipulation in question the intention to create such a situation is not sufficiently evidenced and I think there are considerations stated by Lord Cairns in Atkinson v. Newcastle and Gateshead Waterworks Co.[14], at pages 446 and 447, which are sufficient to rebut the existence of any such intention in this case.\nAnglin J.\u2014Assuming in favour of the appellant (plaintiff) three points which are contested by the respondents (defendants), namely, that by its contract with the municipality of St. Louis du Mile End the defendant company undertook to maintain a defined water-pressure for fire purposes, that the part of the municipality in which the plaintiff\u2019s property is situate is within that undertaking, and that it is sufficiently established that failure to maintain such pressure was, in a legal sense, the cause of the loss which the plaintiff sustained, I am nevertheless of the opinion that he cannot recover the damages which he claims in this action.\nAn alternative claim against the municipal corporation was dismissed by the learned trial judge on the grounds that it owed no duty to the plaintiff in regard to the water-service, its powers in that respect being purely facultative, that the plaintiff as a ratepayer was bound by the terms of the contract with the waterworks company which expressly relieved the municipality from all liability for damages arising out of the exercise of the privileges conferred by the contract, and that there was, therefore, no lien de droit, between him and the corporation on which he could found, an action against it. He has acquiesced in this disposition of his suit against the town.\nHe bases his claim against the defendant company on two grounds\u2014breach of contract and tortious dereliction of duty. He asserts that as a ratepayer he is a party to the contract under which the company, in consideration of an exclusive franchise from the municipality, undertook to furnish a supply of water; or that, if he is not a party to it, he is a person for whose advantage that contract was made, that it is within the purview of article 1029 C.C., and that he is entitled to claim the benefit of it and to maintain an action for damages for injury sustained through the defendant\u2019s breach of its provisions. In the alternative he says that by its contract the defendant company undertook a public duty or calling absolute in its character, and that, the company having entered upon the discharge of that duty, breaches of it entailed liability in tort to every individual citizen injured thereby.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim that he is a party to the contract seems to rest chiefly on the fact that it was authorized by a by-law submitted to the votes of the ratepayers. I am by no means satisfied that a municipal corporation has the power under Quebec law to enter into a contract in the name and on behalf of its ratepayers or citizens individually. But if that may be done, the present contract, at all events as to the supply of water for other than domestic purposes, is clearly not of that character. The municipal corporation makes it as principal and \u00f3n its own behalf and not as agent or representative of its ratepayers. The consideration for the franchise granted is expressly stated to be\nthe public benefit to be derived by the said municipality and the taxpayers.\nThe assent of the electors to the authorizing by-law \u2014required because of the obligation imposed on householders to pay rates (art. 637(a) C.M.)\u2014does not, in my opinion, make them parties to the contract, or entitle them to enforce it as privies.\nNo doubt, under the Civil Code in the Province of Quebec (art. 1029) as under the Code Napol\u00e9on in France (art. 1121), provision is made for stipulations in contracts in favour of persons not parties to them but for whose direct benefit such stipulations are intended; and in cases in which it is established that it was meant to confer upon such third parties rights of action in respect to such stipulations, such rights may exist. But every contractual stipulation for the benefit of another (stipulation pour autrui) does not give to that other a right of action to enforce it. Such a right arises only where it was the intention of the parties to the contract to confer it\u2014an intention the existence or non-existence of which must be determined by the interpretation of the contract. Watts Ward et cie. v. Cels[15]. The principle of this arr\u00eat was applied in Allen & Curry Manufacturing Co. v. Shreveport Waterworks Co.[16], to a contract not dissimilar to that now before us in regard to its provisions for fire-pressure. From the fact that fire protection is in the nature of a public service, that it constitutes a branch of the civic administration, that the terms of the present contract, which distinguishes between domestic supply and that for hydrants to be used only for street watering, fire engines and \u201call strictly corporation purposes,\u201d indicate that it was for a service of such a public character that provision in regard to fire-pressure was made, that the municipality was not under any obligation to the inhabitants to furnish fire protection, that it is unlikely that it would seek to impose on a private company undertaking to supply water an obligation of the nature contended for, to which it was not itself subject, that liability to actions at the suit of individuals for every breach of such a contractual undertaking with the municipality would be of such an onerous character that its assumption by the company would be highly improbable\u2014in a word, that there is nothing either in the language of the contract or in the circumstances under which it was entered into to rebut the ordinary presumption that the stipulation of a contracting party is for himself and not for a third person, but, on the contrary, much to indicate that there was no intention on the part of either contracting party to confer on every ratepayer or citizen such a right of action as the plaintiff asserts, I conclude that the stipulations in regard to public hydrants and pressure for fire purposes were not stipulations pour autrui in the sense in which the plaintiff prefers them and that the do not sustain his action.\nWe are referred by counsel, for the appellant to an arr\u00eat of the Belgian Court of Cassation in the case of Ville de Mons v. Robert et cie.[17], cited by Mr. Justice Cross. In that case the municipality of Mons had granted the defendants a franchise for a gas service in consideration of which the latter undertook to furnish at fixed rates a supply of gas to any citizen who should become a subscriber therefor. By demanding from the defendants a supply of gas and either paying or undertaking to pay for it the citizen entered into direct contractual relations with them and the court held that, from such relations, a right of action in his favour would arise: Whatever might be thought of the applicability of this decision had the present case arisen out of failure of the defendant company to furnish water for the domestic requirements of the plaintiff, it is not in point where the default lies in carrying out an undertaking for the benefit of the municipality as a whole, such as that with which we have to deal.\nMr. Justice Cross, in his dissenting judgment, also refers to the case of Wilshire v. Village of St. Louis du Mile End[18], as establishing that the contract now in question created a lien de droit between the plaintiff company and the inhabitants of the municipality individually. There are, no doubt, expressions of opinion to that effect in the judgment and the contract is treated as having been made by the corporation as mandatary of and as representing the ratepayers. But in that case the question was as to liability for failure to furnish to the plaintiff a private supply of water as to which the terms of the contract differ widely from those relating to the supply at public hydrants; the company were not parties to the action, which was brought against the municipality only; and the actual decision in the case is merely that the municipal corporation was under no liability whatever.\nIn presenting his claim as founded in tort, counsel for the appellant relies upon English and American authority. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Guardian Trust and Deposit Co. v. Fisher[19], delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer (White, Peckham and McKenna JJ. dissenting) is, no doubt, a strong authority in the plaintiff\u2019s favour. Negligence in failing to maintain a sufficient supply in its storage tank by a company engaged in furnishing a municipality with water was held to give to a citizen, whose property was injured by fire in consequence of such neglect, a right of action against the company in tort. In England the improper discharge by a municipality of a statutory duty in regard to water supply for fire purposes, amounting to a misfeasance, has been held by the Court of Appeal to impose a like liability. Dawson & Co. v. Bingley Urban District Council[20]. In his judgment Kennedy L.J. discusses the earlier Court of Appeal decision in Atkinson v. Newcastle and Gateshead Waterworks Co.[21], on which the respondents rely. In that case by the provisions of the \u201cWater Works Clauses Act,\u201d incorporated into the company\u2019s undertaking by a private Act, there was created, as the court said, a statutory duty to maintain fire-plugs with a specified supply of water. Of that undertaking there was a breach which occasioned injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property by fire. The court, after pointing out the improbability of Parliament having meant to impose, or of the company having undertaken liability to actions by any number of householders who might happen to have houses burned down in consequence of an insufficient supply of water being furnished, held the company not liable in damages. For certain breaches of the \u201cWater Works Clauses Act\u201d two penalties were imposed, one going wholly to the public treasury, and the other to the prosecutor; for other breaches, of which the failure to supply water was one, the only penalty imposed was for the benefit of the public treasury. No doubt these penalty provisions influenced the construction put by the court upon the statute. But both Lord Chancellor Cairns and Cockburn C.J. attached great importance to the point stated in the following passage from Lord Cairns\u2019 judgment. Referring to Couch v. Steel[22] he says, at page 448:\u2014\nBut I must venture, with great respect to the learned judges who decided that case, and particularly to Lord Campbell, to express grave doubts whether the authorities cited by Lord Campbell justify the broad general proposition that appears to have been there laid down\u2014that, wherever a statutory duty is created, any person, who can shew that he has sustained injuries from the non-performance of that duty, can bring an action for damages against the person on whom the duty is imposed. I cannot but think that that must, to a great extent, depend on the purview of the legislature in the particular statute, and the language which they have there employed, and more especially, when, as here, the Act with which the Court have to deal, is not an act of public and general policy, but is rather in the nature of a private legislative bargain with a body of undertakers as to the manner in which they will keep up certain public works.\nCockburn C.J. dealing with the same point, says, at page 448:\u2014\nNotwithstanding the great respect that I entertain for the judges who decided the case of Couch v. Steel22, I must say that I fully concur with the Lord Chancellor in thinking, that the question, whether that case was rightly decided, is one which is open to very grave doubts. That question, however, is one which it is unnecessary to entertain here, for the present case is clearly distinguishable. The Act of Parliament on which that case turned was a public general Act applicable to all the Queen\u2019s subjects; here we are dealing with certain obligations imposed by the legislature upon a private company, as the conditions upon which Parliament granted them the powers under which they carried out their undertaking: and 1 think that such an Act of Parliament as this is liable to a much more limited and strict interpretation than that which can be put upon one which is applicable to all the subjects of the realm.\nThe language of Lord Cairns just quoted is referred to with approval by the Judicial Committee in Johnston v. Consumers\u2019 Gas Co. of Toronto[23], at pages 454-5. As is pointed out by Chief Baron Palles in Bligh v. Rathangan Drainage Board[24], the right created by the private legislation dealt with in the Atkinson Case[25] was a public right, not a right given to individuals.\nIn the present case we have not even a statutory duty imposed on the defendants by private legislation. Whatever the obligation, it is purely the result of a private contract between the municipal corporation and the water works company. A fortiori it does not give rise to a right of action on the part of the individual citizen, not within the contemplation of the parties. Moreover, as is pointed out by Kennedy L.J. in the Dawson Case[26], it is to be noted that the defendants in the Atkinson Case25 (as here) \u201cwere not a public body but a private company.\u201d Where the cluty is statutory, the liability which it imposes, is to be determined by the intention of the legislature as gathered from the language of the statute; where it is contractual it depends upon the intention of the contracting parties to be gleaned from the contract fairly and reasonably interpreted. Where such an interpretation leads to the conclusion that liability in damages to individuals sustaining injury through non-fulfilment of the obligations undertaken, was not intended by the parties, no such liability exists under English law. Such appears to be the only proper conclusion to be drawn from the statement of Lord Cairns indorsed by Lord Macnaghten speaking for the Judicial Committee.\nWhile I fully recognize the weight which should be attached to the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Guardian Trust and Deposit Co. v. Fisher[27], English authority appears to be adverse to the appellant\u2019s claim. Moreover, the great majority of the American courts seem to hold the view which obtains in England. See cases collected in Dillon\u2019s Municipal Corporations (5 ed.), vol. 3, sec. 1340, p. 2303. See also Cunningham v. Furniss[28].\nIn order to establish that the defendant\u2019s failure to maintain the fire-pressure stipulated in its contract was illicit, and therefore delictual within the purview of article 1053 C.C., Mr. Justice Cross treats it as falling under clause (b) of section 499 of the Criminal Code. Assuming in favour of the plaintiff that conduct declared criminal by clause (b) would render the defendants civilly liable to individual citizens for consequential injuries sustained by them although such liability was not contemplated by the contract, in the present instance a case within that provision of the Criminal Code has not been made out. I doubt whether it has been established that the failure to maintain the agreed fire-pressure in the neighbourhood was \u201cwilful\u201d on the part of the defendants within the meaning of that term as used in clause (b). But if it has, their contract was for a supply of water to the town and its inhabitants as a whole, not to \u201ca part thereof\u201d; and there is no evidence that the defendants broke their contract, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that, in consequence, the inhabitants of the town would be deprived wholly or to a great extent of their supply of water. For aught that appears to the contrary the use of the regulating valve, of which the plaintiff complains, may have been in the general interest of the municipality and its inhabitants. The curtailing of the water supply in a limited district may have been on the whole beneficial. Its purpose may have been to prevent a large majority of the inhabitants of the town being deprived to a great extent of their supply of water. If bringing the defendants\u2019 conduct within clause (b) of section 499 would entail their civil liability to the plaintiff as an inhabitant of the Town of St. Louis, the record does not contain evidence which would establish such criminal responsibility. Moreover, a breach of section 499 is not alleged in the declaration and the case does not appear to have been tried on the footing that such an issue was involved. It is not even hinted at in the judgment of the trial judge or in the opinions delivered in the Court of Review. Had that issue been presented at the trial, it is not possible to say what evidence might have been adduced to meet it. It is too late to raise such a ground for the first time in appeal and it would be manifestly unfair to the defendants to make it the turning point of the case.\nI have found no authority indicating that a contractor in the situation of the defendant company with regard to the water supply for fire-purposes would be liable under the civil law for delict or quasidelict arising out of the non-fulfilment of his contractual obligations where such liability would not exist in an action of tort under English law. Liability cannot, I think, extend beyond what was in contemplation of the parties when the obligation was undertaken. The nature and extent of the obligation and the persons to whom the duties are owed to which it gives rise depend upon the terms of the contract fairly and reasonably interpreted. To subject the contractor to a greater burden, whether the claim against him is founded in contract or in tort, since it necessarily exists only by reason of the contract, would seem to be contrary to the spirit, if not to the letter, of articles 1074 and 1075 C.C.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J. (dissident).\u2014En vertu des dispositions du code municipal (arts. 637 et suivants) toute corporation a le droit d\u2019accorder \u00e0 une compagnie le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de construire un aqueduc et d\u2019effectuer avec elle un contrat pour l\u2019approvisionnement de l\u2019eau dans la municipalit\u00e9.\nLa corporation du Village du Mile End a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par un r\u00e8glement adopt\u00e9 par son conseil municipal et approuv\u00e9 par les contribuables, \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la compagnie intim\u00e9e le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de poser un aqueduc dans les limites de son territoire, pourvu que, moyennant une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sp\u00e9ciale qui lui serait pay\u00e9e directement par les contribuables, la compagnie leur fournisse de l\u2019eau pour les besoins domestiques.\nLe r\u00e8glement d\u00e9clarait en outre que la compagnie devait poser des bornes-fontaines \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents endroits et elle devait s\u2019obliger de toujours y maintenir une certaine pression d\u2019eau.\nLa compagnie intim\u00e9e, sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du contrat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par elle et la corporation le 12 f\u00e9vrier, 1891, a construit son aqueduc et a fourni l\u2019eau aux contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9, et notamment \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en cette cause, qui lui a donn\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de lui payer en vertu du r\u00e8glement et du contrat.\nMais la compagnie ne para\u00eet pas avoir observ\u00e9 son obligation quant \u00e0 la pression de l\u2019eau; car, \u00e0 diverses reprises, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 protest\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet par la corporation.\nLe 26 septembre, 1906, un incendie s\u2019est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans une cour voisine de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant. Les pompiers furent imm\u00e9diatement appel\u00e9s; ils se mirent \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre pour \u00e9teindre le feu; mais malheureusement la pression d\u2019eau \u00e9tant insuffisante, l\u2019incendie s\u2019est \u00e9tendu et a atteint en d\u00e9finitive la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur appelant et Ta d\u00e9truite de fond en comble.\nIl poursuit maintenant la compagnie en dommages et r\u00e9clame la valeur de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de ses effets qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits dans cet incendie.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l\u2019Honorable Juge Curran, a maintenu son action et lui a accord\u00e9 une somme de $16,712.\nLa cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant la cour de revision, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par les Honorables Juges Pagnuelo, Charbonneau et Dunlop. Le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9e par les Honorables Juges Charbonneau et Dunlop, l\u2019Honorable Juge Pagnuelo ayant pris sa retraite quelque temps avant que jugement fut rendu par la cour de revision. Des notes qu\u2019il a laiss\u00e9s au dossier, font pr\u00e9sumer cependant qu\u2019il favorisait les pr\u00e9tentions du demandeur.\nLa cour d\u2019appel a maintenu le jugement de la cour de revision, et a, par cons\u00e9quent, renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019action du demandeur, MM. les Juges Trenholme et Cross \u00e9tant dissidents.\nIl est incontestable que les dommages soufferts par l\u2019appelant auraient pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9s si la pression d\u2019eau stipul\u00e9e dans le r\u00e8glement et dans le contrat avait exist\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019incendie a commenc\u00e9. Nous avons alors \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la compagnie doit \u00eatre tenue responsable de ces dommages.\nSon obligation contractuelle est bien d\u00e9finie dans le r\u00e8glement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par la corporation et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite incorpor\u00e9 dans le contrat lui-m\u00eame du 12 f\u00e9vrier, 1891.\nMais on dit:\u2014Le demandeur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 ce contrat et la stipulation, quant \u00e0 la pression d\u2019eau, ne peut lui donner le droit de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir comme obligation contractuelle.\nIl ne faut pas perdre de vue cependant le fait que ce contrat, quoique pass\u00e9 entre la corporation municipale et la compagnie, \u00e9tablissait un lien de droit et donnait lieu \u00e0 des relations l\u00e9gales entre le demandeur appelant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e quant \u00e0 l\u2019approvisionnement de l\u2019eau pour des fins domestiques. C\u2019est ce que la cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es dans une cause de Wilshire v. Village of St. Louis[29].\nNotre article 1029 du Code Civil d\u00e9clare:\u2014\nOn peut pareillement stipuler au profit d\u2019un tiers lorsque telle est la condition d\u2019un contrat que l\u2019on fait pour soi-m\u00eame ou d\u2019une donation que l\u2019on fait \u00e0 un autre. Celui qui fait cette stipulation ne peut plus la r\u00e9voquer si le tiers a signifi\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019en profiter.\nCe principe de droit qu\u2019on peut stipuler pour un tiers n\u2019est pas reconnu dans le droit anglais; et alors il est excessivement dangereux de d\u00e9cider une cause comme celle-ci \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence de l\u2019Angleterre.\nDu moment que le demandeur commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse le prix convenu pour l\u2019eau qui lui \u00e9tait fournie, un lien de droit se formait non seulement pour l\u2019eau n\u00e9cessaire aux fins domestiques, mais aussi pour l\u2019eau qui pouvait \u00eatre requise en cas d\u2019incendie. Nous avons la compagnie qui \u00e9tait, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re du prix, et, de l\u2019autre, d\u00e9bitrice de l\u2019obligation de fournir l\u2019eau pour les deux fins mentionn\u00e9es, au contrat.\nIl est bien vrai qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de montant sp\u00e9cifiquement mentionn\u00e9 que le contribuable devra payer pour l\u2019eau qui lui sera fournie en cas d\u2019incendie; mais que cette obligation de la part de la compagnie r\u00e9sulte soit du privil\u00e8ge exclusif qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9, soit du montant qu\u2019elle a le droit de percevoir de tous les contribuables pour l\u2019eau qu\u2019elle leur fournit pour des fins domestiques, elle s\u2019est tout de m\u00eame oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir l\u2019ea;u en cas d\u2019incendie et de maintenir une certaine pression et, par cons\u00e9quent, cette stipulation faite en faveur du contribuable donne certainement \u00e0 ce dernier un droit d\u2019action.\nCe droit d\u2019action, la compagnie ne nie\u2019 pas qu\u2019il existe au cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agirait de son obligation de fournir l\u2019eau pour des fins priv\u00e9es; mais elle pr\u00e9tend que quant \u00e0 l\u2019eau qu\u2019elle est oblig\u00e9e de fournir pour des fins publiques, comme dans le cas actuel, il n\u2019y a pas, pour le contribuable, de droit de poursuite.\nJe suis incapable de trouver une distinction entre les deux. Je consid\u00e8re que le droit d\u2019action existe dans les deux cas et que si la corporation fait d\u00e9faut de donner la pression n\u00e9cessaire, elle engage sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nCette question de savoir si un contribuable peut poursuivre une compagnie est venue dans une cause rapport\u00e9e dans Sirey, 89-4-9 et Journal du Palais, 1889-4-17; et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la Cour de Cassation de Belgique que\u2014\nLa ville qui a fait un trait\u00e9 avec un entrepreneur pour l\u2019\u00e9clairage public et priv\u00e9, a qualit\u00e9 pour faire reconna\u00eetre en justice les droits r\u00e9sultant de la dite convention au profit des habitants abonn\u00e9s, lesquels, de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9, ont individuellement le droit d\u2019exiger de Ventrepreneur l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des stipulations faits \u00e0 leur profit.\nMais il y a plus dans le cas actuel.\nJe consid\u00e8re que la compagnie intim\u00e9e a commis non seulement une faute contractuelle, mais une faute d\u00e9lictuelle et qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 du Code Civil elle doit indemniser le demandeur\u2014\nToute personne (dit l\u2019article 1053) est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilit\u00e9.\nQu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une faute? C\u2019est\u2019tout ce qui blesse injustement le droit d\u2019autrui en faisant une chose qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas le droit de faire, ou bien encore c\u2019est quand on omet de faire soit des actes prescrits par la loi ou soit des actes que les rapports n\u00e9cessaires des hommes consid\u00e8rent comme obligatoires.\nDu moment que la loi prohibe une chose elle devient illicite et constitue un d\u00e9lit. Ainsi nos lois criminelles ou p\u00e9nales qualifient tel acte de faute. Or, du moment que cet acte cause des dommages, il donne lieu \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration civile. Laurent, vol. 20, No. 402, dit:\u2014\nQue les faits punis par une loi p\u00e9nale soient des faits illicites, cela va sans dire; toute infraction est donc un d\u00e9lit civil pourvu qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte un dommage.\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il y a beaucoup d\u2019actes qui blessent les principes de la morale, mars qui cependant n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement qualifi\u00e9s de d\u00e9lictueux par nos lois. Ces faits cependant constituent des fautes dont l\u2019article 1053 nous charge \u00e9galement de faire l\u2019application.\nNous d\u00e9clarons constamment coupable de n\u00e9gligence l\u2019industriel qui n\u00e9glige de couvrir ses machineries. La loi ne dit pas formellement qu\u2019il engagera sa responsabilit\u00e9 en ne remplissant pas cette obligation statutaire. D\u2019ordinaire elle se contente de lui imposer une amende. Mais les tribunaux civils, appel\u00e9s \u00e0 appliquer l\u2019article 1053 de notre code, trouvent dans cette n\u00e9gligence de couvrir ses machines la faute que cet article exige pour d\u00e9terminer la responsabilit\u00e9.\nDans le cas actuel, nous avons la corporation municipale qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te, sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la loi, que la compagnie intim\u00e9e ne pourra fournir de l\u2019eau qu\u2019\u00e0 telle et telle condition. Cette derni\u00e8re re\u00e7oit le privil\u00e8ge exclusif de poser un aqueduc dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9. Mais en retour elle contracte l\u2019obligation de fournir pour \u00e9teindre les incendies une certaine pression d\u2019eau. Son obligation rev\u00eat un caract\u00e8re public. Que le contribuable le veuille ou ne le veuille pas, il est oblig\u00e9 de payer cette compagnie pour l\u2019eau qui lui est fournie pour des fins domestiques. Il y a l\u00e0 pour le contribuable une obligation statutaire qui lui est impos\u00e9e. Est-ce que les obligations corr\u00e9latives de la compagnie ne sont pas \u00e9galement d\u2019une nature publique? Le Code Criminel, d\u2019ailleurs, r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette question par son article 499 qui dit que\ntoute compagnie qui * * * s\u2019\u00e9tant charg\u00e9e d\u2019approvisionner quelque cit\u00e9 ou localit\u00e9 * * * d\u2019eau, de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 viole un contrat * * * sachant ou ayant raison de croire que les cons\u00e9quences probables de son acte peuvent \u00eatre de priver les habitants de cette cit\u00e9 ou localit\u00e9 * * * totalement ou en grande partie de leur approvisionnement d\u2019eau, est passible d\u2019une amende.\nIl y avait donc faute pour la compagnie intim\u00e9e en violant son contrat; et elle a sciemment viol\u00e9 son contrat, car elle en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9e par la corporation et on lui avait intim\u00e9 que les cons\u00e9quences probables de sa n\u00e9gligence pouvaient priver les habitants du Mile End de la protection qu\u2019ils avaient le droit d\u2019attendre en cas d\u2019incendie.\nJe suis donc arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il s\u2019est form\u00e9 un lien de droit entre le demandeur et la d\u00e9fenderesse et qu\u2019en vertue de ce lien de droit le demandeur a un droit d\u2019action contre la d\u00e9fenderesse r\u00e9sultant de cette obligation contractuelle.\nMais, en outre, la d\u00e9fenderesse s\u2019est rendue coupable de faute d\u00e9lictuelle en ne remplissant pas son contrat. Suivant les dispositions des articles 1065 et 1053 du Code Civil, elle est responsable du dommage souffert par le demandeur. Le jugement a quo devrait \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures et celui de la cour sup\u00e9rieure confirm\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Monty & Duranleau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: White & Buchanan.\n[1] Q.R. 22 K.B. 487.\n[2] Q.R. 41 S.C. 348.\n[3] Q.R. 6 Q.B. 107.\n[4] Q.R. 8 Q.E. 479.\n[5] [1908] 1 K.B. 917.\n[6] 46 L.J.

Champion and Another (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe World Building Company and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1914: October 16; 1914: November 30.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nOn Appeal From The Court Of Appeal For British Columbia.\nAppeal\u2014Case originating in Superior Court\u2014Supreme Court Act, s. 37(b)\u2014Concurrent jurisdiction\u2014\"Mechanics' Lien Act\" (B.C.)\u2014Action to enforce lien.\nFor an appeal to lie to the Supreme Court in a case not originating in a superior court, as provided in sec. 37, sub-sec. (b) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" it is not sufficient that the inferior court has concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court in respect to its general jurisdiction; there must be concurrent jurisdiction as respects the particular action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding in which the appeal is sought.\nIn British Columbia the County Court alone may maintain an action to enforce a mechanic's lien. In such action, so far as the parties or any of them stand in the relation of debton and creditor, the court may give judgment for the debt due whatever its amount and if it exceeds $250 there may be an appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that though an action for the debt could be brought in the Supreme Court the foundation for the County Court action is the enforcement of the lien as to which there is no concurrent jurisdiction and no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in such an action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] dismissing an appeal and cross- appeal from the judgment of Grant Co. J. in the County Court[2].\nThe plaintiffs, contractors for constructing a building for the defendants the World Building Co. having obtained the architect's certificate for $6,000 while the work was in progress, filed a lien against the property and brought action in the County Court to enforce it. When the work was finished they filed another lien for the balance claimed and brought a second action. The actions were consolidated.\nBy the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" of British Columbia the action to enforce a lien must be brought in the County Court and on the trial the court may give judgment for the amount found due even if it exceeds the jurisdiction given in an ordinary action. In these cases judgment was given for the plaintiffs for the $6,000 claimed in the first action and the second action was dismissed on the ground that there was no architect's certificate covering the amount claimed therein. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal for the amount so refused and the defendants cross-appealed for dismissal of the first action. Both appeals were dismissed and both parties appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChristopher C. Robinson moved to quash the appeal of the plaintiffs for want of jurisdiction.\nLafleur K.C. contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an application to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.\nThe action was brought in the County Court to en- force a mechanics' lien under the Act R.S.B.C. (1911), ch. 154. To that claim was joined a demand for a personal condemnation in a sum exceeding the ordinary jurisdiction of the court. It is admitted that in such an action the jurisdiction of the County Court is exclusive. The Act also provides, section 34, that in so far as the parties before the court are debtor and creditor the court may give judgment for\nthe sum actually found to be due notwithstanding such sum may exceed the ordinary jurisdiction of the County Court.\nThe question is not free from difficulty, but on the whole I am of the opinion that the claim to enforce the mechanic's lien in such an action as this is the foundation of the jurisdiction of the County Court, and it is by reason and as a consequence of the existence of that lien that the County Court has jurisdiction to deal with the personal obligation of the defendant. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the other hand is dependent merely upon the amount of the indebtedness or liability and in that respect is exclusive. So that in so far as the action seeks the enforcement of the mechanic's lien the jurisdiction of the County Court is exclusive, and in so far as it is a personal claim the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be exclusive were it not for the statute which confers upon the County Court a special jurisdiction in this particular case.\nI read the statute as conferring jurisdiction upon the County Court to give judgment upon the personal claim merely in so far as it is incidental to the enforcement of the mechanics' lien. In that view I come to the conclusion with much hesitation because of the dissent of Duff J. that the jurisdiction is not concur- rent and that the application must be granted with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014A motion to quash this appeal was made and argued before us by Mr. Robinson on the ground that this action was one originating in the County Court of British Columbia under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act,\" and that in such actions the jurisdiction of the County Court was exclusive and not concurrent with the Supreme Court of that province.\nOur jurisdiction to hear appeals not originating in a Superior Court is defined in section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and an appellant must, of course, bring himself within that section in order to justify his appeal.\nThe two conditions necessary to give us jurisdiction are first that \"the sum or value of the matter in dispute\" should amount to $250 or upwards; and, secondly, that the court of first instance, in the present case the County Court, should possess concurrent jurisdiction with a Supreme Court.\nThe amount in dispute is large, several thousands of dollars, and it is contended that so far as defendants' personal liability is concerned there is concurrent jurisdiction in both courts.\nIn one sense that may be true, because as an incident to successfully maintaining his action for a lien the County Court must adjudge the amount for which the lien shall be declared to exist or apply and the Supreme Court of the province had, apart from the lien, undoubted jurisdiction in a personal action for any amount.\nBut it seems to me that the true construction of section 37 of the Act establishing this court is that the \"concurrent jurisdiction\" there spoken of as essential to our entertaining an appeal is one in all the essentials of the action.\nNow this action is one for a lien for whatever amount might be found due the plaintiff. The County Court possessed exclusive jurisdiction under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" to entertain such an action. The determination of the amount for which the lien was to stand was no doubt a most important incident in the action and by section 35 of that Act an appeal was given from the County Court judge where the judgment exceeded $250, as in ordinary cases to the appeal court of the province.\nBy virtue of this appeal the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over the whole case and may deliver the judgment which the County Court judge should have given. But such an appellate jurisdiction does not interfere in any way with the exclusive jurisdiction of the County Court over the lien action up to the time of the appeal.\nThe essential ingredient therefore necessary to give an appeal to this court is wanting, namely, the possession by a superior court of jurisdiction concurrent with the County Court in suits to give effect to mechanics' liens.\nI think the motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014These suits were instituted under the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" in a County Court in British Columbia to enforce an alleged mechanic's lien under the said Act. The 34th section of that Act is as follows:\u2014\n34. Upon the hearing of any claim for a lien, the court or judge may, so far as the parties before him, or any of them, are debtor and creditor, give judgment against the former in favour of the latter for any indebtedness or liability arising out of the claim, in the same manner as if such indebtedness or liability had been sued upon in the County Court in the ordinary way, without reference to this Act.\nAnd judgment may be given for the sum actually due, notwithstanding such sum may exceed the ordinary jurisdiction of the County Court.\nThe County Court gave judgment for the sum of $6,000 against the respondent and also declared the plaintiffs entitled to a mechanic's lien to secure said sum and costs in one of the actions now before us but dismissed the other action and a cross action.\nThereupon appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal with costs.\nThe appellants appeal from that judgment to this court and respondents move to quash the appeal on the ground that the appeal cannot fall within section 37, sub-sec. (b) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which is as follows:\u2014\n(b) In the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, if the sum or value of the matter in dispute amounts to two hundred and fifty dollars or upwards, and in which the court of first instance possesses concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court.\nThe question thus raised turns upon the meaning of the phrase:\u2014\nIn which the court of first instance possesses concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court.\nIt occurs to me that in every case one can think of the superior court would have jurisdiction to hear and try the causes within the general jurisdiction of the County Court and thus in a sense they have con- current jurisdiction in all cases falling within the general jurisdiction of the County Court.\nIt happens that when a suitor goes into the superior court with a claim suable in a County Court he is in some cases punished by deprivation of costs for so doing, but that does not deprive the superior court of jurisdiction even if the County Court has jurisdiction.\nIt would seem that this sort of concurrent jurisdiction limited to claims over $250 was what was prima facie aimed at in the 37th section of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThen we find two special subjects in probate and equitable jurisdiction assigned to the County Courts, but in the delimitation of the nature of the actions these courts may so entertain they are specially declared to have as to such actions concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court of the province.\nWhen we turn to the \"County Courts Act\" we find in the 40th section thereof the following:\u2014\n40. The said County Courts shall also respectively have and exercise, concurrently with the Supreme Court, all the power and authority of the Supreme Court in the actions or matters hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\u2014\nThis is followed by twelve sub-sections defining a great many classes of matters and suits in respect thereof to be dealt with thereunder.\nA mechanics' lien is not one of these. There is in sub-section (3) the following:\u2014\n(3) In all suits for foreclosure or redemption, or for enforcing any charge or lien, where the mortgage, charge, or lien shall not exceed in amount the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars.\nThe words \"or lien\" so used do not imply a mechanics' lien I imagine. And if they did it would only be one up to $2,500, which would not help in this case to give jurisdiction here. Then we have section 34 of the \"Mechanics' Lien Act,\" which is quoted above and shews clearly a special jurisdiction not falling within the general jurisdiction of the County Court or within this sub-section (3) or related thereto in any way.\nI think we must conclude that this special jurisdiction not expressly designated as are others \"concurrent\" was not intended to be a concurrent jurisdiction or what was aimed at in section 37, sub-sec. (b) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as being an exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction.\nThe power to award a judgment for the debt forms a mere incident to the creation of a special jurisdiction or mode of procedure to be followed out thereunder and not otherwise, but confined within the provision of the Act giving same.\nOnly such appeals as the special jurisdiction and remedy given permit can be availed of by those resorting thereto for the benefits to be got by invoking same.\nI think the point well taken and that the motion ought\/to prevail with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014Section 34 of the \"Mechanics' Lien Act\" (R.S.B.C., ch. 154), is as follows:\u2014\nUpon the hearing of any claim for a lien, the court or judge may, so far as the parties before him, or any of them, are debtor and creditor, give judgment against the former in favour of the latter for any indebtedness or liability arising out of the claim, in the same manner as if such indebtedness or liability had been sued upon in the County Court in the ordinary way, without reference to this Act.\nAnd judgment may be given for the sum actually due, notwithstanding such sum may exceed the ordinary jurisdiction of the County Court.\nThe effect of this section is that a plaintiff suing to enforce a mechanics' lien may at the same time, and under the same summons, proceed with his action to enforce the pecuniary obligations in personam arising out of the contract express or implied upon which his claim to a mechanics' lien is based. It is a condition of the jurisdiction of the County Court that the \"indebtedness or liability\" thus sought to be enforced should arise \"out of the claim\" which is alleged to be the foundation of the mechanics' lien; but, the conditions being satisfied, the jurisdiction, having once arisen, is a jurisdiction concurrent with that of the Supreme Court in respect of the like action.\nHere we seem clearly enough to have a case in which the \"court of first instance possesses concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court\" within the meaning of section 37 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nANGLIN J..\u2014The plaintiffs sued in the County Court of Vancouver to recover the sum of $9,930 and for the establishment and enforcement of a mechanics' lien in respect thereof. Jurisdiction to entertain such an action is conferred on the County Courts of British Columbia by the R.S.B.C. (1911), chapter 154. Judgment was awarded the plaintiffs for $6,000, for which they were declared entitled to a lien. An appeal by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal to have the amount of the judgment increased and a cross-appeal by the defendants to have the action dismissed were both unsuccessful. The plaintiffs have taken a further similar appeal to this court, and the defendants a like cross-appeal. The defendants now move to quash the plaintiffs' appeal for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiffs assert that they have a right of appeal under section 37 (b) of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which is as follows:\u2014 37. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, where the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding has not originated in a superior court, in the following cases:\u2014\n(b) In the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, if the sum or value of the matter in dispute amounts to two hundred and fifty dollars or upwards, and in which the court of first instance possesses concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court.\nNotwithstanding the awkward grammatical construction of clause (b), I think it reasonably clear that the antecedent of the relative pronoun \"which\" in its concluding member is \"the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding\" mentioned in the earlier part of the section. That this is the correct construction of the clause is made certain by comparison with the French version, in which the concluding member reads\net si la cour de premi\u00e8re instance poss\u00e8de une juridiction concurrente avec celle d'une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nIn order that there should be jurisdiction in this court under section 37 (b) \"the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding\" instituted in the inferior court must also be within the jurisdiction of a superior court in the province. It does not suffice that in respect to some part of an action, some claim made in it, or some relief which may be accorded there is concurrent jurisdiction in both the superior and inferior courts. The jurisdiction must be concurrent over the action as a whole.\nIn the present instance the jurisdiction of the inferior court is exclusive as to the claim of mechanics' lien. It is the existence of this claim which is the foundation of the County Court jurisdiction. It is only as incidental to an action in which such a claim is asserted that the County Court is given an extended personal jurisdiction. I am convinced that in a mechanics' lien action, which the superior court could not entertain, the County Court cannot be said to possess concurrent jurisdiction with the superior court merely because in such an action the former court may give a personal judgment for debt which could have been, and must have been, sought in the superior court, if sued for alone.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the motion to quash should be granted with costs.\nI find nothing, however, to warrant the view suggested that jurisdiction under section 37 (b) is confined to cases in which the jurisdiction of the inferior court is explicitly declared, either by the statute conferring it or by some other statutory provision, to be concurrent with that of a superior court. Clause (b) applies to four provinces. The introduction into it of such a limitation would probably preclude an appeal in many cases in which it was intended that the right should exist.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacNeill, Bird, Mac-donald & Darling.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The World Building Co.: Bourne & Macdonald.\nSolicitors for other respondents: Bodwell, Lawson & Lane.\n[1] 6 West.

Employers' Liability Act\"\u2014Pleading\u2014Practice\u2014Charge to jury\u2014New trial.\nTo afford protection to workmen about to be employed on a ledge below, several of them, including the plaintiff, were directed by the defendants' foreman to clear loose rocks from the hillside and form a berm above the place where the work was to be done. The clearing was imperfectly performed, although the foreman was informed by some of the men that \"it was all right.\" While plaintiff was at work on the lower ledge he was struck by rocks, which rolled down the hillside, fell over the cliff and sustained injuries for which he brought action to recover damages under the British Columbia \"Employers' Liability Act\" and at common law. It appeared from the evidence that it was customary to clear off such inclines or to erect pentices or barriers for the protection of the workmen on lower ledges, but not to do both, and there was evidence that on this hillside barriers were unnecessary and might be dangerous. At the trial the jury found that the defendants had been negligent \"in not sufficiently clearing the face of the incline and placing barriers to prevent rolling stones and other debris from causing injury to the employees,\" and judgment was entered for the plaintiff. By the judgment appealed from (17 B.C. Rep. 443) the Court of Appeal dismissed the action, holding that the cause of the injury was the failure to clear the hillside sufficiently, which was due to the fault of the plaintiff and his fellow workmen. Held, that, having regard to the character of the work in which the plaintiff was engaged when injured, the employers' duty to provide reasonable protection for him could properly be delegated to a competent superintendent or foreman (furnished with adequate materials and resources), whose negligence would not render the employer liable at common law. Wilson v. Merry (L.R. 1 H.L. (Sc.) 326), applied. Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall (42 Can. S.C.R. 420), and Brooks, Scanlon, O'Brien Co. v. Fakkema (44 Can. S.C.R. 412), distinguished.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J.\u2014On the evidence, failure to clear the face of the incline sufficiently was due either (and most probably) to the negligence of the plaintiff and the workmen engaged with him or to that of the foreman and, consequently, a judgment against the defendants at common law was not justified. The finding that the omission to place barriers above the men working on the lower ledge was negligence is not supported by the evidence; if it were, such negligence would be that of the superintendent. The trial proceeded on the assumption that the works were in charge of a competent superintendent and foreman, having discretion and means to furnish all reasonable safeguards, and an admission to that effect was made at bar on the hearing of the appeal-consequently, the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The findings of the jury were sufficiently supported by evidence and warranted a judgment at common law.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The defendants were bound to allege and prove that they had delegated to a competent person the duty of providing proper safeguards and had furnished him with the means of doing so.\nPer Duff J.\u2014There was evidence upon which the jury might have found that the duty of providing proper safeguards had been entrusted to a competent person provided with the necessary means of doing so, but this was not admitted and the failure of the trial judge to leave this question to the jury caused a mistrial.\nIn the result a new trial was ordered, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment entered on the verdict of the jury at the trial, by Cle- ment J., and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head\u2014note and the questions at issue on the present appeal are set out in the judgments now reported.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nSir Charles-Hibbert Tupper K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting):\u2014 I think we must accept the finding of facts by the jury which is as follows:\u2014\nThe Foreman: Owing to the dangerous nature of the work, we, the jury, consider the defendant company guilty of negligence in not sufficiently clearing the face of the incline and putting in place barriers to prevent rolling stones and other debris from causing injury to the employees.\nAnd we further consider that the plaintiff is entitled to $5,500 damages or compensation.\nThe decision in Priestly v. Fowler[2] did not abrogate the common law obligation resting upon the master in regard to the protection of his servant.\nThe result of that case as developed in the case of Wilson v. Merry[3], and at page 332, as stated by Lord Cairns, is to put the limitation upon that obligation, which appears as follows:\u2014\nBut what the master is, in my opinion, bound to his servant to do, in the event of his not personally superintending and directing the work, is to select proper and competent persons to do so, and to furnish them with adequate materials and resources for the work. When he has done this he has, in my opinion, done all that he is bound to do. And if the persons so selected are guilty of negligence this is not the negligence of the master; and if an accident occurs to a workman to-day in consequence of the negligence of another workman, skilful and competent, who was formerly, but is no longer in the employment of the master, the master is, in my opinion, not liable, although the two workmen cannot technically be described as fellow workmen.\nThere is in the above verdict a finding which possibly relates to what may have been the negligence of a fellow servant. The appellant seems to have been subject to the direction of different people as occasion might arise. One of these was the foreman, Fraser, with whom on one occasion he was engaged in clearing the part of the bluff which all seem agreed needed looking after from time to time.\nNow if it had been demonstrated beyond peradventure that the work done under Fraser or omitted to be done by his directions had been the cause of the accident it might well be argued that the negligence in question was that of a fellow servant.\nBut as I understand the jury they do not necessarily find so and do find that even if the fellow servant was negligent the damages therefrom would have been averted if there had been barriers to prevent even rolling stones and other debris from causing injury. We must bear in mind the evidence and charge of the learned trial judge in reading this verdict.\nI cannot understand how, if that obligation to erect such barriers rested upon respondent and had not been observed, it can be absolved from the consequences of neglect thereof. The utmost that can be said in such case is that the respondent and its foreman were joint tort-feasors.\nThe respondent has neither pleaded nor proved that it fell within the limitation of its liability as defined by Lord Cairns. The statement of defence in paragraph 16 sets up the defence that the injuries in question were caused by the negligence of\nfellow servants of the plaintiff engaged in common employment, to wit: The servants mentioned in the statement of claim, together with the plaintiff, neglected to properly clear off a certain hill above the place where the plaintiff was working at the time of the accident.\nThe 17th paragraph of the defence proceeds in a more elaborate manner to set forth the steps taken by Fraser, the foreman, and his men, including plaintiff, to clear the face of the hill above the spot where plaintiff and others were at the time of the accident engaged in drilling and the duty to render same safe thereby and then alleges that if, which is denied, the accident was caused by any substance, rock, gravel, stones or earth falling upon the plaintiff it was wholly due to the\nneglect of plaintiff and his fellow workmen engaged in a common employment in omitting to take the necessary precautions so that the face of the hill above the ledge aforesaid where the plaintiff was working at the time of the said accident, was clear of all the above material and not otherwise.\nHow can this be said in any sense to answer the neglect to place the proper barriers protecting against such falling material reaching the plaintiff and others, which the statement of claim had alleged as neglect.\nIt is quite obvious that the neglect of the superintendent or manager or of respondent was nowhere pointed at either by express language or implication in these paragraphs.\nThere is nothing anywhere pleaded to answer the charge of neglect to erect a proper barrier save by the general denial of neglect which still left the onus of exoneration from prima facie liability on respondent. Particulars of the neglect involved in paragraphs 16 and 17 were demanded and answered by delivery of so-called particulars alleging that they were as stated in paragraph 17 of the defence.\nSuch being the pleading what is there in evidence to exonerate the respondent by the limitations laid down by Lord Cairns as above?\nThere is absolutely nothing save such inference as may be drawn from an engineer describing himself as manager. There is not a word to explain what was the extent of the authority given him by respondent. Where and what were \"the adequate material and resources\" placed at his command? How could the jury say he was so furnished? How can we say so in the absence of all evidence on that score?\nIn one way of looking at such a matter the word \"manager\" and the control of men which he explains might justify the inference of authority to incur a trifling expense such as involved in some of the suggestions made by counsel, but the manager himself and others say these minor expedients in the way of a barrier would be worse than useless. That does not help the respondent in making out a defence.\nThere is evidence to the contrary also. But there is clear evidence that to effect an efficient protection by building the necessary barrier would involve an expense beyond the ordinary expenditure such as may necessarily be implied in the authority of a manager.\nAnd there is evidence that only by such an erection could the adequate protection, found by the jury to be necessary, have been effectively provided.\nI cannot close my review in this aspect of the case without quoting the evidence of Mr. McDonald, a con- tractor of wide experience, called for respondent in rebuttal. He says as follows:\u2014\nA.\u2014And you say, if water is coming down it would be too expensive to remove all this earth and stones, and I understood you to say to Mr. Griffin that some extra precaution in the way of barriers could be erected?\nA.\u2014No, I did not say that.\nQ.\u2014Do you say it cannot?\nA.\u2014I said, if material was liable to be started rolling through natural causes up above that there might be something done in the way of extra precautions.\nQ.\u2014Yes, exactly. And you, of course, as a railroad contractor yourself, you have to provide against accidents?\nA.\u2014We do all we can.\nQ.\u2014And always, of course, with your eyes to expenses?\nA.\u2014With an eye primarily to the safety of the men.\nQ.\u2014But I say, also with an eye to the expenses?\nA.\u2014Exactly, that is a factor.\nQ.\u2014And you, as a large railway contractor, such as you are, have a good many damage actions to contend with?\nA.\u2014We do not have actions, we settle them all.\nThere is evidence of water coming down at times and of other causes of disturbance from which it may be inferred even if clearing done as well as Fraser says might well account for the accident and the need of a barrier. The reasons or excuses, given for none, were for the jury to consider.\nI am not concerned with determining the question one way or another. I only desire to point out what a wide field of evidence there was before the jury bearing upon the subject and how it was quite competent for them to have reached the conclusion they did.\nPrima facie in a dangerous work there is an obligation resting upon the master to take due care for the protection and safety of his workmen and until that is discharged either by taking the due care needed or in the manner already pointed out by furnishing adequate material and resources as well as a competent manager, he must be held liable for negligence. It does not appear to me that in this case the obligation has been discharged in either way by respondent.\nI need not dwell upon the decisions in this court. I do not think it is necessary for the purposes of this peculiar case to go as far as some of these decisions have apparently gone. Nor do I deem it necessary to define what may and what may not fall within the term system. Whatever may properly fall within that term must, I think, be found within the dictum of Lord Cairns, who did not find it necessary to go further in the exposition thereof, but left a wide field to be dealt with later, as it has been dealt with in many cases since. And within that lie such cases as this if the jury's view of very conflicting evidence be correct. There existed no barrier and no evidence was given to shew any one had the power to supply it.\nIt was properly the purpose of the respondent to pursue the policy indicated in Mr. McDonald's evidence above quoted of finding it cheaper to pay for accidents than furnish the material for adequate protection.\nOur latest case thereon was that of Waugh-Milburn Construction Co. v. Slater[4], decided last November.\nThere is no room for applying the volens doctrine here unless we discard the case of Smith v. Baker & Sons[5], and the case of The Canada Foundry Co. v. Mitchell[6], or perhaps substitute our own judgment of fact for that of a jury.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014The appellant was injured in these circumstances: The respondent company was engaged in making a large excavation (roughly, 300 ft. by 100 ft.) for the site of their dam at the outlet of Stave Lake, B.C. In carrying on this work the appellant, with some others, was clearing a narrow ledge on the face of the steep hillside, preparatory to settling a steam drill, when he was struck by a shower of gravel and rock that fell from the edge of the cliff and was thrown to the foot of the hill below and seriously injured.\nThe charge of negligence which was the principal subject of controversy was that of insufficient protection against the danger of falling rock and earth.\nThe usual practice was when the workmen were employed in drilling on the face of the hill for the foreman to send a party of workmen to make a \"berm\" above the place where they were about to be engaged; a \"berm\" being a cleared space (from which rocks and other material that might be a source of danger had been removed) extending back from the edge of the cliff a sufficient distance to secure such comparative immunity as could be obtained by this method.\nOn the part of the appellant it was alleged this method was in many places ineffectual and that complete immunity from this particular danger might be secured by placing a barrier or shield of logs in such a position as to intercept falling material.\nAt the trial the principal points of controversy were whether there was negligence in failing to adopt some such expedient as that just referred to, whether the plaintiff ought not to fail on the grounds of contributory negligence and assumption of risk; and, whether, assuming all these questions determined in his favour, the negligence leading to the injury was the negligence of a fellow servant for which the company would not be responsible.\nI have come to the conclusion that there ought to be a new trial and I shall refer to the evidence no more than is absolutely necessary to elucidate my view of the law applicable to the case.\nThere can be no doubt that the work was of a dangerous character.\nMr. Haywood, the respondent's engineer, says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You mean to say you never had any timbers or logs or planks or anything of that sort at any time up there, up to the present day to protect the workmen from rocks rolling down on the workmen in that excavation?\nA.\u2014I do not believe we did; we did have a kind of protection for the pipes against blasting.\nQ.\u2014I mean protection for the workmen?\nA.\u2014I don't think so.\nQ.\u2014You could have protected them under the timbers, you could have had planks or logs placed so as to protect the workmen from the falling rocks?\nA.\u2014 It was not practicable.\nQ.\u2014But you did have planks over at the dump to prevent rocks from the skip falling down on the workmen?\nA.\u2014I think you must be referring to the place where the skip was being hauled out over the top of the flume; we had a protection there but there was no reason for any timbers to protect the workmen.\nQ.\u2014Had you not at the top some protection?\nA.\u2014We had a kind of shack.\nQ.\u2014I mean simply as a protection?\nA.\u2014I do not remember what the protection was; it was not for the men working there, it was not necessary; it was protection for the plant. The men were not there when the blasts were going off.\nQ.\u2014You have seen stones or rock rolling down when the men were at work?\nA.\u2014Very much so.\nQ.\u2014You knew it was a dangerous thing?\nA.\u2014 The whole work was hazardous.\nQ.\u2014You knew that vicinity was dangerous?\nA.\u2014Yes, it was dangerous.\nQ.\u2014And you know it can be protected against?\nA.\u2014 It cannot entirely be protected against. Q.\u2014It can to a certain extent be protected against?\nA.\u2014 I cannot say as it could.\nIt was clearly the duty of the company, therefore, to take all reasonable precautions for the protection of the workmen engaged in this hazardous employment.\nThere was, moreover, evidence (see especially the evidence of Fraser, the foreman) entitling the jury to find that the provision of a shield such as that suggested in places where such protection might be required would not be an unreasonably extravagant measure.\nIn these circumstances the position of the respondents appear to have been this: They were not in my view (for reasons I shall presently give) under an absolute duty to see that reasonable care was taken to provide proper safeguards. The duty of the company (and of those exercising the general powers of the company, directors, executive committee, managing director as the case might be) would, I think, be discharged if they engaged some competent person whose duty it was to provide such safeguards and entrusted such agent with the necessary materials and invested him with the necessary authority to enable him to do so effectually. The duty of the agent to take such precautions might be expressly imposed upon him or it might arise impliedly from the terms or character of his employment, but if the company is to escape responsibility (assuming the work in these respects was not in fact superintended by the directors or others exercising the general powers of the company) it must appear that the provision of such safeguards was in fact the duty of some delegate expressly stipulated for or implied in the terms or nature of his engagement and that this delegate had been furnished with the necessary authority and resources to enable him to perform it. That is, in my opinion, the result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Young v. Hoffmann Manufacturing Co.[7]. In effect also it was the view expressed in Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson[8], in a judgment delivered by my brother Anglin and myself jointly.\nI think it was a question of fact for the jury whether the duty of superintendence was in fact in this case retained by the directors or others having authority to exercise the general powers or whether, on the contrary, Mr. Haywood had such authority and resources at his command and was under a duty express or implied to use them in furnishing the suggested safeguards if such safeguards were reasonably necessary. And I think the learned trial judge in effect refused to leave this question of fact to the jury. For that reason there should be a new trial.\nI cannot, however, leave the case without some reference to the grounds on which the appellant contends the judgment of the trial judge should be restored and the respondents contend that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should stand. On the question of volens and contributory negligence I do not think I ought to say more than this. While the evidence is far from satisfactory, I do not think it is a case for the exercise of the power of the court to enter judgment for the defendant. I think there was evidence to support the verdict and I am not sure that in considering the appellant's conduct the admission of the foreman that the appellant \"had practically no understanding of English\" has been sufficiently attended to. His want of English should also be considered in appreciating the effect of his answers given on examination for discovery. He asserts that he understood few of the questions. As to the form of the verdict, its purport seems clearer when it is read in the light of Mr. Haywood's evidence quoted above, and of the judge's charge; so read, it would appear in both branches of it to impute negligence to the company it-self rather than to the appellant's fellow workmen. All these matters, however, present difficulties and suggest additional reasons pointing to the desirability of a new trial.\nComing to the contention of the appellant that the respondent company's duty was an absolute duty to see that reasonable care was taken for the protection of its employees in this dangerous work.\nMy view of the case is that the fault\u2014 if there was fault\u2014 was a fault of management or superintendence of the operations in the prosecution of which Bergklint was engaged (the making of the excavation) and that the case falls within the actual decision of the House of Lords in Wilson v. Merry[9].\nIn that case the trial judge had instructed the jury that negligence in the construction of a scaffold under the supervision of the mine superintendent in such a way as to obstruct ventilation and thereby cause an explosion of fire-damp was negligence for which the owner was in law responsible, the erection of the scaffold being required in the ordinary course of the working of the mine; there being no question of the suffi- ciency of the system of ventilation as originally installed and no suggestion that the superintendent was incompetent. The House of Lords held that\u2014 the instruction in question was erroneous.\nIn Wilson v. Merr[10], as well as in previous and subsequent cases a distinction is signalized between the duty of the master in relation to the safety not only of structures, but of arrangements that are relatively permanent such, for example, as the system of ventilation in a mine or the disposition of the parts of a plant occupying for a considerable period a fixed position and his duty as regards measures which are required from time to time to secure safety in the operations in which the workman is engaged and which must of necessity vary with the progress of work and changing times and places. This latter is treated as a duty of management or superintendence which the master may discharge by employing competent persons whose duty it is to perform it and supplying them with the necessary resources to enable them to do so. The following passages from the judgment in Wilson v. Merry[11] will illustrate my meaning.\nLord Chelmsford, at p. 336:\u2014\nAlthough the learned judge in the course of his summing up, distinguished between \"keeping clear and in good working order the ventilation arrangement or system, when completed, and defect or fault in the arrangement or system itself,\" yet he does not appear to have left it to the jury to decide whether the accident occurred through faulty ventilation or through casual obstruction in the ventilation, the latter of which appears from the evidence to be more likely to have been the case. But, supposing it to have been quite clear that the ventilation itself was defective, yet, if it occurred in the course of the operations in the pit, it ought to have been distinguished from \"that system of ventilation and putting the mine into a safe and proper condition for working,\" which according to the opin- ion of the Lord Justice Clerk, in Dixon v. Rankin[12], \"it was the duty of the master for whose benefit the work is being carried on to provide.\" In the course of working the Houghhead pit it became necessary to arrange a system of what, for distinction's sake, I may call local ventilation. This must be considered as part of the mining operations, and, therefore, even if the accident happened in consequence of the scaffold in the Pyotshaw seam having, under Neish's orders, been constructed so as to obstruct the necessary ventilation, it would have been the result of negligence in the course of working the mine; and if Neish and the deceased were fellow workmen, it would have been one of the risks incident to the employment in which the deceased was engaged.\nLord Colonsay, at pages 344, 345, 346, says:\u2014\nI think that there are duties incumbent on masters with reference to the safety of labourers in mines and factories, on the fulfilment of which the labourers are entitled to rely, and for the failure in which the master may be responsible. A total neglect to provide any system of ventilation for the mine may be of that character. Culpable negligence in supervision, if the master takes the supervision on himself; or, where he devolves it on others, the heedless selection of unskilful or incompetent persons for the duty; or failure to provide or supply the means of providing proper machinery or materials-may furnish grounds of liability; and there may be other duties, varying according to the nature of the employment, wherein, if the master fails he may be responsible. But on the other hand, there are risks incident to occupations more or less hazardous, and of which the labourer who engages in any such occupation, takes his chance.\n* * * * * * *\nIt is not alleged that the general system of ventilation of the pit, as it had existed anterior to the erection of the scaffold, was not good, or that Neish was not a fit man to be placed in the position he occupied.\n* * * * * * *\nFirst: It deals, apparently, with the alleged defect in the scaffold as if it was a defect in the general arrangement or system of ventilation of a pit, for which in certain views the defenders might be regarded as liable, whereas it was a defect in the construction of a temporary structure erected by order of Neish for certain working operations, whereby the free action of a good system of ventilation was temporarily interfered with, which raised a totally different question for the consideration of the jury in reference to the liability of the defenders for the fault of Neish; but the distinction does not appear to have been adverted to. The same distinction is adverted to in the judgment of Lord Cramworth in the Bartonshill Coal Co. v. McGuire[13].\nThe general principle is broadly stated by Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[14], at page 332, in the following passage:\u2014\nBut what the master is, in my opinion, bound to his servant to do, in the event of his not personally superintending and directing the work, is to select proper and competent persons to do so, and to furnish them with adequate materials and resources for the work. When he has done this, he has, in my opinion, done all he is bound to do. And if the persons so selected are guilty of negligence, this is not the negligence of the master.\nBut this passage was construed in Allen v. The New Gas Company[15] (by the Court of Exchequer, Bramwell, Amphlett and Huddleston, BB., at p. 256), as laying down the rule that the owner must provide all that is necessary\nto carry on the business including premises reasonably safe for that purpose as, for instance, in case of a mine of a proper system of ventilation as pointed out by Lord Colonsay, in Wilson v. Merry[16].\nIn that case the injury had been the result of certain gates on the defendant's premises being in a dangerous state of disrepair. But a distinction between the master's duty in relation to the safety of structures in the first instance and his duty in relation to maintenance as a part of the duty of superintendence is suggested at page 256.\nThere was no evidence to shew that the premises of the defendants were dangerous, that the gates were defective in their original construction, or that they had not been perfectly safe when first put up. If they had fallen into a state of decay, and had been per- mitted to remain in that state, it could scarcely be said that that was the act of the defendants, but must have been that of the persons whom they must have employed.\nThe same distinction is also adverted to by Lord Herschell in his judgment in Gordon v. Pyper[17], at page 26. The rule which makes the master responsible for reasonable care in providing a safe place to work, sufficient machinery and appliances and a safe arrangement, was applied by this court in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[18], and Brooks, Scanlon, O'Brien Co. v. Fakkema[19]. In these cases the breach of duty charged was the failure to make proper provision in the first instance. But the question whether maintenance of structures and of plant and machinery (as distinguished from the duty to make safe provision in the first instance) is to be regarded as a duty of management or superintendence that the master may discharge by employment of competent delegates is a question on which there has been a good deal of difference of opinion and which does not necessarily arise in this case.\nThat distinction apart I do not think the principle of absolute responsibility illustrated by the decisions just mentioned, can properly be applied to the circumstances of this case. The work undertaken by the respondents necessarily subjected their workmen to hazards of various kinds, among those being the danger to which workmen engaged in drilling on the hillside might be exposed from falling material. As the work progresses the conditions of it must necessarily change. Expedients which at one time or in one place would be effective safeguards might in other places be only a source of additional peril; where the work is of such a character, and the nature of the precautions to be observed, or the safeguards to be provided, changes or may reasonably be supposed to change with the progress of the work, I think we are outside of the principle of the cases referred to and within the doctrine applied in Wilson v Merry[20], as expounded in the passage quoted above from the speech of Lord Chelmsford.\nThere are two further points to be mentioned.\nFirst.\u2014It has been contended that by failing specifically to plead that the engineer was invested with authority and supplied with means to provide the necessary safeguards, the respondents have disentitled themselves from raising that defence. I think there was evidence to go to the jury on the question whether or not the duty to make the suggested provision for the safety of the workmen was one of the duties of his employment. I think the learned trial judge would have allowed an amendment if one had been asked for, had he not felt that he was bound by the authority of the Fakkema Case[21] to hold that the defendants could not divest themselves of responsibility for the exercise of due care by the engineer. On the other hand, considering the state of the pleadings, the respondents having alleged that the failure to clear the incline was due to the negligence of the appellant's fellow-servants and having omitted to set up the same answer to the allegation of negligent failure to provide a barrier, it would be a little extravagant to treat anything which occurred at the trial as amounting to an admission by the appellant that the duty of making provision of the last mentioned kind was one of the duties cast upon the engineer. I was under the impression at one stage of the argument in this court that Mr. Taylor had admitted that duty was cast upon him in fact; but the intention to make any such admission of fact was afterwards disavowed and I have no doubt that my impression must have been due to a misconstruction of some concession made for the purposes of discussion.\nThe circumstances of the case are very special and on the whole I think justice will be best served by reserving all costs to abide the event of the new trial.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff was an employee of the defendants who were preparing a site for an extensive power plant at the outlet of Stave Lake, B.C. When injured he was engaged with two other workmen on a narrow ledge on a hillside in making ready a level place on which to stand a power drill. Some dirt and stones fell from above. One of the falling stones apparently hit the plaintiff, and, losing his balance, he fell to the bottom of the excavation, some 35 or 40 feet, sustaining serious injuries. He and his two fellow workmen had been instructed by the foreman, Fraser, to clear off all the loose rock and other material from the hillside above and to make the customary \"berm\" before commencing to work on the ledge, and they had been engaged from three to five hours in doing so. Before they began to work on the ledge one of these men, in the plaintiff's hearing, assured the foreman that the work above had been properly done. The accident happened after the men had been working on the ledge about twenty minutes. The negligence charged against the defendants was\n(1) Failing to provide a guard or shield of planks to prevent rocks and other material falling on the men while at work on the ledge;\n(2) Failing to provide a watchman to warn the men of falling material;\n(3) Improper construction and operation of cablelines carrying aerial trams causing loose rock and material to fall;\n(4) Failing to clear away loose dirt and rock above and adjoining the excavation.\nMost of the evidence was directed to the third item of alleged negligence; but it was ignored by the jury, who found that\nOwing to the dangerous nature of the work, we, the jury, consider the defendants guilty of negligence in not sufficiently clearing the face of the incline and putting in place barriers to prevent rolling stones and other debris from causing injury to the employees.\nThey awarded the plaintiff $5,500 damages.\nOn appeal this verdict was set aside on the ground that the evidence did not sustain it and the action was dismissed.\nUpon the admitted facts \"the failure to clear the face of the incline\" would appear to have been ascribable to the plaintiff and his fellow workmen, although the finding of the jury would seem to be to the contrary and probably precludes the dismissal of the action on the ground of contributory negligence. If the jury was of the opinion that the foreman should have personally inspected the work above in order to see that it had been properly done before allowing the men to begin operations on the ledge, and that he was negligent in not having made such an inspection, that would be negligence of a fellow employee and would not support a judgment against the defendants at common law. Moreover, lack of efficient superintendence or inspection is not amongst the grounds of negligence charged against the defendants.\nOn this branch of the jury's verdict we have the following evidence: Fraser, the foreman, asked the men if the work of clearing had been properly done (\"Boys, are you sure that it is all right above?\") and was assured that it had been before the work on the ledge began. This is not questioned. One of the men, McKinnon, gives this evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014In your opinion was everything made safe before you came down?\nA.\u2014I was pretty well satisfied myself with the work we did.\nQ.\u2014With the work you did?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did you think it was safe for yourself, that is the point?\nA.\u2014I never thought of any danger before the accident.\nBut on cross-examination, he says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014When you came down from clearing the top of the hill you did not appreciate any danger after that, you did not think there was any danger?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014And you did not think \u2014 it would be fair to say that Bergklint would not think he was in any danger or appreciate any risk, would he?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014What occurred was something\u2014the picking of stones away was not sufficient to prevent occurring\u2014that is the way you would size it up, would you not?\nA.\u2014Well, we thought we did everything we could do.\nQ.\u2014In the shape of picking away the stones?\nA\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Now what loosened that stuff up there, do you think?\nA.\u2014I have no idea.\nQ.\u2014The dirt around the brink of the hill, the small gravel and small stones were not actually shovelled away from the brink of the cliff, that is about it, is it not?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If they had been shovelled away from the brink of the cliff and the bedrock made bare, it would be less dangerous? A.\u2014About two feet at the edge of the cliff.\nQ.\u2014If it had been made bare further back, it would have been less dangerous?\nA.\u2014I presume so.\nQ.\u2014You presume it would have been less dangerous down there?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nMcLean, the other workman, did not give evidence. From the plaintiff, who had been engaged in similar work in Sweden, we have this testimony:\u2014\nQ.\u2014I call your attention to the notice of injury put in as exhibit 1, I think on the 21st of December, 1910, which was about a month after the accident, you state that this accident was due to loose pieces of rock, allowing loose rock to remain on the edge of the precipice under which you were working \u2014 just call his attention to this notice and I will follow it by another question. The statement in this notice that the cause of the accident was allowing loose rocks to remain on the edge of the precipice. Now what do you mean by that \u2014 I will put it as though I was speaking to the man \u2014 what you mean by that Bergklint is, that they did not sufficiently clear the edge of the hill above the ledge \u2014 what you mean by that is that the loose rocks and stuff were not sufficiently cleared from the edge of the hill above you?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Now is this answer correct? Reading from his examination for discovery at question 70, \"Was it not always your custom in working on that class of work either in Sweden or at the works, to go up above the ledge and clear off the loose stone before you went down on the ledge to work?\n\"A.\u2014Yes.\"\nAsk him if that is a correct answer to that question?\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014Ask him that question, you can do it in your language \u2014 what is his answer?\nThe Interpreter: His answer is, that when it was not too much work they cleared off the rock, but if it was too much work they put protection.\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014Now the next one I wish to call his attention to is question 135 on the same examination: \"But in Sweden you did the same sort of work, you cleared away the loose rock too?\n\"A.\u2014Sure, all over, 3 or 4 yards.\"\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Now 137: \"You put this to him, Mr. Interpreter.\n\"A.\u2014What I mean is that it was not cleared far enough back.\" Q.\u2014138. \"Did you think so at the time?\n\"A.\u2014Just at this place it was not cleared away so far as it was in other places, on account of so little work to be done at this place.\"\nQ.\u2014139. \"That was not my question. My question is did you think at the time when you were clearing it that you had not cleared it sufficiently?\n\"A.\u2014I don't think so.\"\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014Your idea, Mr. Bergklint, is, in short, that the accident was due to this insufficient clearing at the edge of the hill?\nA.\u2014Yes.\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014Very well. Whatever the facts may be as to the reason \u2014 at any rate you now say, Bergklint, you say that the work on the ledge was to be very short, that you were not acting as helper but merely to assist on the ledge in making a place for the machine drill, that is true, is it not, Bergklint? You knew you would be a very short time on the ledge when Fraser sent you to that part of the work and your work was simply to assist in preparing a place on the ledge for the machine?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And notwithstanding his previous answer, the truth is, that he, McLean and McKinnon cleared off all the loose stuff or dangerous material that they could see \u2014 ask him that \u2014 if, as a matter of fact, that however wrong they were and no matter what he has hitherto said, the fact remains that the three of them cleared off the face of the hill of all the loose stuff they could see?\nA.\u2014No, it was only the stones that were lying closest to the edge.\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014I understand the witness to say that is an incorrect answer to 55 \u2014 \"As far as you could see you cleared off all loose rock?\n\"A.\u2014Yes.\"\nAsk him if he swears to\u2014day that he did not clear off all the loose rock that he saw?\nA.\u2014At the edge we cleared off as many stones as we saw, but there were stones higher up the mountain.\nQ.\u2014There were stones higher up the mountain, and did you tell any one or suggest to any one there was any danger higher up the mountain?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014How long was he doing that clearing?\nThe Interpreter: You mean, just on the ledge?\nQ.\u2014In the whole clearing, how long was he clearing the hill above the ledge or any clearing that day?\nA.\u2014Altogether I was about 5 hours. Q.\u2014In clearing?\nA.\u2014In clearing.\n* * * * * * *\nQ.\u2014But passing that over, did you tell me on the 7th of March, this month, the following that you thought there was some danger of rock falling \u2014 that is question 149.\nQ.\u2014149. \"You thought there was some danger of rock falling?\n\"A.\u2014I say \u2014 that at that time I didn't think a great deal about it \u2014 that there might be danger, but I took a chance and went down because I did not think it would take long.\"\u2014This is just after you started, at the same time that McLean told you, you would have to go there.\nQ.\u2014147. \"McLean said, that he thought it was allright and I ask you, if at that time you didn't think it was allright too?\n\"A.\u2014I didn't think so.\"\nQ. 148. \"But you said nothing?\n\"A.\u2014No.\"\nQ.\u2014149. \"You thought there was some danger of rock falling?\n\"A.\u2014I say \u2014 that at that time I didn't think a great deal about it \u2014 that there might be danger, but I took a chance and went down because I did not think it would take long.\"\nQ.\u2014150. \"I see. You didn't think that you would be there long enough for any trouble to happen?\n\"A.\u2014Yes, sir.\"\nDid he give those answers? What does he say so far?\nA.\u2014I cannot recognize all this.\nQ.\u2014Will he deny on his oath he used that language which I read to him, on the 7th of March, this year, will he deny on his oath those questions were put to him and those answers were given \u2014 what does he say?\nA.\u2014No, I cannot do it, I don't remember.\nQ.\u2014Now, whatever he said, the fact is, is it not, that he did not thing the clearing was sufficient when he went down, is that not the fact?\nThe Interpreter: What was that?\nQ.\u2014He did not think it had been sufficiently cleared away, all these stones and stuff when he went down on to the ledge, is that not a fact?\nA.\u2014I saw all of them, that it was risky to work there.\n* * * * * **\nQ.\u2014Fraser sent him to assist in making a safe place to put the machine to be worked by McKinnon and McLean, and told him to assist McLean in clearing the hill and to bar down the rock so as to make a safe place for the machine?\nA.\u2014Yes, they were going to make a safe place for the machine. These extracts are somewhat lengthy. Yet it seems to be scarcely possible to state the plaintiff's position fairly without giving them. Some of them apply as well to the other branch of the jury's finding.\nUpon all this evidence it is, I think, abundantly clear that on the first branch of the jury's verdict the judgment at common law cannot be maintained. Indeed, a verdict finding contributory negligence, if not volens, could not have been held to be at all unreasonable. But the jury have negatived these defences and their verdict upon them is probably conclusive.\nIt remains to consider the failure to\nplace barriers to prevent rolling stones and other debris from causing injury to the employees,\nfound by the jury to amount to actionable negligence. It is doubtful whether the jury meant to impute negligence to the defendants in this respect independently of the earlier part of their verdict. The finding rather reads as if they deemed the defendants chargeable with negligence for not having placed the guard or barriers above the men only because the hillside had not been sufficiently cleared, and on the assumption that for that the defendants were to blame, or at least that they knew or should be deemed to have known of it. But if the latter part of the verdict should be deemed a distinct and independent finding of negligence, on the evidence the practicability of providing such a guard or shield is more than questionable. The testimony of Haywood, the superintendent, and Fraser, the foreman, as well as that of J. A. McDonald, an expert contractor, is that it was impracticable, and that\nin a place like this it would probably cause more accidents and would be more dangerous to erect a thing like that than it would be to go up and take the cause of the trouble out of the way altogether. The first precaution in all work of this kind is to send the men up and give them carte blanche to bar down any rock that was at all dangerous, and if you take that precaution and remove the cause of danger I do not see any necessity for this overhead contrivance.\nAll these witnesses agree that the proper method to pursue in such a situation as the hillside in question presented is thoroughly to clear away all loose stuff and debris above the place where the work is to be done and that it is only where that is not feasible or would be too expensive that the shield protection should be resorted to as a substitute. The plaintiff himself distinctly corroborates this evidence when he says that, in Sweden, (and it is on the practice in that country that he relies to establish that it was negligent not to have had a shield of planks in the present case,)\nwhen it was not too much work they cleared off the rock, but if it was too much work they put protection.\nThere is not a scintilla of evidence that here the work of clearing was \"too much\" or that it entailed too great an expense or that for any other reason it was not practicable to have it thoroughly done. The uncontradicted evidence is that the men were given carte blanche to clear away all dangerous material and that it was only when assured by them that this had been done that the foreman allowed them to proceed with the work on the ledge. Under such circumstances and upon such evidence I agree with the learned judges who formed the majority in the Court of Appeal that the finding that the defendants were negligent in not placing barriers cannot be sustained. The evidence does not support it.\nBut if such a shield should have been placed above the men when at work on this particular ledge and if it was negligence not to have had it so placed, and the verdict in this respect should stand, those facts would not, under the circumstances of this case, in my opinion, warrant a recovery at common law.\nThis case is, I think, clearly distinguishable from Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[22], and similar authorities relied on for the appellant. The nature and extent of the protection for workmen which was required in the course of the works that the defendants were carrying on must have varied in the different spots in which they were from time to time called on to discharge their duties, according to the relative situation of such spots and the character of the surrounding land. In some clearing of the berm and incline would have sufficed; in others the shield or guard of planks might be necessary; again, in others neither precaution might be requisite. It was not a case of defective installation of a permanent structure for protection, as in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[23], where the roof in a mine was defective, or of negligence in maintaining a permanent appliance as in Canada Woollen Mills v. Traplin[24], where the elevator in a mill or factory was worn out. The protection alleged to have been lacking in this instance was not for a place where men would be required to work in the same spot and under the same conditions for any considerable time.\nIt was admitted at bar in this court and the case appears to have proceeded at the trial on the assump- tion that the defendants' works were put in charge of a competent superintendent and foreman, that they were furnished with the means to provide proper protection and were given authority to incur any expense necessary for that purpose. What kind and extent of safeguard would be necessary and best suited for each spot in which workmen were from time to time engaged was necessarily left to the determination of the superintendent or foreman. That was the only system of protection for their workmen which the company could adopt under the circumstances. In providing it they discharged the common law duty of the\nmaster who employs his servant in a work of a dangerous character * * * to take all reasonable precaution for the workmen's safety; per Lord Watson, in Smith v. Baker & Sons[25] at page 353.\nThe principle of the decisions in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[26] and such cases, in my opinion, is not applicable to the circumstances of the present case. Zeigler v. Day[27]; Batty v. Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Co.[28], and Perry v. Rogers[29], at page 258, cited by the learned counsel for the respondent, are, I think, much more closely in point.\nIn the Fakkema Case,[30] much relied on by the appellant, in so far as the decision does not depend on the form of the verdict, which was a principal subject of discussion in this court, and on the failure to raise in the courts below the question of the knowledge or means of knowledge of the defendant company of the existence of the defect complained of, the court pro- ceeded on the assumption that it was dealing with a permanent or quasi-permanent instalment of an engine in a place where the men who were engaged about it would be required to work for a considerable period of time. What will amount to such permanency as will impose on the employer the absolute duty of providing his servants with a place in which to work as safe as is reasonably consistent with the character of the work in which they are engaged and will not permit of his delegating to a superintendent, however competent, the selection and determination of the means of protection best adapted to the situation so that the employer may be himself exempt at common law from liability for mistakes or negligence of such superintendent in regard to selecting and utilizing such means of protection, must frequently be a question of degree which can be determined only upon careful consideration of all the circumstances of each case as it arises. Where men are engaged in extensive outdoor works of such a character that their location changes each hour or each day and that protection which may be the most suitable, or even absolutely necessary, in one place in which they are required to work may be unsuitable or unnecessary in another, the master who selects proper and competent persons and entrusts to them the superintendence of such works and furnishes them with adequate materials and resources for providing reasonable protection for the workmen (all of which it is conceded was done by the defendants) does all that he is bound to do and if the persons so entrusted are guilty of negligence it is not imputable at common law to the master. Wilson v. Merry[31], at pages 332, 344.\nThe fact that the protection alleged to be defective or lacking is required for a temporary purpose is a material element in determining the liability of the defendants for any fault of their superintendent or foreman in regard to it. Ibid., at pages 342 and 346: Hicks v. Smith's Falls Electric Power Co.[32].\nIt is alleged that for the defendants' works there was no system of protection by overhead shields or guards arranged for and that they are, therefore, liable at common law if the absence of such protection was the cause of the plaintiff's injuries. But assuming that this failure to place a shield of planks above the men was the cause of the plaintiff's injuries, and that there was such a lack of system, that lack of system was not the cause of the accident. Had such a system been expressly arranged for, on the evidence in the record an overhead shield would not have been used at the place where the plaintiff was injured. The defendants' witnesses say that its use would have been fraught with greater danger to the workmen. It was probably impracticable. Had the clearing above been done as it should have been, and as the foreman thought and had reason to believe it had been, the shield protection would, upon all the evidence, have been unnecessary. But the testimony does not establish a lack of system such as is now alleged and the verdict does not involve such a finding. If the injuries sustained by the plaintiff in the present case are properly ascribable to the absence of the guard or shield of planks, the fault (if any) in failing to provide that guard or shield was that of the superintendent or foreman and is not attributable to the defendant company so as to subject them to common law liability. If the failure to provide a guard was due to mere error of judgment on the part of the foreman or superintendent no negligence whatever has been established.\nOn the evidence I rather incline to agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal when he says that the cause of the plaintiff's injuries was the failure of himself and his fellow workmen to clear the hillside or incline properly, as it was their duty to have done. It is not shewn that it was not practicable so to clear the hillside that no overhead guard or shield would be required. The plaintiff himself says that the accident was due to the \"insufficient clearing at the edge of the hill,\" and for that he and his fellow workmen, McLean and McKinnon, would seem to have been to blame. No negligence of the foreman, Fraser, or of the superintendent, Haywood, is either alleged or proved in respect of that part of the work. Upon this view of the facts, which appears to be warranted by the evidence, the plaintiff could not succeed either at common law or under the \"Employers' Liability Act.\" But, for the disposition of the plaintiff's appeal to have the judgment in his favour restored, it suffices that a cause of action at common law has not been established.\nFailing to secure a restoration of the judgment at common law, the plaintiff asks that a new trial should be granted to enable him to present a case under the \"Employers' Liability Act,\" which he set up in his pleadings but failed to press at the former trial. The trial judge in charging the jury said:\u2014 I wish to say at once that this is a case, in my opinion, that does not come under the \"Employers' Liability Act\" at all; I feel that if he recovers at all it must be at common law.\nNo exception was taken to this part of the charge. The learned judge was not asked to leave the case to the jury under the statute as well as at common law. The Court of Appeal, exercising its discretion, refused to accede to this request. Under these circumstances and having regard to the evidence to which I have referred, I think that in the exercise of our discretion we should not direct a new trial to enable the plaintiff to place before another jury his claim to recover under the \"Employers' Liability Act.\"\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBut there is not a majority of the court in favour of dismissal. My brothers Idington and Brodeur would restore the verdict for the plaintiff, while my brother Duff is of the opinion that there should be a new trial. Under the circumstances, I very much deprecate the necessity for a new trial and I accept that result only in order that there may be a majority of the court supporting a disposition of the appeal that will not involve the restoration of a verdict which I deem unjustifiable.\nUnder ordinary circumstances since where a new trial is ordered it is, no doubt, desirable that there should be as little discussion as possible of the merits of the action, I should withhold the opinion I had prepared giving the reasons why I think the plaintiff's action should be dismissed and should merely state the considerations which lead me to concur in the order for a new trial. But as some difficulty would seem to have been occasioned at the former trial by the views taken as to the effect of the judgments of this court in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[33], and the Fakkema Case[34], it is not desirable \u2014 indeed, I think, it would scarcely be proper \u2014 to send this action back for another trial without expressing an opinion as to the scope of those decisions and stating my view of the law bearing upon the questions touched by them which this case presents. That I endeavoured to do in the opinion I had prepared, and for that reason I file it with this appended memorandum.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action in damages against the respondents for an accident which, according to the verdict of the jury, was due to their negligence.\nThe respondents were making an excavation for their power-house and the appellant was working to clear a ledge on which a steam-drill was to operate and, in doing that work, stone or debris came down from above and injured him.\nThe jury found as follows:\u2014\nOwing to the dangerous nature of the work, we, the jury, consider the defendant company guilty of negligence in not sufficiently clearing the face of the incline, and getting in place barriers to prevent rolling stone and other debris from causing injury to the employees.\nThere is evidence to support that verdict.\nThe incline in question was not evidently sufficiently cleared. Some work had been done on that incline and the appellant had worked under the instructions of a foreman to the clearing of that incline. But the debris that struck the appellant when he was working on the ledge could come just as well from that incline where he had been previously working as from another part of the hill about which he had not been ordered to do any work. Some strong evidence has been adduced for the purpose of proving that this debris had not been falling from the place where clearing had been carried out by Bergklint's foreman and himself.\nAs to the barriers, the system has been in use and proved effective. On those two grounds the verdict of the jury could be sustained. Appellant should succeed in his action.\nAn employer is bound to regulate his business in such a manner as not to cause injuries to his employees.\nIf he occasions injury to his workmen by the fact that he does not get his undertakings superintended and controlled with due care and caution he is liable.\nIt follows that he is responsible for injury caused to his workmen by the negligent system on which his business is carried on. Bartonshill Coal Co. v. McGuire[35]; Sword v. Cameron[36].\nLord Herschell, in Smith v. Baker & Sons[37], enunciated those principles in the following words:\u2014\nIt is quite clear that the contract between the employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide appliances and to maintain them in a proper condition and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk.\nWe must bear in mind that under the English law the common law duty above mentioned is a personal one, but at the same time when the employer delegates his duty to some other person that responsibility passed from him, contrary to the well-known maxim \"qui facit per alium facit per se.\"\nThe doctrine of common employment comes then in existence.\nThat doctrine is to the effect that if a person occasioning and the person suffering the personal injury are fellow workmen engaged in a common employment and under a common master, such master is not responsible for the results of the injury.\nThat bare statement of the law was somewhat qualified, however, by the opinion several times expressed in important decisions in England to the effect that the master was bound in delegating his powers: 1, to employ competent persons; and 2, to provide a proper and suitable plant. Had the company respondent properly discharged its obligation in this case?\nWas there a proper plant; or proper system and control of the work?\nIn the case of Grant v. The Acadia Coal Co.[38], at page 434, decided by this court, it was stated by my brother Davies that the employer\nis bound to see that his works are suitable for the operations he carries on at them being carried on with reasonable safety,\nand, at page 437, he added,\nthis is a duty that no officer's negligence can relieve him of.\nIn the case of McKelvey v. LeRoi Mining Co.[39] it was also decided that a master who employs a servant in a work of a dangerous character, such as in mining at the foot of a shaft 800 feet deep, is bound to take all reasonable precautions for the workmen's safety.\nI may quote also the case of Brooks, Scanlon, O'Brien Co. v. Fakkema[40], where an incorporated company carrying on dangerous operations is liable at common law for damages sustained by an employee in consequence of injuries occasioned by the use of a system which failed to provide a safe and proper place in which the employee could do his work; it is not relieved from this responsibility by the fact that the operations were superintended by a competent foreman.\nI will refer also to Halsbury, Laws of England, vo. \"Master and Servant,\" No. 280, to shew that the ledge was part of the work carried on by the company respondent and it was, as I have said before, its duty to see that it should be safe for its servants to work thereon.\nFor those reasons, the plaintiff's action should be maintained and the judgment of the Court of Appeal that dismissed it should be reversed with costs of this court and of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed, new trial ordered, costs to abide result.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Harvey, Baird, Grant & Stockton.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McPhillips & Wood.\n[1] 17 B.C.

In order to do so it was necessary to shunt several cars placed in front of the car to be transferred and the train crew switched these cars to certain tracks on which there was then standing a train of the other railway company, headed by an engine under which the fireman, plaintiff, was then working. They undertook to couple the cars which they were switching to the standing train, as a matter of convenience, and, in doing so, struck the rear of the train with such force as to move the engine and cause injuries to the fireman who was working under it. Specific questions were not submitted to the jury, notwithstanding suggestions made by defendants' counsel after the judge had charged them, and they returned a general verdict in favour of the plaintiff.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (24 Man. R. 544), that in so proceeding to couple the cars they had switched on to the standing train the defendants' train crew were still acting within the scope of their employment in the defendants' business and, as they performed the work in a negligent manner, the defendant\n*Present:\u2014Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. were liable in damages for the injuries caused to the plaintiff.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The question, whether the acts of negligence of the company's servants were done in course of their employment was a question of fact for the jury in respect of which there was evidence to support their finding in favour of the plaintiff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment entered by Mr. Justice Gait, at the trial, upon the verdict of the jury in favour of the plaintiff with costs.\nIn the circumstances stated in the head-note, the jury returned a general verdict and assessed, damages in favour of the plaintiff for $11,000, upon which judgment was entered by the trial judge, and this judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from. The questions raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. B. Coyne for the appellants.\nW. H. Trueman for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014I understood Mr. Coyne in his reply practically to concede that the coupling of the cars taken by the appellant company's train to Bird's Hill, where the train of the Canadian Northern Railway was standing, was the main question in this appeal.\nHis contention, however, was that such coupling was something beyond the scope of the employment of those in charge of the Grand Trunk Pacific train and that, therefore, the company was not liable even for the negligence of its employees in respect to it.\nI confess I have not reached my conclusion adverse to this contention without a good deal of doubt. The coupling of the cars was certainly not done under the yardmaster's orders. It was probably done as a matter of convenience and railway practice and under an arrangement made at the time by the employees of both trains. The evidence justifies this conclusion. The jury had evidence before them on which their findings could be sustained. They had a right to accept Thompson's evidence, if they so determined, even if it was in conflict with that of Foster, Gavin and Carroll, as contended.\nI am, therefore, not able to find that such negligent coupling as was proved in this case was beyond the scope of the employment of the conductor and engineer of the Grand Trunk Pacific train.\nThat negligence consisted in the want of notice of the intended coupling to the Canadian Northern Railway train under which the plaintiff was at the time working and in the excessive impact.\nI, therefore, concur in the dismissal of the company's appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent was at work under his engine which, with a train of eighteen or more cars, was standing on a branch of the Canadian Northern Railway at a station in Manitoba when those in charge of one of appellant's engines ran some three cars into said branch to connect them with said train. This was done without warning and with such violence that it moved the whole train and injured the respondent who recovered a verdict and judgment against appellant therefor.\nAppellant contends it cannot be held liable for the acts of the men occasioning such injury. It appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and the appeal was dismissed, Mr. Justice Richards dissenting.\nThe appellant admits sending its men with the engine and a caboose and other cars to leave the latter in the yard of the Canadian Northern and to bring out a car which was loaded with freight to be taken over appellant's line. The car to be brought out was found attached to three other cars in a siding in said yard. Those had to be shunted about to accomplish this purpose.\nIt seems to me clear that men on such an errand could not of their own volition have undertaken to shunt these cars about in any way seeming best to themselves without consulting those in charge in said yard.\nPrim\u00e2 facie it would be the yardmaster who could and perhaps should direct what is to be done. It is said he requested the appellant's men to move the cars in question to a point on the main line and an engine would be along to pick up the three other cars, and they proceeded accordingly to get the car they were after by the several movements needed to accomplish it and had when done these other remaining ears standing on the main line when some one suggested they connect them with the train I have referred to on the branch line and they did so accordingly without any notice to the men in charge thereof and thus injured respondent.\nIt is urged that in doing so they were acting beyond the scope of their duty and without authority and hence appellant is not liable for their negligence.\nIt is quite clear that to have left the cars on the main line at the time when the express train was expected, and that other engine expected to take charge of them was not there to do so, would have been unjustifiable and possibly disastrous.\nThey did what seems to have been needed for the convenience of the Canadian Northern people and themselves in order that the business in hand should be most readily and rapidly discharged and they be enabled to get off with despatch out of the yard and end their errand.\nI am not disposed to follow in all its mazes the other shunting it is suggested they might have done and the possibility of their running over some other man than the one they did, and still less the mass of contradictions between the witnesses and variations of story on the part of some, for I am quite sure they acted in the course of their master's business and used the judgment which impliedly they had a right to use under the circumstances, but happened to be negligent therein for which the master must suffer.\nNo master ever gave his men authority to act negligently, and every man who does gets beyond the scope of his authority in a sense, but the unfortunate master has to bear that burden as far as others are concerned.\nIf the case called for it I think a good deal might be said in regard to what section 317 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d requires of each railway company and impliedly of those entrusted by any railway company with any part of the duty thereby imposed.\nAgain the several movements forward and backward would have had to be taken no matter into what siding they involved entering, and this evidence bearing upon the relation of sidings in question is of such conflicting character as to reduce the question to one for the jury, who may merely have found that appellant's men were reduced to exercising their judgment to extricate themselves from their difficulties and properly chose this siding or branch as result, and acting thereon acted negligently.\nIn any way one can look at it\u2014and counsel, fertile in resources, has induced me to look at it in a good many ways\u2014it all comes back to the responsibility of the master for his servant in executing his masters business, and in that regard appellant must fail. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff j.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal. The only point requiring notice arises out of the contention of the appellant company that the acts of negligence charged are not acts for which they are legally responsible. The substance of the question is whether there was or was not evidence to support a finding by the jury that in fact those acts were done by the employee of the company in course of their employment as the servants of the company. It does not seem to me that there is much to be gained by discussing in detail the exact effect of the evidence. After carefully considering it I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Coyne's contention must be rejected.\nAnglin J\u2014The defendants appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba upholding the verdict of a jury finding them liable to the plaintiff for damages for personal injuries to the extent of $11,000. Three main grounds of appeal were urged in this court: 1st, that the trial judge wrongfully refused to put questions to the jury; 2nd, that the evidence established contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff; and 3rd, that the act of the defendants' servants which caused the plaintiff's injuries was not within the scope of their employment.\nHaving regard to the fact that counsel for the defendants asked that certain questions should be put to the jury only after the learned judge had completed his charge, to the scope and character of the questions suggested, and to the presentation in the charge to the jury of the issues on which they had to pass, I think it was within the discretion of the learned trial judge to decline to put these questions. Moreover, I cannot see that any miscarriage of justice resulted from his failure to require the jury to answer specific questions.\nIn support of his contention that contributory negligence was established counsel for the defendants relied on the breach by the plaintiff of Rule 26 of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, in whose employment he was. That rule reads as follows:\u2014\nRule 26. A blue flag by day and a blue light by night, displayed at one or both ends of an engine, car or train indicates that workmen are under or about it; when thus protected, it must not be coupled to or moved, and other cars must not be placed on the same track so as to intercept the view of the blue signals, without first notifying the workman.\nWorkmen will display the blue signals and the same workmen are alone authorized to remove them.\nAssuming that this rule imposed a duty on-the plaintiff\u2014something which might very easily be more clearly expressed\u2014a perusal of the portion of the charge dealing with the issue of contributory negligence makes it clear that the jury was not asked to find the plaintiff negligent on the ground that he-failed to observe Rule 26. No objection was taken to the charge on this ground, and the learned judge was not asked to direct the attention of the jury to the rule. Neither is there any reference to it in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal. Other grounds of contributory negligence dealt with in the trial judge's charge were not relied upon at bar in this court. I think the defendants are not entitled to have the judgment against them disturbed on this ground.\nMr. Coyne's main contention was that in taking three Canadian Northern Railway fruit-cars to the Bird's Hill line the employees were either acting as servants of the Canadian Northern Railway Co. or as volunteers and not in the course of their employment by the defendants. He also maintained that, if they had been acting within the scope of their duties as employees of the defendants in bringing the cars to the Bird's Hill line, they ceased to so act and were mere volunteers in proceeding to couple them to the Canadian Northern Railway train which was standing there. I think there was evidence to warrant the jury in concluding that, having, regard to all the circumstances, the most practical, if not the only practical way of dealing with the three Canadian Northern cars, which was open to the Grand Trunk Pacific crew, in order to secure the Grand Trunk Pacific meat-car which they had been sent to get, was to take all four cars up to the Bird's Hill line as they did. On Foster's evidence I think it was also open to the jury to find that the Grand Trunk Pacific crew had been requested by him to deliver the three Canadian Northern cars to Thompson for the Canadian Northern Railway Company; there was also evidence to support an inference that it would have been dangerous and improper to have left the three Canadian Northern cars standing on the Bird's Hill line without placing them in charge of Canadian Northern officials, and that the coupling of these cars to the Canadian Northern train standing there was a reasonable, if indeed it was not the best, means available to the Grand Trunk Pacific crew to relieve themselves and their employers, the defendants, of all further responsibility in connection with those cars. The jury may well have found that Thompson requested that the three fruit-cars should be coupled to the Canadian Northern train by the Grand Trunk Pacific crew as the most convenient means of making delivery of the cars to him as Foster had instructed. I think it was open to the jury to have drawn all these inferences and it must be assumed that they did in fact draw such of them as are necessary to sustain the general verdict which they rendered for the plaintiff. While the testimony on this branch of the case is certainly not as complete or as satisfactory as could be desired, on the whole I am of opinion that it cannot be held that there was no-evidence on which a jury could find that what was done by the Grand Trunk Pacific crew was in the course of their employment.\nNo substantial attack was made by counsel for the appellants on the finding that in the coupling of the three fruit-cars with the Canadian Northern train the defendants' servants acted negligently, and upon the evidence, at all events in so far as undue force in making the coupling was charged, such an attack could not very well have been made.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is the case of a railway accident. The plaintiff, respondent, who is a fireman in the employ of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, was doing some necessary work under his engine when a Grand Trunk Pacific train came into collision with it. The plaintiff got injured and he sues the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company.\nA verdict of negligence was rendered toy the jury and the judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal. We are asked to reverse that decision.\nA meat-car had to be switched from a transfer-yard of the Canadian Northern Railway Company to the Grand Trunk Pacific line and a Grand Trunk ^Pacific engine went into that yard to get that car. But in order to reach that car the Grand Trunk Pacific people had to shunt some three cars that were in front of that meat-car. They were asked by the superintendent of the yard to remove those three cars on a certain line. Those cars could just as well be switched in the yard proper or on that line. It was just as convenient for the Grand Trunk Pacific crew to make the shunting at either of those places.\nIn bringing those three cars on the branch line they collided with the plaintiff's train. The impact was done carelessly.\nThe appellants seek to avoid the liability in stating that the Grand Trunk Pacific crew were not in their course of employment.\nWhen they were in the yard of the Canadian Northern Railway Company the Grand Trunk Pacific crew had to follow the instructions, as to their movements, of the yardmaster. They could perhaps have refused to follow the instructions that were given to them if they found them unreasonable; but, in this case, no suggestion is made that they were unreasonable. It is even stated that the removal of those cars on the branch line was a saving of time and work for the Grand Trunk Pacific crew.\nThen those servants were bound to act without negligence, and if by their negligent act they caused injury they render their master liable.\nThe verdict is a reasonable verdict in the circumstances and the judgment a quo should be confirmed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H. H. Hansard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bonnar, Trueman & Hollands.\n[1] 24 Man. R. 544.\n"

The rain washed away the filling and T. was injured by stepping into the excavation.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (47 N.S. Rep. 498), that the corporation was guilty of misfeasance and a verdict in favour of T. should stand.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], maintaining a verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nIn May, 1911, the Halifax City Corporation laid a concrete sidewalk on Granville Street. In doing so the grade was lowered, and on Salter, a steep street crossing Granville, the asphalt sidewalk was cut away in order to make a level junction. The part so cut away was filled in with earth and ashes which in the fall was washed out by the rain. In October the plaintiff, walking up Salter Street, stepped into the hole made by the rain and fell on the concrete, receiving serious injury. In an action against the city she obtained a verdict for $2,000, which the full court sustained. The city appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for the appellant. The city is liable for misfeasance only. Municipality of Picton v. Geldert[2].\nIn this case it was only the usual wear of the sidewalk that caused the depression. See City of St. John v. Campbell[3]; Cullen v. Town of Glace Bay[4]; Maguire v. Liverpool Corporation[5].\nNewcombe K.C. and J. B. Henney for the respondent refer to Corporation of Shoreditch v. Bull[6]; City of Vancouver v. McPhelan[7]; Dawson & Co. v. Bingley Urban District Council[8].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. The accident was due entirely to the faulty construction of the connection between the concrete sidewalk on Granville Street with the asphalt sidewalk on Salter Street. It is a case of failure on the part of the municipality to take due care in the exercise of its powers.\nThe appellant urges that there is no misfeasance, and that for nonfeasance there is no statutory liability. I express no opinion as to whether or not under the statute there is a liability for nonfeasance.\nIn my judgment this is not a naked question of law, but one of mixed fact and law. I am quite satisfied that the accident was directly attributable, as found below, to the fact that the municipality having undertaken to make repairs to the sidewalk left it in an unsafe condition and that for the consequences to the plaintiff the municipality is liable.\nDavies J.:\u2014The question in this case is reduced to a very narrow one. Mr. Bell admits that in laying Granville Street sidewalk of concrete, the city engineer broke up the asphalt sidewalk of Salter Street, which is a street crossing Granville Street at right angles and is very steep. In the doing of this work, the engineer left a gap or space of a few feet wide between the two sidewalks which it was their duty to fill up properly.\nThe jury have found that in the discharge of that duty the city officials were guilty of negligence and that such negligence consisted in not \u201cproperly finishing the work.\u201d If this finding can be construed as a finding that the material used \u201cclay and ashes\u201d in filling up the hole between the sidewalks was improper material, then, I think, the judgment was right and the appeal should be dismissed.\nMr. Bell admits that the duty of filling up that hole so caused lay upon the city. If that is so, they were clearly obliged to do so with proper materials. If the clay and ashes they put in were improper filling and the accident was caused by this improper material being washed out, it would clearly be a case of misfeasance, not nonfeasance.\nI had some doubt on the question of the real meaning of the finding of the jury, but conclude their answer must have reference to the material used being improper; because apart from the material used the evidence was that the work was properly done.\nI base my judgment, therefore, upon the ground that the city officials in building their sidewalk on Granville Street created a condition which cast on them a duty to fill up a gap or space made by them between the two sidewalks, the concrete one on Granville Street and the asphalt one on Salter Street, that they accepted that duty and attempted to discharge it, but used improper material. As a result of such negligence, a hole was made by the rain in this connecting space between the sidewalks into which plaintiff stumbled and was injured.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I have not found it necessary to fully consider the effect of the Statute of Limitations which may possibly, when read in light of the authorities applicable thereto, dispense with any need for observing the distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance so much pressed upon us. I, therefore, pass no opinion thereon.\nI think the reasons assigned in the court below amply justify the judgment appealed from herein and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The jury was entitled to find that the appellant corporation in the exercise of their powers in relation to streets changed the physical condition of the place in question and without justification left it in such state that it was, or at any moment was likely to become without notice to the public using it a dangerous nuisance; and if that was their view there was negligence constituting \u201cmisfeasance\u201d within the meaning of the rule governing the responsibility of municipalities for the condition of highways within their boundaries. On this ground I think the verdict and judgment can be supported.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco confirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Longley awarding $2,000 damages to the respondent.\nIt was an action for damages for negligence causing personal injury to the respondent, who fell on a sidewalk of the defendant municipality.\nSome months previous to the accident some reconstruction and repairs had been made to the sidewalk where the accident occurred. A space of about two feet in that sidewalk had been filled with earth which could, according to reliable evidence, be removed by rain. The plaintiff-respondent, in stepping into the hole which had formed itself at that place, fell upon the pavement and broke her knee-cap.\nThe main point raised by the appellant corporation is that the accident was a nonfeasance on the part of the corporation and that under the common law it could not be held responsible.\nThe jury found, however, that the negligence had been established.\nThe jury could reasonably find this verdict, for the material used could be easily washed out and it constituted an act of misfeasance. I do not see any reason why this judgment of the Court of Appeal, which maintained the verdict, should be disturbed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F. H. Bell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. E. Fulton.\n[1] 47 N.S. Rep. 498.\n[2] [1893] A.C. 524.\n[3] 26 Can. S.C.R. 1.\n[4] 46 N.S. Rep. 215.\n[5] [1905] 1 K.B. 767.\n[6] 90 L.T. 210.\n[7] 45 Can.

Massie and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1914: November 23, 24, 30.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM AN APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nExpropriation\u2014Agreement to fix compensation\u2014Arbitration or valuation\u2014Powers of referees\u2014Majority decision.\nWhere the land was expropriated for railway purposes the railway company and the owner agreed to have the compensation determined by reference to three named persons called \u201cvaluers\u201d in the submission; their decision was to be binding and conclusive on both parties and not subject to appeal; they could view the property and call such witnesses and take such evidence, on oath or otherwise, as they, or a majority of them, might think proper; and either party could have a representative present at the view or taking of evidence, but his failure to attend for any reason would not affect the validity of the decision.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that this agreement did not provide for a judicial arbitration, but for a valuation merely, by the parties to whom the matter was referred, of the land expropriated.\nThe agreement provided that a valuator should be appointed by each party and a County Court judge should be the third; if one of those appointed would or could not act the party who appointed him could name a substitute; if it was the third the parties could agree on a substitute, in which case the decision of any two would be binding and conclusive without appeal; if they could not so agree a High Court judge could appoint. There was no necessity for substitution. Held, that the decision of any two of the valuators was valid and binding on the parties.\nAPPEAL from a decision of an Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario maintaining an award in a matter of expropriation of land for railway purposes.\nThe material facts are indicated by the above head-note. The agreement for submission on which the questions to be decided turn is set out in full in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nW.N. Tilley for the appellants. The agreement provided for an arbitration not a mere valuation. Compensation was to be determined not only for the land taken, but for the consequential injury to the remaining lands to determine which called for decision on questions of law. See Russell on Awards (9 ed.), page 45; Thomson v. Anderson[1], at pages 530-1; In re Carus-Wilson and Greene[2]; In re Brien and Brien[3]; Taylor v. Yielding[4].\nThe award of the original arbitrators was to be unanimous. The provision prohibiting an appeal from the award of the valuers \u201cor any two of them\u201d only makes for finality and there was already a provision as to who should make the award. See United Kingdom Mutual S.S. Assurance Association v. Houston & Co.[5]; In re O\u2019Connor and Fielder[6].\nHamilton Cassels K.C. for the respondents, referred, on the question of arbitration or valuation to the American cases of Hobson v. McArthur[7]; Quay v. Westcott[8]; Republic of Columbia v. Cauca Co.[9], and on the other question to Whiteley v. Delaney[10], contending that the evident intention of the parties that a majority could make the award in any case should not be defeated by a narrow and technical reading of the phraseology.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed and concur with the judgment of the Appellate Division that the case should go back for trial with a declaration \u201cthat the agreement between the parties provides for a valuation by the valuers named therein or a majority of them and expresses the true agreement between the parties.\u201d\nThe question argued before us is whether the agreement of reference in question provides for an arbitration or for a valuation and whether it can be fairly construed as providing for a decision by any two of the valuators named or must be unanimous.\nI think this case is one of those intermediate cases referred to by Lord Esher in In re Carus-Wilson and Greene2, where though a dispute has actually arisen it is not intended that the persons appointed to decide it shall be bound to hear evidence and that it must be decided not on any general principle, but on its own particular circumstances. Reading the agreement as a whole and with reference to the subject-matter of the reference and the circumstances under which it was entered into, I have reached the conclusion above stated.\nThe question to be determined by the valuators was the\namount of compensation for land and damages which the respondents were entitled to as owners of lands taken by the appellate railway company.\nThe agreement named three \u201cvaluers\u201d to whom that question was referred. It provided that if the valuer appointed by either party died he might substitute a new valuer, and if the \u201cthird valuer\u201d died the other valuers might agree upon a third valuer in his stead,\nand in that case the decision of any two of the valuers should be conclusive and binding without appeal.\nThen follows a covenant that the decision of the valuers should be observed and should be binding and conclusive upon the parties and\nshould not be subject to appeal from the decision of the said valuers or any two of them.\nThe agreement further provided that\nthe valuers may view the property and may at their discretion call such witnesses and take such evidence or statements on oath or otherwise as they or a majority of them may think proper and shall give such weight, if any, to such evidence or statements as they in their discretion think proper.\nConsidering the one thing referred to them, namely, the fixing of the compensation to be given the land-owner for his land taken and damages sustained, the fact not without significance that the parties are called \u201cvaluers\u201d all through the instrument and not arbitrators, and the special provision that the valuers might view the premises and decide the question submitted to them without the aid of witnesses, or if they determined to do so might hear statements from witnesses not under oath, I reach the conclusion that the submission was a valuation only and not an ordinary judicial arbitration.\nThen as to the power of two of them to make a binding decision, I revert again to the provision that in case of the death or incapacity of the third named valuer, Judge Morgan, and the inability of the two remaining valuers to agree upon an amount, it was provided that they might agree upon a third valuer, and in that case, that is where a third valuer was appointed by the other two, the decision of any two of the valuers should be conclusive and binding without appeal.\nI think that the appellant attaches more weight to this change of language than it deserves. It seems absurd and without reason to hold that in the case of the named valuers unanimity should be required, while in the other case of the death or incapacity of one of the named valuers and the appointment in his place of a third by the other two, such unanimity was dispensed with. It is clear that in the latter case any two of the valuers could make a final and conclusive decision and if it was intended to change that important fact with respect to the decision of any two of the named valuers, very clear and explicit language would be required to shew such change.\nAs I have said while the language used is inapt I think it fairly bears the construction placed upon it by Mr. Justice Hodgins speaking for the Appellate Division and that it may fairly be paraphrased thus,\nshall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to appeal. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The construction of such an instrument as now in question cannot be properly reached by the mere microscopical examination and analysis of one or more clauses or sentences therein.\nReading and construing this instrument as a whole and finding it possibly ambiguous, we should consider the nature of the business the parties had in hand, attribute to them some common sense and knowledge of the world, and keep in view their probable purpose and see if having due regard thereto and such like surrounding circumstances some sensible operative meaning can be given it.\nOf course if in face of all that it were still found that some clauses were of such an imperative nature that they must be read literally and left no room for being thus properly interpreted and modified by and harmonized with other parts or clauses, we should have to give effect thereto even if by doing so we rendered the document practically worthless as being unworkable.\nI find myself under no such necessity in the interpretation or construction of this document.\nIts meaning is very plain if we approach it in the way I suggest and then look at the clause by which the parties covenanted and bound themselves to abide by the results which might be reached by a majority of those named.\nThen it seems to me the other clauses expressly speaking of a majority acting are also each in harmony with such a purpose and need not be so read as to bear the construction thereof pressed upon us. One of these might by a little straining be so construed, but that is not its necessary or only meaning.\nAnd the clause as to exercising a discretion relative to the hearing of witnesses seems expressly designed for the purpose of enabling a majority of those voting to determine the basic facts upon which the estimate for compensation has to be made. Would it not be rather absurd that two could control the kind of facts which must necessarily guide them and yet could not execute the purpose so clearly involved? It seems to me they might, if so disposed, have thus step by step reduced the remaining problem to a pure arithmetical question and yet if the contention set up be correct they could not carry out such result by signing the certificate thereof.\nI have not had much trouble in coming to the conclusion that a majority of those named were intended to finally determine the result.\nBut when I have to say whether this is a submission to arbitration or a mere agreement for determining a valuation, I find some difficulty.\nI have, therefore, purposely put forward just now what seems to be its import and the only difficult part of the document bearing upon that question, and need not repeat same here.\nAssuming evidence by witnesses used for such a purpose, does the existence of such a power enabling it to be done involve the whole proceeding being held to be one of judicial inquiry within the meaning of that term as defined by Cockburn, C.J., in Re Hopper[11], at p. 372 and top of p. 373, or by Lord Esher in Re Dawdy[12], at p. 429 and top of p. 430, or by Mr. Justice Williams in the case of Re Hammond and Waterton[13], at p. 809.\nWe find therein no very clear-cut test of what is to be held as constituting a judicial investigation, but if I understand those cases and many others the mere permission to a majority of the valuers to examine witnesses does not of itself constitute the submission one of arbitration.\nIf they had been herein bound to hear such witnesses as either party desired, and to determine judicially according to such evidence, then it certainly might have been urged with great force that it was a submission to arbitration.\nThe purpose of the parties hereto seems to me to have been so evidently that of constituting those named mere valuers that I should feel much regret if forced to say they had failed of their purpose.\nAnd that such was their purpose surely is self-evident when regard is had to the departure from the usual method of arbitration under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nSeeing this was not dealt with by the learned trial judge I doubted our right to deal with it, but appellant\u2019s counsel did not seem disposed to raise such question, but preferred getting the opinion of this court thereon as the Court of Appeal had passed upon it.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the agreement of 2nd July, 1913, constituted a submission to arbitration.\nThe appellant company gave to the respondents notice of expropriation of part of their property pur- suant to the provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d (section 193) and offering $900\nas compensation for the said lands and premises and for all damages caused to you by the exercise of its corporate powers thereon.\nThe respondents refused to accept this sum and the appellant company obtained a warrant for (and went into) possession of the lands under the authority of section 217 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d Instead of applying to a judge for the appointment of arbitrators (under section 196) to determine the amount payable as compensation and damages which either party was entitled to do (see chapter 37, 6 & 7 Edw. VII.), the parties entered into the agreement already mentioned, making provision for the ascertainment of that amount, which agreement is in the following terms:\u2014\nMEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT made on the second day of July, 1913.\nBetween\nTHE CAMPBELLFORD, LAKE ONTARIO AND WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY, hereinafter called the Railway Co.,\nOf the one part;\nand\nROBERT F. MASSIE, ISABEL E. MASSIE and THE TORONTO GENERAL TRUSTS CORPORATION, hereinafter called the Owner,\nOf the other part.\nWHEREAS the owner now owns the lands, being part of lot number six (6), Concession B, in the Township of Hamilton, containing three acres and ninety-two hundredths of an acre (3.92), more or less, and the Railway Company is proceeding with the construction of its line of railway across the said lands, as shewn on and according to the plan thereof, a copy of which plan so far as above lands are concerned, is attached hereto.\nAND WHEREAS the Railway Company and the owner have agreed to settle the question of compensation for land and damages to which the owners of said lands are entitled under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d as hereinafter set forth.\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that the Railway Company and the owner do hereby covenant and agree that the question of the amount of compensation payable under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d by the Railway Company for the taking of the said lands for its said railway and for damages sustained by the owner by the taking of said lands and the construction and maintenance of the said railway is hereby referred to the determination of Joseph Hickson, as valuer, appointed by the Railway Company, and Nicholas Garland, as valuer, appointed on behalf of the said Owner, and His Honour Edward Morgan, as third valuer.\nAND in case either of such valuers appointed by the parties respectively shall die, refuse or become incapable to act as valuer before such question is fully determined by the said valuers as to all the lands and damages herein referred to, then the party who appointed such valuer, or the heirs, executors, or administrators of such party, shall forthwith thereafter appoint some other fit person to be valuer in the place of the valuer dying, refusing or becoming incapable to act.\nIn case the third valuer shall die, refuse or become incapable to act and the other two valuers are unable to agree upon the amount to be paid as compensation as aforesaid, they may agree upon a third valuer in his stead and in that case the decision of any two of the valuers shall be conclusive and binding without appeal; if they cannot agree upon such third valuer, a judge of the High Court Division may appoint him on the application of either party on six days\u2019 notice to the opposite party of application to the judge to make such appointment.\nNo costs in respect of proceedings in pursuance hereof shall be payable by either of the parties hereto to the other; but the Railway Company shall pay the fees of all the valuers and the costs heretofore incurred of application for warrant of possession and of motion for appointment of arbitrators if any, shall be paid as between party and party by the Railway Company to the owner. Before valuation proceeds the parties are to agree upon the crossings, if any, to be provided.\nAnd the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree that the decision of the said valuers shall be faithfully kept and observed and shall be binding and conclusive upon the said Railway Company and owner, and shall not be subject to appeal from the decision of said valuers or any two of them.\nAND the undersigned owner for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, doth hereby covenant and agree with the Railway Company, its successors and assigns, that he or they will upon tender of the amount payable to him or them as such compensation by the said valuers, with interest as hereinafter mentioned, execute and deliver to the Railway Company good and sufficient deed in fee simple free from dower and all other claims and encumbrances, vesting in the Railway Company the lands required as aforesaid, such deed to be prepared by and at the expense of the Railway Company, and the said Railway Company agrees to pay the sum of money found payable as aforesaid, with interest forthwith after the making of the said decision, execution of deed, and completion of title as aforesaid.\nThe Railway Company meanwhile to retain possession of the lands required, and to be permitted to proceed forthwith with the construction and operation of its railway and works thereon.\nThe valuers may view the property and may at their discretion call such witnesses and take such evidence or statements on oath or otherwise as they or a majority of them may think proper, and shall give such weight, if any, to such evidence or statements as they in their discretion think proper.\nEither party shall have the right to have one representative present, if desired, at any meeting of the valuers held to view the property or to take statements or evidence, but failure of such representative to attend, whether through lack of notice, or otherwise, shall not affect the validity of the decision.\nThe Company to pay interest at five per cent. per annum on the amount found from date of possession till date of payment.\nIN WITNESS whereof the Railway Company has hereunto caused its corporate seal to be affixed under the hands of its proper officers and the owners have hereunto set their hands and seals and corporate seal respectively.\nIN THE PRESENCE OF\nCAMPBELLFORD, LAKE ONTARIO AND WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY.\nD.

MASSIE.[SEAL]\nTHE TORONTO GENERAL TRUSTS CORPORATION.\n[SEAL]\nF.OSLER, President.J.W. LANGMUIR, Gen\u2019l. Manager.\nIn passing on the question whether this agreement is a submission to arbitration in the legal sense we are to be guided, I think, by the principles laid down by Lord Esher in In re Carus-Wilson and Greene[14], in these words:\u2014\nIf it appears from the terms of the agreement by which a matter is submitted to a person\u2019s decision, that the intention of the parties was that he should hold an inquiry in the nature of a judicial inquiry, and hear the respective cases of the parties, and decide upon evidence laid before him, then the case is one of an arbitration. The intention in such cases is that there shall be a judicial inquiry worked out in a judicial manner. On the other hand, there are cases in which a person is appointed to ascertain some matter for the purpose of preventing differences from arising, not of settling them when they have arisen, and where the case is not one of arbitration, but of a mere valuation. There may be cases of an intermediate kind, where, though a person is appointed to settle disputes that have arisen, still it is not intended that he shall be bound to bear evidence or arguments. In such cases it may be often difficult to say whether he is intended to be an arbitrator or to exercise some function other than that of an arbitrator. Such cases must be determined each according to its particular circumstances.\nIt is not denied that differences had arisen. Were these differences to be settled by means of a \u201cjudicial inquiry worked out in a judicial manner?\u201d The respondents rely upon the use of the term \u201cvalue\u201d as shewing that the parties contemplated a conclusion reached as a result of the application of the personal knowledge and skill of the valuators. But the language of the instrument as a whole seems to negative that suggestion.\nThe question is \u201creferred to the determination\u201d of the gentlemen selected. In certain eventualities,\nthe decision of any two of the valuers shall be final and binding and without appeal.\nThe valuers may view the property and take such evidence on oath or otherwise as they or a majority of them may think proper.\nEither party shall have the right to have one representative present, if desired, at any meeting of the arbitrators to view the property or take statements of evidence. These stipulations seem to contemplate a decision after \u201chearing the respective cases of the parties\u201d; and indeed the fact that the amount of compensation properly awardable for \u201cdamages\u201d caused by the exercise of the powers of the railway company was one of the subjects of the reference (and not merely the value of the land taken) in itself creates a presumption that such was in fact the intention of the parties. I think the instrument rightly construed does provide for an inquiry, in its nature judicial.\nOn the other point I am, with a good deal of doubt, of the opinion that a majority of the arbitrators was competent to act.\nIn the result I think the appellants are entitled to have their motion to set aside the award heard and disposed of; but as a majority of the court are for dismissing the appeal, it is not necessary to consider what would be the most convenient form of order for giving effect to the view above expressed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Not, I confess, without some hesitation, I concur in the dismissal of this appeal. Taking the document of submission as a whole it is, perhaps, made sufficiently clear that it was the intention of the parties that a binding valuation might be made by any two of the valuators whether the three originally named should act or there should be a substitution in the case of the third arbitrator. The clause providing that any two of the arbitrators might determine what evidence should be received certainly points in this direction. At all events I am not convinced that this construction of the agreement, which prevailed in the Appellate Division, is so clearly wrong that we would be justified in reversing the judgment of that court.\nNeither am I satisfied that the view of the Appellate Division that the document taken as a whole provides for a valuation and not for an arbitration is erroneous. There are, no doubt, one or two clauses in it which are not usual in agreements providing for a mere valuation. But their presence does not, I think, suffice to change the character, which it seems otherwise sufficiently manifest from the tenor of the whole instrument it was meant that it should have.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\u2014\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacMurchy & Spence.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Cassels, Brock, Kelley & Falconbridge.\n[1] L.R. 9 Eq. 523.\n[2] 18 Q.B.D. 7.\n[3] [1910] 2 Ir.

VII., ch. 66, by the limitation in section 15 of that statute (now articles 7323 and 7335 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909), but the effect of these enactments was not to repeal the provisions of article 1056 C.C., with respect to ascendant relations who were only partially dependent for support on a deceased workman to whom the statute applied. The judgment appealed from (Q.R. 23 K.B. 212), was reversed, Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nPer Davies J. dissenting.\u2014The words \u201cin all cases to which this Act applies,\u201d in the Quebec statute respecting compensation for injuries to workmen, 9 Edw. VIL, ch. 66, sec. 15, have reference to the special classes of employment referred to in the first section of the Act, and not to the classes of persons entitled to compensation thereunder. Consequently, the effect of section 15 is to limit the employers\u2019 liability to the compensation prescribed by that Act and to that only. Where no objection has been taken to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury at the trial and it does not appear that any substantial prejudice was thereby occasioned there should not be an order for a new trial under the provisions of articles 498 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe majority of the court considered that the amount of damages awarded by the jury was so grossly excessive that there should be a new trial and it was ordered accordingly unless the plaintiff agreed that the verdict should be reduced to an amount mentioned. (See art. 503 C.P.Q.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, entered by Lemieux C.J. on the verdict of the jury at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe plaintiff, the father of a conductor employed by the company who died in consequence of injuries sustained in the course of his employment on the tramway, brought the action against the company to recover damages stated at $2,500, claiming $450 for medical and hospital attendance, funeral expenses, loss incurred through the closing of his place of business during three days, and $2,050 for being deprived of the advantages and assistance which he and his family derived from the deceased. The company denied liability and set up the defence that the plaintiff, not being wholly dependent upon deceased for support, by the operation of the Quebec \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d was deprived of any recourse either under that statute or under the provisions of the Civil Code. At the trial there were no objections taken to the charge of the learned Chief Justice; the jury returned a general verdict against the company and assessed damages at $2,000, for which amount judgment was entered in the Superior Court. On an appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench this judgment was set aside, Trenholme J. dissenting, and the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nL. S. St. Laurent for the appellant.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014A difficult and interesting question which, however, because of recent amendments to the Quebec \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d is of no practical importance to any one except to the parties here, arises in the consideration of this case.\nThe plaintiff, appellant, who was, as he alleges, partially dependent for his support upon a son killed when in the service of the corporation, defendant and respondent, brought this action under article 1056 of the Quebec Civil Code, which reads:\u2014\nIn all cases where the person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi-offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction, his consort and his ascendant and descendant relations have a right, but only within a year after his death, to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi-offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by such death.\n* * * * * * *\nIn all cases no more than one action can be brought in behalf of those who are entitled to the indemnity and the judgment determines the proportion of such indemnity which each is to receive.\nIt is alleged by way of defence that the plaintiff is without recourse because of certain provisions of the Act first above referred to.\nIt is admitted that the accident which resulted in the death of the deceased comes within the definition of section 1 of the Act, but sections 15 and 3 of the Act, now articles 7335 and 7323 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, are relied upon in support of the contention that the right of action which the plaintiff undoubtedly had under the Code is barred.\nSection 15 enacts:\u2014\nThe employer shall be liable to the person injured or to his representatives mentioned in article 3 of the Act, for injuries resulting from accidents caused by or in the course of the work of such person, in the cases to which this Act applies, only for the compensation prescribed by this Act.\nThe French version reads:\u2014\nLes dommages r\u00e9sultant des accidents survenant par le fait du travail ou \u00e0 l\u2019occasion du travail dans les cas pr\u00e9vus par la pr\u00e9sente loi, ne donnent lieu, \u00e0 charge du chef d\u2019enterprise, au profit de la victims ou de ses ayants droit, tels que d\u00e9finis \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la pr\u00e9sente loi, qu\u2019aux seules r\u00e9parations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par cette loi.\nIt is obvious that the remedy given in cases like this against the employer by the Civil Code is taken away from the persons mentioned in section 3 of the Act, who are (a) the surving consort, (b) the children under a certain age, and (c) the ascendants of whom the deceased was the only support at the time of the accident. But the question here is: Can the plaintiff who admittedly does not come within this enumeration of representatives entitled to recover under the Act, being only partially dependent upon the deceased, maintain this action? Or, in other words, is the action which the plaintiff undoubtedly had under article 1056 of the Civil Code barred by the joint operation of sections 3 and 15 of the Act?\nAssuming that the Act was intended to substitute the theory of professional risk for those provisions of the Civil Code which fixed the liability of an employer in case of accident, due to his fault, and to provide a complete and comprehensive body of law in relation, to the subject of workmen\u2019s compensation for injuries received in the course of their employment, I do not think we should lightly attribute to the legislature an intention to go so far as to deprive those who are not among the enumerated beneficiaries of a right of action which they clearly had before the Act was passed.\nThe Act was evidently intended to fix in those accident cases to which it applies the conditions of liability, the amount of compensation and the method of apportionment among those entitled to its benefits, and to that extent it may be considered as exclusive. But the question remains: The plaintiff not belonging to any one of the enumerated classes specifically dealt with, is it possible to hold that by necessary intendment his admitted right of action was taken away?\nIt must be accepted as settled law that\nNo statute operates to repeal or modify the existing law, whether common or statutory, or to take away rights which existed before the statute was passed, unless the intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied. (Halsbury, vol. 27, p. 167.)\nAssuming the Civil Code to be merely a statute, it has been in force for a long time and the principle of the special article upon which the plaintiff relies was part of the law long before the enactment of that Code. It seems, therefore, reasonable that the recent Act should be construed consistently with the Code if it is possible to do so. The ordinary rule of construction is that\nif two statutes can be read together without contradiction or repugnancy or absurdity or unreasonableness, they should be so read,\nand I can see no repugnancy between the Code and the Act. They apply to different classes of persons and the conditions of liability are different.\nThose who are partially dependent upon the injured employee are left to their remedy under the Code, their right to recover continues subject to the obligation to prove that the accident was attributable to an \u201coffence or quasi-offence of the employer\u201d and to hold that this class is to be entitled to the benefit of the Act in the absence of express terms, would be to legislate for a case which the legislature has not thought proper to provide for. In a word the plaintiff bases his claim upon the Code and to defeat that claim the defendant relies upon a statute which makes no provision for this particular case. To maintain its defence the court must acid to the Act a provision which it does not contain.\nArticle 12 C.C., provides that when a law is doubtful or ambiguous it is to be interpreted so as to fulfil the intention of the legislature and to attain the object for which it was passed. Here the language of the statute leaves nothing to doubt or to uncertainty. The only question is: Are we, under the pretence of giving effect to what is alleged to be the intention of the legislature, \u201ca common but very slippery phrase,\u201d to supply what is clearly an omission in the statute. As I said before, that is not interpretation but legislation.\nMuch reliance was placed by the Chief Justice in the court below on the French Act from which the Quebec Act is taken and the jurisprudence that has grown out of that Act in France. But it must be borne in mind that the language of section 15 in question here differs somewhat from that of the French model which reads (art. 7):\u2014 Les ouvriers et employ\u00e9s d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ne peuvent se pr\u00e9valoir, \u00e0 raison des accidents dont ils sont victimes dans leur travail, d\u2019aucunes dispositions autres que celles de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nIn France it is held that the ordinary right of action on the part of the representatives of the deceased is entirely taken away (Cabouet, vol. 1, No. 392; Sachet, vol. 1, No. 754), but the French article 7 uses the expression \u201cla victime ou ses repr\u00e9sentants\u201d without limitation, whereas section 15 of the Quebec Act has deliberately altered that expression and, in terms, limits those entitled to the benefit of the Act to those previously enumerated in section 3, and the Quebec section 3 substitutes the words \u201cof whom the deceased was the only support\u201d for the words used in the French Act which are \u201cchacun des ascendants et descendants qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 sa charge.\u201d The words used in section 3 in the Quebec Act are unambiguous. The benefits of the Act are given to the ascendants of the deceased of whom he was the only support at the time of the accident, whereas the French model applies to all ascendants without distinction. The French authorities are, therefore, of little use. On the whole, I am of opinion that the Act may be and should be construed to mean that those whom the deceased did not support entirely are left to their action under the Gode, they must prove fault on the part of the employer and also the extent to which they have been prejudiced in a pecuniary way by the death of the deceased. There seems to be good reason for the distinction because of the uncertainty which exists in the case of those only partially dependent as to the quantum of their right. The case is not free from doubt, but I think, all things considered, it is impossible to say that the statute has, by implication, taken away a vested right of action when it is possible to so construe it as to leave that right subsisting.\nI find some support for this view in the French cases where the question has arisen as to whether the enumeration of section 1 of the Act is limitative or exhaustive. The French writers seem to favour the restricting of the cases to which the law applies to those specially mentioned in the statute for the reason that it is an innovation upon the common law; the same reason would seem to me to apply to the question which has arisen here; Dal. 1902, 2, 330; 1907, 1.85.\nThere has been some criticism of the judge\u2019s charge but, as has been very frequently said (Clark v. Molyneux[2]; Blue v. Red Mountain Railway Co.[3]; Barthe v. Huard[4]), a summing up is not to be rigorously criticized, and it would not be right to set aside the verdict of a jury because in the course of a long and elaborate summing up the judge has used language which, detached from the context, might appear inaccurate; the whole charge must be read together in order to determine whether it afforded a fair guide to the jury. A new trial is not granted on the ground of misdirection unless some substantial prejudice was thereby occasioned. Art. 500 C.P.Q. In Barthe v. Huard4, Sir Louis Davies said (at page 409):\u2014\nIt is possible that if the learned judge\u2019s attention had been called to this language and its full meaning at the time, and objection taken to it, he would have corrected the apparently misleading direction before the jury had retired or if they had already retired, before they had agreed upon their verdict, but no such objection was taken at the time. This only goes to shew the imperative necessity of courts of appeal insisting, when asked to grant new trials as a matter of right, that only objections to particular statements made by the judge in his charge to the jury will be considered or given effect to when it is shewn that objection has been taken to them at a time when their misleading character can be corrected before the jury.\nNo objection was taken to the charge (arts. 498 (3) and 500 C.P.Q.) and no reference is made to misdirection in the reasons in support of the inscription in appeal before the Court of King\u2019s Bench (art. 493 C.P.Q.).\nAs to the question of the amount of the verdict I would have been disposed to follow the rule laid down in Taff Vale Railway Co. v. Jenkins[5]:\u2014\nWhen once you have got it that there was evidence to go to the jury, and that there was a principle on which it could proceed of taking into account any reasonable prospective pecuniary advantage to the parents, then, unless the verdict is so perverse and against the weight of evidence that it cannot stand, it is not for the court to interfere.\nBut I defer to the opinion of my colleagues and agree to a new trial unless the appellant accepts a reduction in the amount of damages awarded. (See Barthe v. Huard[6].)\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court, but the opinion of the majority is that the amount of damages awarded is so grossly excessive there must be a new trial (costs of first trial to abide the event), unless the plaintiff agrees that the verdict should be reduced to the sum of $1,250, in which case there would be judgment for that amount with costs of the trial and of this court.\nDavies J. (dissenting):\u2014At the conclusion of the argument, I inclined to the opinion, which further consideration has confirmed, that the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, (appeal side,) was right and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI think the legislative scheme of insurance by employers against \u201caccidents happening to workmen by reason of or in course of their work\u201d up to a fixed amount embodied in the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d of Quebec, 9 Edw. VII. ch. 66, and subsequently made part of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909), was a substitution for the former liability of the employer for fault or negligence as declared and enacted in the Code (chapter 3), and was intended to be and is complete in itself. It was, if I may so call it, compromise legislation as between the respective so-called common law obligations and rights of the employers and employees and their representatives.\nPreviously to the passage of that Act the liability of the employer was confined to cases when fault or negligence causing the injury or death complained of was found either in him or in his servants and workmen. Those entitled to recover damages arising from such fault or injury were in cases of death of the injured person inter alia his ascendant and descendant relations who were either wholly or partially dependent upon him for their support. Only one action could be brought on behalf of those entitled to indemnity and the judgment determined the proportion which each was entitled to receive.\nAll this was changed by the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d Fault or negligence were no longer necessary to be proved in order to sustain an action. The maximum of the employer\u2019s liability was fixed: he became an insurer of his workmen up to that maximum and the classes entitled to share in the indemnity were designated. Ascendants only partially maintained or supported by the deceased were omitted from those entitled to share in the indemnity.\nSection 1 of the Act enacts that accidents to workmen, apprentices and employees engaged in any of the works or industries therein mentioned shall entitle the person injured or his representatives to compensation as subsequently provided in the Act and that\nthe Act shall not apply to agricultural industries nor to navigation by means of sails.\nThen follow provisions regulating the extent and amount of compensation payable in cases where the accident causes incapacity either absolute and permanent or permanent and partial or temporary, and also where death is caused and in the latter case the persons and classes entitled to compensation.\nSection 15 provides as follows:\u2014\nThe employer shall be liable to the person injured or to his representatives mentioned in article 3 of this Act for injuries resulting from accidents caused by or in the course of the work of such person, in the cases to which this Act applies, only for the compensation prescribed by this Act.\nIt is contended on the part of the appellant that as compensation is payable under section 3 only to ascendants of whom the deceased was the only support at the time of the accident, ascendants who were partially supported by the deceased not being included still retain their former rights of action under the Code.\nThe results of this contention, if successful, would be curious and I venture to think unlooked for. The new statutory but limited liability of the employer as an insurer for accidents to his workmen created by the statute would not, as was supposed, be substituted for the old unlimited common law liability entirely. The class eliminated from those entitled to share in the statutory damages, namely, partially dependent ascendants, would still continue to retain their former rights of action and the liability of the employer as to them would still be subject to the determination of a jury.\nThe results could possibly if not probably be that ascendants of, whom the deceased were the sole support would, in many cases, be worse off with their share of the statutory damage that ascendants receiving only partial support from the deceased would be whose damages were fixed by a jury. The employer, while assuming new and onerous obligations would be subject not to one action with a maximum statutory damage, but to several actions in some of which the amount of damages would be uncertain and the very basis on which the legislative compact or compromise rested would disappear. Instead of being an insurer with a liability fixed, but divorced from questions of fault or negligence, he would continue in that relation so far as ascendants wholly supported by the deceased workman were concerned but would also carry in addition the common law liability so far as ascendants only partially supported by the deceased workmen were concerned.\nOf course, it was easy to cite cases of supposed hardship upon parties who under chapter 3 of the Code were formerly entitled to recover damages and were deprived of their right under the Act I am construing. But it must be remembered that the Act was in itself a legislative compromise on a most difficult and perplexing question and it certainly would not be surprising if such a legislative compromise enactment resulted in some personal hardships.\nThe argument that the ascendants of whom the deceased was the partial support are not deprived of their former right of action under articles 1053 and following of the Code because they are not expressly so deprived by the statute loses much of its weight in my mind because, first, of the compromise character of the legislation, secondly, because there is no express deprivation of the former right under the Code of any ascendant, even of those who are entitled to share in the statutory compensation \u2014 they being only excluded under the general provisions of section 15 \u2014 thirdly, because of the provision in the Code, article 1056, that there shall be only one action brought against any person responsible for the death of another by or on behalf of those entitled to indemnity in consequence of such death, and the judgment in such action determines the proportion of such indemnity which each is to receive. Fourthly, because the legislature has expressly reserved the so-called common law rights of parties in cases where they thought it desirable these rights should be reserved. On the last point I refer to section 4 of the Act which declares that if a foreign workman or his representatives\ncannot take advantage of this Act the common law remedy shall exist in his or their favour,\nand section 14 which reserves and continues the common law rights of the person injured or his representatives in addition to the statutory recourse, against persons responsible for the accident other than the employer, his servants or agents.\nThe legislature had its attention expressly drawn to the reservation of these so-called common law rights and in cases where it desired them to be continued so declared. I do not think the courts should add another section to the Act continuing these rights as regards other classes than those declared to be entitled to share in the statutory compensation. Lastly, I construe section 15, above quoted, as limiting the employer\u2019s liability to the compensation prescribed by the Act and to that only, in all cases to which the Act applies, and I hold the Act applies in cases where the deceased workman and the employer sued, are within its provisions quite irrespective of the parties or classes entitled to share in the distribution of the statutory compensation which may in any action be awarded. The words \u201cin all cases to which this Act applies\u201d have reference to the special classes of employment, stated in the first section, to which alone the Act is applicable, and have no reference to the different classes of people, ascendants or descendants, wholly or partially dependent upon the deceased, which the Act declares to be entitled to share in the statutory compensation.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s son when acting as conductor on respondent\u2019s street railway received fatal injuries under such circumstances as would give the father a right of action in virtue of article 1056 of the Code. That article so far as relates to our present purpose reads as follows:\u2014\n1056. In all cases where the person injured by the commission of an offence or a quasi-offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction, his consort and his ascendant and descendant relations have a right, but only within a year after his death, to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi-offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by such death. The action was brought accordingly and the case tried by Mr. Justice Lemieux with a jury who rendered a verdict of $2,000 damages. Judgment was entered accordingly. On appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Quebec that court set aside the judgment and dismissed the action. Mr. Justice Trenholme dissented, but thought the damages should be reduced to $1,200.\nThe question raised is whether or not the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d 9 Edw. VII. (Quebec), ch. 66, has taken away the right of action given by the Code.\nIt is quite clear that if the father cannot rely upon the Code he has no remedy. For the said Act only gives relief to\nascendants of whom the deceased was the only support at the time of the accident.\nThe solution of the question turns upon the construction of section 15 of the Act which is as follows:\n15. The employer shall be liable to the person injured or to his representatives mentioned in article 3 of this Act, for injuries resulting from accidents caused by or in the course of the work of such person, in the cases to which this Act applies, only for the compensation prescribed by this Act.\nIt is argued that this section must be read as if the old law had been repealed in its relation to such a case as this either by the express terms of the section or by its interpretation when read in light of the purview of the whole statute and the only remedy a father can have must be within the provisions of the Act.\nIt seems to me I must say, with great respect, absurd to read this section as in itself repealing the above article of the Code. It is an enabling statute and gives new rights of action which reach to cases of accidental injuries in certain employments whether by the fault or without fault of any one and in those cases takes away the remedy resting upon any other.\nIts very language is only made applicable to, and I submit is restricted to, \u201ccases to which this Act applies.\u201d But it is said that we must read the whole Act and especially the terms of what appears in what is now article 7321 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, which, omitting the enumerated employments specified, is as follows:\u2014\nAccidents happening by reason of or in course of their work to workmen, apprentices and employees engaged in the work of * * * shall entitle the person injured or his representatives to compensation ascertained in accordance with the following provisions.\nThis sub-section shall not apply to agricultural industries nor to navigation by means of sails.\nHow much further can such language carry us towards holding article 1056 C.C., is repealed, save as to cases to which this Act applies?\nAnd article 7323 R.S.Q., provides as follows:\u2014\n7323. When the accident causes death, the compensation shall consist of a sum equal to four times the average yearly, wages of the deceased at the time of the accident, and shall in no case, except in the case mentioned in article 7325, be less than one thousand dollars or more than two thousand dollars.\nThere shall further be paid a sum of not more than twenty-five dollars for medical and funeral expenses, unless the deceased was a member of an association bound to provide, and which does provide therefor.\nThe compensation shall be payable as follows:\u2014\n* * * * * * *\n(c) To ascendants of whom the deceased was the only support at the time of the accident.\nHow does that help us to extend the meaning of the section 15, above quoted, defining liability?\nI am unable to see anything therein to aid respondent\u2019s argument. I see much to destroy its effect. For to give effect to it the old mother or grandmother dependent upon say two of her descendants for support, if deprived by the death of one, perhaps the main support, caused by the most abominable conduct of his employer, is left without any remedy.\nShe is to be told by the courts that the legislature has deliberately taken away her bread and given her instead this stone which she cannot use.\nSurely such a method of interpretation and construction of a statute as leads to such results by repealing merely by implication a most beneficent statute of long standing which indeed is alleged by some to be but declaratory of ancient common law, has something wrong in it.\nIn short the Act formulated a scheme of insurance against accidents, for the benefit of those brought within its express terms in the circumstances to which these terms are fitted and only applied to such, and any implication of repeal of the old law is bounded thereby and extends no further. It sounds plausible to say that the employers as classified contribute on the basis of that being in full for liability or expenses on score of accidents in their business. But that is not so, for there are the cases expressly excepted by the Act, and this unprovided for class only forms one more. To argue from the express extension for the inclusion of all others stretches further than common sense can carry us. The maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius is not of universal application.\nWith deference, I must conclude the Court of King\u2019s Bench judgment cannot be upheld.\nThe respondent then argues if we so hold that it is entitled to a new trial by reason of the misdirection of the learned trial judge in charging the jury. Two answers to this are apparent when we read the whole charge and the proceedings at the trial.\nThe learned trial judge did use rather warm language in a sentence or two of his charge, but I think that was cured by his specific instructions at the close of his charge which was somewhat lengthy, but most lucid.\nThe other answer is that no objection was taken to the charge and hence such ground cannot be taken now. If it struck the hearers as the sentences culled therefrom may strike us, I think objection would have been taken.\nThe case of Barthe v. Huard[7] is relied upon to overcome this difficulty.\nAs I read that case it does not help one bit to overcome this answer.\nIn that case there was a long list of objections filed at the trial or immediately after the verdict, and whether as the result of some prior understanding or not does not appear from the report or the original record on file here.\nIt is quite evident from the terms of the chief judgment in the case that objections of some kind to the charge must have been considered by the majority of the court as taken so that they could be looked at.\nFor my part I found, as did another member of this court, that the learned trial judge had improperly rejected material evidence which he should have admitted and the question then was whether or not there had been some substantial prejudice occasioned thereby and, rightly or wrongly, it seemed pertinent in such a case to look at the course of the trial and especially the judge\u2019s charge to see if there could be found to be such prejudice.\nWhether we are right or wrong in all this may be arguable. But certainly there is no distinct ruling in that case such as needed to maintain the objection to the charge in this case when no objection thought of until the court of appeal and the trial is found otherwise properly conducted.\nI pass no opinion upon our possibly inherent jurisdiction, which must be bounded by that of the court of appeal to interfere in a case where there has been a mistrial yet no sort of objection taken.\nAll I need say if it exists, which I doubt, this is not the sort of case in which to invoke it.\nThere is a distinct ground taken which is open, if the facts justify it. That is that the amount awarded by the verdict is excessive.\nIn the consideration of that I should be disposed to take, as I did in the Barthe Case[8], notice of the learned judge\u2019s charge.\nI was disposed at the argument, listening to the reading of the sentences taken by counsel from the charge, to think that blame for the verdict might rest there.\nA more careful consideration of the charge as a whole leads me to think that on the whole, and especially towards the close thereof, it was fair and could not necessarily have misled the jury.\nI have a very decided repugnance to interfering with the verdict of the jury in any case on the grounds of excessive damages. Not that I approve of excessive damages being allowed. The misconduct of a defendant, if gross, may aggravate the damages. And in this case there does seem to have been such negligence.\nBut to put the parties to the wretched experience and anxiety, to say nothing of costs, of another trial all for the sake of a few hundred dollars here or there, seems most undesirable. And this court, for many years, has never interfered for that cause alone. Indeed, the case of Central Vermont Railway Co. v. Franch\u00e8re[9] seems to be the last of the kind and there misdirection also existed. It has only in recent times interfered if the principle of assessing damages has not been properly explained to the jury. Here at the closing of his charge the learned judge correctly explained the law and shewed that it was financial loss alone which must be basis of the assessment of damages. Then the $100 a year sworn to as benefit of services of deceased to the father and what he had habitually paid the mother were on such a basis considerations which left a wide field for the jury to act upon.\nThe practice of appealing here only upon such a ground has almost disappeared. Bather than revive it I should refuse it herein though I think if I had to assess damages I should put them at Mr. Justice Trenholme\u2019s figures. There is no cross-appeal.\nThe notice of reasons assigned by the respondent in appealing below claimed no material loss, but failed to take the ground of excessive damages in estimating them. I do not think a mere denial of the existence of any material on which to found in law a verdict should be treated as synonymous with what is required by the term excessive damages, namely, an admission express or implied of liability coupled with a denial of its accurate and proper measurement. Hence a cross-appeal was needed.\nI do not think it should now be allowed as mere matter of discretion. If the next jury should, as has been known to happen where local courts have used such discretion, give same verdict or greater, what should he done? Travel back here? If the court below had interfered in such a way we should not have reversed on that ground alone.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nDuff J. \u2014 The appellant claims compensation under article 1056 of the Civil Code for loss suffered by him in consequence of the death of his son whose death was found by the jury to have been occasioned by the negligence of the respondents. Article 1056 provides that\nin all cases where the person injured by the commission of an offence or quasi-offence dies in consequence, without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction * * * his ascendant * * * relations have a right * * * to recover from the person who committed the offence or quasi-offence, or his representatives, all damages occasioned by such death.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench held that the right of action which formerly would have accrued under this article to the appellant has been taken away by the provisions of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d 9 Edw. VII. ch. 66. The last named enactment does not profess to repeal or amend the provisions of article 1056. The view upon which the Court of King\u2019s Bench proceeded was that it was a necessary implication to be found in the provisions of the Act that persons in the situation of the appellant were after the passing of the Act to be deprived of the recourse provided for in that article.\nThat opinion, as I understand it, rests upon section 15 of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d which is in the following terms:\u2014\n15. The employer shall be liable to the person injured or to his representatives mentioned in article 3 of this Act, for injuries resulting from accidents caused by or in the course of the work of such person, in the cases to which this Act applies only for the compensation prescribed by this Act.\nThe case before us is not, in my opinion, one of \u201cthe cases to which this Act applies.\u201d Such cases are ascertained\u2014(1) by the nature of the employment of the person injured (sec. 1); (2) by the scale of wages (sec. 6); (3) as regards representatives entitled to compensation by the fact that they fall within the class and answer the descriptions in section 3. In the present case the requirements of the Act as regards the matters numbered (1) and (2) are no doubt satisfied; but the plaintiff does not fall within any of the descriptions of persons who, as representatives, are under section 3 entitled to the benefits of the Act; ascendants entitled to those benefits being limited to those of whom the deceased was the only support at the time of the accident.\nIt is to be observed that the right to recover damages under article 1056 exists only where death has ensued as a consequence of a delict or quasi-delict, the effect of the construction adopted in the court of appeal being that the right of action for wrongs having such consequences would be wholly taken away from persons in the situation of the appellant. I think that such effect ought not to be given to a statutory enactment unless the intention of the legislature to take away the right of action is satisfactorily evidenced by the language employed. I do not think that satisfactory evidence of such an intention is to be found in section 15.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am, with great respect, unable to accept the interpretation which the Court of King\u2019s Bench has placed upon the \u201cEmployers\u2019 Liability Act,\u201d R.S.Q., 1909, arts. 7321, 7323, and 7335. That Act takes away certain rights of action which existed under the provisions, of the Civil Code, art. 1056. A statute, especially one of this character, should not, upon any assumption or presumption of mistake or omission on the part of the legislature in the expression of its intention (Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel[10]; Cowper Essex v. Local Board of Acton[11]), be treated as extinguishing rights of action which it does not expressly or by necessary implication abrogate.\nNor is it permissible to treat a statute, contrary to the expressed meaning, as embracing or excluding cases merely because of a probable view as to legislative intent and because no good reason appears for their inclusion or exclusion, as the case may be (Denn v. Reid[12]; Nixon v. Phillips[13]), or to indulge in conjecture as to what the legislature would have done if the particular case under consideration had been brought to its attention. Attorney-General v. Noyes[14]; Rex v. Inhabitants of Barham[15]; Coe v. Lawrence[16]; Jones v. Smart[17].\nThe liability of the employer to the persons \u201cmentioned in article 7323\u201d is dealt with and restricted by article 7335. His liability to other persons is not touched. To read article 7335 as applicable to cases not within its terms is to legislate, not to interpret. To act upon an assumption of legislative intent which has not been explicitly stated is always attended with some danger; to do so where the result is to take away existing rights of action, if ever justifiable, can be so only where the necessary intendment is so certain from the scope and language of the statute itself that the court has before it what is tantamount to an actual expression of that purpose. Several provisions of the Quebec statute, notably article 7324, make it clear that the legislature did not, even within the specified classes, mean to substitute the statutory compensation for the liability of the employer under article 1056 C.C. in all cases in which his employee is the victim of an accident in the course of his work (art. 7321). It would rather seem to be the scheme of the legislation to substitute the statutory compensation only in the cases specified and in favour of the persons mentioned for the damages to which such persons would formerly have been entitled had an occurrence resulting in injury to an employee been occasioned by some fault ascribable to the employer, and to leave other cases and the rights of other persons in stat\u00fb quo. I find nothing in the statute which indicates an intention to deprive of a right to recover damages under article 1056 C.C, persons to whom it affords no substituted relief \u2014 certainly nothing which would justify holding that such is its necessary intendment. Moreover, upon such a construction the words in article 7335, \u201cto the person injured or to his representatives mentioned in article 7323\u201d are given no effect. Article 7335 is read as if these words were entirely omitted. Another fundamental canon of construction is thus Violated. Stone v. Corporation of Yeovil[18]; Gaudet v. Brown[19]; Presbytery of Auchterarder v. Earl of Kinnoull[20].\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that, because the plaintiff \u2014 as an ascendant of whom the deceased was not \u201cthe only support\u201d \u2014is not within the class of persons (art. 7323) to whom article 7335 declares that the employer shall be liable \u201conly for the compensation prescribed by this sub-section,\u201d his legal right of action under article 1056 C.C., has not been taken away.\nThe circumstances under which the plaintiff\u2019s son was killed were such that, apart from misdirection, the finding of fault on the part of the defendants cannot be impeached. No objection was taken to the charge as is required by articles 489(3) and 506 C.P.Q. Nor was misdirection stated as a ground of appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench as is prescribed by article 499 C.P.Q. While the charge was undoubtedly open to grave objection in the passages dealing with the scope of the defendants\u2019 duty and as calculated to lead the jury to award excessive damages \u2014so much so that, if exception had been duly taken, the defendants, subject to the provisions of article 500 C.P.Q., would have been entitled to have the verdict based upon it set aside \u2014 their disregard of the rules has deprived them of that right.\nBut the damages awarded are so large that from their very excess it is manifest that the jury was either \u201cinfluenced by improper motives or led into error.\u201d Article 550 C.P.Q. The deceased, who was 21 years of age, was employed by the defendants as a street-car conductor. He was at work for ten hours every day. He lived with his father, contributing towards the family expenses $4 a fortnight and occasionally some articles of clothing for his younger brothers and sisters. He sometimes helped his father in the confectioner\u2019s shop kept by him. But any such assistance must have been very slight and of trifling value. The cost of the young man\u2019s board must have equalled, if it did not exceed, the value of anything which he gave in return. The plaintiff claims that he spent $418 in connection with the funeral of the deceased, of which only $110 was paid to the undertaker and $63 to the Church, including cost of burial and tombstone. The balance was expended, according to the plaintiff\u2019s account, in extra household expenses and mourning. It appears that he had not to bear any medical expenses. Nothing is said of any estate which the deceased may have left. Apart from the apparently extravagant expenditure in connection with the funeral, etc. (something certainly not to be encouraged), it is difficult to see from the evidence what pecuniary loss his son\u2019s death occasioned to the plaintiff. While I think that $750 would represent the maximum damages which he should recover, I am not prepared to dissent from the opinion of the majority of my colleagues as to the amount that may be allowed.\nThis seems to be a proper case for the exercise of the power conferred by article 503 C.P.Q. If the plaintiff will consent, the judgment in his favour for damages rendered by the trial judge may be restored to the extent of $1,250. If he declines to accept a judgment for that amount there will be a new trial.\nBrodeur J. (dissident).\u2014Je suis d\u2019opinion de confirmer le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel.\nEn vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 1056 du Code Civil, les ascendants d\u2019une victime avaient le droit de poursuivre l\u2019auteur du d\u00e9lit, mais si cette victime avait un conjoint et des enfants il ne pouvait \u00eatre port\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule action pour tous ceux qui avaient droit \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\nLa loi de 1909 a modifi\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 du patron dans les accidents du travail.\nLes ouvriers ou leurs repr\u00e9sentants devaient, sous l\u2019empire du code, prouver la faute du ma\u00eetre pour pouvoir r\u00e9ussir dans leur poursuite.\nOn a substitu\u00e9 par la nouvelle l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la faute le risque professionnel. Les dommages sous l\u2019empire du code pouvaient \u00eatre accord\u00e9s pour des sommes tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables; mais maintenant ces dommages, dans les accidents ordinaires du travail, ne sauraient exc\u00e9der $2,000. Les ascendants pouvaient autrefois r\u00e9clamer tous les dommages que leur causait le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime du d\u00e9lit. Mais le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a conserv\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 l\u2019ascendant que si la victime \u00e9tait son seul soutien. Il est bien vrai qu\u2019il n\u2019est plus oblig\u00e9 de prouver faute de la part du patron; mais, d\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, ses droits sont restreints au cas o\u00f9 son fils \u00e9tait son seul soutien.\nL\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend cependant que si le p\u00e8re avait d\u2019autres moyens de subsistance il pourrait tout de m\u00eame poursuivre le patron sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du code civil.\nIl y aurait l\u00e0 anomalie, si cette pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, car les enfants et le conjoint sont oblig\u00e9s de s\u2019unir pour instituer leur poursuite. Or, on se trouverait en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un conjoint et d\u2019enfants dont la r\u00e9clamation ne pourrait pas d\u00e9passer $2,000, tandis que l\u2019ascendant, s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas la victime pour seul soutien pourrait poursuivre, lui, pour une somme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que $2,000. Il serait oblig\u00e9 de prouver faute de la part du patron, tandis que les enfants et le conjoint ne seraient pas tenus \u00e0 cela.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus rationnelle est, suivant moi, que l\u2019ascendant, dans le cas d\u2019un accident du travail, comme dans le cas actuel, ne peut r\u00e9clamer que sous l\u2019empire de la loi de 1909 et que son recours, qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait sous le code, lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 par cette nouvelle l\u00e9gislation.\nNotre loi des accidents du travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur la l\u00e9gislation fran\u00e7aise. Elle diff\u00e8re quelque peu dans les termes mais les principes sont les m\u00eames. Or, en France, on d\u00e9cide invariablement que l\u2019ascendant n\u2019a pas d\u2019autre recours que celui que la loi des accidents du travail lui donne.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Choquette, Galipeault, St. Laurent, Metayer & Lafert\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondents: B\u00e9dard, Lavergne & Pr\u00e9vost.\n[1] Q.R. 23 K.B. 212.\n[2] 3 Q.B.D. 237, at p. 243.\n[3] [1909] A.C. 361, at pp. 367 and 368.\n[4] 42 Can.

Several years later the committee were relieved of their duty and the building fund ceased to exist, and during the year previous to the death of the testatrix the original debt in respect of which the building fund had been established was fully paid. There remained, however, at the time of her death balances of debt still due for expenses incurred for other building purposes. In an action to have the bequest declared to have elapsed on account of failure in its ulterior disposition,\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 46 S.C. 97), Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that, in the circumstances of the case, the bequest must be construed as a bounty to the trustees of the church for the purposes of building expenses, including debts incurred for such purposes subsequent to the construction of the church; that the motive of the testatrix was not to make a contribution to any particular fund, but to benefit the congregation in respect to its building liabilities generally, and that the legacy did not lapse in consequence of the \u201cbuilding fund\u201d having ceased to exist and the extinction of the debt in regard to which contributions to that fund were to be applied.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\u2014It was of the essence of the gift that it should be capable, at the time of the death of the testatrix, of being applied in furtherance of the specific purpose for which the \u201cbuilding fund\u201d had been instituted and, that having become impossible, it lapsed under the provisions of article 964 of the Civil Code.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal[1], affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Dunlop, in the Superior Court, District of Montreal.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nC. M. Holt K.C. and W. F. Chipman for the appellant.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question at issue between the parties on this appeal relates to the validity of a bequest in a will made in notarial form, at Montreal, in May, 1892, by a lady who died at a very advanced age, in 1909.\nThe clause of the will in dispute is in these words:\nSecondly, I give, devise and bequeath unto the Trustess of the Building Fund of St. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Wellington Street, in the City of Montreal, those two certain houses situate in the St. Gabriel Ward of the said City of Montreal, fronting on Rush-brooke Street and bearing the numbers forty-eight and fifty (48 and 50) of said street, with the property upon which the said houses are erected as now belonging to me said testatrix. To have, hold and enjoy said property unto said trustees, their successors and assigns as their absolute property in virtue hereof.\nWe are asked to say what the intention of the testatrix was when she used this language to describe the devisees.\nA brief statement of the circumstances under which the bequest was made will, I believe, materially help us to understand the sense in which the late Mrs. Boyd must be presumed to have used the words in which she expressed her intention in respect of this portion of her estate for, as a very eminent judge said,\nall writings tacitly refer to the existing circumstances under which they are made.\nI have also present to my mind the rule of the Quebec Code, article 12, that where a law is doubtful or ambiguous it is to be interpreted so as to give effect to it and, as Laurent says, Vol. 14, No. 292,\nil en doit \u00eatre de m\u00eame des testaments qui sont des lois d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat priv\u00e9.\nSee also the articles of the Civil Code, 1013-1021, which relate to the interpretation of contracts, and Martin v. Lee[2].\nWhen the will was made and at the death of the testatrix, there was in Montreal a congregation known as \u201cSt. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church,\u201d of which the testatrix had been at all times a very zealous member. That congregation had a legal existence, and its property was held in the name of the trustees, now respondents, under the authority of the Quebec statute, 38 Vict., ch. 62, section 4 of which reads:\u2014\nWhenever any congregation, society or mission, in communion or connection with said united church, shall hereafter be desirous of acquiring any land, or real property of any description whatsoever, for the site of any church, chapel, meeting-house, school, manse, glebe, burial-ground, or appurtenances thereto, the same may be acquired by trustees for any one or more of the said objects, which shall be designated in the deed of acquisition, and by any name assumed in said deed, sufficient to shew the connection or communion of its members with said united church, and the locality where such congregation, society or mission is to be established; and such deed shall not require to be registered at any prothonotary\u2019s office, but shall be subject to the ordinary laws of registration applicable to individuals, and such congregation, society or mission shall be entitled to acquire, take or hold lands and real estate, for the purposes aforesaid, without license, in mortmain.\nSome years before the will was made a committee was appointed by the congregation to raise a building fund for the purchase of a site for a new church and to provide for its construction. In due course the property was acquired, and the church was finished in 1891, but not completely paid for. The will was made in 1892. It appears by the trustees\u2019 annual report for the year ending 31st December, 1893, that the church property was heavily encumbered and there was, in addition, a large floating indebtedness. The same conditions continued to exist in 1894. More prosperous days appeared in 1897 and it was then decided to close the building and sinking funds and open a mortgage fund to provide for the payment of the capital and interest of the debt due on the church property. The Building Fund Committee then passed out of existence, although there was outstanding a mortgage on the property of over $12,000. The importance of this will be more apparent when I come to consider the objections made to the validity of the bequest. In 1901 the congregation found it\nvery necessary to the upbuilding of the church that the musical part of the services should be of a high order,\nand it was resolved to purchase a suitable organ which apparently cost something over $2,000. In 1903 the mortgage fund was merged into the revenue fund and in the same year a new building was substituted for the annex to the church at a cost of about $5,000, a contract was let for repairs, and the erection of \u201cMacVicar Hall\u201d to accommodate the Sunday School pupils was decided on. This hall is part of the religious establishment and is connected with the church by a passage-way. In 1907 there appears to have been a very full discussion of different schemes formulated to liquidate the mortgage indebtedness on the church proper. Increased efforts were put forward in 1908 and, finally, it was announced at a meeting held in January, 1909, not that the liabilities of the congregation had been liquidated, but that the balance due on the mortgage was paid off. The deceased, who was throughout, as I have already said, a very active church member, died on the 5th August, 1909, without making any change in her will.\nAt that time, as was found by the trial judge,\nthere was a debt upon \u201cMacVicar Hall,\u201d which is part of the church property under the control of the trustees, of $3,750; there was a debt upon the manse of $4,500, and upon the organ installed in the church of between two and three thousand dollars. Then there were always repairs, improvements, extensions and depreciations to be provided for, to which the legacy could properly be applied and which are clearly covered by the intention of the testatrix.\nThe contention now put forward is that the legacy lapsed because the specific fund designated by the testatrix as \u201cthe building fund\u201d ceased to exist in 1897 at a time when, as I have already pointed out, the financial condition of the congregation was at its worst. The church property was then burdened with a very heavy mortgage and consequently most in need of the help which clearly the testatrix intended to give when she made her will; and to hold that the bequest lapsed when the building fund was merged in the mortgage fund is, I respectfully submit, to effectually defeat the clearly expressed intention of the testatrix which was, not to aid any particular fund, but to assist in making provision for the buildings necessary to effectively carry on the religious work of a congregation with limited means in which she was deeply interested.\nLet us now examine the will. I think we are all agreed that the devisees are the trustees of the church and that the will must be construed as if the devise read,\nI give to the trustees of St. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church for the purposes of the building fund.\nIt is not contended that the trustees were not competent to take or that they are not sufficiently identified, but it is said the purpose (motif) to which the proceeds of the legacy were to be applied had ceased to exist at the death of the testatrix and, therefore, the legacy lapsed.\nThis is not a case of lapsed legacy in the ordinary meaning of the term (arts. 900, 904 C.C.) nor is it a bequest to trustees under articles 868 and 869 C.C. The objection urged by the appellant does not appear to be based upon any particular provision in the Code, but I presume the intention of the appellant is to bring the bequest within the application of a principle well known in the civil law as\nlegs devenu caduc pour cause de cessation du motif pour lequel le testateur a fait le legs.\nThe distinction between this kind of legacy and a conditional legacy with which it is sometimes confounded, is well explained by Pothier, vol. 1, page 425, Nos. 67 and 68. See also 14 Laurent, at page 309, No. 292. There is no uncertainty or ambiguity as to the intention of the testatrix. Her intention was to leave her property to the trustees of the church to which she belonged\u2014 to be applied by them, as I have already said, to the building needs of the congregation and the reference to the building fund was merely to indicate the agency through which at that time the funds for the building were being collected.\nThe trustees take the bequest in their quality as trustees, subject to the obligation to apply it to the purpose mentioned in the will of the testatrix, and at her death that property vested in them conditionally upon their accounting for the disposition they made of it. The effect of such a testamentary disposition is very clearly explained by Pothier, Vol. 1, page 425, No. 68, and at page 443, No. 116. The committee appointed to collect for the building fund could not take, they had no legal independent existence, they were merely subordinate agents appointed temporarily by the congregation for a specific purpose. They had no title to the property or to the possession of any of the buildings of the congregation beyond that of any of their fellow-worshippers. To hold that when the building committee was dissolved the bequest was at an end, would be to say that, although the building liability which the bequest was intended to provide for continued to exist, the trustees were not to get the benefit of it because one of the agencies through which it was expected to raise funds had failed to accomplish that purpose.\nI have gone over the history of the different means adopted to collect funds for the purpose of shewing that at the opening of the succession there was a liability on the congregation arising out of its building operations to which the proceeds of the legacy might be applied as the testatrix intended.\nI venture to urge these additional reasons: The manse and \u201cMacVicar Hall\u201d are built on the original church site, they are necessary auxiliaries to effective church work and are all now part of the original establishment. The organ is incorporated in the building and is an inherent part of it as much as the pews, railings or altar, and surely the balance still due on its purchase price is a debt on the church building of which it forms a part. The same may be said of the manse and \u201cMacVicar Hall,\u201d they are a part of the curtilage of the church and, although the relative positions of the buildings are not made quite clear on the evidence, they are all situate on the lot originally bought for the church and if sold to satisfy the claims now due on them I do not see how any part of the church property could escape: Marson v. London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Co.[3].\nIt is impossible for me to come to any other conclusion than that (1) the trustees take under the will subject to the obligation to apply the proceeds of the bequest in the liquidation of the building liabilities, and (2) that the manse, hall and organ are all part of the general property of the congregation used for its religious purposes and that the motive of the testatrix was not to contribute to a particular fund, but to benefit the congregation in all those respects.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The late Margaret Boyd, who died 5th August, 1909, by her last will and testament, dated 13th May, 1892, made the following devise:\u2014 2. I give, devise and bequeath unto the Trustees of the Building Fund of St. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Wellington Street, in the City of Montreal, those two certain houses situate in the St. Gabriel Ward of the City of Montreal fronting on Rushbrooke Street and bearing the numbers 48 and 50 of said street, with the property upon which the said houses are erected as now belonging to me the said testatrix.\nTo have, hold and enjoy said property unto said trustees, their successors and assigns as their absolute property in virtue hereof.\nThe appellant, as tutor of her minor daughter, who was named in said will residuary legatee of the estate of deceased, brings this action to have said devise declared null and void and to have it declared that the property referred to therein forms part of the residue of the said estate.\nI shall presently refer to the grounds specially taken by appellant, but before doing so it seems to me that we should consider who, if any one, is the devisee. It seems to be assumed by appellant in launching this action against the respondents that they are the devisees named or designated in said devise.\nThe respondents are the trustees of the property of said church holding it as such for the congregation of said church.\nThey are appointed, I understand, by the congregation, but whether by members of the church or members and adherents is not explained and possibly is not material except in the connection I am about to advert to.\nIt is conceded that they are appointed and enjoy such rights of property as they do possess by virtue of 38 Vict. ch. 62, and also seems to be conceded that all the property real and personal belonging to or used by the congregation and those ministering to or serving the said congregation in connection with said church, known by the name of \u201cSt. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church,\u201d is vested in the trustees appointed under said Act.\nThe 4th section of said statute is as follows:\u2014\n4. Whenever any congregation, society or mission, in communion or connection with said united church, shall hereafter be desirous of acquiring any land, or real property of any description whatsoever, for the site of any church, chapel, meeting-house, school, manse, glebe, burial-ground, or appurtenances thereto, the same may be acquired by trustees for any one or more of the said objects which shall be designated in the deed of acquisition, and by any name assumed in said deed, sufficient to shew the connection or communion of its members with said united church, and the locality where such congregation, society or mission is to be established; and such deed shall not require to be registered at any prothonotary\u2019s office, but shall be subject to the ordinary laws of registration applicable to individuals, and such congregation, society or mission shall be entitled to acquire, take and hold lands and real estate for the purposes aforesaid, without license, in mortmain.\nThere never were any other trustees known to said congregation than those so appointed and thus vested with power of taking real estate.\nSection 13 empowers said trustees to acquire lands by devise or bequest. No one else is given the power to acquire by devise and hold for Said congregation any lands. A devise of land to any one else to hold for the congregation would seem to be void as offending against the mortmain Acts. The respondents are, and I assume were, the trustees so duly appointed and possessed of the powers the said Act confers.\nNow, if any lawyer had, only with the knowledge imparted by the foregoing, been asked whether respondents could take under said devise, would he have had any serious doubt or difficulty in answering in the affirmative?\nHe would likely criticize the words \u201cof the building fund\u201d and possibly suggest they might be treated as surplusage or if not so as imposing a restriction upon the uses to which the proceeds of the property, which must be sold within a limited term to comply with the law, could be applied, and probably in line with well known decisions he would suggest the sentence should be read as if to the trustees \u201cfor the building fund.\u201d\nIt could not be applied towards foreign missions, for example, or indeed any service of that kind. Nor could it be used to pay the minister\u2019s salary or other like expenses of the church or congregation.\nSuch is the way this devise appears to me. It does not seem very ambiguous, if at all, or more so than many others which have been given operative effect.\nThe language of Sir George Jessell in In re Roberts[4], as follows,\u2014\nthe modern doctrine is not to hold a will void for uncertainty unless it is utterly impossible to put a meaning upon it. The duty of the court is to put a fair meaning on the terms used, and not, as was said in one case, to repose on the easy pillow of saying that the whole is void for uncertainty,\nseems appropriate.\nIf the language is not in fact ambiguous we have no right to look elsewhere for its meaning.\nIt is urged, however, that the words \u201cof the building fund\u201d when used by the testatrix must, under the circumstances in which she was placed in relation to this church of which she was a member, have had a peculiar significance and import. As such member probably she had taken part in constituting this Board of Trustees.\nIt is shewn in the evidence that some ten years before she made this will the congregation had passed a resolution that a committee be appointed to determine upon the site for the proposed new building, and devise some means of raising a fund for the purpose,\nand a week later another\nthat a permanent committee be appointed to raise a building fund,\nand thereupon a committee was appointed accordingly.\nIt appears this committee continued in existence till after the church was built and after this will was made.\nIt is testified by one of the respondents this was done to facilitate the procuring of funds, to be kept separate from the funds for the maintenance and general working of the church.\nIt also appears that before the testatrix died the church debt for the building of the church itself had been paid off, but that the other buildings in connection with the church for the service of the congregation, such as a manse and Sunday school or meetinghouse and building of an organ in the church had been entered upon, but the expense thereof had not been satisfied; that the fund known as the building fund aforesaid had been merged with a sinking fund and a mortgage created on the whole property which far exceeded the value of this devise.\nIt is suggested that with all this being done the fund meant to be described in the devise had ceased to exist and hence the devise must be held to have lapsed.\nIs that the necessary conclusion from all that transpired?\nAt first sight it wears a plausible appearance, but it does not seem to me of such force as to work out the desire of appellant. There was a committee, but that committee never was the trustee of anything. What they got was the property of the trustees proper and subject to their control so far as needed to be used for the purposes to which the subscribers thereto had donated their contributions.\nThis committee and that fund were all subject to be dealt with by the trustees as they in fact did deal therewith; no doubt with the approbation of the congregation from time to time.\nThe committee and this mode of bookkeeping were no doubt highly proper and expedient means of accomplishing part of the building projects of the trustees, but they do not seem to necessarily imply that a testatrix making such a devise could ever have supposed that the phraseology of her will was thus narrowly limiting her intentions.\nThe remarks of Mr. Justice Swinfen Eady in Attorney-General v. Belgrave Hospital for Children[5], as to looking at the testator\u2019s knowledge of an institution to be benefited by his will, are worth observing in this whole connection.\nShe outlived the committee but not the trustees, and I have no doubt she would have changed her will if she had supposed the disappearance of the committee and its fund as a means of bookkeeping could have or be supposed to have, had the effect of revoking her will pro tanto.\nI think the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs, which let us hope will not be exacted.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I am unable to accept the view which has prevailed in the courts below and with the majority of this court. I will briefly indicate my reasons for thinking that the appellants are entitled to succeed.\nThe devise we have to construe is in the following terms:\u2014\nSecondly: I give, devise and bequeath unto the Trustees of the Building Fund of St. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church, Wellington Street, in the City of Montreal, those two certain houses situate in the St. Gabriel Ward in the said City of Montreal, fronting on Rush-brooke Street and bearing the numbers 48 and 50 of said street, with the property upon which the said houses are erected as now belonging to me, said testatrix. To have, hold and enjoy said property unto said trustees, their successors and assigns as their absolute property in virtue hereof.\nI did not understand it to be disputed in the oral argument presented to us on behalf of the respondents that this clause in the will of the late Mrs. Boyd does sufficiently express a direction as to the employment of the proceeds of the gift by which the trustees are bound and against whom it could be enforced. I think I am doing no injustice to the argument of Mr. Martin, who presented his case with his usual candour, in saying that he admitted that any attempt on the part of the devisees to apply the proceeds of the gift in support, for example, of foreign missions, or in payment of the minister\u2019s salary, would be a departure from the terms of the trust. That being so (and I think the admission was a very proper admission, because it appears to me to be hardly arguable that this is a gift to the trustees of the congregation of St. Matthew\u2019s to be applied for the support of religious objects in any manner the congregation should think fit) it follows that the principle which must govern us in the determination of the dispute that has arisen is furnished by article 964 C.C., which is in the following words:\u2014 964. The legatee who is charged as a mere trustee, to administer the property and to employ it or deliver it over in accordance with the will, even though the terms used appear really to give him the quality of a proprietor subject to delivery over, rather than that of a mere executor or administrator, does not retain the property in the event of the lapse of the ulterior disposition, or of the impossibility of applying such property to the purposes intended, unless the testator has manifested his intention to that effect. The property in such cases passes to the heir or the legatee who receives the succession.\nThe point for decision is whether at the time of the death of Mrs. Boyd it had become impossible to apply the proceeds of her bounty according to the directions of her will. The substantial question in dispute is as to the meaning of the words employed by the testatrix when read, as they must be, in light of the facts which she must be presumed to have had in mind and with reference to which the intended disposition of her property was framed. The will was executed in May, 1892. Ten years before that, in order to make provision for the building of a church, a fund known as the \u201cbuilding fund\u201d had been instituted by the congregation. A permanent committee had been created charged with the collection and administration of the fund. In February, 1892, that committee was discharged, but the fund remained on foot, the church having in the meantime been constructed, and a special committee was appointed for the purpose of securing contributions to the fund to enable the congregation to discharge the debt upon the church then secured by mortgage and amounting to $12,000. The members of the congregation were appealed to and asked to promise to contribute weekly or monthly by \u201cSpecial Envelope Contributions.\u201d This appeal was made pursuant to a report adopted at a special meeting of the congregation and reported in the \u201cMonthly Record\u201d for March. The object of the fund \u2014 the object the members of the congregation were asked to aid by their contributions \u2014 was exclusively to provide for the payment of the existing mortgage debt and I can entertain no doubt that this was the fund described by the testatrix in her will as the \u201cbuilding fund\u201d or that this was the object she had in view. A year before the death of the testatrix this object had been completely accomplished. Not only had the fund itself ceased to exist; the circumstances had so entirely changed between the date of the making of the will and the date of the testatrix\u2019s death as to make a contribution to the \u201cbuilding fund\u201d which the testatrix had known for twenty-five years, an act of no meaning. It follows, therefore, that the specific and limited purpose to which the gift had been dedicated having been fully accomplished, there had supervened (at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death) the \u201cimpossibility\u201d of applying the property which was the subject of the gift to the \u201cpurpose intended\u201d within the meaning of article 964.\nThe courts below have held that the application of the property in payment for an organ, the cost of building a manse, the cost of building an annex, would be within the purposes of the will. With great respect it appears to me to be hardly arguable that these objects were within the objects of the \u201cbuilding fund\u201d instituted in 1882, and to which contributions were invited in February, 1892, three months before the execution of the will. The fact that separate funds were instituted for the purpose of carrying out some of these objects, and that no part of the building fund or of the mortgage fund in which it was afterwards merged was ever applied to any purpose other than the payment of the cost of the church building proper, tells very strongly against this suggestion of the respondents. Indeed, I think the evidence demonstrates that the object of the fund was exclusively that already mentioned.\nI read the clause we have to construe as shewing, on the part of the testatrix, the existence of an intention, in 1892, when she executed her will, to provide for a contribution to take effect at her death to the fund which she knew and for which contributions were then being solicited, and I think it was of the essence of the gift that it should be capable at her death of being applied in furtherance of the specific purpose for which she in common with the other members of the congregation must have known that this fund was instituted.\nAnglin J. (dissenting). \u2014 With the utmost respect for the learned judges of the provincial courts, and for those of my learned brothers who hold contrary views, I am of opinion that the devise in question in this action fails. Assuming in favour of the respondents that they are sufficiently identified by the description\nthe trustees of the building fund of St. Matthew\u2019s Presbyterian Church, etc...\nas I rather think they are in view of the habendum\nunto the said trustees, their successors and assigns,\nthe purpose of the devise was to aid, not the general works or funds of the church under their control, but a specific fund designated by the testatrix as \u201cThe Building Fund.\u201d\nThere is nothing in the devise itself, or elsewhere in the will, to indicate that the testatrix had any such paramount general charitable purpose as would warrant the application of the \u201ccy-pres\u201d doctrine of English testamentary law. The bequest is for a specific, well-defined object and purpose (Theobald on Wills (7 ed.), p. 373), and the question is whether that object still exists \u2014 whether the particular charitable purpose can still be carried out. (4 Halsbury, 158.)\nThe building fund of the new \u201cSt. Matthew\u2019s Church,\u201d the establishment of which was recommended in a report of the 15th February, 1882, was instituted and placed in charge of a special permanent committee by resolution of the congregation of the 22nd February, 1882. The purpose was to separate the new church building fund from the other funds under the administration of the trustees of the church. The new church was completed in June, 1891. The building fund became the object of a special envelope subscription. It was well known to the testatrix, who was a subscriber to it. It was \u201cactive\u201d when she made her will in 1892 and there is no room for doubt that it was that fund with its specific purpose which was the object of her bounty. In 1897 \u201cthe building fund\u201d was replaced by \u201cthe mortgage fund.\u201d The debt on the new church was completely paid off in 1908. Since that time there has been no building fund for the church proper; there was no further occasion for such a fund. The testatrix died in August, 1909.\nThe respondents suggest, however, that there are still church debts to which the proceeds of the devise in question may be applied. These debts were incurred in connection with the erection of \u201cMacVicar Hall\u201d (a \u201cSunday school annex\u201d), the purchase of the minister\u2019s manse and the installing of a new organ. \u201cMacVicar Hall\u201d was first projected in 1903 and was built in 1904. The manse property was acquired in May, 1909, the organ was also installed in 1909. Debts thus incurred were certainly not objects of the bounty of testatrix in 1892; and it is quite impossible to say that she intended to provide for payment of them. Indeed, to apply the proceeds of her devise to them may be something to winch she would have had serious and decided objections. General repairs, improvements, etc., to which the respondents also say the devise may be applied, are ordinarily paid for, not out of a building fund but out of a revenue fund; and the trustees of St. Matthew\u2019s Church had, quite distinct from the church building fund, a revenue fund, which was not an object of Mrs. Boyd\u2019s testamentary bounty. If the church building fund had still existed after her death, no part of the proceeds of the devise to it could be legally diverted to any of these other purposes. Attorney-General v. Belgrave Hospital for Children[6].\nThe two Ontario cases cited by Archibald J. (Tyrrell v. Senior[7], and Edwards v. Smith[8]) are readily distinguishable from that now before us. In each of them there was a bequest in favour of a charitable or religious fund which actually existed in connection with the church to which the testator belonged, both at the time when he made his will and after his death, though under a name somewhat different from that used by the testator to describe it. The court in each instance was satisfied that the object of the testator\u2019s bounty was sufficiently identified In the present case the fund intended to be aided existed when the will was made, but had ceased to exist before the testatrix died. The governing rule under such circumstances is, I think, to Be found in such cases as In re Rymer[9]; Corbyn v. French[10]; Attorney-General v. Bishop of Oxford[11]; Clark v. Taylor[12]; Fish v. Attorney-General[13]; In re Wilson[14], and Burgess\u2019s Trustees v. Crawford[15].\nIn my opinion, owing to the failure of its specific object or purpose the devise in question lapsed and the property passed to \u201cthe heir or legatee who received the succession.\u201d Article 964 C.C.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Foster, Martin, Mann, Mackinnon & Hackett.\n[1] Q.R. 46 S.C. 97.\n[2] 14 Moo.

Bulling (Defendant) Respondent.\n1914: October 21; 1914: December 29.\nPresent: Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Use of motor car\u2014Disobedience\u2014 Act in course of employment\u2014Employer\u2019s liability.\nB. was owner of an automobile and hired a chauffeur to run it, giving him positive instructions that the car was not to be used except for purposes of the owner and his family, and that, when not in use for such purposes, it was to be kept in a certain garage. On the evening of the accident in question the chauffeur took his master\u2019s family to a theatre, in Winnipeg, and was directed by them to take the car to the garage and return for them after the close of the performance. The chauffeur took the car from the garage before the appointed time and proceeded with it for the purpose of visiting a friend in a distant part of the city. While so using the car, contrary to instructions, he negligently ran down the plaintiff, causing injuries for which an action was brought to recover damages against B.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (24 Man. R. 235), that, at the time of the accident, the chauffeur was not engaged in the performance of any act appertaining to the course of his employment as the servant of the owner of the car and, consequently, his master was not liable in damages. Storey v. Ashton (L.R. 4 Q.B. 476), followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Prendergast J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note. Nesbitt K.C. and H. Phillips for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment below affirmed on the ground which was clearly established that the chauffeur from the time he took the motor car out of the garage until the accident occurred was on his own business and pleasure and not on any business of his master\u2019s.\nHe was not acting within the scope of his duty as his master\u2019s chauffeur, but outside of and beyond that scope.\nIdington J.\u2014In this case the learned trial judge finds that the respondent\u2019s chauffeur in driving his automobile was guilty of negligence and respondent liable to answer for the damages consequent therefrom suffered by appellant.\nI assume the facts to be as reported by the learned trial judge, that respondent had in engaging the chauffeur bound him never to use the automobile without leave, and on such occasions as the night in question when he took the wife and some of respondent\u2019s family to the theatre, that the automobile should be at once returned to a neighbouring garage and left there till the time had approached to take it out and go and bring the family home.\nOn the night in question the automobile, after respondent\u2019s people had been duly left at the theatre, was taken to the neighbouring garage and left there by the chauffeur, but in a very short time thereafter taken out and used by him for purposes of his own in course of which the appellant was very seriously injured. It would seem to me idle to contend that when this respondent\u2019s servant took his automobile out of the garage from which it was not to be taken until at least two hours later, he was not a trespasser and liable as such to instant dismissal for doing so. It seems he was not dismissed but retained in respondent\u2019s service despite such gross disobedience and the suffering caused thereby. I quite agree this is a state of things which in a well ordered state ought not to be suffered.\nI regret to be compelled to hold that the common law relative to the ordinary relations of master and servant, and the responsibility of the former for the latter, under such circumstances, does not enable the courts to do absolute justice and that the statutory amendments thereto do not reach far enough to cover such a case as this.\nLet us hope the law will be changed so far at least that the master who thus flaunts his support of such a wrongdoer in the face of one of those he has grossly injured, shall be made liable for all damages done by him whilst in such service.\nIndeed, I think the legislation needed might go further, but to this extent at least it would be a deterrent for both master and man.\nIf this man had, as in the case of Venables v. Smith[2], relied upon by appellant\u2019s counsel, after leaving the theatre and before placing the automobile in the garage, gone upon some brief, errand of his own, something might have been said for the case made.\nUnfortunately for the appellant it seems to have been such a departure from the course of the chauffeur\u2019s employment that in law the master cannot be held bound to answer therefor.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs if the respondent claims them as it is to be hoped he will not.\nDuff J.\u2014The principle of law by which our decision in this appeal must be governed is stated in these words by Cockburn C.J. in Storey v. Ashton[3], at page 479:\u2014\nThe true rule is that the master is only responsible so long as the servant can be said to be doing the act in the doing of which he is guilty of negligence in the course of his employment as servant.\nThe question in controversy is this question of fact\u2014Was the chauffeur, Stapleton, about his master\u2019s business when he ran down the unfortunate victim of his carelessness or was he making use of the respondent\u2019s car in an independent excursion of his own? I think the conclusion at which the Court of Appeal arrived was right and that the question must be answered in the sense in which they answered it, namely, that Stapleton was not then engaged in the doing of anything appertaining to the course of his employment as the respondent\u2019s servant.\nI think the provisions of the \u201cMotor Vehicles Act\u201d of Manitoba to which our attention was called have no relevance to any point arising on the appeal.\nAngliN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nBrod\u00e8ur J.\u2014It is with a great deal of hesitation that I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed, though it is true that when the accident occurred the respondent\u2019s chauffeur was not acting within the scope of his duty. His instructions were to have the automobile at a certain garage or at the respondent\u2019s residence, and instead he took the motor car and used it for his own purpose and pleasure. During that errand of his own he struck the appellant.\nA local Act of Manitoba, in which province the accident occurred, was invoked by the appellant; but it has no bearing upon the issues in this case.\nThe jurisprudence under the English common law is that the master is not liable for the negligence of his servant while the latter is engaged in some act beyond the scope of his employment for his own purpose, though he may be using the instrumentalities furnished by the master to perform his duties as servant. Mitchell v. Crasweller[4], in 1853; Storey v. Ashton[5], in 1869; Rayner v. Mitchell[6], in 1877; Dowling v. Robinson[7], in 1909.\nI may add that the decision in this case should not be considered as a precedent in Quebec, where the liability of the master rests on different principles.

It later served a copy of said notice on S., lessee of said land for a term of ten years. On application to a Superior Court judge for appointment of arbitrators S. claimed to be entitled to a separate notice and an independent hearing to determine his compensation. The judge so held and dismissed the application and his ruling was affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The company sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J., following Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Little Seminary of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (16 Can. S.C.R. 606), and St. Hilaire v Lambert (42 Can. S.C.R. 264), that the Superior Court judge was persona designata to hear such applications as the one made by the company; that the case, therefore, did not originate in a superior court and the appeal would not lie.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The judge, under section 196 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d acts as persona designata and no appeal lies from his orders under that section;\u2014 in this case, the application having been made to and the parties having treated the contestation as a proceeding in the Superior Court, which had no jurisdiction, the Court of King\u2019s Bench rightly dismissed the appeal from the order refusing to appoint arbitrators; and the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada being obviously baseless should for that reason be quashed. Held, per Davies, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., that as there was nothing in the record to shew that the amount in dispute was $2,000 or over, and no attempt had been made to establish by affidavit that it was, the appeal failed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec affirming the ruling of a judge in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, who dismissed an application for appointment of arbitrators in expropriation proceedings under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nCasgrain for the motion.\nRinfret K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction. The facts are as follows:\u2014\nThe Canadian Northern Railway Company, appellant, took proceedings under the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d to expropriate a parcel of land in the parish of St. Laurent, Province of Quebec. Notice was given to the registered owners of the lot, but not at first to the respondent Smith, who had a ten years lease of the property. Later, on becoming aware of the lease, the company served another copy of the original notice on the owner and on the lessee declaring its intention to amend the notice of expropriation by putting Smith \u201cen cause.\u201d The amount originally tendered by the company was $25,000, and this amount was not changed by the amended notice shewing the intention of the petitioner not to increase the amount of its original offer on account of the claim of the lessee. On the petition made by the owner to a judge of the Superior Court, to appoint an arbitrator under section 196 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d Smith appeared to contest the right of the company on many grounds, the important one being that he, as lessee, was entitled to be served with a special notice and to have a special arbitration as to his compensation. This right the company denied.\nThe petition came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Beaudin, who found that Smith was entitled to a special notice and arbitration under the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d independently of the arbitration of the landowner. His judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The company now appeals to this court and have deposited their security in the court below. Smith moves to quash on the following grounds:\u2014\n1. That the judgment in the court below was interlocutory and related only to a matter of procedure;\n2. There is no evidence that the amount involved exceeded $2,000;\n3. That the controversy does not relate to title of land;\n4. That the judgment of the Court below was a judgment person\u00e2 designat\u00e2 under special jurisdiction conferred by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and there is no appeal.\nReference was made at the argument to Turgeon v. St. Charles[1], but that case has no application. It was there decided that a petition by a curator to a judge in chambers under the Quebec \u201cAbandonment of Property Act\u201d was a judicial proceeding within the meaning of that term in 46 or 37(a) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d However that may be it seems to me obvious that the words\nsuit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding\nin that section refer exclusively to civil proceedings which fall to be determined by the provincial courts and judges in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction in civil matters.\nHere the judge to whom the application was made under the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d was, it is true, a judge of the Superior Court of the Province, but for the purposes of that application his jurisdiction was \u201cspecial and peculiar, distinct from, and independent of any power or authority with which he is clothed as a judge of that court.\u201d The Act conferring jurisdiction upon him provides all necessary materials for the full and complete exercise of such jurisdiction in a very special manner, wholly independent of, and distinct from, and at variance with, the jurisdiction and procedure of the court to which he belongs (sections 194, 195, 196, 197 et seq. \u201cRailway Act\u201d). As to appeal see section 209. Paraphrasing what the Chief Justice said in Valin v. Langlois[2], at pages 33, 34, I would say:\u2014\nReading these special provisions in connection with the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and what has been said of the Act generally, I think it is not arriving at a forced or unnatural conclusion to say that Parliament intended to confer upon Provincial judges in Dominion railway expropriation matters an exceptional jurisdiction with a special procedure and with all materials for exercising such jurisdiction, and having nothing in common with the Provincial courts; that these judges and courts were merely utilized outside their respective jurisdiction to deal with this purely Dominion matter. The case comes clearly within the rule in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Little Seminary of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[3]; St. Hilaire v. Lambert[4]; Toronto, etc., Railway Co. and Hendrie, In re[5]; Cie du Chemin de fer de Montreal et Sorel v. St. Vincent[6].\nI am entirely at a loss to understand how this case ever reached the Court of King\u2019s Bench, but as it comes to us from that court and assuming that we have no power to inquire on this application into the proceedings resulting in the appeal below, I am of opinion that the case does not come within sections 46 or 37(a) of the Act.\nMotion to quash granted with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree with the result reached by the Chief Justice.\nDuff J.\u2014The jurisdiction created by section 196 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is not, I think, a jurisdiction given to the Superior Court or County Court as the case may be, but to the judge or judges of those courts. In other words, when acting under that section the judge does not exercise the powers of the court as such but the special powers given by the Act. From the refusal of the judge on an application under section 196 to appoint arbitrators no appeal would lie to the Court of King\u2019s Bench or to this court.\nMr. Rinfret appreciated this and argued that the contestation was an independent proceeding instituted in the Superior Court for the purpose of restraining proceedings not in the Superior Court, but before the Judge acting as persona designata, and that it was from the judgment in this independent proceeding that the appeal was taken to the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nI have examined the proceedings carefully and my conclusion is that beginning with the petition under section 196 all the proceedings have been treated by the parties and by all the judges before whom they have come as proceedings in the Superior Court. However that may be the contestation has been most certainly treated as part of the proceedings instituted by the petition, and whether one holds that they were in the Superior Court or before the judge extra muros, the result is the same. If the first, then the Court of King\u2019s Bench was obviously right in dismissing an appeal from a judgment in proceedings not only misconceived, but incompetent; if the second, no appeal lay to the Court of King\u2019s Bench against a judgment given in proceedings under section 196 and none lies to this court.\nIt is true that the objection that the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was obviously right does not go to the jurisdiction of this court. But appeals have been quashed in limine where they must certainly have failed as being manifestly without foundation and this practice is beyond doubt a beneficent one.\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that no appeal lies from a considerant.\nI may add that collecting as best I can the effect of the words \u201cmatter in controversy * * * amounts to the value or sum of $2,000\u201d from the various pronouncements in which judges of this court have professed to elucidate them, I am not convinced that the somewhat erratic course of decision permits me to hold that the condition of jurisdiction supposed to rest upon those words has been satisfied.\nAnglin J.\u2014While adhering to the view expressed by my Lord the Chief Justice, in delivering the judgment of the court in Finseth v. Ryley Hotel Co.[7], and to what I stated in Turgeon v. St. Charles[8], at p. 483, as to the scope of section 37(a) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d I am nevertheless of the opinion that the respondent\u2019s motion to disallow the security filed by the appellant must succeed, If the proceeding before us is in the nature of a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d within the purview of that section, \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d does not\ninvolve the question of, or relate to, any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue, sum of money payable to His Majesty, or any title to lands or documents, annual rents or other matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\nThere is nothing in the record to shew that the compensation which the respondent claims he should receive for the expropriation of his interests in the lands taken by the appellants\namounts to the sum or value of $2,000.\nNor has any attempt been made under section 49a of the statute (3 & 4 Geo. V., ch. 51, sec. 5) to establish by affidavit that \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d amounts to that sum or value.\nThe motion should be granted with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014C\u2019est une motion pour faire renvoyer l\u2019appel faute de juridiction. Les proc\u00e9dures en la pr\u00e9sente instance ont commenc\u00e9 par une requ\u00eate \u00e0 un juge pour nommer des arbitres sous les dispositions de l\u2019Acte F\u00e9d\u00e9ral des Chemins de Fer, art. 196 et ses amendements. La demande au juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le propri\u00e9taire du terrain \u00e0 exproprier. Sur cette requ\u00eate l\u2019intim\u00e9, Smith, a comparu et, apr\u00e8s avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait locataire de ce terrain, il a demand\u00e9, par une proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il a appel\u00e9 contestation, que la compagnie appelante soit tenue de lui donner un avis sp\u00e9cial d\u2019expropriation et de lui faire des offres particuli\u00e8res et qu\u2019il ait le droit de proposer un des arbitres.\nLe juge \u00e0 qui cette proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient bien fond\u00e9es et son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019Appel.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 par sa motion, dit que nous n\u2019avons pas juridiction parce que la cause n\u2019a pas origine en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et il a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ce point la cause Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[9].\nIl pr\u00e9tend en outre qu\u2019il n\u2019appara\u00eet pas que l\u2019affaire en litige soit d\u2019une valeur de deux mille dollars.\nJe ne serait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 dire que la cause de Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se9 s\u2019appliquerait maintenant dans une cause comme celle-ci.\nIl est bien vrai que cette cause de Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se avait trait \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure sous l\u2019Acte des Chemins de Fer. Il s\u2019agissait, en effet, d\u2019une demande faite au juge pour retirer un montant qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en Cour par la Compagnie. Mais lorsque cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 l\u2019acte qui \u00e9tait en force \u00e9tait le chapitre 135 des statuts refondus du Canada qui d\u00e9clarait \u00e0 la section 28 que la Cour Supr\u00eame n\u2019avait juridiction que dans les causes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9es originairement dans la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Quebec.\nEn 1891. deux ans apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la cause Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[10], Pacte de la Cour Supr\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 par 54-55 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 3, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par cet amendement qu\u2019il y avait appel m\u00eame dans les causes qui n\u2019avaient pas origine devant le Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nDe plus, nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Turgeon v. St. Charles[11],\nthat a cause, matter or judicial proceeding originating on petition to a judge in chambers, in virtue of articles 875 and 876 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure is appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMais si j\u2019h\u00e9site \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer mal fond\u00e9 le premier point soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, je crois qu\u2019il doit r\u00e9ussir sur son second point, quant au montant en litige.\nIl n\u2019appara\u00eet pas au dossier si l\u2019affaire en litige vaut $2,000. Il n\u2019y a pas non plus d\u2019affidavit de produit qui en \u00e9tablisse la valeur (3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 51, sec. 5).\nDans la cause de Turgeon v. St. Charles11, que je viens de citer, il y avait une preuve au dossier \u00e9tablissant combien valait le droit en litige et c\u2019est pourquoi nous avons maintenu que nous avions juridiction. Mais dans le cas actuel, il n\u2019y a pas. de preuve au dossier de la valeur de ce droit et alors je suis d\u2019opinion que cette motion de l\u2019intim\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Perron & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Casgrain, Mitchell & Co.\n[1] 48 Can.

(the agent of the company for obtaining such applications) was induced through the fraud of L. to sign, without reading it, a document which she believed to be an application for shares but which, in fact, was a mortgage for securing a supposed loan to her and contained a covenant to re-pay the amount of the loan. M. was an intelligent woman capable of reading and understanding the document.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (17 B.C. Rep. 366), the Chief Justice and Davies J. dissenting, that as M. was under no duty to exercise care to protest the company against the possible frauds of their agent, L., she was not guilty of negligence estopping her from setting up the plea of non est factum which, in the circumstances, was a good defence to the company's action on the covenant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Gregory J. at the trial, and cross-appeal from the same by the company, respondents.\nThe judgments now reported contain a full statement of the circumstances of the case and the questions raised upon the present appeal.\nNesbitt K.C. and Christopher C. Robinson for the appellant and the respondent on the cross-appeal.\nA. C. Macdonnell and J. A. Ritchie for the respondents and appellants on the cross-appeal.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Sir Louis Davies. In his judgment will be found the facts of the case as they are spread out in the record.\nI will be content to state very briefly the ground of my concurrence and hope in so doing to avoid unnecessary and tedious repetitions.\nThere can be no doubt that a gross fraud was committed upon the company respondent when the loan in question was obtained. No attempt was made to deny this, and it is also very clearly established that the fraud could not have been successfully carried out, as it was, without the co-operation of Morgan, the appellant, and of his wife. Their co-operation may have been either innocent, guilty or merely negligent.\nI am of opinion that Morgan was a party to the fraud and that it was made possible by, putting the most favourable construction upon her conduct, the gross negligence of his wife, the respondent on the cross-appeal.\nAs Sir Louis Davies points out, the loan was secured by a mortgage on a property the title to which was vested in Mrs. Morgan by deed of January, 1895, duly registered. To obtain that loan it was necessary to have Mrs. Morgan's signature on the application for the loan and to a subscription for shares in the company, and I have no doubt that, as found by all the judges in appeal, her signature was attached to each of these documents by her husband. The certificate of shares issued in due course to Mrs. Morgan and was assigned to the company for the purpose of the loan by a memorandum of assignment indorsed thereon and executed by Mrs. Morgan in the presence of one Yarwood, a practising solicitor in good standing. Subsequently a mortgage on the property was executed in the presence of the same Yarwood, who certifies on his oath of office as notary public that the mortgagor, Mrs. Morgan, appeared before him and,\nbeing first made acquainted with the contents of the mortgage, its nature and effect, acknowledged that she was the person mentioned in the instrument as the maker and that she understood the contents, nature and effect of it.\nUpon the same occasion she also made and signed before Yarwood a declaration that she was the sole and absolute owner in fee simple of the property then registered in her name, and authorized the payment of the proceeds of the loan to Leighton. It is not disputed that the signatures to those documents are genuine and that they were necessary to the fraudulent obtaining of the money from the company. Three years afterwards, in October, 1898, Mrs. Morgan executed in the presence of another witness an agreement for an extension of the mortgage to which is annexed a certificate of one Norris, a notary public, to the effect that she was made acquainted with the contents and understood the nature and effect of the instrument. Norris is dead, but there is no suggestion that he was a party to the fraud. Yarwood was examined as a witness at the trial and his evidence, in the last degree unsatisfactory, establishes at least that Mrs. Morgan was in his office on the day the documents first above mentioned were executed and that she acknowledged her signature to them in his presence. Examined as a witness, Mrs. Morgan admits her signature to the documents in question and says that they were read to her and that she signed them, her contention being that the documents purported to be executed for the purpose of buying shares in the Dominion Loan Company. There is no evidence that any document except those produced was signed on that occasion by Mrs. Morgan, and Yarwood's evidence goes at least far enough to establish that if any documents were read to Mrs. Morgan it must have been those that she signed. It is difficult to read her evidence without being impressed by her capacity and intelligence and it is impossible for me to believe that if, as she admitted, the document was read to her she would ever have misunderstood its meaning and effect.\nIn any event, I am clearly of opinion that if she signed and delivered those formal documents at various times during a period of three years under the circumstances described, even in ignorance of their contents, if that is conceivable, she must be held liable for having, through her culpable negligence, made it possible for her husband and his associates to successfully carry out this nefarious transaction.\nIt is said that the agents of the company are alone responsible for the fraud and that they alone benefited by it. I am satisfied, on the whole evidence, that Morgan knew of the project to obtain the money from the company from the beginning and actively co-operated with the agents of the company in carrying it out. I am not sure as to whether he had a share in the swindle. As to him I cannot see any reason why the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed. I am unable to agree that Mrs. Morgan should be relieved of responsibility for the consequences of her grossly negligent conduct.\nI have felt it to be my duty to say at least this much because of the important principle involved in the judgment of this court. It will hereafter behoove all those who are concerned in making investments either for themselves or as trustees for others to take notice that little credence or faith is to be attached to the declarations of fact made by a notary public under his oath of office in connection with the execution of formal documents such as those in question in this case.\nI would dismiss the appeal and allow the crossappeal, both with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Galliher that this case \"reeks with fraud, carelessness and incompetence.\"\nI also agree with him that Thomas Morgan, one of the defendant appellants was a party from the very beginning to the fraud practiced upon the company. That fraud consisted in obtaining from the company a loan of $1,500 upon the security of some 15 shares of its stock applied for and standing in the name of Catherine Morgan, his wife, the other defendant appellant; and the further security of a mortgage from Catherine Morgan to the company on lots 1 and 4, block 1 of Newcastle suburban lots, addition to City of Nanaimo, with the buildings thereon, which lot she was represented to be the owner of in fee.\nI am unable, however, to reach the charitable conclusion which induced the learned judge to give her the \"benefit of the doubt\" as to her personal participation in or liability for the frauds or to hold that proof of deceit as against her failed.\nI have come to the conclusion, after reading all the evidence, that it is impossible to doubt her complicity with her husband in the fraud from its very beginning.\nI do not think she herself signed the application in November, 1894, for the shares in the company. Her name to that application was, in my judgment, either signed by Morgan, her husband, or by Williams, the clerk of Leighton, the secretary of the local board of the company in Nanaimo. The judges in the Court of Appeal, from an examination of his wife's signature written during the trial by Thomas Morgan and in evidence thought the signatures \"Catherine Morgan\" to the two applications, in August, 1894, were written by Thomas Morgan, her husband \u2014 and it may well be that they were right. There is a marked resemblance between the said signatures and the signature written by Thomas Morgan when on the witness stand. I am, however, of the opinion that these signatures to these applications were written by Williams, the man who filled up the applications and who was a clerk in the employ of Leighton, the agent in Nanaimo of the local board of the loan company. To my mind, it matters little which of them wrote the signatures. They were certainly written either by Morgan or by Williams; and, if by the latter, at Morgan's instance and request. That Mrs. Morgan well knew of the application and was a direct party to its being made, I cannot, after reading the evidence, entertain any doubt whatever.\nIt is important to remember that these applications by Mrs. Morgan consisted one of an application for 15 shares of the plaintiff company's stock and the other for a loan of $1,500 on the security of those shares which she agreed to assign to the company and of a first mortgage upon the lot of land referred to, the title to which was represented in the application as in her name. On this land it was represented there were some buildings worth $1,900 with \"$1,000 incumbrance due on the house for lumber,\" to pay which and to improve the lots the loan was applied for.\nWilliams, the witness to these applications, who was then employed by Leighton, the secretary of the local board of the loan company, subsequently got into difficulties, left Canada and his whereabouts is unknown. At the time, Catherine Morgan was not the owner of the real estate described and there were no buildings upon the land.\nIn due course, the application for the shares was granted and, in the following March, Catherine Morgan, at her husband's request, went to the office of Yarwood & Young, solicitors, and executed to the company (1) the mortgage in question of the lots of land, (2) an assignment of the 15 shares, (3) a statutory declaration of her sole and absolute ownership of the real estate, etc., and (4) an order to the company to pay the $1,500 to Leighton.\nYarwood witnessed her signature to each and all of these documents, took her statutory declaration and gave the usual certificate of the execution of the mortgage by a married woman apart from her husband. Everything on the face of the documents was perfectly regular and proper. Mrs. Morgan, however, while not denying the authenticity of any one of her signatures to these four documents, puts herself forward as the victim of a fraud by others and says she never signed them with knowledge of what they really were, but believing them to be shares in the company her husband was selling to Leighton, the agent. She further absolutely denies that she ever signed any papers before Yarwood at all, either in March, 1895, at his office, or at any other time and place. She insists in her main examination and repeats persistently in her crossexamination that she only signed one paper at Yarwood & Young's office and that was not before or in presence of Yarwood, but before Young, Yarwood's partner, now Judge Young.\nBeing faced with the four several documents containing her name, she admits that they are her signatures, witnessed and certified to by Yarwood and not by Young; she still, over and over, repeats her statement that she only signed one document and that one she signed before Young and never signed anything before Yarwood. That single document she alleges was an assignment of her shares to Leighton who, her husband told her, was buying them and would repay, them the money they had up to then paid the company on account of the purchase of the shares.\nShe admits that in the light of the facts her story seems \"perfectly ridiculous\" to use her own language. Yarwood was called and gave his testimony which, judging from the stenographer's report, was about the usual kind of evidence a witness called to prove the execution of documents years before would give. There is no suggestion whatever that he was in any way a party to the fraud or acted otherwise than any reputable practitioner would have done under the like circumstances.\nNo attempt was made to support Mrs. Morgan's testimony by calling Judge Young before whom she said she signed a single paper, not four papers. No such paper witnessed by Young was produced and Mrs. Morgan admitted her explanation seemed foolish and ridiculous and yet in a matter where her honesty was at stake as well as her oath, she neglected to call the only witness who could substantiate or explain her statements.\nIt seems to me quite clear that she has confounded two different occasions. She may and probably did on one occasion sign some document before Judge Young and she has in some way got that incident mixed up with the execution of the mortgage, the assignment of her shares, the statutory declaration and the order for the payment of the money. Her signatures to each of these four documents are admittedly genuime. They are properly witnessed and certified by the notary public who is called and examined with respect to their execution. She herself admits not once, but many times, that the paper she did sign was read over to her. All attempts to make her deny this were in vain and at length, in answer to a question put by the trial judge, who seemed to be under the impression that she had not intended to admit the document she signed was read over to her, she repeats her statement that there could be no doubt about it that it was read over.\nUnder such circumstances as these to hold that Mrs. Morgan was the innocent victim of a vile conspiracy concocted to rob a mortgage loan company of $1,500 is taxing my credulity unduly. Some years after the execution of the mortgage and other documents before Yarwood, Mrs. Morgan went, at her husband's request, 1st June, 1898, to the office of Leighton and there signed before A. E. Planta a long agreement under seal with the respondent company for the extension of the time given in the mortgage for the repayment of the $1,500.\nWith respect to the mortgage she signed in March, 1895, Catherine Morgan suggests that she thought the document read to her was to the effect that she was buying shares in the Dominion Loan Company while her husband says that he sold the shares in the spring of 1895, which he had purchased the previous November and on which, in the meantime, he had been paying up $9 a month to the company and that he sold them because he was hard up and could not go on paying the monthly instalments and asked his wife to go down to Yarwood & Young's and sign the necessary papers.\nThe two stories are quite irreconcilable and as Mrs. Morgan admits knowing all about the monthly payments made on the shares by her husband, it is quite clear that she could not think she went down at that time to purchase shares. And so it seems to me her story about going to Leighton's office in June, 1898, more than three years after the mortgage was executed, and signing the agreement for the extension of the time for the payment of the mortgage money before the clerk Planta as a witness is as \"perfectly ridiculous,\" as she admitted she thought her story about signing the mortgage papers was. She said she thought she was signing over the shares to Leighton, whereas as a fact they had been signed over to him by her some three years previously, and they had been receiving back from Leighton, in the meantime, payments on account of his purchase of the shares from Morgan.\nThe fact is that her statement, surmise, reason or what you may choose to call it, for signing the extension of time for paying the mortgage that she thought she was signing over the shares which Leighton had bought, seems as \"perfectly ridiculous\" in the light of all the facts as her version of the execution of the mortgage.\nPlanta, who witnessed the extension, could not remember the circumstances connected with the execution of the document, but identified his signature as a witness and testified in the ordinary way to its execution. Mr. Norris, the notary public, who certified to the execution of the extension by Mrs. Morgan and that she knew its contents and understood its nature and effects, is unfortunately dead.\nOne or two controlling facts ought to be borne in mind. All of the documents, mortgage, solemn declaration of Mrs. Morgan, assignment of shares to company by way of security for loan and order to the company to pay the money to Leighton as well as the agreement to extend the time for payment bear the genuine signature of Mrs. Morgan, the defendant. The only signatures that are disputed are those to the application to the company for shares and the application for a loan, which are signed in her name either by Williams, the clerk, at her husband's request or as found by the Court of Appeal by the husband himself. In either case, it seems clear she knew all about it from her husband. The execution of the first four documents are witnessed and authenticated by Yarwood, an attorney and notary public, who testifies to the facts. The other document, the extension, is witnessed by a clerk, Planta, who also testifies and by a notary public now dead. The documents were by her own admission on oath read to Catherine Morgan before she signed them. She never appears to have seen Leighton, the agent, personally in connection with any of these transactions.\nNo one made any misrepresentation to her of the contents of any one of the documents.\nAll of the books kept by Morgan during the time when these transactions took place and which presumably would throw light on the transactions, have been destroyed.\nThe conclusions 1 drew after hearing the argument and reading the evidence and the judgments below, were that both Morgan and his wife were parties to the conspiracy to defraud the company respondent and that Mrs. Morgan's story of the facts connected with the signing of the mortgage and the other papers, in March, 1895, before the attorney and notary public Yarwood and the extension, in 1898, before Planta and Norris, the notary public, are pure creatures of her fancy, or to use her own language when giving her evidence, \"perfectly ridiculous\" in the face of the proved and admitted facts.\nAs to Morgan's complicity in the fraud, I have not the slightest doubt. Agreeing with the Court of Appead on this point, I would confirm their judgment and dismiss this appeal, but not being able to accept their \"charitable judgment\" giving Mrs. Morgan the benefit of the doubt and holding her equally guilty with her husband of the conspiracy to defraud, I would allow the cross-appeal and hold both liable for the amount due upon the mortgage and amend the judgment below accordingly. IDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent is a building society which was incorporated in 1890 under the Ontario Act respecting building societies and has since carried on its business in Toronto and shortly after its incorporation created a branch board in Nanaimo, in British Columbia, through which certain dealings in question herein were had upon which this action by respondent against Caroline Morgan, wife of the appellant Thomas Morgan, and said Thomas Morgan is founded.\nThe statement of claim alleges that Caroline Morgan made an application in writing, on 9th August, 1894, to said company for an advance of $1,500 to be secured by mortgage on certain real estate in Nanaimo falsely and fraudulently representing that the said land was worth $1,200 and buildings thereon were worth $1,900 and that she had paid $1,200 for said land though she well knew the said land was under $500 in value and had no buildings thereon.\nIt is further alleged therein that, on the 28th of March, 1895, she signed a statutory declaration by which she falsely and fraudulently represented to the plaintiff:\u2014\n(a) That she had been in continuous and undisputed possession of the said lots and every part thereof since on or about the 1st day of November, 1894.\n(b) That the various buildings described in her said application for a loan were erected wholly upon the said lands.\n(c) That the said lots and building (house) were only charged or encumbered by an amount of $1,000 due for lumber on or used in such house and to be paid out of such loan of $1,500\u2014from plaintiff, whereas the facts were that the defendant, Caroline Morgan, never had been in possession of said lots nor was there any building erected thereon or any money due or accruing due by the said defendant for lumber in connection with any building or otherwise in relation to said lots.\nThen Thomas Morgan is charged with being well aware of the making such false and fraudulent repre- sentations and purpose thereof and for the purpose of participating in the moneys to be advanced was a party to all said false and fraudulent representations.\nIt is further charged that they for the purpose of carrying out their fraudulent scheme procured one John Daniel Foreman, the appraiser of the respondent, to make the false and fraudulent statement in a statutory declaration of 10th August, 1894, that\nthe said lots were worth, exclusive of buildings, in cash $1,200, and that the buildings then completed were worth in cash $1,900, and that the property would bring at a forced sale in cash at that time $3,000, both of said defendants well knowing that the said land was worth less than $500 and had no buildings whatever erected thereon.\nThe statement of claim alleges respondent advanced the sum of $1,500 and has thereby suffered damages.\nIt is further alleged that Caroline Morgan executed a mortgage on said land and thereby covenanted to pay the mortgage.\nRelief is prayed against both Morgans on the ground of fraud, and alternatively against Caroline Morgan on her covenant in the mortgage.\nThese charges were denied by the statement of defence and it was further alleged therein that:\u2014\nIn or about the year 1894 she purchased from William K. Leighton, agent of the plaintiff company, at the city of Nanaimo, in the Province of British Columbia, certain shares in the plaintiff company and signed or believed she signed applications for or other documents in connection with the purchase of these shares. If the signatures of Caroline Morgan appended to the alleged mortgage and relative statutory declaration were made by her (which the defendants deny) they were made in mistake or fundamental error, under the belief that she was signing documents in connection with the purchase of these shares and with no purpose or intention of signing the alleged mortgage or relative statutory declaration.\nOn the issue thus raised the parties went to trial before Mr. Justice Gregory, who accepted the evidence of the defendants as substantially correct and, by his opinion judgment, reports most favourably on the demeanour, integrity and intelligence of Caroline Morgan, but less favourably upon the intelligence and manner of Thomas Morgan yet accepting him as a truthful witness.\nHe accordingly dismissed the action with costs.\nThereupon the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. That court, Mr. Justice Irving dissenting, allowed the appeal as against Thomas Morgan, but dismissed it against his wife and he now appeals here and respondent cross-appeals as against them both.\nThe appellant Thomas Morgan was asked in the witness box to write his wife's name and he did so. There was no other specimen of Morgan's handwriting placed before the court. There was no expert evidence of any kind called. No expert opinion of any kind was given by any of the witnesses called.\nThe application which the statement of claim makes the basis of the action charging fraud against Mrs. Morgan was produced and shewn him and he denied ever having seen it or signed the name \"Caroline Morgan\" thereto.\nThe application for shares in the respondent company was also shewn him and he also denied ever having seen same or signed the name of Caroline Morgan thereto.\nThe Court of Appeal using and acting upon their own knowledge of handwriting as a result of the comparison of that single specimen of Morgan's writing of the name \"Caroline Morgan,\" with the signature to said applications, has come to the conclusion that he signed his wife's name to said applications. The only extended opinion of those concurring in the result is the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Galliher, who deals with the matter as follows:\u2014\nAs to the husband, Thomas C. Morgan, I entertain no doubt whatever that he signed the name \"Caroline Morgan\" to Exhibit 1, Application for Loan; and Exhibit 2, Application for Shares; and that he was from the beginning a party to the fraud practised against the company.\nConsidering that he swears that he never saw any of these papers until years afterwards, I place no credence whatever in his testimony. Looking at Exhibit 1, Application for Loan, we find some twenty questions answered, including value of building, description of buildings, amount due on same, rental value, etc., buildings which never existed on the premises. One would indeed need to be credulous to assume that he signed this document and knew nothing of its contents. It is as deliberate and brazen a piece of fraud as could be perpetrated and I find the evidence fully connects Thomas C. Morgan with it.\nMr. Justice Martin in a brief note suggests it is only after some hesitation he allows the appeal. The Chief Justice gave no written opinion.\nConsidering that the claim made is based upon the allegations of false and fraudulent misrepresentation of this man's wife as above set forth, and that he is only charged with knowingly aiding her therein, and that she is exonerated by the Court of Appeal; that there was no application to amend the pleading so framing the action, and no suggestion of amendment; that the notice of appeal gave as one of the grounds thereof that the learned trial judge should have found both defendants party to the fraud alleged in the statement of claim, I most respectfully submit the foregoing conclusion is erroneous in law.\nIf the charge had been made that he had conspired with others than his wife to commit the alleged frauds or that by forging and use of the forgery of his wife's name he had accomplished same, I might be able to understand such a conclusion of law, but as the record stands, I cannot.\nI also submit, for the reasons I am about to give, that, in law and fact, the conclusions reached are quite unwarranted.\nThe learned trial judge, who heard the evidence and saw and heard these defendants and gave credit to their story, ought not to have been reversed, especially in such a case as this, involving thereby a finding of gross fraud and perjury, where there are no collateral facts or circumstances or fundamental facts regarding matters in dispute upon which the appellate court so reversing can with absolute confidence and assurance rely and feel they are not mistaken. I respectfully submit mere skill in comparison of handwriting when used upon a single bit of handwriting, where a man failed to spell his wife's Christian name correctly, is hardly such a stable foundation to build upon.\nLet us, only dealing just now with the appeal of Thomas Morgan, look first at broad, salient features of the story with which we have to deal and see whether in it there is any inherent probability of its justifying such a finding as the Court of Appeal has reached, and later deal with the minor details relied upon in argument for respondent.\nThe local board of respondent was organized with one Leighton (who seems to have done a mixed sort of business of insurance, brokerage, and in short general agency) as secretary. He later is spoken of as treasurer, and sometimes as agent. He no doubt managed or was the active man in managing all the business of the respondent in that Nanaimo district. It would seem from a book produced which he was given by respondent to keep therein track of subscriptions for shares and payments thereon, that he got subscriptions for shares in the respondent company from a great many people and received money thereon and no doubt transmitted much, if not all, as in duty bound, to the respondent.\nThis seems to have been opened in the end of 1890, shortly after the local board was constituted, and a number, if not all, of the directors on that board were among the first subscribers for shares.\nThe appellant says he was solicited by one Williams, a clerk of Leighton, to take shares in said company, and that he finally, but when he is unable to say, assented and told him to have them \"taken out\" as his expression is, in his wife's name. Williams, some years later, left for parts unknown and (up to the trial) had not since been found. Leighton, still later, is sworn by a clerk of his, who succeeded Williams, to have been much worried over some crooked dealings he had got into, either through Williams or otherwise, and ultimately died of brain disease in an asylum.\nOne cannot help suspecting that the terse description sworn by Morgan to have been used by one Andrews in respondent's employment, when investigating this matter and hearing Morgan's story, fits the office managed by Leighton:\u2014\nAndrews says, according to this:\u2014\nThat is a rotten combination over there.\nThere is another case just similar to that happened George Thompson, and they can't find George Thompson.\nAndrews, who was in court, and heard what Morgan swore to, was not called to contradict him. I assume Leighton and Williams were both most dishonest men and given to practices such as this case indicates beyond a shadow of doubt they were guilty of in relation to the loan in question.\nThe applications for shares and for loan were apparently filled up by Williams. Mrs. Morgan's name is signed thereto in a handwriting clearly not hers.\nI should say it was signed by this man Williams if I were to permit myself to use my impression received from a comparison of hand-writing.\nThey were dated 9th August, 1894. At that time Leighton had a vacant lot which he had acquired in the previous June from one Roberts, who had mortgaged same to another company for $300.\nIt was the description of this lot which was inserted in the application for loan. The application represented it to be improved in the manner set forth in the statement of claim.\nNeither the appellant nor his wife had then, or at any previous time, any real estate of any kind.\nAn appraiser's certificate of valuation of this property was made at the foot of the application for loan by one John D. Foreman, a member of the said local board from its beginning, representing its value as stated in the application and certifying to the good character and credit of Caroline Morgan, the applicant.\nThis was in the form of a statutory declaration taken before said A. S. Williams, a notary public, who had also subscribed as witness to the signature \"Caroline Morgan\" signed to the said applications.\nThese applications, so supported, were at once forwarded to the respondent at Toronto, and a stock certificate for fifteen shares, dated 1st November, 1894, was issued, but never delivered to Mrs. Morgan, or any one for her.\nThe payments therefor were to begin 1st December, 1894. Whether she paid from that date as contemplated by this certificate, or when, is not clear. It is clear, however, that Leighton in whom was the title to the vacant lot to the extent of an equity of redemption therein subject to the mortgage for three hundred dollars, by deed purported to transfer the lot as if free from mortgage to said Williams on the 7th January, 1895, in consideration of $350.\nOne Peto, who witnessed this deed, I imagine possibly another employee of Leighton, seems to have made the affidavit of execution only on 28th March, 1895, before E. M. Yarwood, of whom we will hear more presently.\nWhat purpose this conveyance to Williams was intended to serve puzzles one, for on the 18th January, 1895, he conveys by deed of that date to Caroline Morgan for the consideration of $225 same land, but subject to a mortgage of $300 to the British Columbia Land and Investment Agency made 8th February, 1893.\nThe deed is witnessed by Leighton, who makes the affidavit of execution before the same Mr. Yarwood on the 28th March, 1895. That seems to have been a busy day for Mr. Yarwood, for it was on the same day Mrs. Morgan is alleged to have called and executed the mortgage in question, the transfer of her shares aforesaid as a further security for the loan, and the order upon respondent to pay Leighton the proceeds of the loan; taken the statutory declaration by her that she was the absolute owner of said lands and had been in possession since 1st of Decem- ber, 1894; and testified to a number of other curious palpable lies as facts. All these instruments are of that date and subscribed by Mr. Yarwood as the attesting witness or notary public taking them.\nAnd there is still another thing he is supposed to have done the same day, as a notary public, that is to certify that she appeared before him and being first made acquainted with the contents of the annexed instrument (i.e., the mortgage) and nature and effect thereof, acknowledged same etc., and that she executed without fear or undue influence of her husband, etc.\nThen on the 6th April, 1895, the deeds from Roberts to Leighton, from Leighton to Williams and Williams to Mrs. Morgan, were, I infer from the account of Yarwood & Young rendered Leighton, and other evidence, registered by that firm.\nWhy the registration was delayed till that time is unexplained. But it does appear by the report of Mr. Yarwood to Leighton that he must have had entrusted to him the completion of the title and must have either paid no attention to what he was doing when taking the alleged declaration of Mrs. Morgan and certifying as he did as to her execution of the mortgage, or he would, as solicitor for the respondent, have found ample reason for further inquiry as to a good many things, for example, how the company could be making a loan of fifteen hundred dollars on a property passing from one party to another at such prices as evidenced by the deeds, and that no one had in fact paid off the prior mortgage, though a discharge had been got and withheld from registration.\nAs he ventured as witness to explain this first, by saying he did not read or observe that, and had noth- ing to do with it, and further, by saying it was a building society loan, I may, parenthetically as it were, remark that this attitude of Mr. Yarwood towards his duty and the facts suggest how easy it was for him to fall a victim to the fraudulent arts and devices of Leighton, a practised master of fraud.\nBut above all he certainly should not have permitted Mrs. Morgan to have taken the statutory declaration of which as the solicitor concerned on behalf of respondent he may be supposed, indeed presumed to have known the import and purpose and the consequences of its falsity.\nAnd applying the test of the account he made out against her, yet never sent her but delivered to Leighton, he was her solicitor and owed her a special duty as such I am far from assuming that he was intending at any time to make himself a party to a deliberate fraud, but I do think the fair inference from all he says and the contents of these documents is that he simply signed because of his confidence in Leighton. If he had discharged his duty, she never could have been induced or trapped into signing these documents.\nIt is quite possible though attesting the documents by his signature, he merely took the word of Leighton that they were all right, and signed accordingly. She says she never saw him but saw his partner (who is not called), and signed in his presence what she was told was an application for shares. She never was told, she says, anything else. Though she refers to Mr. Young as reading the documents, I do not think any one of experience will take this in its literal sense. No one seems to have at the trial pressed her to explain exactly what she meant by his reading and we must use our common sense. She was entirely without experience in business matters. And, though a woman of education and intelligence, as the learned trial judge reports, any one of experience knows how little many such persons appreciate what they are doing in dealing with business matters entirely foreign to the limited sort of education unfortunately given too many of her sex.\nWe must then ask ourselves if it is really conceivable that she could knowingly have made a false statutory declaration, as Yarwood is made to certify she did take before him, if she had really had the document read to her. The learned trial judge who had the best opportunity, by seeing and hearing her, and thus of knowing whether she was likely or not to make such a false declaration, has decided in no uncertain terms that in his opinion she would not.\nI have read her depositions on examination for discovery and her evidence at the trial and come to a similar conclusion. We must bear in mind that she was giving evidence some fifteen years after all this had transpired and may be mistaken in many details, but she knew she never had any such property or any dealings for a loan of this character, and had but one thought in regard to any business relations with Leigthon and respondent and that was the subscription for shares in respondent company to be paid for in small monthly instalments, and that after paying for some years thereon, she had agreed to transfer same to Leighton and he was to repay by similar small monthly payments $200 therefor, in consideration of her so transferring.\nThis, she says, led her to signing another document in the presence of Mr. Planta. A document is pro- duced which seems to bear her signature and of the date she indicates as about the time when she supposed she was transferring her shares to Leighton. This document is an agreement for the extension of time for payment of the mortgage and is attested by Planta, then a clerk in Leighton's office. Again we have one Norris, now dead, a brother-in-law of Leighton, and a notary public, signing a certificate of her having acknowledged it in her presence. She says she never saw him on any such occasion, and never heard of any such mortgage or proposed extension. She does say, however, that from about that time till some time after she had moved to Vancouver, which would be the same year I think, Leighton continued to make his payments to her which were sometimes collected by her brother in Nanaimo.\nPlanta, who is called by the respondent, seems to have no definite recollection of this extension agreement, but identifies his signature as witness thereto. He, however, corroborates her as to the collection by her brother from Leighton of the monthly payments just referred to. That seems to me a very strong circumstance corroborative of her whole story. Indeed, twist and turn the case round in any way, it seems fatal to respondent's contention of her knowingly joining in a fraud. Then we find the duplicate copy of the extension agreement turns up, not in her hands, but where Leighton's custody of it left it to be found and whence it was produced and given her or some one for her shortly before the trial.\nNow in all these years there is only one communication from the respondent company to her, and that is a brief note of 9th March, 1898, which she denies ever getting and which is as follows:\u2014 Your policy for $1,500 expires on April 9th, and must be renewed with the company selected by this Association. Kindly call on Mr. W. K. Leighton for complete application form and pay him the premium.\nInstead of the insurance being renewed by her going to Leighton, or he to her, we are told by Planta of its having been renewed by an application not signed by her, but by him for her when he was in Leighton's office and would have done so under his instructions though evidently suspecting or having reason to suspect its fraudulent character. It is hardly likely with this sort of suspicion of his master that he would have forgotten seeing Mrs. Morgan in relation thereto if any occasion therefor as the notice indicates.\nThe Morgans were still living in Nanaimo when this was done. Can we in face of her sworn denial and a not impossible explanation by her, fairly and properly assume that because she signed the declaration of 28th March, 1894, she must be held to have committed a deliberate fraud ? And as a necessary consequence hold that her whole story is a tissue of perjury ? If she deliberately and knowingly took that false declaration she must have done so for a fraudulent purpose and if she committed such a fraud, she could not forget it and must be following it up now with perjury, and all that for a share in a sum of eleven to twelve hundred dollars to be divided amongst three or four, for that would be all that was left after paying the prior mortgage and expenses.\nSometimes one gets so disgusted with the standard of truth and honest dealing too often adopted by some passing as reputable people as to be possessed of wide awake suspicions. I am not prepared for my part to carry it so far as to brand this woman to be presumed to be from all we can learn, most highly respectable and honest, as guilty of gross fraud and perjury. It would be my legal duty if trying her for such offences with no more evidence than there appears here to at once direct her discharge.\nAs to whether she was so negligent as to be liable, I will deal with that presently. But before leaving this subject of her being guilty of fraud, I must point out it is all based on what if anything is mere negligence. What should we think if Mr. Yarwood, for example, had been joined as defendant, and a trial judge had found him, because of obvious oversights a party to the fraud which might have been averted by greater care ? For my part I think the one proposition is just as monstrous as the other and both unfounded. And when we reflect that he and all others, save possibly the clerks in his employ, had unbounded faith in Leighton, it is easy to comprehend how such bold swindles as involved here were accomplished. Such a man, eager and bent upon his fraudulent purpose, watches his opportunity, day by day and month by month, to seize the occasion when those to be dealt with, are, by over-confidence in him, lulled into security and as it were, put asleep, and put off, or seized when off, their guard.\nThose inclined to doubt the feasibility and success of such ventures unless helped by the criminal connivance of those claiming to be mere victims and thereby led to charge them with being accessories to fraud, should reflect for a moment upon the innumerable cases of patent-right swindles which led to a change in the law governing notes founded on the consideration of an interest in a patent; and the well known syndicate swindles; and perhaps above all on the too common cases of those wretched breaches of trust on the part of those doing a business that controls the money of other people. Inexperienced people at each new disclosure of such cases, marvel at the boldness and adroitness of him perpetrating the fraud and the incredible, or almost so, stupidity of those enabling the swindler to secure signatures to almost anything. But we know, if experienced, that all such victims are by no means stupid or ignorant, indeed are often keen business men.\nAgain, we must use our common sense and accept the assistance of the trial judge in all such cases.\nIt seems to me for the foregoing reasons that the claim against Mrs. Morgan on the grounds of fraud taken in the statement of claim must fail and with it must fall the claim against the alleged accessory.\nBut the Court of Appeal finds he signed the applications and, though she did not, she is in some way to be held guilty of being a party to the fraud.\nIs there any tangible ground upon which that can rest? Why should he even if to be presumed a rascal, deliberately contrive to put his young innocent wife into such a position? I pressed counsel for respondent on this and got in reply no suggestion that will for a moment in light of other facts wear even a plausible appearance.\nIt is said he was under some obligation to Leighton.\nHe denied in his examination for discovery signing said applications and told what that obligation to Leighton was. He gave details of how the latter came about. He had sometime before these occurrences got Leighton to indorse his paper for $2,790 at the bank, to be paid off by monthly payments of $103 a month, and says he paid accordingly and gave Leighton $400 for this use of his name as surety.\nI have no doubt the respondent's solicitor, who heard this story, accepted it as perfectly true, or we should have found some effort to discredit it by producing evidence from the bank to destroy it.\nThe statement of claim alleges that his motive was to participate in the proceeds of the fraud and there was thus afforded a fine opportunity to have investigated and if true, proven it at the trial with the double effect of shewing he did participate and that he was not truthful in his story as to his relation with Leighton.\nIt is urged he was a tailor in narrow financial circumstances. Granted that, for argument's sake, is every tailor under such conditions to be presumed a rascal ? Or that he is ready to become such and so stupid in his rascality as to bring quite needlessly into his scheme his wife and thereby, whilst using her as a tool thereof, to multiply the dangers of discovery.\nWhy should the deed of this vacant lot owned by Leighton not have been made to Morgan and he give the necessary mortgage ? I can conceive of Leighton not desiring to proffer such a loan in his own name, but why must he use Mrs. Morgan's ? Again, why if Morgan's financial needs were the mainspring of these acts now in question, should the negotiations have dallied along from the 9th of August till the latter half of April?\nCounsel at first suggested in answer to this inquiry there must be three monthly payments of instalments on stock before a mortgage could be taken. But his junior, also general solicitor for respondent, better conversant with the usual mode of dealing, frankly and properly admitted this was not an obstacle, for these small payments could be made at one time in advance and the borrower be recouped by proceeds of the loan. Indeed, there is no explanation possible for this delay upon the theory that Morgan's necessities were the moving causes or one of the chief parts thereof.\nIt is quite conceivable that Leighton having an unregistered deed of the lot, hesitating how to use it to his best advantage, could frame such a scheme and be very uncertain step by step, just how he was to accomplish his purpose, and thus might, hesitating, delay and bide his opportunity of proceeding safely, and hence let the matter drift along. We have not that data furnished us to do more than surmise, though I fancy respondent ought to have got and presented much of it to see how this man's surroundings shaped his actions.\nWe have enough proved in this case to establish conclusively that Leighton was, from the start which began with inducing Foreman to certify to a false report of valuation and the rest of the board or three of them recklessly to stamp it with approval, a somewhat accomplished adept in fraudulent practices.\nEven if the man be dead, no sentiment should restrain or restrict us in our purely scientific inquiry. The honour of the living is at stake.\nIt is said we have no other instance proven against him. Do we need any? No one as a rule goes to pieces (to use expressive slang) morally speaking in a day. The internal evidence in this case demonstrates the process of moral decadence had progressed very far in his case before his undertaking the work of the 9th and 10th of August, 1894. His character is indelibly disclosed in the preparation of the applications of the former date now in question, and the Foreman report and indorsement thereof of the latter date. The court was not sitting to investigate his career, and it might have been difficult under the pleadings for defendants to have got in general evidence relative thereto, but we have the curious side light given by Mr. Andrew's statements to Morgan already adyerted to as given by the latter and allowed by respondent to go uncontradicted or unexplained.\nThen to complete Leighton's connection with the matter, we find a sham sale by the respondent company to a relative of his under the power of sale in the mortgage without serving the usual notice or even sending a letter to the mortgagor.\nThe mortgage provided this could be done, but it also provided for the inexpensive service of a notice by registered post.\nOne cannot help thinking it was a very harsh and ill-considered proceeding. But it is very obvious it was all contrived by Leighton, who represented he had a man ready to buy at the price needed to realize the debt.\nAll this is but another illustration of the strange power this man Leighton exercised over all he came in contact with.\nThat brings me to consider the claim made alternatively to hold Mrs. Morgan liable on the covenant in the mortgage.\nThat is presented in two ways. In the first place it is said her ignorance of what she was doing was not of that character which would entitle her to succeed under a plea of non est factum.\nI think the evidence of herself and husband, if be- lieved (as the learned trial judge and I believe it), is just of that kind which has many times been held as a complete answer by way of such plea to the action upon the deed. I have already written at such length demonstrating my view of the facts of which I conceive a right understanding of the utmost importance herein, that I do not propose to labour with the law bearing thereupon. That is in such a case well settled unless we are to re-open the question and limit as has been suggested by high authority, such a defence under such circumstances as set up here to the illiterate, and deprive the literate and educated people entirely of such a defence in cases where they could have read what they signed, but failed to do so.\nWith great respect, I submit, the doing or trying to do so would start anew a dangerous discussion and help the rascals to prey upon honest people.\nThe next way in which the claim is presented on this basis of liability independent of active fraud is that Mrs. Morgan was negligent and thereby misled respondent.\nIt seems to me that if she was negligent, that negligence, if any, was induced solely by the acts of those representing the respondent and ostensibly in the course of executing the business of respondent; and that in such case it cannot be heard to complain.\nCertainly Leighton was held out by respondent, whatever it choose to call him, as its agent, and so also were the solicitors who procured by the direction of Leighton the execution of the documents she signed.\nUnder such circumstances respondent can have no recourse against her.\nThe very document upon which reliance is placed shewed upon its face, when regard was had to the deeds under which she claimed, that it was palpably false and should have misled no one.\nIf she trusted too implicitly to others, then those others seem to have been as blindly trusted by the respondent. I think it has no ground to complain.\nIn parting with this case I may be permitted to say that in all cases of this character it is generally possible to demonstrate, by reference to collateral facts and attendant and surrounding circumstances, when thoroughly investigated, whether the accused has been guilty of fraud as charged or not, and I regret that so many clues, leading to such disclosures and light as such circumstances and collateral facts might afford, have been entirely neglected.\nI have already pointed out one of these in relation to the charge of appellant's hope of participation in the fruits of such frauds as committed and there are many of minor import in the path of such an inquiry.\nThe facts that no steps were taken to adduce expert evidence in relation to the disputed signatures though they were denied in the examinations for discovery, and thus respondent warned in time, suggests a grave suspicion that those then concerned for respondent certainly did not think it worth while as likely to maintain respondent's contention.\nIt may be answered respondent had a right to rely on the rule of law entitling judges at trial to compare the writing of the genuine with the disputed. Experience teaches that such a proceeding is most hazardous. Even when the most scientific means have been applied by expansion of the letters and measurement of the angles and all implied therein mistakes are not unknown. When the facts of the case tend to render it extremely probable that the writing denied is genuine, and the denial is rather a mere obstruction in way of completing proof, it is convenient and beneficial that a judge may dispose of such a contest by relying upon the rule. But to invoke and rely upon the rule alone against the sworn testimony of those accused, seems to me, I most respectfully submit a denial of justice and what is not generally expected of a learned trial judge, and especially so, when the party, asking the court thus to act upon its own expert knowledge, has not exhausted many other most obvious means of testing the veracity of those who have pledged their oath in denial.\nI think the frank manner in which counsel for the Morgans invited every probing of matters bearing upon the conduct of his clients, whether technically admissible or not, might have been relied upon to have facilitated the investigation of the bank accounts of Morgan, even without forcing the bank to exhibit its books at the trial.\nThe facts that no one ever asked him to vote or pay taxes in respect of the property ought alone to have stood as a barrier in plaintiff's way of claiming any benefit therefrom in absence of more investigation than mere books in a municipal office.\nThe appeal ought to be allowed with costs here and in the court below, the cross-appeal of respondent dismissed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the respondent company fails on both the appeal and cross-appeal. First, as to the cross-appeal. The learned trial judge finds that Mrs. Morgan never knew that the property comprised in the instrument signed by her had been conveyed to her by Leighton and never knew until the action was brought that she had signed a mortgage or applied for a loan; that she had never intended to enter into such a transaction, but had supposed that she was merely signing documents incidental first, to an application for, and afterwards, to a sale of shares.\nAlthough the facts in the aspect they assumed under Mr. Ritchie's advocacy seemed, at first sight, to point to another conclusion, I think no good reason has been advanced for reversing this finding of the trial judge concurred in by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellant's contention must rest upon the proposition that Mrs. Morgan had agreed to permit herself to be used as the recipient of the title to the property and as mortgagor for the purpose of obtaining a loan for the benefit of Leighton or that she knew she was engaging in a transaction of some such character. The fact that she actually paid for the shares points the other way; but the controversy in this aspect of it, is essentially a dispute about Mrs. Morgan's credibility and upon that question this is pre-eminently a case in which a Court of Appeal ought to be guided by the conclusion of a competent and painstaking trial judge who has heard the witnesses.\nThe finding is clearly sufficient to support a plea of non est factum. As to estoppel, I think there is no evidence of negligence. Mrs. Morgan supposed she was signing an application for shares presented by a person who was clearly the company's agent to take such applications. She did so in the presence of a reputable solicitor. She was acting under the direction of her husband, who, she supposed, understood the nature of the transaction. In these circumstances, I do not think she owed any duty to the respondent company which she can be fairly charged with having neglected. The fons et origo mali was the dishonesty of the company's agent. I think she was under no duty to them to take steps to protect them against his possible frauds.\nAs to the appeal, there are some things in the evidence, no doubt, calculated to excite one's suspicion as to Morgan's complicity in or knowledge of Leighton's real design; still in the last analysis the question whether he was or was not implicated in Leighton's fraud must be decided as a question of credibility. All the facts were before the trial judge and I see no reason to suppose that any of the considerations which led the majority of the Court of Appeal to reverse him were overlooked by him. I am unable to find in the specimen of the handwriting produced evidence of sufficient weight to justify the reversal of his finding.\nI think the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs, the appeal allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and on this branch of the case the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Livingston, Garrett, King O'Dell.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Cowan, Ritchie & Grant.\n[1] 17 B.C.

(1900), ss. 178 and 179.\nIn the City of Sydney the Dominion Iron and Steel Co. and the Dominion Coal Co. owned railways passing along a public highway and intersected by the tracks of the Cape Breton Electric Railway Co. Under the provisions of secs. 178 and 179 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.N.S. (1900), ch. 99) an order-in-council was passed directing that the highway be carried under the said railway tracks, the Dominion Iron & Steel Co. to execute the work and the cost to be paid in a specific proportion by the City and the three companies and \u201cthat all the land damages be paid by the City of Sydney,\u201d B. owned land opposite the railway tracks and by the construction of the subway the sidewalk in front thereof was narrowed and altered and access to it changed. Claiming that his property was greatly depreciated in value thereby he brought an action against the City of Sydney for compensation therefor.\nHeld, that the \u201cland damages\u201d which the city was to pay would include damages for injurious affection such as B. claimed. But\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that the city was not liable for such damages, B.\u2019s only recourse being against the company which executed the work.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (47 N.S. Rep. 480) affirmed, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The only question on the appeal was whether or not the plaintiff had a right of action against the City of Sydney for injurious affection to his property by construction of a subway on a public highway in that city. The trial judge and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that he had none.\nMellish E.G. for the appellant.\nFindlay Macdonald for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant owns property in Sydney fronting on Victoria Street where a subway has been built which reduces the width of the street and leaves, for the length of the subway, a street of about half the width previously existing and in a manner changes the access to the appellant\u2019s property.\nHe claims that his property has been injuriously affected thereby and that respondent, whose council promoted the creation of this subway by an application to the Governor in Council to direct such work for the public safety as means of crossing two railways, is answerable to him for the damage thus done to his property.\nThe work was directed by the Governor in Council after hearing respondent and the representatives of the railway companies concerned and the work executed by the Dominion Iron and Steel Co., Limited, according to a plan annexed to the order-in-council. The terms of the order-in-council, material for our present consideration, are as follows:\u2014\n4. That the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Limited, shall undertake the construction of the subway at the offer made by the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Limited, viz., $35,000, and that the City of Sydney shall contribute $5,000; the Cape Breton Electric Company, Limited, and the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, each to contribute one-third of the remainder not to exceed the sum of $10,000, balance of cost of construction to be paid by the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Limited.\n5. That all the land damages be paid by the City of Sydney.\n6. That detailed plans and specifications be submitted by the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Limited, for approval by the Government.\nThe courts below have held that inasmuch as there was no land taken from the appellant, he has no remedy for anything in the way of his land being injuriously affected.\nThe order-in-council was founded upon sections 178 and 179 of the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act\u201d which are identical in terms with sections 187 and 188 of the \u201cRailway Act of Canada,\u201d as consolidated in 1888, save in substituting the Governor in Council for the Railway Committee.\nIt seems to me that the first question raised is whether or not an action can be founded upon such an order. It is quite correctly stated in the judgment appealed from that the order-in-council cannot enlarge the claim for land damages which must rest upon the statute. But it has been decided in numerous cases that an action may be founded upon orders made under said sections 187 and 188 of the \u201cRailway Act of Canada.\u201d The first was the case of the City of Toronto v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[2]. The action upon the order in that case gave rise to much judicial difference of opinion.\nSome able judges in the Court of Appeal seem to have hesitated to hold that in a case where the municipality had not applied to the Railway Committee it could be made liable to such an action.\nIt so happened in that case that municipal authorities had represented that the condition of things needed something to be done for public safety. This enabled some judges to hold the city liable; though doubting much the liability if that element were out of the case.\nThat case was followed by the special case of In re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and County and Township of York[3], which had to be decided in part at least on the bare question of the right to bring an action upon such an order though the party to be held liable thereunder had taken no part in the proceedings before the Railway Committee.\nThe court held on the facts one of the municipalities could not be held a person interested, but the other was and that the action would lie.\nThen the question came again before the Ontario courts in the case of City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co., wherein it was sought to recover from the city the proportionate share of the cost of certain protective measures ordered by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council of Canada.\nThe learned trial judge in that case followed the foregoing decisions and his judgment was maintained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThereupon the city appealed to the Judicial Commitee of the Privy Council. The result is reported in City of Toronto v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4], from which it appears that by that time former doubts as to the range and efficacy of such an order had disappeared and the only doubt raised was as to the constitutional power to make an order as against a municipality created by a provincial legislature and supposed until the earliest of these cases to be endowed only with such powers as its creator had given it and hence could not be used for any ulterior purpose as a means of taxing those within its limits.\nThe Judicial Committee overruled the objection and held the order valid and binding upon the city.\nI am unable to distinguish in principle the ground proceeded upon in those cases from that invoked herein which is merely another application of the same principle to a slightly different state of facts.\nIn the last analysis it is simply a question of the jurisdiction of the Governor in Council within the sections relied upon to execute the purposes of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d by such an order as made.\nThe section neither expressly nor impliedly directs how the purpose is to be executed. Its object is plain. It may be said that there is an implication that the statutory method of expropriation alone can bound the operation of such an order. The language of Lord Macnaghten in Corporation of Parkdale v. West[5], to which I will presently advert, lends colour to such a proposition. But that was before the decisions I have referred to and legal history outlined therein.\nIt would, however, I submit, seem quite competent for the Governor in Council either to direct that the procedure towards making the crossing should be according to the method laid down in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d whereby the arbitration proceedings provided thereby might be invoked and that all usually done before a railway is built, such as filing a plan or scheme, and that satisfaction be made the owner of land taken for damages, or security given therefor, before any proceedings taken; or that the work be done according to plans specified by the order and be paid for as specified and the land damages be determined as the law in such case may have provided and be also paid by any such party as the order should direct. If that party happened to be a municipality it might well be left in the case of a work to be done on or to improve its own streets to its exercising its power of negotiating with those concerned or resorting to its powers of expropriation or taking its chances of an action and directing accordingly.\nNow of the four parties concerned in the execution of this work one only was selected to execute it according to the plan proposed and evidently as a contractor doing the work for a fixed price and each of the other three parties who were concerned was to contribute as directed to the cost the sums respectively allotted as its share of the burden.\nRespondent in this respect was to pay some of the cost of execution and meet the land damages.\nIt certainly cannot be said that each of the railway companies was to be expected to file a plan and give notice thereof and have a separate set of arbitration proceedings to determine the amounts to be paid for land damages. And it cannot be said that one merely undertaking on behalf of itself and others the contract to execute the work was expected to assume the responsibility for a series of arbitrations with which it was to have no concern.\nIt was clearly intended that respondent should attend to, and I think the fair inference is that it did attend to, the business of meeting such claims as involved in securing the right of way, but in course of doing so failed to recognize such claim as appellant might have. It widened the street allowance first and thus ameliorated the condition of things sure to result from executing the work. Whether or not that amelioration was sufficient to meet reasonably the rights of appellant in street accommodation is very questionable.\nThe street is vested in the respondent which took steps to have it so widened. Evidently respondent thus aided in promoting the furtherance of the enterprise and took part in the wrong, if any, now complained of, by co-operating with those executing the work by lowering or altering the grade of its street. It admits as much though not admitting a prior determination to do so.\nHaving not only submitted to, but, actively as its minutes shew, promoted the making of the order and agreed to be governed by it, and actively acted upon the order in question and taken no steps to bring about the usual mode of acquiring lands and satisfying the claims of those damnified, which it was by the terms of the order to have satisfied, can it in law say it is entitled to go free?\nI have looked at a great many cases of actions founded upon the rights given by virtue of statutes and from the case of Beckford v. Hood[6], where it was held that by virtue of the \u201cCopyright Act\u201d a man had acquired a right of property in his literary productions for infringement of which he had a right of action, down to the present time there have been a great many successful and unsuccessful attempts made to found actions upon some breach of duty created by a statute having been neglected or the statute intended to protect some one having been wilfully violated. As a result of these decisions I think it seems to be now the settled rule to look at the statute and determine in the language of Lord Cairns in the case of Atkinson v. Newcastle and Gateshead Waterworks Co.[7], at p. 448, whether or not an action can be said to fall within the purview thereof. He said there, when asked to follow the law as laid down in the case of Couch v. Steel[8], after doubting the rule therein:\u2014\nI cannot but think that that must, to a great extent, depend on the purview of the legislature in the particular statute, and the language which they have there employed, and more especially when, as here, the Act with which the court have to deal is not an Act of public and general policy, but is rather in the nature of a private legislative bargain with the body of undertakers as to the manner in which they will keep up certain public works.\nI ask now does it lie within the purview of this statute that an action is intended to be brought or may be brought founded upon the right created thereby?\nAs to the intention, I grant that for a new road and new enterprises crossing each other there is room to urge that the statutory method of expropriation is to be followed.\nBut as to the case of improved methods of crossing old roads where no new land is to be expropriated and where the proceedings indicated by the statute seem quite inappropriate and next to impossible, if not as I incline to think often absolutely impossible, to make them applicable and workable; is there no remedy by action founded upon the statute and the duties and rights founded upon and flowing therefrom?\nIt is this latter phase of what may arise any day on similar statutes that renders this an important case. The sections authorizing the order are evidently intended to apply to two entirely different conditions of things. And so far from the powers given being in any sense limited or bounded fry the procedural methods of expropriation, the cases I have cited shew how much further the courts have gone than might be implied from the judgment in Corporation of Parkdale v. West[9], where, on the facts, the municipality\u2019s power to expropriate was impossible of application.\nI have come to the conclusion that despite the neglect to adopt the methods provided by the statute, and impossibility of observing same, a case has arisen in which the right of action may be founded upon the statute and what has been ordered and done thereunder, for which respondent must answer.\nI also think it may be well rested upon the active co-operation of the respondent with the railway companies in doing that which was wholly illegal; especially if the only methods by which such a work can be executed lawfully are for a railway company to file a plan, etc., as provided for in the case of a new work or extension of an old one to which such methods will apply. The latter is not exactly my view, but rather the former. All I mean to say is that if these methods must be observed, then the respondent has wrongfully contributed, by the use made and permission given to use the street owned and controlled by it, to the detriment of the plaintiff in respect of his property.\nIn such case it would fall within Corporation of Parkdale v. West[10].\nI should prefer to rest upon the ground that the section comprising both that to which the mode of expropriation given by the Act and that to which such methods cannot be applied, the duty created by statute and order thereunder, as between the parties hereto was violated or neglected by respondent and must be answered by it in way of damages.\nThe charter of respondent by section 248 vests the legal title of the street in it, by section 249 requires it to keep the streets in repair and by section 265 empowers it to see that anything needed for their protection be observed and measures of prevention of any injury thereto may be taken and especially that it be not encumbered in any way by structures of any kind or otherwise. Armed with these powers it neglected each and all of them. It had, moreover, very ample power to close up permanently \u201cin whole or in part any road or street, or portion of a road or street within the town limits\u201d and had comprehensive powers of expropriation and compensation.\nOf course, all this and the bearing thereof herein is predicated upon the hypothesis that there is a claim for damages for injuriously affecting appellant\u2019s property. The language of Lord Macnaghten in Corporation of Parkdale v. West[11], is, though in an action against the municipality, clearly intended to demonstrate that there was in fact a case of a claim under the \u201cRailway Act of Canada\u201d as it appeared in the statute which existed before the consolidation of 1888.\nNow under that act as it then stood it was much more difficult to found any claim for the injuriously affecting land than under the later Act from which the \u201cRailway Act of Nova Scotia\u201d seems to have been almost entirely taken.\nThe judgment of Lord Macnaghten, therefore, seems to put beyond doubt that in such a case as this the man whose lands are to be injuriously affected by executing a work which it is duly competent for the Governor in Council to direct, is not confined to the terms of the single section by virtue of which the Governor in Council acts, but that the whole Act must be looked at and read in a way that will execute its probable purpose.\nIn the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act\u201d there are sections 88 and 138 respectively identical with sections 92 and 144 in the \u201cCanada Railway Act of 1888,\u201d which I repeat were more effectively framed to protect the owner of land injuriously affected than is to be found in the earlier acts which were before the court in Corporation of Parkdale v. West11.\nIn that case the railway companies concerned and the municipality had all agreed and signed a memorandum of agreement which provided for the municipality undertaking the work. It alone was sued and unsuccessfully sought to justify under the order of the Railway Committee. In many leading features that case and this are alike, but as respondent here did not, as defendant there, actually execute the work, that case does not by any means entirely cover this, but as to the measure of damages it seems in point so far as the judgment needed to go. There are many features in the facts of that case which render it of very doubtful help herein. For the work in question there was not wholly within Parkdale, but stretched into another municipality over which it had no control. There had been local legislation enabling the two municipalities to deal with the matter, but that was ignored in what was done. Yet as to the question of the measure of damages it seems a safe guide.\nI have no doubt on the facts there the damages were very much more obvious than here and presented a case much more adaptable to fit the procedural features of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d relative to expropriation to the facts than can be done by what is presented in this case.\nAll that I have set forth above as within the powers of respondent if it had chosen to exercise them were, upon its peculiar facts automatically, as it were, eliminated from consideration in that case.\nThe law of Ontario also rendered it impossible for a municipality to destroy the property of landowners fronting upon a street without making compensation.\nThe charter of respondent gave it more invasive power in this regard than existed in the Village of Parkdale under the \u201cMunicipal Act of Ontario,\u201d and so far as lowering the grade of the street may be involved the damages recoverable may have to be in that regard measured by a less stringent rule than might have been applicable to Parkdale. This, however, is a minor point, not going to the gist of the action.\nWhat I am concerned with is to demonstrate if I can that the Governor in Council acted within the power given and that it became the duty of each party falling within the scope of the order made, to do that which in law it could properly and lawfully do to carry out the order made and that if the respondent had exercised its numerous powers, it could have protected the street until those entitled to compensation had been satisfied or secured and that those entitled by virtue of their property being likely to be injuriously affected were of that class, and that unless and until either by the exercise of its own powers or the exercise by some one of the other parties concerned of a power lying within the power given it, the order of the Governor in Council remained inoperative save in so far as the implied duty thereunder cast upon the respondent to satisfy the claims for \u201cland damages.\u201d\nIt overlooked this and thereby in effect disobeyed the order by which the Governor in Council had directed in that regard as above quoted.\nHence in my view this action must rest upon the statute and the possible duties that the directing power thereunder may impose.\nI may repeat that in the alternative there seems a clear case of the respondent having not only neglected to preserve the street, but also joined in an attempt to destroy it unless protected by the authority of the order of the Governor in Council.\nThe respondent is clearly liable either for its failure to observe the terms of the order-in-council or for this violation of the terms of its charter imposing the duty to maintain the street. It is to be observed that the authority of the Governor in Council is by the amendment of 1898, now forming section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act of Nova Scotia,\u201d sub-sees. (h) and (i), more direct and specific than that given the Railway Committee in the \u201cRailway Act of Canada.\u201d\nThe sub-section (h) empowers the Governor in Council to direct relative to the construction, of railways upon, along or across highways, and sub-section (i) empowers as to the compensation to be made to any person or company in respect of any work or measure directed to be made or taken, or the oost thereof, or the proportion of such cost to be borne by any person or company.\nIn the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d applicable to this in the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, of which the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is one, a person is so defined as to include any body corporate, which the respondent is.\nThe order-in-council is not perhaps as clearly expressed as it might have been, but it certainly implies that the duty of compensation relative to land damages was imposed upon respondent.\nThen section 14 provides that any decision or order made by the Governor in Council under said \u201cRailway Act\u201d may be made an order of the Supreme Court and be enforced in like manner as any rule or order of such court.\nAll these provisions coupled with the line of cases I have cited upon the right to bring an action to enforce an order of the Railway Committee under the \u201cRailway Act of Canada\u201d decided since the decision in Corporation of Parkdale v. West[12], somewhat differentiate the point of view to be taken here from that held in that case as to what may be the scope of authority implied in an order-in-council under the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act.\u201d\nIt was suggested in argument by appellant\u2019s counsel that at least a declaration might be made by us which is not necessary or desired if the appeal can be maintained.\nIf we cannot maintain the appeal, I think we have no right to make any declaration, as this is not a suit for any such purpose even if such a suit is maintainable in a Nova Scotia court.\nAnd, again, it has been suggested that the company constructing the subway are the wrongdoers and should have been parties defendant.\nThat company was a mere contractor to do the work and get certain compensation and there is no right by or through it to reach the respondent.\nIf that company and all the other companies concerned had been made parties along with the respondent, they might have answered that it was the duty of respondent alone to bear the burden of compensation for land damages.\nIf the respondent is liable at all, it can be held liable herein without such circumlocution which could lead nowhere.\nIn conclusion I may remark that the damages may be insignificant if heed is given to the powers of the city to close part of the street. The measure of damages should be reached by due consideration being given to the possibilities of what might have happened had the city exercised all its powers and the consequent damages in way of compensation in such case.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The controversy in this appeal turns upon the construction of certain sections of the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act,\u201d sections 178 and 179, chapter 99, R.S. of N.S., and of a certain order-in-council made under the authority of these sections, A brief statement of the material facts will be necessary to shew the exact nature of the points in question.\nThe appellant is the owner of certain lands in the territorial limits in the City of Sydney, the respondent municipality. Railways of the Dominion Coal Company and the Dominion Iron & Steel Company cross a street within the municipality, known as the Victoria Road. The Cape Breton Electric Co. has a tramway in this road which, following its surface, formerly crossed these railway tracks by a level crossing. The crossing being dangerous, the Governor in Council on April 29th, 1911, made an order in the following terms:\u2014\nThe Commissioner of Public Works and Mines in a report dated the 18th day of April, 1911, states that the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, and the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Limited, have constructed and in operation certain railways in the County of Cape Breton to which chapter 99, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, is applicable.\nThat such railways so in operation pass over and across a highway within the limits of the City of Sydney in the County of Cape Breton, at a point known as the McQuarrie\u2019s Crossing;\nThat it has been represented to the Governor in Council that it is necessary and expedient for the public safety that such highway be protected;\nThat careful inquiry has been made in respect thereto, and in respect to the best means of affording such protection and as to the apportionment of the costs thereof, and all parties interested have been heard in respect thereto;\nThat it is necessary and expedient for the public safety and for removing and diminishing the danger arising from the position of the said railways and crossing that the said highway be carried under the said railways.\nThe Commissioner recommends that the necessary subway be ordered constructed in general accordance with the plans and specification submitted by the Dominion Iron & Steel Company. Limited, and referred to on the report of F. W. W. Doane, civil engineer, dated 14th September, 1910, and annexed to the Commissioner\u2019s report, but, however, with the following modifications and subject to such approval of the Governor in Council as to the further details thereon.\n1. Modification of the sidewalk subway arch under the Dominion Coal Company railway to a span with girders, and reinforced concrete roof.\n2. Leaving the south approach, including sidewalk grade, to the approval of the city engineer of the City of Sydney.\nThe Commissioner further recommends that, except as modified above, the report of the said F. W. W. Doane be adopted, and that the recommendation contained therein be carried into effect.\nThe Commissioner further recommends:\u2014\n1. That permanent pavement be not required to be laid in the said subway.\n2. It shall be the duty of the Dominion Iron & Steel Co., Limited, and the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, to keep the street reasonably open for traffic during the construction of said subway.\n3. That the expenses of a watchman from the first day of January, 1911, be paid by the parties interested, i.e., the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, the Dominion Iron & Steel Company, Limited, the City of Sydney and the Cape Breton Electric Company, Limited, in equal shares until the traffic across the rails be diverted into the subway.\n4. That the Dominion Iron & Steel Company, Limited, shall undertake the construction of the subway at the offer made by the Dominion Iron & Steel Company, Limited, viz.; $35,000, and that the City of Sydney shall contribute $5,000; the Cape Breton Electric Company, Limited, and the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, each to contribute one-third of the remainder, not to exceed the sum of $10,000, balance of cost of construction to be paid by the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Limited.\n5. That all the land damages be paid by the City of Sydney.\n6. That detailed plans and specifications be submitted by the Dominion Iron & Steel Company, Limited, for approval by the Government.\n7. That the stairway be roofed over and all parties interested pay an equal portion of the cost.\nPursuant to the order, the projected subway was constructed on Victoria Road underneath the railway tracks. The appellants premises, are situate on Victoria Road and the subway passes in front of them. The result of the works was that the roadway of Victoria Road was lowered throughout the width of the subway and the sidewalk opposite the appellant\u2019s premises was altered and narrowed. The appellant in his action advances a claim for compensation in respect of the injurious affection of his premises by the construction of these works. In his statement of claim he based his claim to relief upon an allegation that \u201cthe parties interested in the order-in-council had constructed the subway in question in the years 1911 and 1912 and that in doing so they altered and towered the grade of the street, changed the width of the street and the sidewalk opposite Ms property, thereby impeding access to that property from the street and bringing about a diminution in value and furthermore, that under the provisions of the order-in-council the respondent municipality was under an obligation to pay to the appellant compensation for his loss.\u201d In the alternative, the appellant charged that the respondent municipality had wrongfully altered the grade of the street, prejudicially affecting his property in respect of the access thereto from Victoria Road and diminishing the value of it. The answer of the respondent municipality was twofold. In substance it was alleged that the works in question were constructed (under authority of the order-in-council passed pursuant to certain provisions of the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act\u201d) by the Dominion Iron & Steel Company, Limited, and that the municipality was not in any way responsible to the appellant for the acts of that corporation; that the clause of the order-in-council directing the City of Sydney to pay \u201cland damages\u201d did not give the appellant any direct recourse against the municipality and that the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action. The parties agreed that the question of the liability of the respondent municipality to plaintiff should first be determined on the pleadings and on certain admissions which are as follows:\u2014\nIt is admitted in pursuance of the said order-in-council the Dominion Iron and Steel Company proceeded to make such subway in the years 1911 and 1912, before this action was brought.\nIt is admitted that said subway was built as shewn on plan M\/a and had the effect on the street as shewn on the said plan.\nIt is admitted that the sidewalk in front of the plaintiff\u2019s property was altered and narrowed.\nIt is admitted that the access to the plaintiff\u2019s property has been changed by the building of the said subway.\nIt is agreed that the question of legal liability of the city on the admissions made at the trial and appearing on the pleadings be first decided, and in the event of the city being held liable that the damages be assessed at a later date.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ritchie, who held that the provision of the orderin-council respecting \u201cland damages\u201d was ultra vires and that the other grounds of liability put forward by the appellant were met by the fact that the subway was constructed by the Steel Company pursuant to the order-in-council under authority of statute.\nIn the full court the appellant\u2019s appeal was dismissed in part as appears in the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher on the same ground as that taken by Mr. Justice Ritchie as well as on the further ground that the provision in the order-in-council assessing the \u201cland damages\u201d against the city must be read as only a provision apportioning the cost of the works amongst the parties interested and not as giving any right against the city to third parties,\nI have come to the conclusion there is no answer to the last mentioned point taken in the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher. Sections 178 and 179 of the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act\u201d are as follows:\u2014 Sec. 178. Whenever any portion of a railway is constructed or authorized or proposed to be constructed, upon or along or across any street or other public highway at rail level or otherwise, the company, before constructing or using the same, or in the case of railways already constructed, within such time as the Governor in Council directs, shall submit a plan and profile of such portion of railway for the approval of the Governor in Council; and the Governor in Council, if it appears to it expedient or necessary for the public safety, may, from time to time authorize or require the company to which such railway belongs, within such time as the Governor in Council directs, to protect such street or highway by a watchman or by a watchman and gates or other protection \u2014 or to carry such street or highway, either over or under the said railway by means of a bridge or arch, instead of crossing the same at rail level, \u2014 or to divert such street or highway, either temporarily or permanently \u2014 or to execute such other works and take such other measures as under the circumstances of the case appear to the Governor in Council best adapted for removing or diminishing the danger arising from the then position of the railway, and all the provisions of law at any such time applicable to the taking of land by such company, and to its valuation and conveyance to the company, and to the compensation therefor, shall apply to the case of any land required for the proper carrying out of the requirements of the Governor in Council under this section.\nSec. 179. The Governor in Council may make such orders and give such directions respecting such works and the executing thereof, and the apportionment of the cost thereof and of any such measures of protection between the said company and any person interested therein, as appear to the Governor in Council just and reasonable.\nI am unable to agree with the view (assuming the works in question to have affected the appellant\u2019s access to his property from Victoria Road in such a way as to entitle him to claim a compensation from the railway company constructing the works, for injurious affection of his property under sec. 138 et seq.) that such compensation may not properly be the subject of apportionment as part of the cost of the works authorized under sec. 179, and I think the phrase \u201cland damages\u201d is wide enough to embrace, and was intended to embrace, compensation of the nature of that claimed by the appellant in this action, On the other hand (assuming the works were lawfully constructed under secs. 178 and 179) the plaintiff on well settled principles would have to look to some statutory provision or some contract for his right of compensation for injuries suffered by him in consequence of an undertaking carried into effect under the sanction of statute. I agree with the full court in thinking that section 179 does not invest the Governor in Council with authority to do more than apportion among the parties interested the cost of the undertaking and that such authority does not extend to the giving a right of action to persons entitled to compensation against anybody who is not exercising the powers conferred by the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nIn this particular instance it was the Dominion Iron & Steel Company which was exercising its powers as a railway company under authority of section 178 and by the last paragraph of that section that company in exercising those powers was subject to all the provisions of the law relating to taking of land by a railway company. On it rested the obligation created by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to compensate persons whose lands should be injured by the construction of the works. I think section 179 does not authorize the Governor in Council to extend this obligation to others and I think the order-in-council does not profess to do so. Assuming then the works to have been lawfully constructed, the position would be this: The appellant\u2019s right to recover compensation, if any, is against the steel company, and it is to have compensation determined in the manner provided for by the Act. But there is no right under the Act against the municipality.\nThe truth appears to be, however, that if the claim now put forward by the appellant is a well-grounded claim the work never was lawfully constructed. The provisions of the \u201cRailway Act of 1879\u201d which were in question in Corporation of Parkdale v. West[13], were almost identical with the provisions of the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act\u201d relating to the construction of works which trespass upon or injuriously affect the lands of private persons, and it was there held by the Privy Council that before constructing a work having such effect, it was the duty of the railway company to take the necessary proceedings to ascertain and to pay the compensation provided for in the Act. That was not done in this case, and while it may be that the plaintiff would in consequence have a right of action for damages against the railway company, there is nothing in this record whatever to justify a finding that the city was in any way implicated in the wrongful acts of the railway company, in other words, there is nothing to shew that the municipality was a party to proceeding with the work without taking the necessary steps under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d One may suspect that the municipality, being the party chiefly interested, was in reality responsible for the taking of this course, but there is no admission to that effect, and there are no facts which would justify such an inference. I am not satisfied that the appellant could not after the completion of the structure, have taken proceedings to compel the railway to concur in the necessary steps for determining and to pay compensation when determined. That, however, was not done and I am unable to see on what ground his claim against the municipality can be sustained. It was not suggested on behalf of the appellant that the railway company should be added as party-defendant and one must suppose that there is some good reason why proceedings were not taken against the railway company.\nWith a good deal of regret I find myself forced to the conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed on the short ground that the municipality is not shewn to have done any wrongful act; and as regards compensation, it is responsible only under the order-in-council and the provisions of the order-in-council are limited to giving to the railway company a right to claim contribution in respect to the cost of the work. There is no vinculum juris between the appellant and the municipality and no tort for which the municipality is responsible.\nAnglin J.\u2014This appeal presents three questions for determination:\u2014\n1. Are land damages part of the costs of the \u201cworks and the execution thereof within section 179 of the \u201cNova Scotia Railway Act,\u201d Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, ch. 99?\n2. Are the sections of that Act which provide for payment of such damages in respect of lands not taken, but injuriously affected, made applicable to works ordered under section 178?\n3. Is the City of Sydney directly liable to the plaintiff for whatever damages he has sustained?\nHaving regard to the obvious connection between section 178 and section 179 and to the provisions of the former, I have no doubt that land damages are included in the costs of works dealt with in the latter.\nThe decision of the Judicial Committee in Corporation of Parkdale v. West[14], at pp. 611-12, with a reference to section 138 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d gives a conclusive answer in the affirmative to the second question.\nThe third question presents a little more difficulty. The order of the Governor in Council was authorized by sections 178 and 179, as well as by section 8(i) of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d By that order, granted on the application of the defendant municipality, and without which, because of interference with the railways, the works could not have been undertaken, while the railway companies were directed to construct them, the City of Sydney was required to pay \u201call the land damages\u201d occasioned by them. These terms were accepted by the city and upon them the work was undertaken.\nIf the work was begun and prosecuted without application, or notice to treat to the plaintiff (secs. 138-141) (and that would appear to have been the fact in view of the contention of the defendant, made throughout this litigation, that there is no liability for damages sustained by the owner of land not taken, but only injuriously affected) their construction and the alteration in the level of the highway were as to him a trespass; and for that those who committed it, the railway companies, and not the present defendant, are liable, just as they would be, if they had entered upon and taken the plaintiff\u2019s land. Corporation of Parkdale v. West[15]; Inverness Railway and Coal Co. v. McIsaac[16]; Hanley v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.[17]. If, on the other hand, proceedings were duly taken, under sec. 138 et seq. of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d it is probable that only damages ascertained in accordance with those provisions are recoverable. But, however that may be, it would seem that the land damages, like other items of the cost, are payable in the first instance by the companies exercising the powers conferred by sec. 138 et seq., with a right as to the land damages of indemnification against, or recoupment by, the City of Sydney under the terms of the order-in-council. That order made under sections 8(i), 178, and 179 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d contemplated that the powers conferred by that Act should be made use of as the machinery by which the right to acquire, or to cause injury to, land should be exercised. Unless that procedure is followed it may be that there is no obligation upon the defendant municipality under the order-in-council. But in any case, I think the primary and the only direct responsibility to the plaintiff is that of the railway companies, either as trespassers, or as liable to pay compensation under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d Whatever may be the liability of the City of Sydney, if any, it is in my opinion not to the plaintiff, but to the railway companies by way of indemnity or contribution.\nOn this ground alone I would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The proceedings do not disclose any lien de droit between the appellant and the respondent.\nThe appellant claims that his property has been injuriously affected by the construction of a subway. It might be true; but who is the wrongdoer? That is the railway company and not the respondent municipality; and the action then should have been brought against the company.\nBut the appellant says that he is entitled to proceed against the City of Sydney because, under the order-in-council which ordered the construction of the subway, that city was condemned to pay \u201cland damages.\u201d\nI have no doubt that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council could authorize or require the railway company to construct the subway. But the taking of any land required for the carrying out of the requirements of the order-in-council or any compensation for lands injuriously affected, should be determined under the ordinary provisions of the law. (Ch. 99, R.S.N.S., sec. 178.)\nArbitration proceedings should have taken place. Damages would have been assessed and then the City of Sydney could perhaps be held liable for those damages and compensation.\nBut until this is done, can the city be condemned to pay anything to a riparian owner of the subway? I don\u2019t see how in the circumstances of this case an action by a property owner should lie against the municipality.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.

In consequence of a letter from the contractor notifying the company of the stoppage of the works, on account of alleged unjustifiable interference therewith, the company took possession of the materials and plant of the contractor, without obtaining the certificate specified, did some work therewith, and then entered into correspondence with the contractor's bondsmen to induce them to proceed with the contract. Upon seizure of the goods under execution by a judgment creditor of the contractor,\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that as the insolvency of the contractor had not been proved nor a certificate of their manager procured, as provided by the contract, the goods in question did not become the property of the company and the contractor's letter could not be considered as a waiver of the conditions precedent stipulated in the contract; consequently, the possession so taken of the plant and materials did not entitle the company to the right of possession thereof as against the execution creditor. Per Duff J., dissenting.\u2014In the contract in question the term \"insolvency\" should be construed as meaning the condition of a person unable to pay his just debts in the ordinary course of business; the contractor was visibly insolvent in this sense; the contract had also been abandoned, the company had taken possession under the provision in the contract, and, there being no evidence to establish a contract of suretyship by the bonding company which was requested to proceed with the works, the possession of the company was effective as against the execution creditor. The Queen v. The Saddlers' Co. (10 H.L. Cas. 404), and Parker v. Gossage (2 C.M. & R. 617), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Gregory J., at the trial, by which an interpleader issue to determine the ownership of goods seized by the sheriff under an execution issued by the respondent, as judgment creditor of the Anderson Construction Company, was decided against the present appellants.\nThe circumstances in which the interpleader issue was directed are set out in the head-note and the questions raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellants.\nEwart K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal turns, I think, upon the true construction of the application to the facts of the following part of paragraph 5 in the contract between appellant and the Anderson Construction Company:\u2014\n5. Upon the insolvency of the contractor, or upon an execution being levied on his goods, or upon a judgment in a court of British Columbia being obtained against him, which shall not be satisfied or secured within fourteen days, or upon his making arrangements for assignment in favour of his creditors, or upon the manager certifying under his hand to the company that in his opinion the contractor (a) Has abandoned the contract, or * * *\nThen the company, without in any wise prejudicing any other of the rights or remedies of the company under the contract, may enter upon the said works and expel the contractor therefrom, and may itself use the materials and plant upon the premises for the completion of the works, and employ any other contractor to complete, or may itself complete the works, and upon such entry the contract shall be determined save as to the rights and powers conferred upon the company and manager thereby.\nThe contractor, by a letter of remonstrance with regard to the alleged unjustifiable interferences of the appellant, wrote appellant notifying it of the stoppage of the work. Thereupon the appellant's president had directed some of his men to take possession of the goods in question, but instead of adopting the methods specified in the contract for expelling the contractor therefrom, and thereby determining the contract, entered into correspondence with the contractor's surety to induce it to proceed with the contract.\nMeantime the sheriff seized the goods, which were thus, in my view of the facts and reading of the contract, merely held tentatively in possession.\nTo speak of such a possession as that which might have ensued upon a determination of the contract within and according to the terms thereof and a possible bar to a sheriff's seizure, seems a misinterpretation of what actually happened.\nIt is beside the question to set up the doubtful state of solvency or insolvency. For even if insolvent the contractor was not ipso facto by the terms of this contract, to be considered as expelled from the contract and the right of property or possession in its tools and material changed. It is the election beyond doubt to actually expel it from and terminate the contract that is the right given.\nThe method of doing this, if intended before the seizure, certainly fell far short of what the contract had in contemplation.\nAnd as a result the sheriff's seizure cannot be displaced or the claim that it was irregular, and such as only a trespasser might have effected, be upheld.\nThe appeal must, therefore, I think, be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The provision of the agreement upon which the dispute arises is as follows:\u2014\n5. Upon the insolvency of the contractor, or upon an execution being levied on his goods, or upon a judgment in a court of British Columbia being obtained against him, which shall not be satisfied or secured within fourteen days, or upon his making arrangements for assignment in favour of his creditors, or upon the manager certifying under his hand to the company that in his opinion the contractor\n(a) Has abandoned the contract, or\n(b) Has suspended the progress of the work for ten days after receiving from the manager a written notice to proceed, without any lawful excuse under these conditions, or\n(c) Has failed to give the manager all facilities for inspecting any material before the same is in any way used on the work, or\n(d) Has failed to complete all or any of the works by the time herein specified for their completion.\nThen the company, without in any wise prejudicing any other of the rights or remedies of the company under the contract, may enter upon the said works and expel the contractor therefrom, and may itself use the materials and plant upon the premises for the completion of the works, and employ any other contractor to complete, or may itself complete, the works, and upon such entry the contract shall be determined save as to the rights and powers conferred upon the company and manager thereby.\nInsolvency is here used in the sense in which the term has usually been interpreted in clauses of for- feiture. To quote the judgment of Mr. Justice Willes in The Queen v. The Saddlers' Co.[2], at p. 425:\u2014\nThe term \"insolvent\" has been repeatedly construed in a like eontext, both in private instruments and upon the construction of a statute, to apply to a person labouring under a general disability to pay his just debts in the ordinary course of trade and business.\nTo the same effect is the dictum of Parke B., in Parker v. Gossage[3]:\u2014\nAn insolvent in ordinary acceptation is a person who cannot pay his debts.\nThe Anderson Construction Company was visibly insolvent in this sense. They abandoned their contract explaining that they were unable to carry it on for want of means. Their workmen presented time cheques to the manager of the appellants which the construction company had refused to pay, to the amount of $8,000. Mechanics' liens were filed and proceedings were taken under them against the property of the company. The company was called upon to implement a guarantee of a debt of $5,000 which it had given to Balfour, Guthrie & Co. at the request of the construction company. Very shortly after the appellants took possession the sheriff seized the tools and plant of the construction company under an execution issued at the suit of the butcher who had supplied the boarding house with meat. The plant and tools were sold and this litigation arose out of a contest between the appellants and various creditors of the construction company over the disposition of the proceeds. Not only is there evidence of insolvency; insolvency was demonstrated within the meaning of this clause. Indeed, it was only in this court for the first time that anybody was bold enough to make the suggestion that insolvency had not been proved.\nIt is equally clear that the appellants entered and took possession under the authority of this clause. That they took possession in point of fact is not disputed. It was expressly admitted at the trial. It is, moreover, conclusively proved. The appellants, for example, made use of material belonging to the con tractors in a manner which would have been wrongful unless the appellants were rightfully acting under this clause.\nA suggestion, made for the first time in this court, that some dealings between the appellants and a company referred to in the evidence as the \"bonding company\" are relied on as shewing conduct on the part of the appellants incompatible with an intention to proceed under paragraph 5 of the contract. The difficulty with this contention is that it has no basis in point of fact. It is founded on the assumption that the contract with the \"bonding company\" was a contract of suretyship, and that the demand made by the appellants was a demand that the sureties should execute the construction company's contract. There is not a scrap of evidence to shew that there was any contract of suretyship. The contract may have been and probably was a contract of indemnity by which the \"bonding company\" made themselves answerable for any loss occasioned by the failure of the construction company to per form their contract, a very different thing indeed from a contract of suretyship. There is nothing whatever in Mr. Rogers' evidence justifying the assumption that anything he did was in the least consistent with the assertion and exercise of the appel- lants' rights under clause 5. If such a point was to be raised it ought, of course, to have been suggested at the trial when the document could have been produced and all the facts bearing upon the point could have been considered. It would be quite contrary to the settled rule upon which this court has acted, over and over again, to permit such a point to be raised in such circumstances in this court for the first time.\nI have dealt with the points upon which Mr. Ewart sought to support the judgment\u2014points not hinted at apparently, any one of them, in the courts below. Virtually, I think he admits that the construction of clause 5 upon which the British Columbia courts proceeded is a construction which cannot be sustained.\nWith very great respect, I can see no answer to the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Irving upon that point. I ought, perhaps, to mention before taking leave of the case, the form of the issue which was the subject of much discussion at the argument. There can be no doubt that the question the parties intended to raise and that the learned judge who made the order, intended to be tried, was the question whether, in the circumstances then existing, the property in question was exigible under the writ of execution against the construction company. It was not at all disputed at the trial that the agreement between the parties in reference to the sale precluded the respondents from relying upon the sale as in any way prejudicing the rights of the appellants.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014While unable to accept the construction of the agreement, under which the appellants as- sert a right to possession of the property in question as against the sheriff, which would give them the right to take possession only if they intended to proceed themselves to complete the works and not to do so through other contractors, I am of the opinion that this appeal fails on other grounds.\nThe agreement prescribes certain alternative conditions precedent to the appellants' right to take possession of and use the plant and materials of their contractors, the execution debtors. Two of those conditions which they claim to have been fulfilled are insolvency of their contractors, and abandonment of the contract.\nInsolvency, though by no means improbable, has not been proved.\nThe contract requires that its abandonment shall be certified under the hand of the manager of the company before the right to take possession of and use the contractors' materials arises. I cannot accept the suggestion that this stipulation was so wholly in the interest of the contractors that it could be and was waived by their letter stating that for certain reasons they would be unable to proceed with the work. Having chosen to make the procuring of this certificate a condition precedent to their right to take possession on abandonment, I am of the opinion that without it the appellants cannot establish a right to possession as against the sheriff.\nMoreover, I am not satisfied that there was in fact an abandonment by the contractors within the meaning of the provision of the contract which is invoked. I would, on these grounds, dismiss the appeal with costs.

City of Montreal v. The Montreal Street Railway Co. ((1912) A.C. 333), referred to. Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada has the same power to make orders respecting the use and occupation of the lands of a provincial railway company as it has in regard to the lands of any other corporate body created by a provincial legislature.\nAPPEAL from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, dated the 20th of July, 1912, whereby the Lachine, Jacques-Cartier and Maisonneuve Railway Company was authorized to use and occupy a portion of the lands of the Montreal Tramways Company which had been transferred to that company by the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company in pursuance of the Dominion statute 1 & 2 Geo. V., ch. 115.\nThe Montreal Tramways Company was incorporated by the statute of the Province of Quebec, chaptered 77 of the statutes of that province enacted in the year 1911 (1 Geo. V.). The Montreal Park and Island Railway Company was also incorporated by a statute of the Province of Quebec, in 1885, and, by the Dominion statute 57 & 58 Vict., ch. 84, was afterwards declared to be an undertaking for the general advantage of Canada. By section 11 of its Act of incorporation, the Montreal Tramways Company was, amongst other things, authorized to acquire the privileges, lands, franchises, etc., of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company and, by the Dominion statute, 1 & 2 Geo. V., ch. 115, the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company was authorized to transfer its privileges, lands, franchises, etc., to the Montreal Tramways Company. In accordance with the authority thus obtained the Montreal Tramways Company acquired the privileges, lands, franchises, etc., of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company by deed executed on the 18th of November, 1911, including the lands affected by the order now appealed from, and forthwith entered into possession and occupation thereof. The deed of sale was ratified by a statute afterwards enacted by the Legislature of Quebec, 2 Geo. V., ch. 84. The respondent company was incorporated by the Quebec statute, 9 Edw. VII., ch. 99, and was afterwards, by the Dominion statute, 1 & 2 Geo. V., ch. 104, declared to be an undertaking for the general advantage of Canada. On the application of the respondent company, the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, on the 12th June, 1911, made an order fixing the location of the portion of the respondents\u2019 railway now in question with the restriction, as to the Montreal Street Railway Co., that the location across the lands in question should be arranged between the parties so that the least injury and inconvenience might thereby be caused to the Montreal Street Railway Company. On the 29th of March, 1912, the respondents served a notice of expropriation of the strip of land now in question, which was needed for their right-of-way, addressed to the \u201cEstate of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company (now the Montreal Tramways Company), owner of the above-mentioned lands\u201d; on 9th April, 1912, they served a petition for the appointment of arbitrators to determine the compensation to be paid for the lands sought to be expropriated addressed in the same manner, and, on the 19th of May, 1912, desisted from the said expropriation proceedings. The respondents, on the 9th of July, 1912, applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for an order authorizing them to take and make use of the strip of land in question for the purposes of their railway and, upon that application, the order now appealed from was made.\nThe question upon the appeal was whether the Board had jurisdiction to make the order appealed from.\nRinfret K.C. for the appellants.\nLafleur K.C. and Jodoin K.C. for the respondents. The Chief Justice agreed with Duff J.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal invoked under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to test the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada to make the following order, dated 12th July, 1912:\u2014\nUpon reading what is alleged in support of the application and on behalf of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, and the report of the chief engineer of the Board: \u2014\nIt is ordered that the applicant company be and it is hereby authorized to take for the purpose of the crossing that portion of the said lot No. 340, of the lands of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company consisting of a strip of land 597 feet in length by 100 feet in width, containing 1.62 arpents, as shewn on the said plan.\nD\u2019Arcy Scott,\nAssistant Chief Commissioner\nBoard of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nThe matter has been needlessly confused by incorporating in the case and proceedings matters entirely irrelevant to the neat point which is involved.\nThe respondent was originally incorporated by the Legislature of Quebec, but, by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, 1 & 2 Geo. V., ch. 104, the work was declared to be one for the general advantage of (Canada and thus all appertaining thereto came within the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and the consequent jurisdiction of the said Railway Commissioners,\nThat Board was duly applied to for an order approving of the proposed route for respondent\u2019s railway when a great many parties, including the Montreal Street Railway Company, under which the Montreal Tramways Company, now appellant, claims, were heard in regard to their respective objections to the route.\nAn order, dated 12th of June, 1911, was made subject to various conditions approving of at least a part of the proposed route, including that part of it crossing the land in question, but in respect thereof was left in somewhat indefinite form, which is expressed as follows in sub-section (d) of section 1 of said order:\u2014\n(d) The location across the lands of the Montreal Street Railway Company to be arranged between the parties so that the least injury and inconvenience may be suffered by the street railway company.\nThe respondent seems to have instituted expropriation proceedings which, on such an indefinite order, may have been considered premature and, on objection, desisted therefrom. All relative thereto does not concern us here.\nThe respondent seems to have conceived the idea that, inasmuch as the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company had become a Dominion railway, the proper course was to have resort to the power of the Board under section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d and applied accordingly, but it was disclosed upon the hearing of the application that, though that railway company was still under the Dominion authorities, Parliament had empowered it to sell its property and, in course of exercising that power, the land in question had passed to the Montreal Tramways Company which was and is a concern incorporated by the Legislature of Quebec.\nThereupon the Board made the order above quoted. It did not pretend to act upon section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d but simply confined itself to making an order which completed the work left in the indefinite form I have already adverted to, and declared what it always had intended, subject to amicable adjustment, should be done in the way of declaring its approval of the route. This it had, in my opinion, undoubtedly, jurisdiction to declare and approve.\nThe mistake in description of the owner does not affect the taking of the land or the right to direct the route as defined to be taken by respondent.\nThe pretension that because the land happened to belong to a local tramway, therefore, there was no jurisdiction in the Board to so direct is without foundation.\nThe local railway company\u2019s property is, in that regard, just as much within the power of Parliament and subject to the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d as is that of any other corporate body created by the local legislature.\nThe further pretension that the power of expropriation in such case belongs to a local board instead of the Dominion authorities is equally without foundation unless we are to invert the order of superiority as between the Dominion and the provinces, as defined by the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and reverse many authorities deciding that what is necessary to the execution of the purpose of the constructing of Dominion works, including railways, has to be observed. The cases of The City of Toronto v. The Bell Telephone Co.[1], and the Attorney-General of British Columbia v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2], have surely settled that much and given a wide enough scope to what is conceivable as necessarily incidental to the execution of the powers of Parliament. A later generation may laugh (when struggling with its results) at the conception of telephone posts and wires upon the streets of a municipal corporation being held to be such an incidental necessity, but, meantime, we must accept it with becoming respect as a proper interpretation of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nSurely the crossing of a bit of land held by a corporation of another sort, not for present use, but in hopes, or alleged hopes, of its use possibly in a future age, falls far within these applications of the principle laid down and acted upon in these and other cases, unless we are to hold that a local tramway is a more sacred thing than its fellow creature, a municipal corporation.\nWith great respect, I think the argument based on section 176 has misconceived the situation in law and in fact. But that does not affect the jurisdiction of the Board which has been impeached to make the order it did. Even if used as against the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, that is something the company moving has nothing to do with. Though assuming (with great respect I much doubt) the latter company properly made a party, to elicit an opinion from us in a case to which it was no party, yet the order might, as against the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, if an order suitable to such an exigency had been made under section 176, be rested thereupon and be held good.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada and the question which arises is whether the Board had power to make a certain order, dated 20th July, 1912, which is in the following terms. THE BOARD OR RAILWAY COMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nOrder No. 17,082.\nSaturday, the 20th of July, A.D. 1912.\nD\u2019Arcy Scott,\nAsst. Chief\nCommissioner.\nS. J. McLean,\nCommissioner.\nIn the matter of the order of the Board, No. 13,993, dated June 12th, 1911, approving the location of the Lachine Jacques-Cartier and Maisonneuve Railway Company\u2019s line of railway from the westerly terminus of the railway to a point about 400 feet west of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s crossing at Iberville street subway, in the City of Montreal; and the application of the Lachine, Jacques-Cartier and Maisonneuve Railway Company for authority to take, for the construction of its railway, a portion of lot No. 340, in the Parish of St. Laurent, in the said City of Montreal, of the lands of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, consisting of a strip of 597 feet in length and 100 feet in width, containing 1.62 arpents, as shewn on the plan dated June 12th, 1911, and approved under the said order No. 13, 993.\nUpon reading what is alleged in support of the application and on behalf of the Montreal Park and Island Railway. Company, and the report of the chief engineer of the Board:\u2014\nIt is ordered that the applicant company be and it is hereby authorized to take for the purpose of the crossing that portion of the said lot No. 340, of the lands of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company consisting of a strip of land 597 feet in length by 100 feet in width, containing 1.62 arpents, as shewn on the said plan.\n(Sgd.) D\u2019Arcy Scott,\nAssistant Chief Commissioner\nBoard of Railway Commissioners for Canada.\nThere can be no serious doubt, I think, that the Board, in making the order, was professing to execute powers conferred upon it by section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d It appears clearly enough from the application dated 10th May, 1912, and a further application of the 26th July, that it was understood by the respondents that the Board was exercising powers under that section. Indeed, it is so stated in the factum of the respondents and, while the section is not mentioned in the order, the order purports to be made under, the application of the 10th of May, and it is not really disputed that the order was an order under the section mentioned. The Board would, of course, have no power under the general expropriation provisions of the Act to make such an order, as sufficiently appears from a consideration of sections 215 and 216.\nI do not think the parties have really come to any issue upon the question whether the lands in question ever did constitute an integral part of the railway undertaking of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, or are now such a part of the Montreal Tramways Company, and I think there is no evidence before us which would enable us to pass upon the point, assuming it would be competent for us to do so on this appeal. It may be doubted, I think, whether section 176 has any application to the lands of a railway company which are not physically a part of the railway undertaking: for example, subsidy lands held for sale. It is quite arguable that proceedings under the general expropriation provisions of the Act would be the appropriate method of getting authority to take such lands even where the owner is a Dominion railway company. The point, in my view, is of no importance on this appeal, because, as I have already indicated, those proceedings are taken by the railway company under section 176; and the lands which the respondent company was authorized to take by the order appealed from are now and at the time the application and order were made were the property of a provincial railway company owning and operating a railway which is a local undertaking and subject to the exclusive authority of the provincial legislature.\nFirst.\u2014These lands are the property of the Montreal Tramways Company whose undertaking is a local undertaking under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Quebec Legislature. It is not disputed that the lands in question, prior to November, 1911, formed part of the property of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company whose undertaking, having been declared for the general advantage of Canada, was a Dominion undertaking. In November, 1911, however, that company was authorized by an Act of the Dominion Parliament to transfer the whole or any part of its undertaking and property to certain companies engaged in operating provincial undertakings, including the Montreal Tramways Company, and, in the result, the property in question, with other properties, became vested in the Montreal Tramways Company, a railway company engaged in working a provincial railway, and were vested in that company when the application was made upon which the order was based. These facts are admitted again and again in course of the proceedings taken by the respondents and are not disputed in the respondents\u2019 factum.\nSecondly.\u2014Section number 176 has no application to lands which are the property of a provincial railway company. The full text of the section is as follows:\u2014\n176. The company may take possession of, use or occupy any lands belonging to any other railway company; use or enjoy the whole or any portion of the right-of-way, tracks, terminals, station or station grounds of any other railway company, and have and exercise full power to run and operate its trains over and upon any portion or portions of the railway of any other railway company, subject always to the approval of the Board first obtained and to any order and direction which the Board may make in regard to the exercise, enjoyment or restriction of such powers or privileges.\n2. Such aproval may be given upon application and notice, and, after hearing, the Board may make such order, give such directions, and impose such conditions or duties upon either party as to it may appear just or desirable, having due regard to the public and all proper interests.\n3. If the parties fail to agree as to compensation, the Board may, by order, fix the amount of compensation to be paid in respect of the powers and privileges so granted. 3 Edw. VII., ch. 58, sec. 137; 6 Edw. VII., ch. 42, sec. 8.\nIf this section applies to provincial railway companies, then it is within the power of the Board of Railway Commissioners for the Dominion to authorize a Dominion railway company to make use, to any extent that the Board shall think proper, of the works of a provincial railway company without the consent of the provincial railway company or the public authorities of the province, and without a declaration by Parliament that the provincial railway should be a work for the general advantage of Canada. The Board would also have power under the express provisions of the section to impose conditions upon the provincial railway company, as well as duties, as it might appear just or desirable to them and to fix the compensation to be paid in respect to the powers and privileges granted. In a word, the section, if such be its application, authorizes the establishment over provincial railways of that dual control which has been held to be contrary to the policy of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[3], at pages 345, 346. Sub-section 4(c), of section 2 and section 8 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d seem to shew that where it was intended that a specific provision of the Act should apply to provincial railway companies that has been expressly stated.\nI think the proper conclusion is that section 176 has no such application.\nIt is argued, however, that at the time the line of the respondents was located these lands were still a part of the property of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, a Dominion company. I do not think that in the circumstances of this case that is an answer to the appeal. When the application was made for leave to take possession of the lands, admittedly they had passed to the Montreal Tramways Company.\nThe Dominion legislation authorizing the transfer to the provincial company of the property of the Dominion railway company involved by necessary implication a declaration that such property, when transferred, should be no longer be part of a work for the general advantage of Canada; I entertain no doubt that such a declaration by the Dominion Parliament made with the concurrence of the Quebec Legislature would be entirely effective to remove the property transferred from the Dominion jurisdiction under sections 91(29) and 92(10) of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nThe result is that, with respect to the property transferred, section 176 ceased to have any operation.\nAnglin J.\u2014Upon its face, the order appealed from (No. 17,082) was within the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada. It purports to authorize the \u201ctaking\u201d by the Lachine, Jacques-Cartier and Maisonneuve Railway Company, \u201cfor the purposes of the crossing,\u201d of a part of the lands of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company \u2014 a railway subject to the authority of the Parliament of Canada. Such an order is within the power conferred by section 176 of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nBut, on the argument, it was made clear beyond all doubt that, while the land in question had been vested in the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, when the application was made to the Board for approval of the location of the Lachine, Jacques-Cartier and Maisonneuve Railway, and when the order approving such location was pronounced, as a result of conveyances authorized by Dominion and provincial legislation, it had become vested in the Montreal Tramways Company, a provincial railway company, and belonged to it at the time the order now in appeal was pronounced. Moreover, it wag admitted at bar that the land to be taken is adjacent to car-sheds formerly belonging to the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, but now the property of the Montreal. Tramways Company, that no tracks of either company are laid upon it, and that, in fact, no crossing is to be provided for.\nThese facts were known to the Board of Railway Commissioners, and it is a little difficult to understand how they came to make an order dealing with the land as if it were still the property of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, and stating that it is required for the purpose of a crossing. Under the circumstances I should have preferred remitting the matter to the Board in order that we might be advised, before passing upon it, whether the form which the order has taken was due to some clerical error in draftsmanship, or whether the Board was of the opinion, for some reasons not apparent to us, that, not- withstanding the legislation above referred to and the conveyances consequent upon it, the land in question should still be deemed, for the purposes of section 176, to belong to the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company. But my colleagues think it unnecessary to adopt this course, since it is undisputed that the land in question was, in fact, vested in the Montreal Tramways Company when order No. 17,082 was made.\nDealing with the order, therefore, as if made for the taking of land belonging to the Montreal Tramways Company, a provincial railway company, I am of the opinion that the Board had not jurisdiction to make it. Section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is the only authority under which counsel sought to sustain the order, and I know of no other provision of the statute that could be invoked to support it. Section 176, in my opinion, is confined to its operation to lands of railway companies subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and has no application to lands of provincial railway companies.\nBrodeur J.\u2014On the 10th of May, 1912, the railway company respondent, applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for an order under section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to take certain lands and to have the compensation fixed by the Board.\nOriginally these lands belonged to one of the appellants, the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, a federal railway company. But these lands had been, in the month of November previous (1911) transferred to the other appellant, the Montreal Tramways Company, a provincial company. The Board granted the order on the 20th of July, 1912.\nIt is claimed by the appellants that the Board was without jurisdiction in proceeding under section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nSection 176 provides that the Board may authorize a railway to\ntake possession of, use or occupy any lands belonging to any other railway company,\nand the Board may fix the amount of compensation if the parties fail to agree.\nThe words \u201cany other railway company,\u201d in that section, do not refer to a provincial company. The company mentioned in the section is defined in the Act as meaning a company within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Board would be then without jurisdiction to fix the compensation for lands belonging to a provincial company.\nThe lands in question might, likely, be expropriated by the respondent company, but the compensation should be determined not by the Board, but by arbitrators appointed under the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nIt was contended by the respondents that the proceedings of the Board were valid because when the plans were originally approved the federal company, appellants, were then owners. But the deposit of those plans in the registry office was made on the 19th of January, 1912, and the formal notice of expropriation was given on the 3rd of April, 1912. At both these dates the federal company had ceased to be the owners of these lands and they had passed into the possession of the provincial company. The Board was then, in July, 1912, without jurisdiction to authorize the taking of the lands of the provincial company and to fix the compensation therefor under section 176 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Geuest, Billette & Plimsoll.\nSolicitors for respondents: Henri Jodoin.\n[1] [1905] A.C. 52.\n[2] [1906] A.C. 204.\n[3] [1912] A.C. 333.\n"

On 29th June, 1911, while appellant was still in occupation of the premises under the lease, an agreement was made to extend the lease for another period of three years from 1st May, 1912, to 1st May, 1915, with the same conditions. In June, 1911, Harris Vineberg sold the premises to Moses Vineberg, subject to leases which the purchaser assumed and nothing was done to cancel the lease until the 2nd of May, 1912, when Moses Vineberg served a notice on appellant to terminate the lease on 3rd August, 1912. The appellant remained in possession after 3rd August, 1912, and Vineberg took no steps to have him ejected and continued to collect the rents until the 20th January, 1913, when he sold the property to the respondent subrogating them in all his rights and obligations under the lease then current and undertook to cancel the lease on the 1st of May, 1913, and have the appellant vacate the premises on that date. On the same day, after the sale was made, Moses Vineberg notified the appellant of the sale to the respondents and requested him to pay the rent to them. On 29th January, 1913, Harris Vineberg and Moses Vineberg notified the appellants of cancellation of the lease to take place on the 1st of May following. The respondents, who were then proprietors, gave no notice, but continued to collect the rents up to the month of April. On May 5th, respondents took the present action to declare the lease cancelled and eject the appellant.\nIn the Superior Court the action was maintained and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review at Montreal.\nLafleur K.C., and A. Perreault, for appellant.\nJacobs K.C., and Couture, for respondents.\nChief Justice.\u2014I would dispose of this case on this very short ground:\nAt the time this action was brought, the defendants, now appellants, were in possession of the premises under a lease from Harris Vineberg, of 29th June, 1909, which was made subject to the following, among other conditions:\nThe lessee will have the right to continue the present lease from year to year after the expiration of the said term, and until the property will be sold, upon the same condition and for the same rental as hereinbefore mentioned: and during such continuance of this lease, will have the right to bring the lease to a termination at the end of any year, by giving the lessor three months\u2019 notice in writing of its intention, as well as to continue this lease, as afterwards of terminating it. Failing such notice at the end of the said term, the lease will continue. And the lessor will have the right, in the event of the property being sold, to bring the lease to an end, at any time, whether during the said term of three years, or afterwards, by giving the lessee three months\u2019 notice in writing to that effect. The lease, which was for a term of three years from May 1st, 1912, with a right of renewal, was not registered when the property was sold on the 1st of June, 1912, to Moses Vineberg, from whom the respondents Friedman et al. purchased. Moses Vineberg gave the required notice to cancel the lease en temps utile.\nIt appears to me obvious that, in these circumstances the case comes under article 2128 (C.C.) which reads as follows:\nThe lease of an immovable for a period exceeding one year cannot be invoked against a subsequent purchaser unless it has been registered.\nIt is evident that, the lease not having been registered, the defendants (now appellants) cannot invoke its terms as against the plaintiffs (now respondents), subsequent purchasers of the property, and this is sufficient to dispose of the case.\nIt is quite true that, taken literally, it is difficult to conciliate the provisions of articles 1663 and 2128 C.C., but having considered the Report of the Codifiers (see 12 Biblioth\u00e8que du Code Civil, page 753, and 18 Biblioth\u00e8que du Code Civil, page 135) one may safely say that, after some discussion, the system adopted by the Legislature in the Code, as finally enacted, provided that leases were to be considered as charges on the immovables with respect to which they were passed and subject, as a consequence, to the ordinary rules as to registration of real rights.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014Harris Vineberg by a writing dated 28th June, 1909, \u201clet and leased\u201d to appellant the property in question herein for the term of three years to be reckoned from the 1st of May, 1912. The appellant happened to be in possession of the premises on the date of this lease, but as nothing, so far as I can see, turns upon the terms of that holding I will avoid the confusion apt to be created by referring thereto.\nThe inducement to the making of a lease nearly three years ahead of the time from which it was to run would seem to have been that the lessee agreed by this lease\nto put up a new front to the stone building on the property according to the plans prepared, to cost at least twenty-eight hundred dollars, and to have the said, improvement done forthwith,\nfailing which the lessor had the right to demand cancellation of this lease.\nNothing unusual appears in this lease save the foregoing and the following clause:\u2014\nThe lessee will have the right to continue the present lease from year to year after the expiration of the said term, and until the property will be sold, upon the same conditions and for the same rental as hereinbefore mentioned; and during the continuation of this lease, will have the right to bring the lease to a termination at the end of any year by giving the lessor three months\u2019 notice in writing of its intention, as well to continue this lease, as afterwards of terminating it. Failing such notice at the end of the said term, the lease will continue. And the lessor will have the right, in the event of the property being sold, to bring the lease to an end, at any time, whether during the said term of three years, or afterwards, by giving the leassee three months\u2019 notice in writing to that effect.\nIt is upon the last sentence of this clause that the various questions arising herein must turn.\nHarris Vineberg sold the property to Moses Vineberg on the 5th of June, 1911\u2014over a year before the last sentence of this clause could become operative. Having regard to the expected expenditure of $2,800 on the erection of a front in 1909, it could hardly be supposed that anyone could conceive of this clause on behalf of the lessor becoming operative before the term began to run. Besides that, the express language used as to bringing the lease to an end is\nat any time whether during the said term of three years or afterwards.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that it never was competent for the lessor to bring the lease to an end by three months\u2019 notice until after the term had begun to run.\nThen by the time the term had begun to run the original lessor had ceased for nearly a year to have any interest in the matter.\nAt that time the only person having a right to interfere with the appellant, the tenant, was the vendee, Moses Vineberg.\nAccording to some notions prevalent in the minds of those concerned and, indeed, put forward in argument herein it was only the original lessor who could give notice or act in the matter. Such does not seem to me to be a position either in accord with the law when viewed historically or with the construction of this lease.\nWhat has to be borne in mind is that it was originally the law that the vendee upon the sale taking place had the right to enter as a matter of course. It was for him to determine whether or not he should avail himself of this right. There was nothing binding him to do so. It might be for his advantage to continue the lease.\nIt is not necessary for our present purpose to define accurately the relative rights of such parties; which varied in many cases by custom and otherwise. All I am concerned with here is to indicate the general nature of the relation which was existent before the code, in order to appreciate the use of the term \u201clessor\u201d in this lease and also the provisions of the code which modified the relative rights of the landlord and tenant in such cases as sale by a lessor.\nNow, in this case I may observe that the term \u201clessor\u201d is used throughout the lease in relation to a number of things to be enjoyed by him as well as in the clause above quoted, and I see not the slightest reason to construe it in one sense in one place and in another sense in other places. It means the owner who is landlord for the time being in relation to any of the other things to be done or submitted to.\nIt cannot, therefore, be construed as meaning only the original landlord who may have died or disappeared. Hence, I think, Harris Vineberg had nothing to do with what Moses Vineberg or any succeeding landlord might do or wish to be done.\nFrom this it seems to me that Moses Vineberg had the right to give the notice which he gave upon the 2nd of May, 1912, declaring the lease terminated in August following and, in the language of the clause in question, \u201cto bring the lease to an end.\u201d The only condition precedent to his doing so was that there must have been a sale and that sale having taken place gave this vendee that right which he exercised at the earliest possible moment specified in the instrument.\nSupposing the sale had taken place only a week before or the same day, he was the man to declare his intention and right and what difference can it make that the sale had taken place a year before? There must be some lapse of time long or short between the sale and the declaration of the vendee\u2019s intention. I was at first blush inclined to think that only a sale within the term might be effective, but I do not think that view is tenable. Let us observe the provision binding the appellant, the lessee, to erect the new front in 1909, and the condition therein contained that in default \u201cthe lessor\u201d could demand the cancellation of this lease, and ask ourselves what would have been the rights of Moses Vineberg in relation thereto in case of default had he purchased in 1909 soon after the execution of the lease?\nCan there be a doubt that he would have had on such default the right in 1910, before the term had begun to run, to insist upon the cancellation of the lease?\nIt seems to me there could not and that illustrates the position of these parties in relation to each other at any time after Moses Vineberg became the landlord. By one term of it cancellation could have been insisted on by him before the term, or after for that matter, but by another term it clearly was not intended such a thing as termination upon notice was to take place until another time which must occur within the term.\nThen it was argued that he had become bound by the deed to him to maintain the leases then subsisting as if that forbade him or his successor giving notice to terminate.\nBut the provision is only\nto maintain the leases of the said premises now subsisting until the due termination of the same under the provisions thereof.\nAnd the question simply is whether or not the notice given on the second of May was a due termination thereof. I think it was, and there the matter should end but for what transpired later. It may well be that the parties in truth intended something else but, if I understand English, they have not so expressed it. It seems nothing more was said. The appellant stayed in possession, paid monthly the rent to Moses Vineberg till January following.\nFive months\u2019 rent was thus paid and accepted after the lease had effectually been brought \u201cto an end\u201d in the terse language of the term providing therefor.\nWhat right has anyone to say it was restored? There was absolutely nothing in the conduct of the parties from which to imply a waiver of the notice. There simply arose as between them that relation which the law implies from the actual condition of things when a lease is at an end. It was not argued that this was a tacite reconduction, and probably to do so would not have helped in any view of this case.\nI shall presently revert to the legal situation thus created in light of the provisions of the code.\nMoses Vineberg sold the premises in question to respondents on the 20th January, 1913, and conveyed same to them by notarial deed of that date. And then, on same day, served on appellant written notice of said sale requesting it to pay its rent in future to the respondents\nas I have nothing more to do with the rents.\nIn the vendor\u2019s declarations contained in the said deed is the following clause:\u2014\n(4) That he hereby transfers to the said purchasers the rental of said premises as and from the date hereof, hereby subrogating and substituting them in all his rights under the lease of said premises.\nThis is followed by the following provision under the caption \u201cPossession\u201d:\u2014\nThe purchasers will be the absolute owners of said property with immediate possession, subject to the existing lease which, however, the vendor undertakes to cancel not later than the first of May next and have the present tenant vacate on or before that date. Under such facts and circumstances the said Harris Vineberg and Moses Vineberg, on the 29th January, 1913, gave notice, as if given pursuant to the clause above quoted from the lease, to the appellant to quit on the first of May then next.\nIt is upon such notice that this action is founded.\nThis action was begun on the 5th of May following. The appellant, tenant, proceeded to pay the rent monthly as it had been requested to the respondents, getting receipts from them which made no reference to the notice to quit or recognized it in any way.\nThe notice to quit contained the following:\u2014\nThat by deed of sale passed on the day of January instant, the said Moses Vineberg sold and transferred the said property to Charles Workman and David S. Friedman.\nThis reference to deed of sale probably refers to the deed of 20th of January, but does not so expressly state for no date is given but \u201con the day of January instant.\u201d And in terms it is otherwise inaccurate in referring thereto for that deed only contained the provision above quoted as to cancellation of the lease which might have bound the grantors to procure it in various other ways.\nThe provision is treated as if the respondents had been empowered thereby to give notice as agents of the vendors or as if the vendors had been authorized to give notice in name and on behalf of the vendees.\nI assume it might have been quite competent for the vendor and vendees to have had the vendor constituted, as between them, the vendees\u2019 agents to use the names of the vendees or that of the vendors and vendees in giving notice, and to have provided for the vendor assuming the burden of the expense of giving proper notice and all that was needed to get possession. But it has not expressly done so and, with deference I submit, has not impliedly done so. It is quite obvious the parties concerned had some such notion as I have already adverted to, that the notice had to be given in the name of the vendors who were no longer lessors and did not fall within the terms of the clause enabling the lessor to give notice in writing to put the lease at an end.\nI have already given my reasons for thinking that it is only the actual lessor at the time who can under this lease give notice. Such is the express term of the provision and it seems, I respectfully submit, a perversion of the language used to try and make it express something else.\nBesides that the tenant is entitled to have in black and white what his landlord demands and to know exactly with whom he is dealing and to have the lessor (i.e., the actual landlord) clearly bound to abide by what is proffered.\nIf, by the 1st of May, the advantages of the situation had been reversed so that the respondents did not wish to eject the tenant and the appellant did not wish to continue tenant, how could it have availed itself of this notice as an answer to the continuation of the tenancy?\nThough holding the opinion that Harris Vineberg had after his conveyance to Moses Vineberg no longer power to give notice, yet I can conceive of an interpretation of this peculiar contract which intended that the clause for termination was only to become operative by him and in his name in the event of a sale by him, and upon any such hypothesis he carefully eliminated himself and his personal power by the express stipulation that the leases were to be maintained by his vendee to whom he transmitted such rights as he had and reserved nothing for himself. I think this notice was void and even the institution of this action cannot give it vitality.\nBut the many complications of this maze of going the wrong way about a very simple business are not yet ended.\nThe situation created by the first notice, and what ensued thereupon after the 2nd of August, has to be viewed in light of the obvious fact that thenceforward from that date the appellant held on sufferance.\nTo that situation article 1608 of the Civil Code may apply. But if we have regard to the acts of the parties they seem to have created a situation in which article 1642 is applicable and a monthly tenancy is to follow.\nIn either case, article 1657 is made applicable and no notice in accord therewith has ever been given.\nIt is answered that the notice of January is sufficient. I reply again there was no notice by the landlord at all; and that a landlord entitled to give a monthly notice cannot give one unsuitable to the tenancy and which would not bind both himself and the tenant. It is a notice that both can rely upon which the law requires if confusion is to be avoided.\nLastly, we have, if what I have said regarding the termination in August or otherwise is unfounded, the express language of article 1663 as follows:\u2014\n1663. The lessee cannot, by reason of the alienation of the thing leased, be expelled before the expiration of the lease, by a person who becomes owner of the thing leased under a title derived from the lessor; unless the lease contains a special stipulation to that effect and be registered.\nIn such case notice must be given to the lessee according to the rules contained in article 1657 and the articles therein referred to; unless it is otherwise specially agreed.\nI am unable to see why this very clear and express language is to be changed or discarded. With that accepted there is a complete answer to the respondents\u2019 contention in any way it can be presented as there does not seem to have been registration of this lease.\nWith great respect, I cannot think that there is anything which renders it necessary to import article 2128 into the discussion. That was adopted for the very obvious reasons assigned, and finds its proper place under the 18th title of the Code which is devoted to the registration of real rights and has its analogue in, I suppose, all of such systems of registration.\nThis article 1663 is found in another place where the subjects of lease and hire dealt with are of an entirely different character.\nI see no inconsistency and there is much that is cogently put forward in the argument of Mr. Lafleur to show that the ground taken in the judgment of Mr. Justice Delorimier is not satisfactory.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs sue for a declaration that a certain unregistered lease made by their predecessor in title, one Harris Vineberg, to the defendants, dated the 29th June, 1909, for a term of three years from the 1st of May, 1912,\nis resiliated and cancelled and came to an end on the 1st May, 1913\nThis lease contained the following clause:\u2014\nThe lessee will have the right to continue the present lease from year to year after the expiration of the said term, and until the property will be sold, upon the same conditions and for the same rental as hereinbefore mentioned; and during such continuation of this lease, will have the right to bring the lease to a termination at the end of any year by giving the lessor three months\u2019 notice in writing of its intention, as well to continue this lease, as afterwards of terminating it. Failing such notice at the end of the said term, the lease will continue. And the lessor will have the right, in the event of the property being sold, to bring the lease to an end, at any time, whether during the said term of three years, or afterwards, by giving the lessee three months\u2019 notice in writing to that effect.\nBy deed of the 5th of June, 1911, Harris Vineberg conveyed the property in question to Moses Vineberg, who covenanted to maintain the subsisting leases and was subrogated to his vendor\u2019s rights in respect of them.\nBy deed of the 20th January, 1913, Moses Vineberg conveyed the property to the plaintiffs. This deed contained the following clause as to possession:\u2014\nThe purchasers will be absolute owners of said property with immediate possession, subject to the existing lease which however the vendor undertakes to cancel not later than the first of May next and have the present tenant vacate on or before that date.\nThe purchasers were expressly subrogated to all the rights of the vendor under the lease. On the same day the vendor, Moses Vineberg, gave to the defendants written notice of the sale and required them thereafter, to pay their rent to the plaintiffs, who accordingly received the rent for the months of February, March and April, 1913.\nThe plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2019 lease was terminated by two notarial notices given to them\u2014 the first on the 2nd of May, 1912, on behalf of Moses Vineberg, and the other on the 29th January, 1913, on behalf of Harris Vineberg and Moses Vineberg. They base their claim to the declaratory judgment above mentioned and to an order for possession against the mis-en-cause, who are sub-tenants, solely on this ground. The Superior Court decided in their favour, holding that the lease had been terminated by the notices and that the defendants, by their sub-tenants, were, therefore, illegally in possession of the premises.\nIn the Court of Review[2], this judgment was affirmed. But, in his opinion, Mr. Justice de Lorimier, who spoke for the court, said that the first notice was of little consequence because it had not been acted on by mutual consent, and the lease had been treated as still subsisting after the 3rd of August, 1912, the date fixed by the notice for its termination. He deemed the notice of the 29th of January, 1913, to have been validly given by Harris Vineberg and Moses Vineberg in their own interest as well as in that of the plaintiffs. He was also of the opinion that article 1663 C.C. was inapplicable, but that article 2128 C.C. applied, and that, under it, the lease was void as against the plaintiffs, as purchasers, because it had not been registered. On these grounds the appeal of the defendants was dismissed.\nIt is against that judgment that the present appeal is taken.\nFor the reasons stated at some length by Mr Justice de Lorimier, in upholding the validity of the notice given on behalf of Moses Vineberg on the 2nd May, 1912, I agree in his view that the right to terminate the lease in question was not personal to the original lessor, Harris Vineberg, but passed with the ownership of the property first to Moses Vineberg and afterwards to the plaintiffs, who became, each in turn, the \u201clessor\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the clause of the lease providing for resiliation. But I incline to think that the notice of May, 1912, was ineffectual because it was given in respect of a sale which had taken place eleven months before the term of the lease began and before the notice itself was given. The resiliatory clause provides that the lessor may terminate the lease\nin the event of the property being sold * * * at any time, whether during the said term of three years or afterwards\nby giving notice, etc. The notice could only be given during the term or afterwards. Moses Vineberg recognized that to be the case and therefore deferred giving notice in respect of the sale of the 5th June, 1911, until the 2nd May, 1912. It cannot have been in contemplation of the parties to the lease that the lessee should be kept in uncertainty for eleven months whether the landlord intended to exercise his option to cancel or meant to continue the lease. It was, I think, the clear intent that the option should be exercisable only at the time of the sale\u2014a reasonable delay being allowable for the giving of notice. The fact that the notice could be given only during or after the three-year term affords a strong indication that it could not be given at all in respect of a sale which took place before the commencement of the term.\nBut, if I should be mistaken in thinking that the notice of the 2nd May, 1912, never was effectual, I agree with the Court of Review that it was waived and the lease continued by mutual consent. The plaintiffs recognized it as subsisting on the 20th January, 1913, by the very deed which they put in evidence to establish their title, and by the notarial notice of the 29th January, 1913, on which they also rely. The defendants plead that it is still in force. As put by the respondents themselves in their factum:\u2014 The notices of May, 1912, are of little importance as nothing was done in furtherance thereof and the appellant was allowed to continue its occupation until the sale to the present respondents.\nOn the whole evidence I am satisfied that after the 3rd August, 1912, the occupation of the defendants was not under a tacit renewal (Art, 1609 C.C.), or under a tenancy by sufferance (Art. 1608 C.C.). There was a waiver of the notice and a continuance of the three years\u2019 lease by mutual consent.\nApplying the reasoning of Mr. Justice de Lorimier as to the rights of the purchaser under the clauses of the lease which provides for its resiliation, on the sale from Moses Vineberg to the present plaintiffs they became the lessors of the defendants and entitled to cancel the lease under that clause. The right to give the notice only arose on the sale, by which full ownership was vested in the purchasers. On the very day of the conveyance\u2014the 20th January, 1913\u2014 Moses Vineberg notified the defendants of the sale and of the subrogation of the plaintiffs to his rights as landlord. Thereafter his status as landlord or lessor to the defendants was completely at an end. Assuming that the notarial notice of the 29th January, 1913, was in time and otherwise sufficient, (it abounds in mistakes and misrecitals) in my opinion it could not be lawfully given by or on behalf of Moses Vineberg but could be so given only by or on behalf of the plaintiffs, who were then the lessors. The notice does not purport to be given on behalf of the plaintiffs and there is nothing in evidence to show that Moses Vineberg had any power or authority to give a notice on their behalf. On the contrary, the special clause as to possession in the deed from Moses Vineberg to the plaintiffs, above quoted, is an undertaking by the former on his own account to cancel the lease and to have the tenant vacate the premises. I cannot regard the notarial notice of the 29th January, 1913, as something done by Vineberg on the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf which they might ratify and adopt and thus obtain the benefit of. On his own behalf, Moses Vineberg had not the right to give the notice. His undertaking to cancel the lease and secure possession of the premises for the plaintiffs did not empower him to exercises rights which had passed to them and for any abuse of which they would be accountable. Harris Vineberg\u2019s right had ceased on the 5th June, 1911.\nBut, if the notice of the 29th January could be deemed an exercise of the right of resiliation conferred by the lease, I would regard article 1663 C.C. as presenting a fatal obstacle to its efficacy. That article reads as follows:\u2014\n1663. The lessee cannot, by reason of the alienation of the thing leased, be expelled before the expiration of the lease, by a person who becomes owner of the thing leased under a title derived from the lessor; unless the lease contains a special stipulation to that effect and be registered.\nIn such case notice must be given to the lessee according to the rule contained in article 1657 and the articles therein referred to; unless it is otherwise specially agreed.\nThe requirement of registration in this article is no doubt, difficult to understand. But the text is explicit and I am, with great respect, unable to restrict its application in the case of immovables to leases for a term not exceeding one year, as Mr. Justice de Lorimier thinks should be done. See Mignault, Droit Civil Canadien, Vol. 7, p. 357. The reference in the second paragraph of the article to\narticle 1657 and the articles therein referred to\nwas relied upon at bar as indicating that the application of article 1663 should be so restricted, it was said article 1657 and the articles therein referred to deal only with leases for one year or less. But, on reference to article 1657, it will be seen that it deals with leases where the term is uncertain, or where the lease is verbal whatever its duration. Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier, C. J., in his \u201cCours de Droit Civil,\u201d Vol. 5, at p. 239, discussing Art. 1663, says:\u2014\nC\u2019est par erreur que les r\u00e9dacteurs de notre code ont exig\u00e9 cet enregistrement; il n\u2019y avait aucune raison de le faire.\nThis view of the learned commentator may be correct. Mr. Mignault says in his valuable work, Vol. 7, at p. 356:\nIl y a une contradiction, du moins apparente, entre les articles 1663 et 2128.\nThe latter article is as follows:\n2128. The lease of an immovable for a period exceeding one year cannot be invoked against a subsequent purchaser unless it has been registered.\nExplicit as is the text of this article, that of article 1663 is equally so. I cannot find any satisfactory ground for holding that one must yield to the other, or that article 1663 should receive a construction which will confine its operation to leases not within article 2128. To so restrict its application would be to introduce into the article a qualification which there is nothing in the text to justify. As put by Mr. Mignault, at p. 357 of the 7th vol. of his work:\nDans ce cas, l\u2019article 1663 est une disposition inutile, puisque le tiers-acqu\u00e9reur ne saurait avoir plus de droits que son auteur, le bailleur, et que celui-ci n\u2019aurait pu expulser le locataire sous un bail annuel avant l\u2019expiration de l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\nIt was by article 1663 that the purchaser\u2019s right to expel his vendor\u2019s tenant, recognized in the old jurisprudence, was done away with. If article 1663 applies in the case of immovables only to leases for terms not exceeding one year, does the old right of expulsion still exist in regard to other leases? Was it the purpose of article 2128 to extinguish that right? In their report the codifiers tell us that by the adoption of article 1663 leases became charges on immovables and like other charges should be subjected to the publicity of registration. Hence, they say the introduction of article 2128. The statement is scarcely intelligible if the leases dealt with in article 2128 are not covered or affected by article 1663, since on that assumption, they do not become charges on the immovables leased and the reason assigned for requiring their registration does not exist.\nThe more article 1663 is considered the more apparent does it seem to be that its application cannot be restricted to leases for one year or less.\nThe contradiction between article 1663 and article 2128 is only apparent. Both may be given full effect although they do, no doubt, partly overlap. One makes registration a condition of the exercise of the right of resiliation by those claiming under the lessor; the other makes it a condition of the lessee and his assigns or sub-tenants claiming the protection of a lease for more than one year as against a transferee of the lessor\u2019s title, apart from any contractual provision requiring him to respect or maintain it. McGee v. Larochelle[3].\nIt may be, as Mr. Mignault suggests in his note at the foot of page 356, that the legislature in enacting article 1663 had in mind the protection of assigns and sub-tenants of the lessee and inadvertently made use of language broad enough to cover the lessee himself; it may be, as Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier says, that the provision requiring registration was inserted in article 1663 by mistake. But we may not on mere surmises deny to the lessee the advantage to which the plain and unambiguous words of the article entitle him.\nIn the present case article 2128 C.C. cannot be successfully invoked by the plaintiffs. In the first place they do not in their declaration rest their case on that article. No reference is made to the non-registration of the defendant\u2019s lease. On the contrary, they treat the lease as subsisting and binding on them and they claim relief not against it, but under it. Nor could they have done otherwise, because, by the deed on which they base their title and claim to possession, they expressly took \u201csubject to the existing lease\u201d and had themselves subrogated and substituted to all the rights of their grantors under that lease. While mere notice or knowledge of the lease before they acquired title would not prevent the plaintiffs taking advantage of its non-registration (Art. 2085 C. C.), having taken their title expressly subject to it, they cannot invoke article 2128 C.C. against it. They cannot thus escape from their express assumption of it. Dunn v. Wiggins[4]. This seems to me to constitute a peremptory ground for the dismissal of this action.\nFor these reasons, I would, with the most profound respect, allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Review and would direct judgment dismissing the action with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s\u2019agit dans cette cause d\u2019une action en expulsion contre un locataire par un tiers acqu\u00e9reur.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action. La cour de revision[5] a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la d\u00e9fenderesse appelle de cette d\u00e9cision de la cour de revision.\nCertains points soulev\u00e9s par l\u2019appelante devant les cours inf\u00e9rieures ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s dans son factum et, par cons\u00e9quent, je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019ils sont abandonn\u00e9s. Alors je ne vais r\u00e9f\u00e9rer qu\u2019aux trois questions qu\u2019elle a discut\u00e9es dans la plaidoirie \u00e9crite et orale qu\u2019elle a faite devant nous.\nVoici ces trois points:\u2014\n1. Le nouveau propri\u00e9taire n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019expulser le locataire parce que le bail n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 suivant les exigences de l\u2019article 1663 C.C.\n2. Le privil\u00e8ge de r\u00e9siliation stipul\u00e9 dans le bail \u00e9tait personnel et ne pouvait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 que par le locateur originaire.\n3. Les avis de cong\u00e9 requis par la loi et la convention n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s.\nD\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement et port\u00e9e de l\u2019art 1668 C.C.\nLe bail est sous forme authentique et il couvre une p\u00e9riode de trois ans. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9. Il contient une stipulation que le locateur pourra mettre fin au bail s\u2019il vend la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le tiers acqu\u00e9reur, s\u2019autorisant de cette stipulation, demande l\u2019expulsion de la d\u00e9fenderesse-appellante, mais cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9pond en disant: Vous ne pouvez me faire d\u00e9guerpir parce que le bail n\u2019est pas enregistr\u00e9. Et elle se base sur l\u2019article 1663 du Code Civil qui dit:\nLe locataire ne peut, \u00e0 raison de l\u2019ali\u00e9nation de la chose lou\u00e9e, \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 avant l\u2019expiration du bail, par une personne qui devient propri\u00e9taire de la chose lou\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019un titre consenti par le locateur, \u00e0 moins que le bail ne contienne une stipulation \u00e0 cet effet et n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9. La pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelante sur ce point est mal fond\u00e9e.\nLe d\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement du bail ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 que par le tiers acqu\u00e9reur et non pas par le locataire. Il est de principe que l\u2019enregistrement n\u2019est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral requis qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers. On exige l\u2019enregistrement d\u2019un bail pour le rendre opposable au tiers acqu\u00e9reur. Mais, si le bail n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9, rien n\u2019emp\u00eache ce tiers de se pr\u00e9valoir de la clause de r\u00e9siliation qui y est stipul\u00e9e et de demander l\u2019expulsion du locataire.\nIl suffit d\u2019ailleurs d\u2019examiner l\u2019historique de cette l\u00e9gislation pour s\u2019en convaincre.\nSous le droit romain, en vertu de la loi emptorem, le bail n\u2019engendrait qu\u2019un rapport particulier entre le preneur et le bailleur; il ne produisait que des obligations de personne \u00e0 personne et le nouveau propri\u00e9taire pouvait expulser le locataire. Le contrat de louage \u00e9tait termin\u00e9 par la vente que le propri\u00e9taire faisait de la chose lou\u00e9e.\nCette disposition de la loi romaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie en France jusqu\u2019au Code Napol\u00e9on et dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec jusqu\u2019au Code Civil. L\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais et canadien, tout en maintenant ce droit d\u2019expulsion pour l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, obligeait le tiers acqu\u00e9reur de laisser jouir le locataire pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e courante. Il ne pouvait pas l\u2019expulser imm\u00e9diatement. Pothier, \u201cLouage,\u201d No. 297; Troplong, \u201cLouage,\u201d No. 505.\nLe Code Napol\u00e9on adopta une r\u00e8gle diff\u00e9rente de la loi romaine et il d\u00e9clara que la vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9e ne mettait pas n\u00e9cessairement fin au bail, mais \u00e0 la condition que le bail f\u00fbt authentique ou e\u00fbt date certaine; ou \u00e0 moins que le bailleur se f\u00fbt r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de le r\u00e9silier. L\u2019article 1743 du Code \u00e9non\u00e7a cette r\u00e8gle dans les termes suivants:\nSi le bailleur vend la chose lou\u00e9e, l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur ne peut expulser le fermier ou le locataire qui a un bail authentique ou dont la date est certaine, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne se soit r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ce droit par le contrat de bail.\nLorsque nos codificateurs ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur rapport le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1863, ils ont recommand\u00e9 d\u2019adopter la r\u00e8gle du Code Napol\u00e9on; mais l\u2019article qu\u2019ils propos\u00e8rent diff\u00e9rait de l\u2019article 1743 sous le rapport de la r\u00e9daction\net dans l\u2019omission des mots qui restreignent la r\u00e8gle aux baux par \u00e9crit et ayant date certaine. Cette restriction, (ajoutent-ils), paru inutile. Le mode de constater la v\u00e9ritable date est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration des dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales concernant la preuve.\nIl est tr\u00e8s important de lire l\u2019article que les codificateurs ont alors soumis car il nous donne la clef de la contradiction apparente que nous retrouvons dans les deux articles 1663 et 2128 de notre Code Civil.\nVoici donc est article:\nLe locataire ne peut \u00e0 raison de l\u2019ali\u00e9nation de la chose lou\u00e9e \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 avant l\u2019expiration du bail par une personne qui devient propri\u00e9taire de la chose lou\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019un titre consenti par le locateur, \u00e0 moins que le bail ne contienne une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 cet effet.\nRapport des codificateurs, \u00e9d. 1863, vol. 2, p. 96.\nIl n\u2019est nullement question, comme on le voit, de l\u2019enregistrement du bail.\nDans leur rapport subs\u00e9quent, du 1er juillet 1864, sur l\u2019Enregistrement, les codificateurs, apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu\u2019ils avaient sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au titre du louage que la vente de l\u2019immeuble ne mettrait plus fin au bail, ajoutaient\nL\u2019adoption de cette disposition ferait du bail une charge sur l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019on doit soumettre, comme toute autre charge, \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9.\nil est donc sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019amender l\u2019article 39a en \u00e9tendant la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 tout bail pour un terme exc\u00e9dant un an. Et ils ont propos\u00e9 alors l\u2019amendement suivant, qui fut adopt\u00e9 et qui est devenu le texte de notre article 2128:\u2014\nLa bail d\u2019immeubles pour un terme exc\u00e9dant un an ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un tiers acqu\u00e9reur, s\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9.\nDans la seconde \u00e9dition de leurs rapports, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e en 1865, nous retrouvons de la part des codificateurs les m\u00eames observations sur l\u2019article 1663 que nous avons reproduites plus haut, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, que la vente ne mettait pas n\u00e9cessairement fin au bail, mais qu\u2019on ne devrait pas adopter la r\u00e8gle du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui exigeait un bail authentique, pour que le locatire p\u00fbt rester sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nRapport des codificateurs, vol. 2, 2eme \u00e9d., (1865) p. 29.\nMais quand nous ouvrons ce m\u00eame volume, \u00e0 la page 92, nous trouvons qu\u2019on a ajout\u00e9 au texte de l\u2019article quatre mots qui lui donnent un sens contraire \u00e0 celui que les codificateurs proposaient.\nCes mots ont trait \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement du bail.\nVoici, d\u2019ailleurs, le texte de l\u2019article tel que nous le retrouvons \u00e0 cette page 92:\u2014\nLe locataire ne peut \u00e0 raison de l\u2019ali\u00e9nation de la chose lou\u00e9e \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 avant l\u2019expiration du bail, par une personne qui devient propri\u00e9taire de la chose lou\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019un titre consenti par le locataire, \u00e0 moins que le bail ne contienne une stipulation \u00e0 cet effet et n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9.\nComment ces quatre derniers mots se sont-ils gliss\u00e9s l\u00e0? J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le d\u00e9couvrir. Est-ce une erreur d\u2019impression? C\u2019est possible. Car, avec cette addition, l\u2019article ne reproduit plus l\u2019intention des codificateurs telle qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont exprim\u00e9e dans leur rapport.\nEt ensuite, cet article semble irr\u00e9conciliable avec l\u2019article 2128, qui traite de la m\u00eame mati\u00e8re au titre de l\u2019Enregistrement. Les codificateurs, comme on le sait, apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs premiers sept rapports sur les diff\u00e9rentes parties du Code Civil, avaient pr\u00e9par\u00e9, le 21 Novembre 1864, un rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire pour expliquer certaines corrections qu\u2019ils d\u00e9siraient faire. Voici ce qu\u2019ils disent au commencement de ce rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire:\u2014\nLes commissaires, ayant termin\u00e9 leurs travaux en tant que le Code Civil est concern\u00e9, auraient regard\u00e9 ce travail comme imparfait s\u2019ils ne l\u2019eussent revis\u00e9 en entier et avec soin, dans le but de faire au texte imprim\u00e9 et soumis successivement de temps \u00e0 autre les changements et additions n\u00e9cessaires * * * *\nLe texte de ces changements propos\u00e9s * * * se trouve ci-apr\u00e8s dans l\u2019ordre qui devra \u00eatre finalement donn\u00e9 aux livres et aux titres du Code.\nNous examinons les changements faits au titre du louage et rien n\u2019appara\u00eet concernant l\u2019article 1663 qui portait alors dans leurs rapports le No 56.\nAlors on peut dire avec beaucoup de raison que cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement dans l\u2019article 1663 est due \u00e0 une erreur. Nos commentateurs, Mignault et Langelier, trouvent cet article peu satisfaisant.\nCette diff\u00e9rence que je viens de signaler entre le texte originaire et le dernier leur paraissait inconnue; du moins, ils n\u2019en parlent pas dans leur ouvrage. Ce n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant, car cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition des rapports est tr\u00e8s peu connue. J\u2019en avais un exemplaire dans ma biblioth\u00e8que priv\u00e9e et je remarque que cette \u00e9dition ne se trouvait pas ni \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que du Parlement, \u00e0 Ottawa, ni dans celle de la cour supr\u00eame. La cour supr\u00eame cependant a pu se la procurer avec beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 et a maintenant l\u2019exemplaire qui para\u00eet avoir appartenu au juge Beaudry, l\u2019un des codificateurs. Mais cet article 1663 se trouve dans le Code avec ces quatre mots ajout\u00e9s et nous devons l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et le concilier, si possible, avec les autres dispositions de la loi et surtout avec l\u2019article 2128.\nSi nous lisons litt\u00e9ralement l\u2019article 1663, nous voyons que le locataire ne peut \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 par le tiers acqu\u00e9reur, \u00e0 moins que le bail ne contienne une stipulation \u00e0 cet effet et \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit enregistr\u00e9.\nCela veut-il dire que si le bail ne contient pas la r\u00e9serve d\u2019expulser au cas de vente le locateur ne pourra pas expulser le locataire? Certainement non.\nLe locataire a le droit de rester sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait une clause qui pourvoit \u00e0 son expulsion. Cette clause est stipul\u00e9e dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du propri\u00e9taire. Et si elle ne se trouve pas dans le bail, alors le nouvel acqu\u00e9reur ne peut expulser son locataire de suite.\nIl r\u00e9sulte que cette clause \u00e9tant stipul\u00e9e en faveur du propri\u00e9taire, ce dernier seul peut s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir.\nC\u2019est ce qu\u2019enseigne Baudry-Lacantinerie dans son premier volume du Trait\u00e9 du Louage, au n\u00b0 1296, o\u00f9 il dit:\nLorsque le bail contient la r\u00e9serve du droit d\u2019expulser le preneur au cas de vente, la clause ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur; elle ne peut pas l\u2019\u00eatre par le preneur.\nLe m\u00eame principe doit s\u2019appliquer quant \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement. Il n\u2019y a que le nouveau propri\u00e9taire qui puisse se pr\u00e9valoir du d\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement du bail.\nOn a voulu, au cours de l\u2019argument, interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article 1663 suivant son sens grammatical et litt\u00e9raire.\nJe pr\u00e9f\u00e8re donner \u00e0 cet article une interpr\u00e9tation conforme aux id\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de notre Code et suivre en cela l\u2019opinion de M. de Chassat, \u201cInterpr\u00e9tation des Lois,\u201d p. 101, o\u00f9 il dit:\u2014 L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation grammaticale et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation logique \u00e9tant admises, quelle est celle des deux qui, dans le doute, doit l\u2019emporter?\nLorsqu\u2019elles concourent pour nous retracer les m\u00eames objets, la solution est facile; le sens naturel des mots \u00e9tant aussi la pens\u00e9e de la loi, il suffit \u00e0 l\u2019esprit d\u2019en obtenir la certitude. Mais lorsqu\u2019elles ne concourent pas, quelle est celle des deux qui est obligatoire pour le juge? Il est \u00e9vident que les mots ne font pas le droit; c\u2019est la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur; les mots ne servent qu\u2019\u00e0 les manifester: Non enim lex quod scriptum est, sed quod legislator voluit, quod judicio suo probavit et recepit. L. de quibus ff. de legibus. Toutes les fois donc qu\u2019il y aura une diff\u00e9rence entre le sens des mots et la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur, il faudra abandonner les mots, puisque ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 qu\u2019est le droit. De l\u00e0 l\u2019obligation pour le juge de rechercher le vrai sens de la loi.\nQue ces quatre mots de l\u2019article 1663 soient le produit de l\u2019erreur, ou qu\u2019on ait voulu par l\u00e0 \u00e9noncer la r\u00e8gle du Code Napol\u00e9on quant \u00e0 l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 du bail, je crois qu\u2019il faut faire pr\u00e9valoir les dispositions de l\u2019article 2128 sur celles de l\u2019article 1663 et d\u00e9cider que dans le bail d\u2019immeuble d\u2019un an le tiers acqu\u00e9reur est oblig\u00e9 de maintenir ce bail: mais si le bail exc\u00e8de un an, il ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 contre le tiers acqu\u00e9reur \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit enregistr\u00e9.\nSur son premier point, l\u2019appellante doit donc faillir. L\u2019opinion savante et \u00e9labor\u00e9e de l\u2019honorable juge deLorimier, qui a rendu le jugement de la cour de revision, est bien fond\u00e9e.\nII.\nLe droit de demander la r\u00e9siliation du bail est-il personnel au propri\u00e9taire qui a consenti le bail?\nC\u2019est la seconde question que nous soumet l\u2019appellante qui pr\u00e9tend que ce droit est personnel au locateur originaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 Harris Vineberg.\nLe bail contient la clause suivante:\u2014\nThe lessor will have the right, in the event of the property being sold, to bring the lease to an end at any time, whether during the said term of three years of afterwards, by giving the lessee three months\u2019 notice in writing to that effect. On a dit que les mots \u201cat any time\u201d dans cette clause donnaient au locateur le droit de mettre fin au bail en tout temps apr\u00e8s la vente, qu\u2019il pourrait laisser passer six mois, un an, ou plus apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dispos\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et ensuite donner avis de r\u00e9siliation.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion avec l\u2019appellante que ces mots \u201cat any time\u201d se rapportent au cas o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire viendrait \u00e0 vendre sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit pendant les trois ann\u00e9es du bail, soit pendant les ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes.\nMais je ne puis partager son opinion que le bailleur seul puisse exercer ce privil\u00e8ge de r\u00e9silier le bail et qu\u2019il ne pourrait en vendant sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9rer ce privil\u00e8ge au nouvel acqu\u00e9reur. Tous les auteurs sont unanimes \u00e0 dire que les droits stipul\u00e9s dans un bail passent au nouvel acqu\u00e9reur s\u2019il d\u00e9sire continuer le bail. Voici ce qui dit Laurent, vol. 25, n\u00b0 395.\nL\u2019acheteur est subrog\u00e9 aux droits et aux obligations du bailleur; donc, si le bailleur a stipul\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 d\u2019expulsion l\u2019acheteur est aussi subrog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce droit. C\u2019est sans doute pour ce motif que la loi n\u2019exige pas que le contrat de vente investisse l\u2019acheteur d\u2019une facult\u00e9 dont il jouit de plein droit en vertu de la subrogation. Il devient bailleur et il a tous les droits qui appartenaient au bailleur en vertu de son contrat. Enfin, on peut invoquer, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le principe de l\u2019article 1121; le bailleur qui stipule le droit d\u2019expulsion fait une stipulation au profit d\u2019un tiers, ce que la loi permet quand telle est la condition d\u2019une stipulation que l\u2019on fait pour, soi-m\u00eame; or, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la facult\u00e9 d\u2019expulser, r\u00e9serv\u00e9e par le bailleur dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, est la condition du bail, il faut dire plus, elle est stipul\u00e9e dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du bailleur autant que dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, car elle a pour objet de faciliter la vente de la chose lou\u00e9e. On a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait une question d\u2019intention; cela est certain en th\u00e9orie, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une convention; mais, en fait, l\u2019intention des parties n\u2019est gu\u00e8re douteuse. Pourquoi le bailleur a-t-il stipul\u00e9 le droit d\u2019expulsion? En faveur de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur; donc cette facult\u00e9 doit passer \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur, \u00e0 moins que le vendeur ne d\u00e9clare que l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur n\u2019en pourra pas user.\nQuand Harris Vineberg a vendu, le 5 juin, 1911, \u00e0 Moses A. Vineberg, il aurait eu parfaitement le droit de stipuler la r\u00e9siliation du bail avec son acheteur. Mais il n\u2019en a rien fait. Au contraire, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte de vente que l\u2019acheteur s\u2019obligeait\nto maintain the leases of the said premises now subsisting, until the due termination of the same under the provisions thereof.\nLes droits et obligations relevant du bail en question en cette cause sont donc pass\u00e9s entre les mains de l\u2019acheteur et d\u00e8s ce moment l\u00e0 Moses A. Vineberg devenait le cr\u00e9ancier du droit de mettre fin \u00e0 ce bail s\u2019il venait \u00e0 son tour \u00e0 vendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIII.\nL\u2019appellante pr\u00e9tend que les avis requis par la loi ou la convention n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s.\nEn devenant acqu\u00e9reur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, Moses A. Vineberg est devenu, comme je l\u2019ai dit dans le paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, acqu\u00e9reur de tous les droits et privil\u00e8ges attach\u00e9s au bail. L\u2019un de ces privil\u00e8ges \u00e9tait qu\u2019il pouvait le r\u00e9silier au cas o\u00f9 il la vendrait.\nLe 20 janvier 1913, il a vendu aux intim\u00e9s, Friedman et Workman, et il est stipul\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte de vente que le bail prendra fin, et ce dans les termes suivants:\u2014\nThe purchaser will be the absolute owners of said property with immediate possession, subject to the existing lease, which, however, the vendor undertakes to cancel not later than the first of May next and have the present tenant vacate on or before that date.\nLes nouveaux acqu\u00e9reurs auraient pu parfaitement proc\u00e9der \u00e0 r\u00e9silier eux-m\u00eames le bail; mais ils ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 en faire une condition de la vente que le vendeur lui-m\u00eame donnerait l\u2019avis de r\u00e9siliation. Ils \u00e9taient bien pr\u00eats, je suppose, \u00e0 se rendre acqu\u00e9reurs de l\u2019immeuble et \u00e0 payer le prix \u00e9lev\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait convenu, mais \u00e0 la condition que le bail fut annul\u00e9. Leur vendeur repr\u00e9sentait que le bail pouvait se terminer; alors il s\u2019est charg\u00e9 d\u2019en faire faire la r\u00e9siliation de l\u00e0 au premier mai, 1913. C\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs une convention absolument conforme au bail qui avait stipul\u00e9 que le bailleur en cas de vente pouvait mettre fin au bail.\nLe bail devait cependant se continuer jusqu\u2019au premier mai. Il ne pouvait pas d\u2019ailleurs \u00eatre r\u00e9sili\u00e9 avant cela parce que la convention stipulait un avis de trois mois. Alors Moses A. Vineberg auquel s\u2019est joint, suivant moi inutilement, Harris Vineberg, le premier bailleur, donne l\u2019avis de cong\u00e9 de trois mois mentionn\u00e9 au bail \u00e0 la compagnie appelante par prot\u00eat notari\u00e9.\nIl all\u00e8gue dans son prot\u00eat la vente qu\u2019il a faite quelques jours avant \u00e0 Friedman et Workman et il ajoute ceci:\nThat it is one of the conditions of the said sale that the said F. X. St. Charles and Co., Ltd., the tenant of the said property, will by notification be obliged to vacate the same under the terms of the said lease.\nEn donnant cet avis, il est \u00e9vident que Harris Vineberg et Moses A. Vineberg agissaient alors tant dans leur propre int\u00e9r\u00eat que dans celui des nouveaux acqu\u00e9reurs. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute que l\u2019intention de tous les bailleurs pass\u00e9s et pr\u00e9sents \u00e9tait de mettre fin \u00e0 ce bail. L\u2019appelant ne peut donc pas pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019avis de cong\u00e9 ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment donn\u00e9.\nPour toutes ces raisons, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gouin, Lemieux, Murphy, B\u00e9rard & Perrault.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Jacobs, Hall, Couture & Fitch.\n[1] 21 R.L.

C.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Divi\u00adsion of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], dismissing, on equal division of the court, the appeal by the appellant from the refusal of Simmons J., at the trial with a jury, to reserve a case for the opinion of the Appellate Division.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. O'Connor K.C. for the appellant. W. L. Scott for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which, on an equal division of opinion, refused to quash a conviction against the appellant prisoner under section 212 of the Criminal Code for having, under promise of marriage, seduced and had illicit connection on or about the 27th day of March, 1919, with one Mary Kovack, an unmarried female under the age of 21 years.\nTwo questions only were raised and argued at bar : one, whether the evidence of Mary Kovack, the female in question, was corroborated or not; and the other, whether she was at the time of the alleged offence of previously chaste character.\nAfter hearing Mr. O'Connor, counsel for the appel\u00adlant, on the question of corroboration, we were unanimously of the opinion that there was sufficient evi\u00addence of corroboration, and Mr. Scott was not called on to reply on that point.\nThe second question raised a much more delicate and difficult point: Was the jury justified in not finding the complainant Mary Kovack, at the time of the illicit connection of the 27th March between her and the prisoner, a girl of previously unchaste character?\nThe material facts necessary to reach a conclusion on that point are fully set in the learned judge's reasons given in the Appellate Division (1). The As to the signature of the witnesses at the request of the testator, undoubtedly this is a requirement of article 851 C.C., although it is not mentioned in the English Wills Act, 1 Vict., ch. 26, from which article 851 C.C. is derived. But it is to be remarked that when the will is signed or marked by another person than the testator, article 851 requires the \"express direction\" of the testator, while with regard to the signature of the witnesses at the request of the testator, nothing is said as to the form of this request. In my opinion, inasmuch as the legislature, in speaking of the direction or request of the testator, requires it to be expressed in one case and not in the other, it follows that this request can, in the latter case, be implied by reason of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will. Here Mellor testified that Mrs. Wynne, when the witnesses and she had walked right up to the bed, asked them if they would be witnesses and put their signatures on the will, and that she said this aloud to both of them. The request she thus made to James and Mellor must have been heard by Wynne, who then signed the will and saw or could see the witnesses sign it in his presence. In my opinion, but I say this with every deference for the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench who thought otherwise, it would be pushing formalism too far to reject this will for the lack of an expressed request of the testator to the witnesses, and the more so as this is an essentially simple and popular form of will, which undoubtedly the legislature desired to render as easy as possible to the least educated of the population.\nIf it be contended that Mrs. Wynne who went for the witnesses and asked them to attest the will, had no mandate from Wynne to do so, I would answer that evidently no express mandate was required. And the question really is whether Wynne intended to make a will and dispose in favour Of his wife, and unless Mrs. Wynne's testimony be discredited, I must find that he did. The obtaining of witnesses, although essential, was not, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, a matter requiring any kind of mandate from the testator, for if we must take it as established that he wished to make a will, getting the witnesses necessary for the validity of the will was merely carrying out his desire.\nIt may be that this will is quite near to the danger point, but after full consideration I find myself unable to set it aside and nullify the very natural and reasonable disposition which Wynne made of his property, for he and his wife had been long married and had no children. Of course, Tuck's affidavit in support of the probate was untrue, as he did not see Wynne sign the will, although he probably could identify his signature. But nothing would now be gained by annulling the probate, for the testimony of James and Mellor shews that Wynne really signed the will. And, in my opinion, the attack on the will itself fails.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. F. Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott & David.\n[1] 15 Alta. L.R. 313; [1920] 2 W.W.R. 251.\n"
