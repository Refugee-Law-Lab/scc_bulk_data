Woodruff v. The Attorney-General for Ontario (1908), A.C. 508, distinguished. Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 20 K.B. 164) reversed, Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAt the time of the death of C.L.C., 11th April, 1902, the statutes in force in the Province of Quebec relating to succession duties provided that \"all transmissions, owing to death, of the property in, usufruct or enjoyment of movable and immovable property in the province shall be liable to the following taxes calculated upon the value of the property transmitted, after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of the death, etc.\" Subsequently, by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 11, a clause was added (sec. 1191(c)), as follows: \"The word 'property' within the meaning of this section shall include all property, whether movable or immovable, actually situate or owing within the province, whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the debt is payable within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province, and all movables, wherever situate, of persons having their domicile (or residing), in the Province of Quebec at the time of their death,\" which was in force at the time of the death of H. H. C, 26th December, 1906. Succession duties were levied, in respect of both estates upon the whole value of the property devolving including, in each case, movable property locally situated in the United States of America. The action was to recover back those portions of the duties paid in respect of the value of the movables situated outside the limits of the Province of Quebec.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 20 K.B. 164), Davies and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the movable property situated outside -the limits of Quebec forming part of the succession of H. H. C. was subject to the duty so imposed.\nOn an equal division of opinion among the judges, of the Supreme Court of Canada the judgment appealed from stood affirmed in so far as it held that the movable property situated outside the limits of Quebec forming part of the estate of C. L. C. was not liable to such taxation.\nAPPEALS from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming, with a variation, the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, by which the respondents' petition of right was maintained.\nThe respondents, by their petition of right, claimed the refund of succession duties paid by them and exacted by the Government of Quebec in virtue of the statutes of the Province of Quebec in respect of duties exigible on the transmission of property in consequence of the death of the owner. The amount demanded was $31,492.02, of which $10,545.55 had been paid in respect of part of the succession of the late Charlotte L. Cotton, and the remainder in respect of part of the succession of the late Henry H. Cotton, her husband; the claim was made on the ground that these portions of the estates consisted of personal property which was locally situate in the State of Massachusetts, one of the United States of America, and, consequently, not subject to the imposition of succession duty by the provincial legislature.\nThe Superior Court maintained the petition of right as to the whole of the amount demanded, with interest from the date of the institution of the action. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench this judgment was affirmed, in effect, by the judgment now appealed from, which merely modified the judgment of the Superior Court by deducting therefrom the amount of $393, and ordering that each party should bear its own costs. The ground on which the deduction was made was that the Superior Court, for the purpose of ascertaining on what amount the tax was payable, should have deducted a proportionate amount of the debts due by the deceased owners of the property in question from that part of the property which was locally situate in the United States of America, instead of deducting the entire indebtedness from that part of the estates locally situate in the Province of Quebec.\nOn the present appeal the respondents gave notice of cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, in so far as it varied the judgment of the Superior Court, on the grounds that, if the only property subject to duty was that locally situate in the Province of Quebec, the amount of the debts should be deducted only from the property so liable to taxation; that, if it were otherwise, the value of the property situate outside that province would be affected and lessened in value, and that, as their claims had been sustained in the Court of King's Bench, notwithstanding the reduction in the amount of the judgment, the costs on the appeal to that court should have been allowed to them.\nThe questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nT. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question for the opinion of the court in this case is: If a person domiciled in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec dies leaving movable property such as bonds and debentures \"locally situate\" in Boston, Massachusetts, one of the United States of America, can that part of the estate be considered or taken into account in calculating the amount of the duty to be levied on the transmission of his estate under the succession duty law of that province? For the meaning of the term \"locally situate\" see Dicey, Conflict of Laws (2 ed.), p. 309; Hanson, Death Duties (6 ed.), pp. 108-109; and notes of my brother Anglin.\nThere are in fact two estates in connection with which this question arises here: that of Mrs. Cotton and that of her husband, H. H. Cotton; and the action is to recover from the Government the amounts paid as succession duty on both estates through error of law, as is alleged. Each of the cases presents a different state of facts for consideration, and the statutes relied on by the Crown as applicable to the two successions are not in terms identical.\nDealing first with the succession of Mrs. Cotton, it appears that she died in Boston, on the 11th of April, 1902, having made her will there on the 17th of April, 1900, disposing of a fairly large estate in bonds and debentures, the bulk of which was, at the time of her death, locally situate in Boston. In the interval between the making of the will and her death, the deceased's husband bought a house, at Cowansville, in the Province of Quebec, where he was born, and he had actually taken up his residence there, although some of the winter months were spent in Boston. After his wife's death, the husband continued to reside at Cowansville, to which place he brought her body for interment, and there he died. I accept the finding of the courts below that Mrs. Cotton was, at the time of her death, domiciled in the Province of Quebec and that her estate devolved under the law of that domicile, but, in my opinion, the statute imposing the duty levied by the Crown does not extend to that portion of her estate which was locally situate beyond the limits of the province. The statute reads:\u2014\nAll transmissions, owing to death, of the property in usufruct or enjoyment of movable and immovable property in the province, shall be liable to the following taxes, calculated upon the value of the property transmitted, after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of the death.\nTaken in their strict and literal meaning the words \"movable and immovable property in the province\" relate prim\u00e0 facie to property locally situate within the limits of the province and, as my brother Anglin says, that such was the intention of the legislature is made superabundantly clear by reference to the French version of the statute where the words used are\ntoute transmission par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, etc., de biens mobiliers ou immobiliers situ\u00e9s dans la province, etc.\nIf these words \"situ\u00e9s dans la province\" had been omitted and the language of the French law (art. 4, L. 22, Frim. An. VII.) from which the Quebec Act is taken adhered to, then all the French authors say that by application of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam the meaning of the word \"movable\" might be enlarged so as to include all personal estate where-ever it might be; but if effect is to be given to the language of the legislature, the result must be to say that by inserting the qualifying words \"in the province\" after the words \"movable and immovable property\" it was intended to exclude the application of that maxim and limit the impost to such movable property as, at the date of the death, would be found within the jurisdiction. The question on this branch of the case is not as to the power, but as to the intention of the legislature. Acts imposing death duties, like all other taxing statutes, must be construed strictly and in favour of the subject. Hanson's Death Duties ( 6 ed. ), p. 78. I do not overlook the fact that in the declaration to be furnished the collector of provincial revenue the description and real value of all the property transmitted, whether movable or immovable and wherever situate, is to be supplied to that official; but no inference is deducible from this obligation which would extend the meaning to be given the section imposing the tax.\nDealing now with the estate of the husband, who died on December 26th, 1906, at Cowansville, in the Province of Quebec, having, by his will made there in notarial form, instituted the respondents his testamentary executors. A large amount of bonds and debentures physically situate in the United States formed part of that estate at its devolution. In the interval between the death of the wife and that of the husband, the law of Quebec was amended so as to subject to succession duty all movable property transmitted\nwherever situate, of persons having their domicile (or residing) in the Province of Quebec at the time of their death.\nMr. Justice White speaking for the court in Knowlton v. Moore[2], at p. 56, after making a careful review of the law concerning death duties in ancient and modern times, says:\u2014\nTax laws of this nature in all countries rest, in their essence upon the principle that death is the generating source from which the particular taxing power takes its being and that it is the power to transmit or the transmission from the dead to the living on which such taxes are immediately rested;\nand Fuzier Herman, vo. \"Successions,\" No. 1899, says:\u2014\nIl suit de l\u00e0 que le droit de succession est d\u00fb chaque fois qu'il y a mutation, c'est-\u00e0-dire dessaisissement par mort, sans qu'il y a\u00eet \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper du titre en vertu duquel l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 est d\u00e9volue. C'est donc le d\u00e9c\u00e8s qui est le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du droit proportionnel. De m\u00eame que, en droit civil (art. 718), les successions s'ouvrent par la mort, de m\u00eame, en droit fiscal, c'est le d\u00e9c\u00e8s qui, en op\u00e9rant la mutation des biens, donne ouverture \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance du Tr\u00e9sor. Ainsi que l'exprime un arr\u00eat de la cour de cassation, l'imp\u00f4t de mutation par d\u00e9c\u00e8s \"a le caract\u00e8re d'une dette naissant avec l'ouverture de la succession et inh\u00e9rente d\u00e8s ce moment \u00e0 tous les biens qui la composent.\"\nIn France, and the Quebec statute is an adaptation of the law of that country, it is universally accepted that the power to transmit or the transmission or receipt of property by death is the subject levied upon by all death duties. Fuzier Herman, vo. \"Successions,\" No. 2028. The duty is not levied upon individual items of property which together make up the estate, but upon the transmission or devolution of the succession. The civil law of Quebec, in the light of which this statute must be read, is based upon the\nold Roman legal theory of universal succession or succession as a unit by means of which, the legal personality of the deceased passed over to his heir.\nArticle 596 of the Civil. Code says that succession means \"the universality of the things transmitted\" and that universality devolves at the domicile of the deceased (art. 600 C.C.). By the law of that domicile, the title under which the heirs receive the estate, the movable property of the deceased, wherever situate, is governed. In such a case the maxim of mobilia ossibus inhcerunt finds its application, as my brother Duff clearly demonstrates in his notes, to which I would venture to add two authorities taken from the French law. In a note to Dalloz, 1897,1,139, M. Sarrut says:\nEn vertu de la fiction mobilia ossibus inh\u0153rent l'universalit\u00e9 juridique d'une succession mobili\u00e8re est cens\u00e9e adh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la personne du d\u00e9funt; or le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait, en droit., au lieu de son domicile l\u00e9gal.\nPothier, Introduction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, vol. 1, p. 7, No. 24.\nLes choses qui n'ont aucune situation sont les meubles corporels, les cr\u00e9ances mobili\u00e8res, les rentes constitu\u00e9es, autres que celles dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ci-dessus parl\u00e9, quand m\u00eame elles auraient- un assignat sur quelque h\u00e9ritage: car cet assignat n'est qu'un accessoire. Toutes ces choses, qui n'ont aucune situation, suivent la personne \u00e0 qui elles appartiennent, et sont par cons\u00e9quent r\u00e9gies par la loi ou coutume qui r\u00e9git cette personne, c'est-\u00e0-dire, par celle du lieu de son domicile.\nTo sum up briefly, I am of opinion that the right or title to the bonds and debentures situate in Boston passed on his death from the deceased to his heirs in the Province of Quebec by virtue of the law of that province and all the movable property transmitted by that title is subject to the duty which the legislation which creates the title chooses to attach as a condition of the transmission on those who claim title by virtue of our law. Halsbury, vol. 13, p. 273, No. 373.\nLet me test the soundness of this construction of the law by reference to section 6 of the Act we are now considering. That section is in these words:\nNo transfer of the properties of any estate or succession shall be valid, nor shall any title vest in any person, if the taxes payable under this section have not been paid, and no executor, trustee, administrator, curator, heir or legatee shall consent to any transfers or payments of legacies, unless the said duties have been paid.\nPayment of the duty is a condition of the transfer and no title is vested until it is paid. If the executors or legatees sought to enforce their title to the bonds in Boston, it would be a good answer to their claim that not having paid the succession duty they had no title to the bonds. In which case, where would the title to that portion of the deceased's estate vest? If, therefore, the heirs must invoke the Quebec Act as their title, the condition subject to which that Act transmits the property to them \u2014 payment of legacy duties \u2014must be fulfilled. It is unnecessary to say that, in my opinion, this case is clearly distinguishable from the case of Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[3]. There is no question here of an attempt to tax property situate beyond the jurisdiction; the Quebec statute merely fixes the conditions subject to which it gives a good title to the property of the deceased. In a word, the tax is imposed as a condition of the devolution, a condition subject to which the heirs take title. The amount of the tax is fixed by reference to the aggregate value of the property and the degree of relationship of the successors to the deceased; but there is nothing in the law which prevents a government from taxing its own subjects as in this case on the basis of their foreign possessions. I would allow the main appeal as to the estate of H. H. Cotton.\nAs to the cross-appeals, the necessary result will be their dismissal, because that is the conclusion to which the opinions of the three members of the court who would allow the main appeal in the case of Mrs. Cotton would necessarily lead and it, therefore, becomes unnecessary for me to express any opinion on the merits of these cross-appeals.\nThe conclusion, therefore, to which I have come is that as to the estate of Mrs. Cotton the appeal should be dismissed and that it should be allowed as to the estate of Mr. H. H. Cotton.\nAs to costs, the costs of the Superior Court should be paid by the Crown; the costs in appeal and here should be paid by the estate of Cotton, as also the costs on the cross-appeals.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014In the case of Woodruff et al. v. Attorney-General for Ontario[4], the Judicial Committee held that there was no sound distinction in point of law between the two transactions or assignments of property in question in that case. As said in their judgment:\u2014\nThey were both concerned with movable property locally situate outside the province and the delivery under which the transferees took title was equally in both cases made in the State of New York.\nHad the judgment stopped there it would seem reasonably clear that the grounds of their Lordships' decision that the Ontario succession duties were not recoverable in that case, were the local situation of the property outside the province, coupled with a delivery of the property under which the transferees took title also in the State of New York. Under these facts and circumstances they did not agree with the Court of Appeal for Ontario which held that the assignment of 1902 fell within the Ontario Act imposing succession duties because it was, as that court held, a transfer of property made in contemplation of death to take effect only on and after the death of the transferor. As I understand the judgment of the Privy Council, up to this point, it did not matter whether the assignment so made was or was not made in contemplation of death and only to take effect on and after death. These facts, as found by the Court of Appeal, were immaterial in their judgment because, as they go on to say,' \"the pith of the matter\" was the limitation in Canada's \"Constitutional Act\" of the powers of taxation given to the local legislatures, which limitation they said made\nany attempt to levy a tax on property locally situate outside the province beyond their competence.\nThis broad general statement it will be seen takes no account of the fact that such property may have been transferred abroad by the testator or intestate in his lifetime in contemplation of death and so as to avoid the succession duties. Such a factor as the transfer of the property abroad, which is given prominence to in the preceding part of the judgment, has no room in this part, where the Judicial Committee is apparently pointedly stating their opinion of the limitation placed upon the powers of the local legislatures in the grant to them of the power of \"direct taxation within the province.\" The fact of there having been an assignment of such property made abroad by the deceased in his lifetime in contemplation of death is in this statement of the limited character of the powers conferred on the local legislatures absolutely ignored as irrelevant, and the general proposition laid down that\nany attempt to levy a tax on property locally situate outside the province is beyond their jurisdiction,\nthat is, the jurisdiction of the local legislatures.\nBut the Judicial Committee do not stop there. If they had it might be contended that the language of their judgment, though broad and general enough to cover other cases, must be construed as applicable only to such facts as they were in that case dealing with, namely, where movable property was\nlocally situate outside the province and the delivery under which the transferees took title was also made outside the province.\nThe latter words, however, of their judgment seem to render it impossible to attach such a limited meaning to the judgment, because they go on to deal with the arguments advanced by Sir Robert Finlay for the Attorney-General of Ontario. His argument, as reported, was to the effect that the legislation was intra vires the legislature because the tax was not a tax on property but one on the devolution or succession, that it was imposed on persons beneficially entitled by virtue of the will of the deceased or by virtue of the testamentary transfers made by him in his lifetime to take effect at his death. That these per-sons taxed were resident in the province and were directly liable for the duty.\nDealing with this argument the single remark the Judicial Committee make is:\u2014 Directly or indirectly, the contention of the Attorney-General involves the very thing which the legislature had forbidden to the province, taxation of property not within the province.\nSuch a remark would be pointless if they had held the transaction of 1902 to have been a bon\u00e0 fide absolute assignment and not to have been of the character contended for by Sir Robert Finlay and found by the judgment in appeal before their Lordships, namely, one made in contemplation of death and only to take effect on and after death. The latter construction of the transfer had to be reached, otherwise there was no ground for discussion as to the property being taxable under the Act. The limitation upon the powers of the provincial legislatures to levy direct taxation within the province, rendered it unnecessary for their Lordships, as they said,\nto discuss the effect of the various sub-sections of section 4 of the \"Succession Duty Act,\" on which so much stress had been laid in the argument before them.\nIt is, therefore, evident to me that the judgment of the Privy Council in this case of Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[5] is of a wider and broader application than contended for by the appellant in this appeal, and that it is conclusive upon us in the appeal now before us. The distinction attempted to be made by Mr. Dorion, at the first hearings between the two statutes of Quebec and Ontario levying these succession duties, namely, that the former expressly makes the taxation payable upon the transmission of the property, while the latter places it upon the property itself, is not a substantial distinction. In my judgment, under both statutes, the tax is one not on the property, but on its devolution or succession. (See Lovitt v. Attorney-General for Nova Scotia[6]) But no such, distinction can be successfully invoked to take this appeal out of the binding effect of the judgment of the Privy Council in Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[7]. That judgment was not based upon the mode in which the Legislature of Ontario attempted to levy the succession duties there in, dispute, but upon the denial of the existence of any constitutional power in the legislature either directly or indirectly to impose such duties upon property not within the province. The head-note of the case correctly sums up what it really did decide, namely, that,\nit is ultra vires the legislature of the province to tax property not within the province; Held, accordingly, that the \"Succession Duty Act\" (R.S.C. 1897, ch. 24) does not include within its scope movable properties locally situate outside the Province of Ontario which it was alleged that the testator, a domiciled inhabitant of the province has transferred in his lifetime with intent that the transfers should only take effect after his death.\nIf I am right in my construction of this Woodruff decision, it is binding in this appeal, as the foreign bonds, stocks and other securities owned at her death by Mrs. Cotton, and at his death by Henry H. Cotton, and upon which, or the transmission of which, it was contended by the Crown in right of the Province of Quebec succession duties were payable under the provincial statute, were, at the times of the respective deaths of Mrs. Cotton and Henry H. Cotton, situate in Boston, Massachusetts, and not in the Province of Quebec, and had never been, so far as the record shews, physically situate in that province.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed. As regards the cross-appeal, I think this should be allowed. The Court of King's Bench modified the judgment of the Superior Court by deducting the debts of the estate from all the assets and not from the assets in the province only. I think the Superior Court was right in holding that the debts owing by the estate in the province should be deducted from the assets in the province only. In estimating the amount upon which succession duties should be paid, the executor or the courts have nothing to do with assets outside of the province which were beyond their jurisdiction, and which it is ultra vires of the legislature to tax. The statute says, section 1191(6), that these succession duties are to be calculated\nupon the value of the property transmitted after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of the death.\nWhat the legislature was dealing with and all that it had power to deal with was the property within the province\u2014just as the reference to debts had to do exclusively with debts due in the province. If I am correct in my construction of Woodruff's Case[8] in holding that property \"locally situate outside of the province\" was not liable to the succession duties, then it must, I think, be held that the words \"property transmitted\" in section 1191 (6) had no reference to property outside of the province, but had exclusive reference to the property within the province which, and which alone, the legislature in the matter of these duties had power to deal with.\nI would, therefore, allow the cross-appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAs regards costs, the respondent should be allowed costs in all the courts and costs upon his cross-appeal in this court. The judgment in the court of appeal not allowing him costs in that court was based upon the assumption, wrongful to my mind, that the judgment of the Superior Court should be substantially modified. As I think the Court of King's Bench wrong upon that point, I would allow the respondent his costs of the appeal in that court as well as in this court, and also his costs in the cross-appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The issue raised herein is of very great importance. It involves the question of the interpretation and construction of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" section 92, sub-section 2, assigning to the exclusive power of the provincial legislatures\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes;\nand of the interpretation and construction of an Act of the Quebec Legislature professedly acting within said power enacting that\nall transmissions, owing to death, of the property in, or the usufruct or enjoyment of, movable and immovable property in the province, shall be liable to the following taxes, calculated upon the value of the property transmitted, after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of the death:\nor and as it now stands amended in 6 Edw. VII. ch. 11 (1906) (of Quebec).\nThe first question thus raised is whether or not this enactment is a competent exercise .of the power given by the preceding enactment.\nBefore passing to the solution of this question, I wish to consider and dispose of the suggestions made by counsel for the respondent relative to the bearing of the amending section 1191(c) and three or four following sections of said Quebec statute.\nThe contention set up is that these several later sections shew that it is not the transmission of property that is taxed, but the property itself.\nInasmuch as section 1191(c) of the Quebec Act is a declaration of the meaning of the word \"property\" where it occurs in the Quebec Act above referred to and quoted from, I am unable to see how it can affect the question at all if the act of transmission within the province is the subject of taxation and a proper basis therefor. And still less can the following sections thereof affect the question raised here, for it is frankly admitted by counsel that none of the property now in question here is of any of the kinds covered by these later sections.\nOf course it may be a fair argument that finding these sections in the Act taxing the transmission of property, stated in the terms they respectively are stated, it is in truth a taxation of property that is involved. Whatever weight may be given thereto it seems to me impossible to reach such express language as quoted above as imposing taxation on anything but the transmission.\nThe case of Lambe v. Manuel[9] seems conclusive upon that point. In the language of Lord Macnagh-ten therein, page 72,\nthe taxes are imposed by those Acts \u2014 this being one \u2014 on movable property are imposed only on property which the successor claims under and by virtue of Quebec law.\nAnother argument to support this contention, of property being the subject of the tax was made for appellant is this that immediately after transmission or granting of probate the personal representative is to be recouped in a specified way varying according to the distinction or character of each legacy. It seems to me this argument is more plausible than sound.\nIt is the first transmission that is in question and not the later transmission taking effect abroad as the result thereof.\nI infer from the evidence adduced that it was erroneously supposed to be contended that the later transmission was had in view by the statute.\nNeither the requirements of the rules of corporate bodies in which stock may have been held by deceased, nor those of a foreign state relative to the enforcing of claims therein are what is meant by the transmission named in the statute. It is that transmission, and only that, which vests any right, whatever it may be, in him getting by force of the law of Quebec, title to the property of deceased, that is meant by the use of the word in this statute. The purview of the Act shews that, if any doubt could otherwise exist.\nI, with deference, doubt what Mr, Geoffrion seemed to concede resting upon the decision of Mr. Justice Pagnuelo in In re Denoon[10]. The words of the Act are strong and the legislature competent to change the old law or keep its operative effect in suspense.\nIn another point of view the argument is met by the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[11], where an analogous argument was put up.\nThe tax there had to be determined by the paid-up capital of the bank and the number of offices or places of business it had in the province.\nThere, as here, the questions of direct or indirect taxation, the power over banks as such resting with the Dominion, and their rights to carry on business independently of provincial authority, and a foreign head office owning and controlling everything, were all relied upon.\nThe tax was held to be direct and the mode of fixing it was but the measure to be applied for ascertaining what the tax should be.\nHere the tax is measured by the amount of property to be transmitted under certain conditions varying in each case just as in the cases of banks and other companies in that case.\nCounsel for appellant then invokes the authority of the case of Woodruff v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[12], to shew that personal property actually situated in a foreign state cannot be taxed by a provincial legislature. The Ontario Act, R.S.O., ch. 24, is as fundamentally different from the Quebec Act we are called upon herein to consider, as such Acts can well be from each other. Section 4, sub-section (a) of the former is as follows:\u2014\n(a) All property situate within this province, and any interest therein or income therefrom, whether the deceased person owning or entitled thereto was domiciled in Ontario at the time of his death or was domiciled elsewhere, passing either by will or intestacy.\"\nLet any one compare the two for a moment and what I have just stated seems clear.\nBefore proceeding further it is proper to inquire whether notwithstanding the radical differences between the two Acts it has, as is contended, in truth been decided, by the Privy Council in the said Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[13], that the provincial legislature cannot tax a transmission in and by Quebec law of personal property outside the province, and that the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam so much relied upon relative to the laws of other countries, cannot avail in this case.\nIf that was the real issue raised in that case, and it has been therein definitely decided, there is an end of the matter. If it was not the real issue, and the decision did not necessarily involve the decision of such issue, then it cannot bind us.\nI may at once say that the statement of fact in the following sentence of the judgment, seems to me to dispose of the question of the fundamental grounds the judgment proceeds upon.\nThey (i.e., the two transactions there in question) both were concerned with movable property locally situate outside the province and the delivery under which the transferees took title was equally in both cases made in the State of New York.\nSurely that is as wide apart from what is involved here as can well be. The title upon which the attempted taxation herein rests arose in Quebec by virtue of the transmission its laws give vitality to. It is upon the act of giving force and validity thereto that the taxation is imposed. Whether such transmission is taxable or not and the legal ambit thereof is entirely another question. But it is not involved in the denial of a right by virtue of such a statute as the Ontario Act to tax the property itself when in, or after taken to, a foreign country, and has been in the lifetime of the deceased there transferred to another, and thenceforward remains in the foreign state the property of such transferee.\nThe Ontario Act was so framed that it did not give rise to the very question raised here. When the interpretation of that Act was called for, in said case, the first subject calling for consideration was the scope of legislation whereof the keynote was the subsection I have just quoted. It purports to tax property situate within the province and in taxing property, not the owner in respect thereof, or the transmission thereof, lies the radical difference between the Acts there in question and what we have to pass upon. In trying to arrive at the correct interpretation naturally the taxing power of the province was referred to. An obiter dictum appears relative thereto that read in relation to the situation of the property there in question and the facts relative thereto might well be attributed thereto. But it by no means proves it is to be taken in the wide sense now contended for here, in relation to another set of facts giving rise to other legal considerations. The. judgment reached does not need its support nor does it seem the basis thereof.\nAnd that is made abundantly clear when the judgment expressly refers to the case of Blackwood v. The Queen[14] as containing the reasoning which covers the. case and I infer was in fact adopted in disposing of it.\nIf ever a case was decided on what was supposed by the court to have been the intention of the legislature, as expressed in its enactment, that was the case of Blackwood v. The Queen[15]. The entire reasoning of the judgment was elaborated in order to the making of that clear. The conclusion is thus summed up therein:\u2014\nAll these things, the person to pay, the occasion for payment, and the time for payment, point to the Victorian assets as the sole subject of the tax.\nWhilst impliedly admitting the power of the colony of Victoria to go much further by using language shewing such a purpose, it would have been idle to elaborate as was done if the power in Victoria did not exist. All the case called for in such event was, if so, to declare accordingly.\nThe court adds that the reasons which led English courts to confine probate duty to the property directly affected by the probate, notwithstanding the sweeping general words of the statute which imposed it, apply in full force to the Victoria statute and the case arising upon it; yet the court made it quite clear that said reasons were only illustrative of how such Acts had been treated and their interpretation might form a guide for reaching the meaning of the Victoria statute.\nFor in the early part of the judgment the court points out that the discussion relative to the terms \"probate duty\" and \"legacy duty\" could only be used as descriptive of two classes of statutes familiar to English lawyers and adds: \"If used for any more exact application they are misleading.\"\nNow passing that we have the following declaration in the Quebec Act as amended which clears all this up if doubt ever existed. The amending clause was apparently designed to clear it up whether needed or not.\nThe clause is section 1191(c), as follows:\u2014\n1191(c). The word \"property\" within the meaning of this section shall include all property, whether movable or immovable, actually situate or owing within the province, whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the debt is payable within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province, and all movables, wherever situate, of persons having their domicile, or residing, in the Province of Quebec at the time of their death.\nThis is most explicit as to what is to be covered by the transmission to be taxed and most comprehensive. Perhaps it comprehends too much, but as to that we are not concerned here, for the case now in hand of the transmission of the estate of the late Mr. H. H. Cotton who was domiciled at his death in the province, falls within the latter part of the clause just quoted and is preceded by language evidently intended to reach as far as the powers possessed might go to express the intention not found in the Victoria Act or the Ontario Act.\nNor are we concerned with the amendment since made to rectify what were possibly too extensive claims. Neither of these amendments is retrospective.\nThe clause should be held good for that which the legislature had the power to enact when the excess of authority, if any, was as here easily severable from what was ultra vires or capable of being read as expressing only what was intra vires.\nI am only concerned thus far to see if there was an expression of intention such as was sought for but could not be found in the Victoria Act. For the present I assume, but by no means say, the language needed clarification.\nIt seems to me there can in regard to this Act thus amended be no doubt of its intention to impose a tax on the transmission in Quebec by force of its law, of the personal estate wherever situate.\nThe next and most important question which arises here is this: Does such express intention limited within what is necessary to cover the case of the transmission of the late Mr. H. H. Cotton's estate wheresoever situate, come within what it is competent for the Legislature of Quebec to enact?\nThis question starts several others. In the first place the taxability of any transmission of property in any case; the principle upon which it can be rested; and \u00abthe kind of property respecting which its transmission may be taxed. I cannot think any doubt can exist as to the right to tax the transmission. The basis of such right as well expressed in Winans v. Attorney-General[16] by Lord Loreburn, page 30:\u2014\nIn both cases the property received the full protection of British laws, which is a constant basis of taxation, and can only be transferred from the deceased to other persons by a British court.\nThe basis of taxation and for transfer from the deceased to others is not exactly in the same way here in evidence, as there, but as to transfer is fully more so. The deceased had property in the province for which his executor could get no title or reach it without probate or authentic will (whichever happened to be the case), and that could only be got upon the conditions determined by law. Even if one of these conditions happened in the event to be most onerous, and possibly uncollectable by an action taken by the Crown, I fail to see how the respondents can now and here attack it.\nAgain, the Lambe v. Manuel[17] case, the converse of this upon the same statute before the amendments referred to, proceeds upon the recognition of the title got by the transfer or transmission involved in the grant of probate in another province where the deceased had his domicile at death.\nIt seems to me to give impliedly just that recognition of the grant relative to goods in another province which I have already suggested.\nIt may at least prim\u00e0 facie be here given in a limited sense to the mobilia sequuntur personam rule.\nIn the next place arises the question of the power of the Quebec Legislature confined as already mentioned within the limits assigned by the \"British North America Act\" regarding direct tax and its imposition within the province.\nGreat stress is laid upon a passage in the judgment in the Woodruff case apparently denying the power of taxation of property beyond the province.\nIf I am right in pointing out as above that the court was proceeding upon the statement of facts quoted above, and the peculiarity of these facts, then the expression can only fairly be held to relate to the position of affairs at the death of the testator in that case.\nThe property had been passed in a foreign state to others and the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam could not on such a state of facts be applied in any of the various ways it has been made applicable in law.\nThe language of the Ontario Act did not permit of that being done on the facts dealt with in that case.\nAnd as already suggested the expression relied upon might have a relevancy thereto, but cannot be fairly extended to something else not needed for the disposal of that case.\nI cannot think the expression was intended to mean more, but if so it was obiter dicta.\nEverything else aside from that partakes of obiter dicta, which, of course, must be given that respectful consideration due at all times to eminent authority. And giving that it is our duty, if an examination of the principles of law to be applied do not seem to us to permit of the application of what is expressed in obiter dicta, to say so, or at all events not feel bound thereby.\nWith great respect, I cannot assent to the said obiter dicta or its apparent assumption that \"direct taxation within the province\" necessarily means only taxation in respect of property physically within the province.\nCounsel for respondents in his argument relied so much upon these observations it seemed as if his whole hope rested therein and the courts below have gone thereon entirely.\nA man may be domiciled within a province and be made answerable for taxes imposed upon him in respect of property outside the province, but over which the laws of the province may have given him the only foundation he can have for dominion or legal possession.\nFor example, a man domiciled within a province may build railway cars and lease them to one of the railway companies running into the United States, and sometimes have them at home and sometimes abroad. Can he not be taxable in respect of such property?\nThe Canadian farmer may use land on each side of the line between this country and the United States and his flocks or herds may be driven from his house and farm steading in any one province to the end of his farm and pasture in the foreign state. Can he not be taxed for or in respect of such personal property? Is the right of taxation to be determined by the mere accident of where these cars, flocks or herds may be at a given time? Is the income derivable therefrom to depend also on such accident? Reason seems to say no. It is his domicile in the province that gives the power of taxation in his case validity.\nYet in taxing such property or the man in respect of such property, there is in a sense taxation of property which may be outside the province. The man is taxed and may be made to pay in respect of property abroad.\nIs it conceivable that the right of taxation of a multitude of other and especially commercial properties can depend on anything else than the domicile of the man answerable for the tax and who is enjoying all his rights or property therein by virtue of the legislation of his province and the contracts he has formed therein ? And for the protection of such rights should he not share part of the common expenses of such protection?\nThere are no doubt cases of personal property within a province owned by some one outside the province which can be taxed also.\nThen we have the income tax which forms no mean part of the aggregate municipal taxation. Yet it often rests upon no other foundation in law than the domicile of the man taxed.\nThe income tax has never been questioned. Yet the sources from which the income flows may be in every quarter of the globe.\nThe legislature of the province, where he thus earning it is domiciled, having had committed to it the exclusive power over property and civil rights and imposed upon it the duty of protecting him therein, has also the power of direct taxation to meet the expenses of discharging such duty. Surely the fact that the income may never have reached home and may be left abroad to earn more, is not to determine the power of imposing such a tax.\nLest it may be said taxation of income is indirect, I submit what was said in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[18], at page 582, in the course of the judgment dealing with the power of direct taxation given the provinces. It is as follows:\u2014\nIt would deny the character of a direct tax to the income tax of this country, which is always spoken of as such, and is generally looked upon as a direct tax of the most obvious kind; and it would run counter to the common understanding of men on this subject, which is one main clue to the meaning of the legislature.\nIf, therefore, we may safely assume an income tax derivable from foreign ventures and not necessarily reaped and brought into the home custody of him liable to such tax, why should we in this case be confined to the test of the particular thing being physically within the province as the true limit of the power of taxation within a province?\nIt is to be observed also that the same court, in Blackwood v. The Queen[19], thus expressed its views in reference to the power of taxation. It said at page 96:\u2014\nThere is nothing in the law of nations which prevents a Government from taxing its own subjects on the basis of their foreign possessions. It may be inconvenient to do so. The reasons against doing so may apply more strongly to real than to personal estate. But the question is one of discretion, and is to be answered by the statutes under which each state levies its taxes, and not by mere reference to the laws which regulate successions to real and' personal property.\nThis power, I submit, is that of direct taxation. It is not said that the extreme exercise suggested as possible would be a proper exercise of such power. It could not be exercised over any one domiciled in another country or province. But by every principle of convenience and reason relative to the partition of the powers thus existing and being apportioned between the respective jurisdictions of dominion and provinces, there is nothing that forbids and much that leads to the conclusion that it was intended to assign to the provinces whatever powers of direct taxation a province or state could properly exercise and usually exercised or had the power to exercise.\nDirect taxation, except for local purposes, had never been resorted to by the old Province of Canada, and, so far as I am aware and as it is generally understood by the term, has not yet been resorted to by the Dominion, save possibly by the excise duties.\nThe Dominton quite consistently therewith might also by virtue of the power assigned it possibly resort thereto. But when the conditions existent relative to direct taxation were such as to induce the belief that its resort thereto by the Dominion might only be in a very remote contingency, why should we assume that the usual and general power was not that assigned to the provinces which alone were likely to exercise it; and that it was not intended to enable them to exercise it in their respective dealings with their own citizens?\nThere is nothing to indicate that the general power declared as above to be possible, was reserved for the Dominion only, or that some implied limitation was intended, reserving and preserving part of it in a dormant condition, only to be exercised on extreme occasions, or for special purposes. In contradistinction to the power extending over all persons and given the dominion to resort to any mode of taxation, it was quite natural in assigning direct taxation to express it as appears.\nI submit, what was intended was that which the language indicates, when we have regard to the nature of the Act which consists of a concise description of a number of enumerated powers.\nIt is an extremely improbable thing that for the mere purposes of raising a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, any abuse such a power may be in this particular regard susceptible of, was dreamed of as a thing to be guarded against, by 'any one. If it had, we would likely have found other expression given thereto.\nMoreover, we must bear in mind that of those federated provinces, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had long enjoyed just as complete powers in this regard as the colony of Victoria of which the legislation was in question in the judgment I have referred to. It does not seem to have occurred to the court in making the remarks I have quoted, that any distinction then existed between the powers of that colony relative to such taxation and those of any other country.\nAre we to assume that these other provinces surrendered in this regard what in theory they had enjoyed up to Confederation? The same is true of the old Province of Canada; but as it was divided into two provinces, the illustration drawn therefrom is not so direct.\n\"Direct taxation within a province\" and \"direct taxation of property within a province\" are, I submit, not interchangeable terms. It is the former term that is used, and if the meaning of the latter term was what it purposed surely it would 'have been so expressed.\nAnd when we find that the Privy Council has not adhered to the literal expression of the same power by limiting it to the \"revenue for provincial purposes\/' but has heretofore found in that, despite the words used, power to delegate it to corporate municipal and school boards, I do not think we should seek in another spirit of interpretation, relative to words in the same sentence, to restrict the power by something not expressed and to something quite unusual. Parliament was not accurately defining the powers of a petty corporation to be created, but designating in general terms where that line was to be drawn in dividing the legislative powers of a great state. It must be borne in mind that the legacy duty had long been in force in England and that the \"Succession Duty Act\" had been passed some twelve years before the \"British North America Act,\" and that both, within the memory of those transacting affairs, had been the subject of judicial construction whereby the line was drawn at where the rule mobilia sequuntur personam would put it. See Thomson v. The Advocate-General[20]; and Wallace v. Attorney-General[21]; each dealing with the respective Acts referred to. And to this day the rule said maxim implies has been applied in the Manuel Case[22] I have referred to, to govern in one way the construction of this very Act now in question before its amendment. The principle being so declared the converse case surely must be held arid applied herein.\nOr is this interpretation in Lambe v. Manuel22 when restrictive in its operation to be all right, and in the converse case all wrong?\nThe view held in Wallace v. Attorney-General[23] may since have varied by statute but that does not affect the line of argument I suggest.\nAgain I shall not readily impute to the framers of the \"British North America Act\" the purpose of so limiting the powers of a province in this regard that the economic results of such limitations inevitably would be, by so limiting its taxing power, to drive a large portion of capital owned by those domiciled in a province to use it in a foreign country.\nIn conclusion it seems to me the man domiciled in a province is liable to such direct taxation for the specified purposes of provincial revenue as may be usually, exercised over him for the like purpose in any other state.\nWhen living he is liable to taxation upon his income derivable from his investments abroad, and if the legislature sees fit all else he has abroad, and when he is dead the transmission of his estate in so far as it requires the protection and support of the law ( as in Quebec under the principles of the Civil Law or Code) the sanction or authority of the province exercised by or through the ordinary channels it has created for the purpose can only be obtained upon the terms the province has seen fit to enact as to the condition of giving that legal support or needed sanction or authority.\nHowever much all I have advanced by way of illustration relative to the taxing power may be subject to limitation or reservation, I am unable to see how or by what process it is possible to compel a province to give that sanction save on its own terms.\nThe will of the late Mr. Cotton was made in Quebec, where he undoubtedly was domiciled when it was made and at his death, and his will rested for its validity on the laws of Quebec, and was expressly made subject to the conditions imposed by this statute before it could obtain any force or effect.\nThe respondents have not shewn that in respect of this estate there was any mistake made in that regard or that the securities in respect of which, or upon the basis of the value of which, they paid this tax did not, or rather respondents in order to acquire title thereto did not, require this sanction.\nI can conceive of a case wherein a foreign state or another province may have expressly provided for a statutory or other representative of a deceased person who in life was domiciled elsewhere, getting his personal property situate within its jurisdiction without any evidence of what had taken place in the jurisdiction of his late domicile. This, however, is not in accord with the known international law relative to personal property.\nPrima facie his personal property had according to the legal maxim mobilia sequuntur personam its location in the province where he was in life domiciled at the time of his death. And fully agreeing in and duly observing all that has been said in the case of Blackwood v. The Queen[24], relative to the interpretation of legislation which deals with personal property or estate by an Act of this kind not warranting the application of the said maxim to interpret the statute which does not make clear the purpose of its covering by the application of the said maxim all beyond the state of his domicile I yet think when the legislature has expressed a clear intention to cover all that, then the maxim may well be taken as a starting point of presumption which the plaintiff in a case such as this to recover back must rebut if it can be rebutted.\nWhether or not because of another form of law and another mode of thought than ruled the minds of the framers of the Victoria Act dealt with in that case, the word transmission is used and a more direct and comprehensive result is reached.\nThose enjoying the benefits of the transmission by virtue of Quebec law and Quebec courts must pay for or upon the transmission.\nWe had the Attorney-General for Quebec v. Reed[25], in the first but not on second argument, pressed upon us, but the respondents' factum still presents it as covering the alternative argument that if it was not property that was being taxed, then it was not direct, but indirect taxation.\nIn a like case I would feel bound to follow this authority, but fortunately the reasoning it proceeded upon and ground given in support thereof,, have since been revised in the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[26] case, by the same court and relieves from any embarrassment which otherwise might have been felt.\nI would add that to my mind if we imposed no taxes but those which would not fall in part at least on someone else than he first paying, we never would be troubled with taxes.\nNo one possessing clearness of vision can imagine that a single tax upon land is not in part borne by others than the land owner who pays it.\nIts payment or the burden of its payment has to be reckoned with and met by every member of society. Its simplicity is attractive.\nIt is admitted the probate of the late Mrs. Cotton's will executed in Boston was first applied for and got in Quebec.\nAnd her husband as the executor of her will obeyed that law, concluded he was, and consequently his wife must be held to have been domiciled in Quebec at the time of her death.\nI am unable to see how in face of the proceedings at the time the declarations made then and upon which the Court of Probate, if the will was probated as admitted, can be overturned by such evidence as now adduced. The amending section 1191(c) defining the word \"property\" is not applicable to her case, but as already suggested the statute did not, in my opinion, or my reading of the Lambe v. Manuel[27] case, need it.\nThe law of Quebec operated on each estate, was recognized as having so operated and I fail to see how his representatives can now claim to defeat the law in either case.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and doing so seems to render consideration of the cross-appeal needless.\nDuff J.\u2014-This appeal raises the question whether an Act of the Legislature of Quebec imposing certain duties described as \"succession duties\" in respect of transmissions of property under the law of that province in consequence of death is within the competence of that legislature in so far as such transmissions affect movable property locally situate outside that province.\nThe court below held the Act to be in that respect ultra vires conceiving itself to be governed in the determination of the point in question by the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[28].\nIn that case their Lordships had to pass upon the power of the Legislature of Ontario to impose a tax in respect of particular items of property locally situate outside the province on the occasion of a transfer of that property inter vivos effected by delivery of it in the State of New York.\nThe two cases seem to be clearly distinguishable; and I do not think we are relieved from considering the points raised on this appeal either by the decision itself in Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario28 or by any of the observations of the distinguished and lamented judge who delivered their Lordship's judgment. The learned judges in the courts below appear, if I may say so with the greatest respect, to have overlooked (in its bearing on this case) the fundamental difference in point of law between the devolution under the law of a province of a movable succession comprising movables having an extra-provincial situs and a transfer inter vivos of the title to particular movables (having such a situs) effected by delivery of them outside the province; and thus, as I conceive, to have missed the broad distinction between the question presented in this case and that pronounced upon in the decision by which they considered themselves to be governed.\nIt is a principle now generally recognized in countries where either the common law or the civil law prevails that as regards movables (wherever they may be situated in fact) a testate or intestate succession is for many purposes considered as an integer devolving under and governed by a single law \u2014 that namely which was the personal law of the decedent at the time of his death. \"The logical consequences of this general principle are kept intact by the application of the fiction mobilia ossibus inh\u0153rent.\" (Bar, Private International Law, sec. 362.) The principle is recognized by articles 6, 599 and 600 of the Civil Code of Quebec; the latter of which in effect adopts in this connection the rule of English law that the \"personal law\" is the law of the territory in which the decujus had his domicile.\nThis principle has never, by the law of England at all events, been regarded as excluding the authority of the law of the situs in respect of the particular movable items comprised in a succession; but it does involve the regulation by the law of the domicile of the distribution of the beneficial surplus belonging to the succession after the satisfaction of such claims as debts and expenses of administration. By that law then is determined the extent to which the property is subject to testamentary disposition and the conditions upon which the beneficiaries become entitled to accede to a share of the estate through such disposition or by operation of law; and among the generally recognized logical consequences of this principle (preserved as above mentioned by the maxim mobilia ossibus inh\u0153rent) is that the legislative authority of the domicile is acting within its proper sphere in assuming for public purposes a share of the surplus as a toll exacted from the beneficiaries by way of condition upon or as an incident of the accession to the benefits of the succession. Bar 254, 255; Wharton, 183, 184, 185; Dicey, 751, 752, 753; Eidman v. Martinez[29], at page 591; State of Maryland v. Dalrymple[30]; West, Inheritance Tax, 180 to 188.\nIn the fiscal legislation of the United Kingdom these principles have for nearly a century had full play. The enactments of the statute (55 Geo. III. ch. 184) imposing legacy duty were expressed in general terms comprehensive enough in themselves to apply to all persons and to all bequests of or payable out of personal property wherever situate. It was held in a well-known series of cases that the statute must be construed in accordance with the principle expressed in the maxim quoted above. In 1842 in Thomson v. Advocate-General[31] all the Lords (accepting the unanimous opinion of the judges) affirmed that the legislature must be supposed to have been legislating with reference to the principle mobilia sequuntur personam. In 1865 (in Wallace v. Attorney-General[32]) Lord Cranworth in construing the general words found in the Succession Duty Act\" of 1853, said that the incidence of legacy duties was regulated by the principle that such imposts should be charged upon benefits accruing under \"the laws of this country.\"\nNobody doubts, of course, the competence of the Imperial Parliament to pass legislation obligatory upon the courts of the Empire professing directly to affect property situate in foreign countries whatever the ownership under which it is held. But there are certain recognized principles of international conduct which in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary the courts will assume Parliament has not disregarded. It was in these cases considered to be no infringement of these rules that Parliament should impose legacy duties in respect of a succession composed in part of movables having an actual situs in a foreign country, provided the decedent had at the time of his death a domicile within the United Kingdom. This restriction of the duty to the estates of persons so domiciled was sufficient, as Lord Herschell said in Colquhoun v. Brooks[33], at page 503, to \"bring the matter dealt with within our territorial jurisdiction.\"\nI dwell upon this phrase of Lord Herschell\u2019s in order to emphasize the fact that this jurisdiction of the law-making authority of the domicile to tax the benefits derived from a movable succession as a whole has not been regarded in the courts of the United Kingdom as in any way resting on the extra-territorial authority which a sovereign power asserts in respect of its own subjects wherever they may be or as having any necessary relation to the nationality of the decedent. It is regarded simply as an exercise of the \"territorial jurisdiction.\" Therefore, no distinction has been drawn in this connection between the legislative authority of a colony invested with powers of self-government or of a state or province which is the member of a federation and that of a Parliament possessing unrestricted sovereign powers. In the numerous cases which have come before the Privy Council from the Australasian colonies touching the scope of enactments imposing death duties the constitutional competence of the legislatures of those colonies to proceed in these matters on the principle mobilia sequuntur personam seems never to have been doubted. Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[34]. Indeed, as Mr. Dicey has pointed out, since the Treaty of Independence with the American colonies in 1783, the policy of the Parliament of the United Kingdom has been to treat the colonies as in the matter of such taxation possessing fiscal independence. In the United States, it is perhaps superfluous to observe, in this respect the several States have been regarded as exercising an independent sovereignty.\nIs the taxing authority of a province of Canada affected by any restriction which makes such a province incompetent to apply these principles in framing its plan of taxation in respect of successions? Nobody can doubt that prior to Confederation the Province of Nova Scotia (let us say) possessed such authority. How far then was this authority curtailed by the \"British North America Act?\" I make no apology for quoting once again what one may perhaps call the classic passage in Lord Watson's judgment in Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[35], at pages 441 and 442, where he explains the constitutional relation in which the provinces stand to the Canadian Union.\nTheir Lordships do not think it necessary to examine, in minute detail, the provisions of the Act of 1867, which nowhere profess to curtail in any respect the rights and privileges of the Crown, or to disturb the relations then subsisting between the Sovereign and the provinces. The object of the Act was neither to weld the provinces into one, nor to subordinate provincial governments to a central authority, but to create a federal government, in which they should all be represented, entrusted with the exclusive administration of affairs in which they had a common interest, each province retaining its independence and autonomy. That object was accomplished by distributing, between the Dominion and the provinces, all powers executive and legislative, and all public property and revenues which had previously belonged to the provinces; so that the Dominion Governments should be vested with such of these powers, property, and revenues as were necessary for the due performance of its constitutional functions, and that the remainder should be retained by the provinces for the purposes of provincial governments. But, in so far as regards those matters which, by section 92, are specially reserved for provincial legislation, the legislation of each province continues to be free from the control of the Dominion, and as supreme as it was before the passing of the Act.\nThe subject of taxation was not under the Act exclusively assigned as a domain of legislation to either the Dominion or the provinces. The Dominion in that field is given unrestricted authority; the provinces have a concurrent, but more limited, authority. The scope of this provincial authority is defined by the words\ndirect taxation within the province for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nIn this case we are concerned only with the condition\" that the taxation shall be \"within the province.\" Some point, it is true, was raised on the words \"direct taxation;\" but since the decisions of the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[36], and Brewers and Maltsters Association of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario[37], it does not appear to be any longer open to question that duties imposed upon or in respect of benefits acquired under a will or intestacy are direct taxes within the meaning of the provision under discussion. The point for consideration then is this: Was the authority (which the provinces unquestionably possessed before Confederation) to impose duties upon or in respect of the benefits acquired under a succession comprising in part extra-territorial movables abrogated by the provision of the \"British North America Act\" which limits the provincial power of taxation to \"taxation within the province.\"\nThe question at issue cannot, I think, be fully appreciated without taking into account the authority of the provinces to legislate upon the subject of \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province.\" It is, of course, settled that the Dominion in the exercise of its authority relating to the subjects of legislation mentioned in section 91 may while acting within its own proper sphere legitimately pass laws which in their operation affect property and civil rights within the provinces; but it is equally well settled that over property and civil rights regarded as subjects of legislation in themselves the Dominion (except when acting under the specific provisions of that section) possesses no legislative authority. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[38], at pages 110 and 111. The subject of successions, the decujus being domiciled in Quebec, is one of those subjects which is within the exclusive authority of the Legislature of Quebec \u2014 in respect of which the authority of that legislature is in Lord Watson's phrase \"as supreme\" as before the passing of the Act. The right of a beneficiary entitled to share under such a succession is regulated by that legislature alone. In the courts of any country, which accepts the law of the domicile as prescribing the rules of succession, the right of a person claiming to share in the benefit of such a succession would fall to be determined by the application of such rules as that legislature prescribes as applicable to such a case.\nIn accordance with the principles already indicated the \"logical consequences\" of this control of such successions by the Province of Quebec \"kept intact\" by the application of the fiction mobilia ossibus inh\u0153rent seem to involve this \u2014 every such succession may be deemed for the purpose among others of determining the incidence of duties imposed upon benefits accruing from the devolution of it to have as an entirety its seat in Quebec. On what ground, then, are we so to restrict the words \"taxation within the province\" as to exclude such successions from the taxing authority of that province? There appears to be no ground for doing so. The possibility of those words being so restricted does not appear to have occurred to the Judicial Committee when considering the case of Lovitt v. The King[39].\nI have not been able to discover anything in Woodruff v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[40] which affects the force of these considerations. There was in that case no question of a testamentary or intestate succession. The Province of Ontario had attempted to exact duties in respect of transfers made inter vivos, though in contemplation of death, of movables having at the time the transfers were made a situs in the State of New York according to both the law of Ontario and the law of New York. The transfers were, as their Lordships held, effected by delivery in New York. It is argued, however, that a passage in the judgment of Lord Collins lays down two propositions, 1st, that taxation, by a province, of property locally situated outside the province is ultra vires, and 2ndly, succession duties levied, by a province, upon benefits accruing from a succession devolving under the law of the province and composed in part of movables locally situate outside the province are taxes imposed on extra-provincial property within this rule. It is needless to say that if such were the sense of a passage which forms the ground, or one of the grounds, of the judgment it is not for this court to refuse to follow it or to seek to fritter it away by insubstantial distinctions.\nI think this is a misreading of their Lordships' judgment. It is not without some bearing upon the point of the meaning of the judgment that the appeal then before their Lordships did not involve the consideration of the validity of taxes imposed upon a succession such as we have here and that their Lordships' judgment does not in terms mention such a succession.\nIndeed, it seems to me that the second of the above mentioned propositions can be deduced from the judgment only through an assumption that it follows as a logical consequence from the first. A moment's consideration will shew that this is not the case. Such benefits are generally recognized as being subject to the taxing power of the province as we have seen upon the principle that the totality of objects constituting a succession is subject to the personal law of the decujus and consequently that the rights of persons claiming such benefits are governed by this personal law and are regarded as having their seat in the territory subject to it. There is, however, no principle generally recognized under which transactions inter vivos respecting particular movables objects are held to be governed by the lex domicilii. The more generally accepted view appears to be that according to the principle indicated by the maxim mobilia se-quuntur personam the lex domicilii does not become applicable to such transactions as those which were in question in Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[41], but that, broadly speaking, it is only in respect of those transactions which, (to use Mr. West-lake's phrase,) a person's property is conceived and dealt with, (e.g., marriage contract,) \"as an entirety grouped round the owner's person as a centre\" that the lex situs has resort to the law of the domicile for its legal rules; and this on the ground that in such cases, as in the case of movable successions, convenience imperatively requires that they be governed by a single law. Westlake, p. 181-186, 191-195; Savigny (Guthrie's translation) 176, note (2); Wharton, vol. II., 680-684; Bar, 488-491; Fcelix, paragraph 62; 1 Aubry et Eau, p. 103 ; 1 Demolombe, pp. 110 and 111. According to the law of Ontario (which follows the law of England) there seems to be no room for controversy that the transactions in question in that case were governed by the law of New York. The authorities are fully reviewed by Mr. Westlake (pp. 191-195), and his argument appears to leave no doubt upon the point. The donees consequently derived nothing through the law of Ontario. That was the view presented by Mr. Danckwertz in his argument before the Privy Council on behalf of the appellants and that was evidently the view upon which their Lordships acted. It is perhaps not to be expected that statutes such as that before us \u2014 which impose duties in respect of transmissions of the estates of domiciled residents including property situate abroad, and at the same time upon all property within the jurisdiction transmitted by death, wherever the domicile of the decedent may be \u2014 could escape criticism as putting into operation two seemingly incompatible principles. Strictly we are concerned in this case only with the question of the power of the legislature in respect of the first mentioned class of duties; and constitutionally the legislature's action in imposing such duties so far as it is constitutional, cannot be affected by the circumstance that it has also professed to exact them (if it have done so) in circumstances to which its authority does not apply. The truth is, however, that the practice very widely prevails of taxing all personal property having a situs within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing power on the occasion of a transmission of title by or in consequence of death. The law of England, for example, maintains \"the paramount authority of the situs over the assets themselves as distinguished from the beneficial in the clear surplus.\" Westlake, p. 125; and the estate duty applies to all such items having an actual local situs in the United Kingdom.\n\"No one doubts,\" says Mr. Justice Holmes, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Blackstone v. Miller[42], at page 204,\nthat succession to a tangible chattel may be taxed wherever the property is found, and none the less that the law of the situs accepts its rules of succession from the law of the domicil, or that by the law of the domicil the chattel is part of a universitas and is taken into account again in the succession tax there. Eidman v. Martinez [43]. See Mager v. Grima[44]; Coe v. Errol[45]; Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania[46]; Magoun v. Illinois Trust and Savings Bank[47]; New Orleans v. Stemple[48]; Bristol v. Washington County[49]; and for state decisions Matter of Estate of Romaine[50]; Callahan v. Woodbridge[51]; Greves v. Shaw[52]; Allen v. National State Bank of Camden[53].\nNo doubt this power on the part of two States to tax on different and more or less inconsistent principles, leads to some hardship. It may be regretted, also, that one and the same State should be seen taxing on the one hand according to the fact of power, and on the other, at the same time, according to the fiction that, in successions after death, mobilia sequuntur personam and domicile governs the whole. But these inconsistencies infringe no rule of constitutional law. Coe v. Errol45; Knowlton v. Moore[54].\nThere is certainly nothing in the \"British North America Act\" pointing to the conclusion that a Canadian province is confined to either one or the other of these principles of taxation. One province may adopt that which gives special prominence to the circumstance that the succession is regulated by the law of the domicile, another to the fact that the title to particular items of movable property is controlled by the law of the situs. Toll may be exacted as an incident of the accrual of the benefit or as a condition of the passing of the title. And since either may be validly acted upon to the exclusion of the other, I do not see upon what ground it can be said that both principles may not be brought, so to speak, under the same roof and combined in a single system. The decision of the Judicial Committee in Lovitt v. The King[55] appears to support this view. This disposes of the question touching the duties charged against the benefits under the will of Henry Cotton.\nIt is not without some hesitation that I have concluded that the duties imposed by the earlier statute must be held to be leviable in the respect of Mrs. Cotton's estate as a whole. As to the question of domicile, Henry Cotton's admission creates a presumption which has not been displaced and the point now relied upon appears to have been taken for the first time in this court. The question upon which I have had some doubt relates to the construction of the statute itself. The provision to be considered is:\u2014\n1191(b). All transmissions, owing to death, of the property in, usufruct or enjoyment of, movable and immovable property in the province shall be liable to the following taxes.\nThat is the English version. In the French version, however, instead of the words \"property in the province,\" we have \"propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e dans la province;\" and the contention is that these words shew the legislature to have been aiming at transmissions only of property having an actual physical situs within the province or property which considered apart altogether from the fact of its constituting part of a succession devolving under the law of the province has a situs within the province by construction of law. After a most careful examination of the judgments in the case of Lambe v. Manuel[56] I think the decision in that case relieves us from considering the construction of the statute in this aspect. I think the effect of that decision is that the situs indicated by the phrase above quoted from the French version is the situs as determined in the case of movables by the application of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam. The question which arose in Lambe v. Manuel[57] was whether certain movables which formed part of the patrimony of a person who had died domiciled in the Province of Ontario, (but which admittedly, if that circumstance were to be left out of consideration, has a situs within the Province of Quebec) were dutiable under the enactment referred to. It was held they were not dutiable and on the ground as it appears to me that in the application of the phrase above quoted \"situ\u00e9e dans la province\" the principle mobilia sequuntur personam must govern. In that case the contention on behalf of the Attorney-General was the contention which is now made on behalf of the respondents, viz., that the principle upon which the legislature had proceeded was that all property having (irrespectively of the operation of the maxim mobilia. sequuntur personam) a local situation in the province should be subject to the duties imposed by the Act. That construction was rejected by the Superior Court, by the court of appeal and by the Judicial Committee successively. The ground upon which the Superior Court proceeded as appears by the judgment of Sir Melbourne Tait, was that the legislature had acted upon the principle consistently adopted by the English courts in construing the Legacy Duty Acts, viz., that for the purpose of determining the incidence of duties imposed upon transmissions of benefits in consequence of death the situation of the property is to be determined by the maxim referred to. His views are summed up in the last paragraph of his judgment, which is in the following words:\u2014 I have come to the conclusion that I should interpret article 1191(6) in accordance with the rule of our law and of the English law regarding movable property above stated and hold that it means all transmissions of such property in the province, belonging to persons domiciled therein at the time of their death, in other words, transmissions resulting from a succession devolving here and that in the eye of the law the movable property in question is not situated in this province and is not subject to the tax sought to be imposed. This construction will not only be consistent with such rule, but also with the other provisions of the Act.\nIn the court of appeal the judgment of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 is to the same effect as appears by the following passage:\u2014\nII nous faut donc d\u00e9clarer que, lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, les biens dont il s'agit avaient leur assiette dans la province d'Ontario et qu'ils doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme situ\u00e9s dans Ontario, lieu du domicile due de eu jus. Ils \u00e9chappent partant, au droit de fisc de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nNotre statut rend la chose encore plus claire en imposant un droit sur les seuls biens situ\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl n'\u00e9tait pas, d'ailleurs, n\u00e9cessaire de faire cette restriction: nous ne pouvons pas taxer l'es biens situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.\nThe view indicated by this passage is emphasized by the citations made by Boss\u00e9 J., from the judgment of Lord Hobhouse in Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[58], at page 773.\nThe judgment of the-Judicial Committee was delivered by Lord Macnaghten and in the course of that judgment His Lordship says, referring to the reasons given by Sir Melbourne Tait and Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9:\u2014\nThe decisions of the Quebec courts are, in their Lordships' opinion, entirely in consonance with well-established principles, which have been recognized in England in the well-known cases of Thomson v. Advocate-General[59], and Wallace v. Attorney-General[60], and by this board in the case of Harding y. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland58. Now, what are the principles established in the cases to which His Lordship refers? These principles can best be stated in the ipsissima verba of the learned judges by whom those cases were decided. In Thomson v. Advocate-General[61], the Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, said, at page 21:\u2014\nAn Englishman made his will in England: he had foreign stock in Russia, in America, in France, and in Austria. The question was whether the legacy duty attached to that foreign stock, which was given as part of the residue, the estate being administered in England; and it was contended, I believe, in the course of the argument by my noble and learned friend who argued the case, in the first place, that it was real property, but, finding that that distinction could not be maintained, the next question was whether it came within the operation of the Act, and although the property was all abroad, it was decided to be within the operation of the Act as personal property, on this ground, and this ground only, that as it was personal property, it must in point of law, be considered as following the domicile of the testator, which domicile was England.\nNow, my Lords, if you apply that principle, which has never been quarrelled with, which is a known principle of our law, to the present case, it decides the whole point in controversy. The property, personal property, being In this country at the time of the death, you must take the principle laid down in the case of In re Ewin[62], and it must be considered as property within the domicile of the testator, which domicile was Demerara. It is admitted that if it was property within the domicile of the testator in Demerara, it cannot be subject to legacy duty. Now, my Lords, that is the principle upon which this case is to be decided. The only distinction is that to which I have referred, and which distinction is decided by the case In re Ewin61 to be immaterial.\nAt page 26, Lord Brougham observed: \u2014\nThe rule of law, indeed, is quite general that in such cases the domicile governs the personal property, not the real; but -the personal property is in contemplation of the law, whatever may be the fact supposed to be within the domicile of the testator or intestate.\nAnd finally at page 29 these words are attributed by the Report to Lord Campbell:\u2014 If a testator has died out of Great Britain with a domicile abroad, although he may have personal property that is in Great Britain at the time of his death, in contemplation of law that property is supposed to he situate where he was domiciled, and therefore does not come within the Act; this seems to be the most reasonable construction to be put upon the Act of Parliament.\nIn Attorney-General v. Napier[63],\u2014it may be added\u2014Parke B. thus refers to the decision in Thomson v. The Advocate-General[64]:\u2014\nIn the case of In re Ewin[65] the doctrine was first broached that the true criterion whether the parties were liable to legacy duty depended upon the fact whether the testator at his death was domiciled in England; and that is the rule adopted by the learned judges in their decision in the case of Thomson v. The Advocate-General64; and Lords Lyndhurst, Brougham and Campbell put it upon the great principle that personal property is to be considered as situate in the place where the owner of it is domiciled at the time of his death.\nThe effect of the other two cases mentioned by His Lordship may be stated in the language of Lord Hobhouse in Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[66], at page 774:\u2014\nThe matter appears to be well summed up in Mr. Dicey's work on the Conflict of Laws at page 785, in \"which he paraphrases Lord Cranworth's application-of the principle mobilia sequuntur personam by saying that the law of domicile prevails over that of situation.\nThese then are the principles we are to apply; and, applying these principles, it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that for the purposes of this enactment the situs of movables forming part of a succession devolving under the law of Quebec must be taken to follow the domicile of the decedent.\nAnglin J. (dissenting ). \u2014 The Crown appeals against the judgment of the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec disaffirming its right to retain succession duties levied against the estates of the late Charlotte Cotton and her husband, Henry H. Cotton, in respect of movable property consisting of bonds, stocks, promissory notes, jewellery and pictures actually situate in the United States of America at the date of the demise of each decedent.\nThat the actual situs of the tangible portion of this property was foreign is, of course, unquestionable: According to the rules stated in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[67], at pages 481-2, and accepted in Payne v. The King[68], at pages 559-60, the intangible portion also had a \"local existence\" \u2014 was \"actually situate,\" or, as put in the cases (Thomson v. Advocate-General[69]; Winans v. Attorney-General[70]; Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[71], \"locally situate\" and, as far as property of that class can be, was \"physically situated\" (Winans v. Attorney-General[72]) either at Boston or elsewhere in the United States \u2014 certainly not in the Province of Quebec. No reason was advanced in argument, and I know of none, why those rules should not obtain in that province.\nAlthough in many of the cases property so situate is described as \"locally situate\" I am unable to appreciate the force of the word \"locally\" in this phrase (Commissioners of Inland, Revenue v. Midler & Co.'s Margarine[73], per Lord James of Hereford at page 228; Treasurer of the Province of Ontario v. Pattin[74], unless, indeed, it is used in a sense which makes it interchangeable with the word \"actually\"\u2014in the case of tangible property as the equivalent of \"physically\" and in the case of intangible property to denote that attribute of locality which it possesses according to such rules as those laid down in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[75]; in Commissioner of Stamps v. Salting[76], and in Re Hoyles[77]. To signify property thus situate, as well as property having a physical situs, within or without the territorial limits of the taxing province or state I shall in this opinion employ the phrase \"actually situate.\" Charlotte Cotton died on the 11th of April, 1902; Henry H. Cotton on the 28th of December, 1906. Both dates are important because the Quebec succession duties law was materially amended and was consolidated in the interval.\nIt is admitted that Henry H. Cotton was domiciled in the Province of Quebec when he died. The respondents allege that his domicile, which, of course, was also that of Mrs. Cotton, was at the time of her death in the State of Massachusetts. In the view of the case taken by the provincial courts it was unnecessary to pass upon the question of Mrs. Cotton's domicile, and it was left undetermined.\nHenry Cotton made two solemn declarations respecting his wife's domicile which were filed with the provincial revenue officers. In the first, made in 1902, he stated that Mrs. Cotton's domicile at the time of her death was in the State of Massachusetts: in the second, made in 1904, that it was in the Province of Quebec. The decision of the Privy Council in Lambe v.Manuel[78], is put forward as the reason for his change of view. But the bearing of that decision on the question as to the domicile of Mrs. Cotton is scarcely apparent.\nWhen sixteen years of age Henry Cotton left the Province of Quebec and went to reside in Boston. He lived and carried on business there for thirty-six years. He became a naturalized American citizen. He married a lady born and brought up in the State of Massachusetts. During the summer he often paid visits with his wife to Cowansville, Quebec, where his mother resided. In 1901 he appears to have decided to retire from business. He came as usual to Cowansville that summer. During this visit he and his wife resided, as had been customary, with his mother. He, however, then bought a property in Cowansville and proceded to improve it with a view to making it his future permanent residence. In the autumn he returned as usual with his wife to Boston. They both appear to have remained there until Mrs. Cotton died in April, 1902. In his second declaration filed with the revenue officers he swore that he believed his domicile was at Boston when he married. Notwithstanding the difficulty of establishing that a domicile of origin has been changed (Winans v. Attorney-General[79]), I have no doubt upon these facts that Henry Cotton had acquired a domicile in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It may require less cogent evidence to make out a case of change or loss of an acquired domicile, or domicile of choice, but upon the facts in evidence, notwithstanding the second declaration of Henry Cotton, my conclusion would be that, although he had, sometime before his wife died, formed an intention of abandoning his Massachusetts domicile and of again acquiring a domicile in the Province of Quebec, he had not up to the time of her death actually carried out that intention; that, although he had taken some preliminary steps with that end in view, the actual change of domicile had not been made and he still retained his domicile in the State of Massachusetts, as well as his American citizenship.\nThe respondents, however, did not allege in their pleadings that Mrs. Cotton died domiciled in Boston. On the contrary, by claiming the return only of duties paid on her foreign assets they appear to admit and to base their action on her domicile being in Quebec. Moreover, in their factum in the Court of King's Bench, and again in their factum in this court, they state that Henry Cotton's \"wife died in Boston, where he had returned to live temporarily.\" It would be regrettable if a misapprehension of counsel as to the proper inference to be drawn from, or as to the legal effect of. the facts established, should prevent the appellants asserting their legal rights. Fortunately, so far as it affects Mrs. Cotton's estate, this case may be disposed of on another ground which leads to the same result as if she were held to have been domiciled at Boston when she died.\nThe provincial courts have held that, although the Quebec \"Succession Duties Act\" in terms imposes a tax on the transmission of the inheritance, the legislature intended that that tax should in fact be fastened on the property itself which passes from the decedent to his heirs or legatees; and that, in so far as it imposes this tax on movable property actually situate outside the province, the Act is ultra vires and unconstitional, this case being in their opinion ruled by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[80]. Upon this ground the plaintiffs have been awarded judgment for the repayment by the Crown of the succession duties which it received from both estates in respect of the property in question.\nThe respondents, in support of the judgment in their favour, also assert that, upon its proper construction, the Quebec \"Succession Duties Act\" applicable to the estate of Mrs. Cotton did not purport to impose a tax in respect of movable property of domiciled decedents, which was actually situate outside the province. Because before considering the constitutionality of any statute it is desirable, if possible, to appreciate its precise scope and purview and also because it seems fitting that a court should not determine an issue as to the constitutionality of a statute unless the cause before it cannot otherwise be satisfactorily disposed of, it will be proper first to deal with the contention of the respondents that the Quebec statutes in force in 1902 did not purport to impose succession duties on movable property actually situate abroad. It will be convenient at the same time to consider whether the intention of the legislature was to impose a tax upon the transmission of the property or upon the property itself. Counsel for both parties rejected a suggestion that the tax might be regarded as imposed on the beneficiaries, that upon a proper construction of the Act only beneficiaries within the province would be subject to it and that it should on that ground be held intra vires.\nWhen Mrs. Cotton died the Act in force was the statute 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 17, amended by 57 Vict. ch. 16; 58 Vict. ch. 16, and 59 Vict. ch. 17; section 1191(6) (57 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 2), so far as material reads as follows:\u2014\n1191(b) All transmissions, owing to death, of the property in, usufruct or enjoyment of movable and immovable property in the province, shall be liable to the following taxes, calculated upon the value of the property transmitted, after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of the death.\nThere followed a table of rates varying according to the value of the estate and the degree of relationship borne by the several beneficiaries to the decedent. The statute then contained no definition of the word \"property.\"\nIn the form in which it stood at the time of Mrs. Cotton's death \u2014 except for an immaterial amendment (59 Vict. ch. 17) \u2014the Quebec succession duties law was considered by the Privy Council in Lambe v. Manuel[81]. In that case the question presented was whether certain bank stocks, registered and transferable at Montreal, Que., and a mortgage debt secured by hypothec on land in Montreal, which formed part of the estate of a decedent domiciled in the Province of Ontario, were liable to succession duties in Quebec. All this property was held not to be taxable because\naccording to their true construction the Quebec \"Succession Duties Acts\" only apply in the case of movable property to transmissions of property resulting from, the devolution of a succession in the Province of Quebec.\nThat the transmission of the property took place outside Quebec and not under Quebec law was the ground on which it was held that the Quebec statutes did not purport to authorize the imposition of the succession duties claimed. This judgment proceeds upon the view that by section 1191(5) the legislature intended to impose a tax on the transmission of the property passing and not on the property itself. The statute in express terms declares that \"all transmissions owing to death * * * shall be liable\" \u2014 \"toute transmission par d\u00e9c\u00e8s * * * est frapp\u00e9.\" Notwithstanding that the value of the property determines the rate of taxation and that in several sub-sections the duty appears to be treated as charged upon and as payable out of the estate, it must, I think, be assumed that the legislature intended what it said when it expressly imposed the tax on the transmission. The decision in Lambe v. Manuel[82] appears to me to be conclusive upon that point, although it does not determine what is the real incidence or subject of the tax imposed. That question was not before the board. I am, therefore, with respect, of the opinion that, whatever may be in fact their ultimate incidence, the Quebec succession duties were intended to be imposed directly and primarily not upon the property of the succession, but upon its transmission.\nIn Lambe v. Manuel82 the Judicial Committee proceeds upon a well-known principle of construction in determining that the word \"transmissions,\" though not expressly qualified or restricted, should be held to include only transmissions taking place under the law of the province. Lord Macnaghten makes this abundantly clear, when he says that the decision is.\nentirely in consonance with well-established principles which have been recognized in England in the well-known cases of Thomson .v. Advocate-General[83], and Wallace v. Attorney-General[84], and by this board in the case of Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[85]. Their Lordships did not, as was contended at bar by counsel for the present appellants upon the first argument of this appeal, treat the words \"in the province\" found in section 1191(b.) as qualifying or restrictive of the word \"transmissions.\" The phrase \"in the province\" is referred to only in the statement of the object of the action in the earlier part of the judgment, where it is applied to the subject \"movable or immovable property.\" If there could be any doubt upon the point\u2014I have none\u2014a glance at the French version of section 1191(b) makes it certain that this is its proper application:\u2014\n1191(b) Toute transmission, par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'usufruit ou de jouissance de biens mobiliers ou immobiliers, situ\u00e9s dans la province, est frapp\u00e9e des droits suivants, sur la valeur du bien transmis, d\u00e9duction faite des dettes et charges existant au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nBut for the -appellants it is urged that by the words \"in the province\" \u2014 \"situ\u00e9s dans la province\" \u2014 the legislature meant to include not only property actually situate in Quebec, but also movable property which, though actually situate elsewhere, is for purposes of succession and enjoyment, according to the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam (Blackwood v. The Queen[86]), governed by the law of the testator's domicile, which has been assumed to be in the Province of Quebec. 1 am unable to accede to that view. Prima facie the expressions \"in the province\" \u2014 \"situ\u00e9s dans la province\" \u2014 refer to property actually situate in Quebec. They are applied in the statute to immovable as well as movable property. To immovables the maxim invoked has, of course, no application. The force of the expressions is restrictive, not expansive. Had the legislature meant to include all movable property passing under the law of Quebec \u2014all property of which the transmission occurs in Quebec or is governed by Quebec law \u2014 wherever actually situate, I cannot conceive that it would have employed the terms \"situ\u00e9s dans la province.\" In another section of the same Act (55 & 56 Vict. ch. 17), 1191(a), we find the expression \"situ\u00e9s dans la province\" \u2014 \"within the province.\" There it clearly means physically or actually situated in Quebec. This affords \"one of the safest guides to the construction\" of the same words in section 1191 (6), which immediately follows; Blackwood v. The Queen[87]. If we may consider the subsequent action of the legislature in defining the word \"property\" as including all property, whether movable or immovable, actually situate within the province (3 Edw. VII. ch. 20), in afterwards extending this definition so that by express terms \"property\" was made to include all the movable property wherever situate of a domiciled decedent (6 Edw. VII. ch. 11, sec. 1191(c) ) and in finally removing entirely the. words \"in the province\"\u2014\"situ\u00e9s dans la province\"\u2014from section 1191(6) (7 Edw. VII. ch. 14, sec. 2), the view which I have taken of the proper construction of that section as it stood in 1902 would appear to be fortified. If by an application of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam the words \"situ\u00e9s dans la province\" should be construed as including the movables actually situated abroad of a domiciled decedent, the concluding clause of the definition of the word \"property\" introduced in 1906 was quite unnecessary. - Winans. v. Attorney-General[88]. Comparing the Quebec \"Succession Duty Acts\" and their development with the corresponding Acts of the Province of Ontario (55 Vict. ch. 6, sec. 4; R.S.O. 1897, ch. 24, sec. 4(a) ) and their development (1 Edw. VII. ch. 8, sec. 6; 7 Edw. VII. ch. 10, sec. 6), it appears to me that, probably actuated by fears that a tax imposed upon or in respect of property not actually situate within the province would not be \"taxation within the province\" (\"British North America Act,\" sec. 92(2) ) the authorities of both provinces, in order to ensure the constitutionality of their legislation, at first advisedly confined themselves to the imposition of succession duties in respect of property actually situate within the province. Perhaps grown bolder as the needs of revenue became more pressing, or it may be more grasping and prepared to risk a contest upon the constitutionality of a mere severable amendment, or, possibly, having had their fears and doubts as to their jurisdiction allayed, both provinces later on sought to extend the scope of this taxation so that they might obtain succession duty revenue in respect of movable property of domiciled decedents actually situate abroad.\nI am convinced that as the law stood in the Province of Quebec at the time of Mrs. Cotton's death only so much of her estate as was actually situate in that province was liable to the succession duties imposed by section 1191 (b) above quoted. In respect of her foreign bonds, etc., her estate was not liable to Quebec succession duties, because, whatever may have been the power of the legislature in that respect, the statute as it then stood did not purport to impose a tax upon the transmission of property actually situate outside the province. But when Henry Cotton died the consolidated succession duties provisions of the Act, 6 Edw. VII. ch. 11, were in force. By that statute the portion of section 1191(6) above quoted was re-enacted in the same terms, except that the words, \"or the,\" were inserted before the word \"usufruct.\" There was added, however, section 1191(c):\u2014\n1191(c). The word \"property\" within the meaning of this section shall include all property, whether movable or immovable, actually situate or owing within the province, whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the debt is payable within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province, and all movables, wherever situate, of persons having their domicile, or residing, in the Province of Quebec at the time of their death.\nThe words \"in the province\"\u2014\"situ\u00e9s dans la province\"\u2014still remained in section 1191(b), being stricken out after Mr. Cotton's death by the Act, 7 Edw. VII. ch. 14.\nThere is a manifest repugnancy arising from the presence in the same Act (6 Edw. VII. ch. 11) of the words \"in the province\" found in section 1191 (b) and the definition of the word \"property\" in section 1191(c). By the former the tax is confined to transmissions of property which is within the province; by the latter it is extended to property without the province. The two provisions are irreconcilable.\nHaving regard, however, to the history of this legislation and to the manifest intention of the legislature to extend the application of succession duties, first, in 1903, to all property of non-domiciled decedents actually situate within the province\u2014obviously in order to meet the decision in Lambe v. Manuel[89]\u2014and again, in 1906, to movable property of domiciled decedents actually situate outside the province, I am of the opinion that in the consolidation of 1906 the words \"in the province\" \u2014 \"situ\u00e9s dans la province\" \u2014 should be deemed to have been allowed to remain in section\" 1191 (b) per incuriam. Their deletion in the following year tends to confirm this view. Moreover, a construction which rejects them accords with the rule that if two sections of the same Act are repugnant the latter must prevail. Wood v. Riley[90], per Keating J.; The King v. Justices of Middlesex[91]. The principles of statutory construction are, I think, the same in the Province of Quebec as in the other provinces of Canada where the English common law prevails.\nIt follows that at the time of the death of Henry Cotton, who was then admittedly domiciled in Quebec, his movable property actually situate abroad was subject to succession duties under the statutes of that province, if its legislature had the power to impose such taxation.\nIn determining this question of provincial legislative jurisdiction in Canada, decisions upon the proper construction, the scope, purview and effect of statutes enacted by Parliaments or legislatures whose powers of taxation are unrestricted are of little, if any, practical value. A consideration of them rather tends to confuse the issue.\nIn the matter of taxation, as in other matters, our provincial legislatures possess only such powers as the \"British North America Act\" confers upon them. By section 92 they are empowered To make laws in relation to\n(2) Direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nThese words clearly confer not a general power of taxation, but a power subject to a triple limitation. The taxation must be direct; it must be within the province; it must be imposed in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes. The taxation in question is admittedly imposed \"in order to the Raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\" But the respondents contend that it is neither \"direct\" nor \"within the province.\" Of these two restrictions the first is obviously concerned with the delimitation of the line between provincial and Dominion powers, saving to the Dominion the field of indirect taxation; whereas the second appears to be designed to prevent encroachment by one province upon the domain of another, or of a foreign state. The latter limitation seems to me to present the more formidable objection to the constitutionality of the taxation here in question. The conclusion which I have reached upon it renders it unnecessary for me to consider the question whether a tax in terms imposed upon the transmission of property, but in its ultimate incidence falling upon the property transmitted, is direct or indirect taxation.\nThat the words \"within the province\" were introduced either as declaratory of a restriction on the provincial power of taxation which would have been implied, or in order to impose such a restriction, admits of no question. But the precise nature and extent of the limitation which is thus expressed as it affects the right to pass death duty legislation has been a subject of much debate. If these duties could be regarded as imposed upon the transmission only and not at all upon the property transmitted, in the case of the domiciled decedent the taxation in respect of his movable property abroad as well as at home might be \"within the province:\" if they should be regarded as imposed on the property transmitted, the taxation in respect of movable property of a non-domiciled decedent situate in the province, although the transmission of it takes place, usually, but not always (Dicey on Conflict of Laws (2 ed.), p. 753), under foreign law, would be \"within the province.\"\nCan it be that a provincial legislature empowered to levy taxation only within the province may validly impose death duties in respect of movable property actually situate abroad under the guise of a tax upon transmission, invoking the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam to bring such property constructively within the province, and at the same time, repudiating that maxim, may legitimately exercise the same taxing power in respect of movables which under it would be constructively situate aboard though actually situate within the borders of the province? That it has the latter power is definitely established by the recent decision of the Privy Council in the The King v. Lovitt[92] Has it also the former? I cannot believe that it has under the restrictive words of the \"British North America Act\" with which we are now dealing. I adhere to the view which I expressed in Lovitt v. The King[93], at page 161, which is not affected by the disposition of that case by the Judicial Committee, that if the legislature of a Canadian province can by legislative declaration make anything property \"within the province\" which would not be such according to the recognized principles of English law * * * this constitutional limitation upon its power (of taxation) would be a mere dead letter.\nCould such a legislature validly enact that, as a condition of obtaining from its courts letters probate or of administration required for the reduction into possession and administration of assets, however trifling in value, actually situate within the provincial borders, a tax must be paid based on the value of the entire estate of the decedent, including movables (and in that case perhaps immovables also) actually situate elsewhere and in respect of the administration and collection of which such letters were wholly unnecessary \u2014 a tax which, however or by whomsoever payable in the first instance, would in most cases ultimately have the effect of reducing the value to the beneficiary of such foreign assets passing to him by succession? There is nothing in the law of nations which forbids the legislature of a sovereign state imposing such a tax. Blackwood v. The Queen[94]. But, if the legislature of a Canadian province may do so, the restriction upon the provincial taxing power under the words \"within the province\" would, in the case of succession to movables, seem to be illusory.\nIn construing the restrictive words of the \"British North America Act,\" \"within the province,\" we must, I think, ascribe to the Imperial Parliament the intention that the restriction thereby placed upon the provincial power of taxation should be definite and certain and should be the same in every province. The Queen v. Commissioners of Income Tax[95]; Lord Saltoun v. Advocate-General[96]. This excludes the idea that, confining itself to one or the other, each province may in this matter select its own basis of taxation -- transmission and constructive situs according to the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, or property and actual situs. If some provinces, adopting the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, should impose a tax in respect of the movable property of their domiciled decedents \"actually situate\" abroad and others should declare dutiable all property actually situate within their respective local areas regardless of the domiciliation of the deceased owners, double taxation of some movables and entire exemption of others would result. Uncertainty, inconvenience and confusion would ensue; and the sanctity of the legislative domain of one province might be successfully invaded by the legislation of another.\nIt may be urged that such consequences could be obviated if the provinces would agree amongst themselves upon the basis of this taxation. But there-is no assurance that all would concur in such an arrangement; and the jurisdiction conferred by sub-section 2 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act\" does not depend upon and cannot be determined by an agreement between provincial governments.\nIn order that a provincial tax should be valid under the \"British North America Act,\" in my opinion the subject of taxation must be within the province. To determine what is the real subject of taxation the substantial result and not the mere form of the taxing Act must be considered. The ultimate effect of succession duties such as are provided for by the Quebec statutes, whether imposed directly upon the transmission or directly upon the property, is to reduce the amount of the estate to which the beneficiaries succeed (Cooley on Taxation (3 ed.), p. 32.) Whether paid by the personal representative or secured by his bond before he obtains probate or letters of administration, or paid by him before handing over the property to the beneficiaries, or by the beneficiaries themselves prior to, or upon receipt of the property to which they succeed, the substantial result is the same \u2014 they come out of, or lessen the value of that which passes by the succession. The tangible thing affected by the tax is the property which passes. In substance the taxing state takes for itself directly or indirectly a part of the property transmitted from the decedent to his beneficiary.\nWhere a testator by his will provides that his legacies shall be exempted from death duties, he in effect adds to each bequest the amount of the duty which it would otherwise have borne. In such a case, therefore, although \u2014 it may be for the advantage of the beneficiary, or it may be for the convenience of the estate \u2014 the testator has provided that payment of the tax shall be made out of the residuary estate and not out of the property bequeathed to each individual beneficiary, the tax is none the less imposed in respect of that property and is in substance a tax upon it. In whatever form of words \u2014 tax upon transmission, tax upon succession to property devolving under the law of the province, or tax upon probate \u2014 the duty may be imposed, if the beneficiary ultimately has to pay it as a condition of receiving his share of the estate or has to accept that share reduced by its amount, or if the tax is paid out of the residuary estate in exoneration of the specific or pecuniary legatee, the result is that the real incidence of the tax is upon the property of the succession. This is always the case where taxation is levied in respect of particular property of whatever nature, whether the taxing Act constitutes the tax a lien or charge upon such property and provides for its seizure and sale if necessary to satisfy the impost, or the remedy prescribed for the recovery of the tax is by personal action or proceedings against the persons required to pay it.\nThat the property so to be affected should itself be within the province at the time when the taxation attaches in respect of it seems to me to be prim\u00e0 facie the restriction which the Imperial Parliament intended to impose upon the provincial power of taxation in respect of property. Under the Quebec law the duties attach upon the transmission of the property \u2014 that is, at the moment of the decedent's demise. Its situation at that time determines its liability to provincial taxation. That the situs of the subject of taxation is the test by which provincial jurisdiction to tax it should be settled seems to be undisputed in the case of immovable property. In the case of movable property the large portion of it which is tangible has an actual physical situs equally with immovables. It is only intangible personalty which must of necessity be given a situs by fiction of law. If the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam be applied for the purpose of determining in respect of what property a Canadian province is by the \"British North America Act\" given the power of direct taxation all movable property, tangible and intangible alike, will be given a fictitious situs notwithstanding that tangible movables have an actual situs which is physical and that intangible movables have in contemplation of law an equally well-established actual situs\u2014and that for purposes of taxation. Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[97]; Payne v. The King[98]; Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Muller & Co.'s Margarine[99]; Commissioner of Stamp Duties v. Salting[100]. In fact movables actually situate outside the borders of the province are as far beyond the \"direct power\" of the Quebec Legislature as immovables similarly situate. Blackwood v. The Queen[101].\nIt is contended that to hold that, where provincial taxation is levied in respect of property, the property must be within the province is in effect to insert the words \"on property\" before the words \"within the province\" in sub-section 2 of section 92 of the \"British North America Act,\" Treasurer of Ontario v. Pattin[102], and that the insertion of these words would exclude the imposition of many purely personal direct taxes \u2014 such as a poll tax \u2014 which it was certainly intended that the provinces should have the power to impose. But the view which I take of the \"British North America Act\" provision is that it should be read as authorizing direct taxation only where the real subject of the tax \u2014 whether person, business or property\u2014is within the province. In testing the validity under this construction of any particular provincial tax it would, of course, be necessary to determine what is the real subject of taxation.\nUnder the Quebec Act imposing death duties for the reasons I have stated I am of the opinion that the real subject of taxation is the property passing, notwithstanding the clearly expressed intention of the legislature to fasten the tax upon the transmission. I think it improbable that the Imperial Parliament meant to confer on the provincial legislatures the right to tax any property real or personal beyond their \"direct power.\" Blackwood v. The Queen[103]. The Lovitt decision has established that it was not intended that a province should be denied the power to tax property actually situate within its borders merely because for some other purposes (Blackwood Case103, at page 93), such property is in law deemed to be constructively elsewhere.\nApart from authority I would for the foregoing reasons hold that the Quebec Legislature in attempting to impose death duties in respect of property actually situate outside the province exceeded its constitutional powers.\nBut I also think the matter concluded by the authority of the decision of the Privy Council in Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[104]. I concede that the facts in that case are readily distinguishable from those before us. It may also be said that Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario104 might have been disposed of, without determining the constitutional question now under consideration, on the ground that there a complete transfer of the property had taken place in a foreign state by an act inter vivos and the property itself was actually situated without the province, and the Ontario statutes, therefore, had no application. But their Lordships of the Judicial Committee did not see fit to rest their decision upon that ground. On the contrary they say:\u2014\nThe pith of the matter seems to be that, the powers of the provincial legislature being strictly limited to \"direct taxation within the province\" (\"British North America Act,\" 30 & 31 Vict. ch. 3, sec. 92 , sub-sec. 2 ), any attempt to levy a tax on property locally situate outside the province is -beyond their competence. This consideration renders it unnecessary to discuss the effect of the various sub-sections of section 4 of the \"Succession Duty Act,\" on which so much stress was laid in argument. Directly or indirectly, the contention of the Attorney-General involves the very thing which the legislature has forbidden to the province \u2014 taxation of property not within the province.\nThe reasoning of this board in Blackwood v. The Queen[105] seems to cover this case.\n\"The contention of the Attorney-General\" referred to can scarcely have been aught else than the reported argument of counsel representing him that the transfers were testamentary in substance;\nthe duty claimed was not a tax on property, but a tax on the devolution or succession: the duty was imposed on persons beneficially entitled * * * the persons taxed were resident in the province.\nIt is to this argument that Lord Collins makes reply that directly or indirectly \u2014 although the transfers should be deemed testamentary and although the tax should be regarded as primarily imposed on the transmission, or on the beneficiaries \u2014 it involves the very thing forbidden \u2014 taxation of property not within the province. Not content with expressly basing his judgment on this ground, his Lordship emphasizes its importance by the statement that it is \"the pith of the matter.\"\nWoodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[106] cannot be brushed aside by the familiar observation that the language used must be read in the light of, and confined to the facts of, that case, and is applicable only to legislation couched in the form of that then before the court. Their Lordships have anticipated and precluded such an argument in their statement that the contention of the Attorney-General directly or indirectly\u2014i.e., either upon assumptions that the transfers were really testamentary and that the Ontario Legislature should be deemed to have imposed its tax not on the property, but on the succession or devolution or on the persons beneficially entitled, or upon contrary assumptions\u2014 involved taxation of property not within the province ; and \"any attempt to levy a tax on property locally situate outside the province\" is ultra vires of a provincial legislature.\nNeither may this portion of their Lordships' judgment be regarded as obiter dictum. As put by Lord Macnaghten, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, in New South Wales Taxation Commissioners v. Palmer[107], at page 184:\u2014\nIt is impossible to treat a proposition which the court declares to be a distinct and sufficient ground for its decision as a mere dictum, simply because there is also another ground stated upon which, standing alone, the case might have been determined.\nSee also Membery v. Great Western Railway Co.[108], per Lord Bramwell, at page 187.\nAs I understand the judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Lovitt v. The King[109], it determines nothing inconsistent with the view I have expressed. Their actual decision turns upon the construction of a deposit receipt which they held to be primarily payable at St. John. The asset which it represented, being a simple contract debt, therefore had a local situs in New Brunswick. As property locally situate in that province their Lordships held that it might be made subject to the succession duty taxation of New Brunswick, notwithstanding that the testator died domiciled in Nova Scotia; and, the legislature having clearly expressed its intention to impose succession duties upon such property, their Lordships decided that those duties must be paid. Although in the course of the judgment passing reference is made to section 92 of the \"British North America Act,\" and in the discussion of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam invoked by the respondent some expressions occur which are perhaps consistent with a view contrary to that which I hold, the right of a provincial legislature to impose taxation in respect of movable property locally situate outside the province, and the double taxation of the same estate by two different provinces which might ensue are aspects of the case now before us which Lovitt v. The King[110] did not present and as to which the absence from their judgment of all allusion to Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[111] would seem to warrant the conclusion that their Lordships did not express an opinion.\nFor these reasons I conclude that in the case of Henry Cotton the taxation in question was ultra vires of the provincial legislature, and that on that ground the plaintiffs are entitled to succeed.\nIn the case of Mrs. Cotton, the plaintiffs would be entitled to succeed upon the same ground if the Quebec statutes in force when she died purported to tax movables of a decedent actually situate abroad; but they are, in my opinion, entitled to judgment in her case because the Quebec \"Succession Duties Acts\" as they stood at the time of her death did not purport to impos, a tax in respect of movable property not actually situate within the province and possibly also because Mrs. Cotton was not domiciled in Quebec at the time of her death.\nI should, perhaps, note that, as the statute was amended in 1903 and consolidated in 1906, although the tax purports to be imposed upon the transmission, it is extended to the Quebec movables of a non-domiciled decedent the transmission of which takes\" place abroad and under the law of the decedent's foreign domicile. By further amendment made in the consolidation of 1906 the legislature sought to render dutiable the foreign, movables not only of the domiciled decedent, but also of the decedent who is resident, though not domiciled, in the Province of Quebec. I allude to these peculiar features of the legislation to make it clear that they have not been overlooked and also because they indicate how far the legislature was prepared to go.\nIt was not urged on behalf of the appellants that the monies claimed by the plaintiffs could not be recovered because they were paid voluntarily and not in mistake of fact, but in mistake of law. Counsel no doubt refrained from presenting this contention because it appears to be well established under the system of law which obtains in the Province of Quebec that where a person voluntarily makes a payment because he erroneously believes he is compelled by law so to do, he may successfully maintain an action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'ind\u00fb: Articles 1047 and 1048 C.C. In that case the error is in that which was the principal consideration for making the payment (art. 992 C.C.) and, though voluntarily paid, the monies may be recovered. Leprohon v. Mayor of Montreal[112]; Boston v. L'Eriger[113]; Lelerc v. Lelerce[114]; Bain v. City of Montreal[115], per Strong J., at page 265, per Taschereau J., at page 285.\nThe main appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nI agree in the disposition made of the cross-appeals on the ground indicated in the opinion of my Lord the Chief Justice.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This case, it seems to me, should be decided according to the principles laid down by the Privy Council in the case of Lambe v. Manuel[116] and the decision of Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario) cannot be successfully invoked.\nThere is a vast difference between the two statutes that were submitted to the courts in those two cases.\nIn the case of Lambe v. Manuel[117], the \"Succession Duty Act\" of Quebec was at issue, and in the matter of Woodruff, the Ontario \"Death Duty Act\" had to be interpreted.\nThe Quebec law imposes a succession duty on the transmission or devolution of the estate.\nIn the Ontario statute, on the contrary, the property itself is taxed.\nLet me quote the two statutes side by side and we will easily see the difference that exists between those two enactments:\u2014 Quebec Law.\nOntario Law.\nAll transmissions owing to death of the property in usufruct or enjoyment of movable and immovable property in the province shall be liable to the following taxes calculated upon the value of the property transmitted.\nThe word \"property\" within the meaning of this section shall include all property, whether movable or immovable, actually situate or owing within the province, whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province, and all movables, wherever situate, of persons having their domicile (or residing) in the Province of Quebec at the time of their death.\nSave as aforesaid, the following property shall be subject to a succession duty as herein after provided, to be paid for the use of the province over and above the fee payable under the\"Surrogate Courts Act;\" (a) all property situate within this province, etc. * * * passing either by will or intestacy.\nThe word \"property\" in this Act includes real and personal property of every description, and every estate or interest therein capable of being devised or. bequeathed by will or of passing on the death of the owner to his heirs or personal representatives.\nWe are asked to decide whether movable property, consisting in bonds and shares of foreign companies belonging to a deceased person domiciled in Quebec is liable to death duties.\nThe Privy Council in the case of Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[118] had to deal, as I have already said, with a statute taxing the property itself. As 'the bonds in question in that case were due by foreign corporations, were in a foreign country, and had not passed by will or intestacy, it is no wonder that applying the provisions of the section 92 , sub-section 2 , of the \"British North America Act\" they have declared that under such a statute the Attorney-General of that province could not reach movable property whose situs were not in Ontario.\nThe Ontario law does tax movable property situate in the province and belonging to an outsider, but it does not affect any such property situate in another country.\nThe Quebec law, on the contrary, as interpreted by the Privy Council in the case of Lambe v. Manuel[119], cannot reach movable property situate in the province, because the duty that was authorized was not a duty on the property itself, but on the transmission of the property.\nThe testator in the case of Lambe v. Manuel119 was domiciled outside of Quebec and left shares of banks having their place of business in Quebec.\nThe Privy Council confirmed the decision of the Provincial courts and adopted the views expressed by Sir Melbourne Tait and Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 that the Quebec \"Succession Duty Act\" only applies, in the case of movables, to transmissions of property resulting from the devolution of a succession in the Province of Quebec; or, in other words, that the taxes imposed on movable property are imposed only on property which the successor claims under, or by virtue of, the Quebec law.\nIt was declared that, in order to reach those securities they should be transmitted according to the laws of Quebec and that what was taxed was the right to inherit.\nApplying those broad principles of Lambe v. Manuel119 to the facts of this case, I come to the conclusion that Mr. and Mrs. Cotton's representatives are liable because the transmission of shares and bonds has been made according to the laws of Quebec, and that the duty is imposed upon the devolution or upon the privilege for their successors to take or receive property under their wills. By fiction of the \\law, movable property is considered to be situate wherever the owner resides. It is referred to the domicile of the owner and governed by the law of that domicile (art. 6 C.C.). It becomes subject to the law governing the person of the owner.\nRelying upon the following decisions in England, where the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam has been adopted, Thomson v. Advocate-General[120]; Wallace v. Attorney-General[121]; Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[122], I have come to the conclusion that the government had rightly collected duties on those securities and shares and that the action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de deniers instituted by the respondents should be dismissed.\nIn order to fortify my opinion, may quote Hanson \"Legacy and Succession Duties,\" where he says:\u2014\nIt has already been pointed out that in order to render personal property liable to duty it is necessary that it should be situate within this country, and that as property of a movable nature accompanies in construction of law the person of its owner the situation of the owner's domicile at the time of his death and not the actual local situation of the property itself is the true test of -the liability to duty.\nI had some doubts, however, as to whether Mrs. Cotton's estate was liable to duty. The statute in force at her death did not contain a d\u00e9finition of the word \"property,\" as quoted above.\nThat definition was made after the judgment in the case of Lambe v. Manuel[123]. But the Quebec judges, in their decision as affirmed by the Privy Council, were so strong in their idea that what the statute contemplated was to tax any transmission re- suiting from a succession devolving here under the laws of the province, that my doubts were removed.\nWe must not forget that under our laws in Quebec the transmission of a succession takes place instantaneously at the death. \"Le mort saisit le vif\" is the old saying, and in that regard the laws of the two provinces of Ontario and Quebec shew a difference. (Arts. 596-599 and 600 C.C.)\nThe respondents have claimed before this court that Mrs. Cotton was not domiciled in Quebec when she died in Boston in 1902.\nThat question was not raised by the pleadings. On the contrary, it is there implicitly admitted that her domicile was in that province, when they acknowledged that her movable property locally situate there was duly taxed. According to the judgment of Lambe v. Manuel[124], her movable property even situate in Quebec was not subject to duty if she was domiciled elsewhere. The respondents in admitting by their pleadings that Mrs. Cotton's movable property in Quebec was liable to taxation admitted virtually that she was domiciled here.\nBesides her husband has stated in his affidavit of the 10th February, 1904:\u2014\nI have examined again that difficult question of domicile, and all the facts and circumstances of the case and I have come to the conclusion and admit that since the month of April, 1901, and, therefore, at the time of the death of my wife, my domicile (which was, of course, her domicile) was at Cowansville, in the said district.\nThe question of domicile, when a person does not reside all the time at the same place, is determined by his own intention; and if the person whose domicile is in question comes and declares that his domicile is in a certain country, I believe that his legal representatives are bound by his extra-judicial admission, and such an admission can be successfully invoked against them.\nI am of opinion then that the domicile of Mrs. Cotton at her death was in Quebec and that the respondents could not successfully raise that issue.\nA cross-appeal has been made by the respondents by which they claim that the Court of King's Bench should not have reduced the amount of the judgment rendered by the Superior Court. They claim by this cross-appeal that the debts of a succession should be entirely deducted from the part of the amounts situate in this province when there is one part of the estate not liable to duty and situate elsewhere. As I am of opinion that in this case, all the assets of the succession had to pay succession duty, I am not called upon to discuss the point raised. The cross-appeal then should be dismissed and the appeal allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs; Gross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dorion & Marchand.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Casgrain, Mitchell, Mc-Dongall & Creelman.\n[1] Q.R. 20 K.B. 164.\n[2] 178 U.S.R. 41.\n[3] [1908] A.C. 508.\n[4] [1908] A.C. 508.\n[5] [1908] A.C. 508.\n[6] 33 Can.

Alexander (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1911: October 10; 1912: February 20.\nPresent: Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nTitle to land\u2014\u201cTorrens System\u201d\u2014Priority of right\u2014Registration\u2014Caveat\u2014Notice\u2014Construction of statute\u2014Saskatchewan \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d 6 Edw. VII. c. 24\u2014Equities between purchasers\u2014Assignment of contract\u2014Conditions\u2014Right enforceable against registered owner.\nUnder the provisions of the Saskatchewan \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d (6 Edw. VII. ch. 24), the lodging of a caveat in the land titles office in which the title to the lands in question is registered, prevents the acquisition of any legal or equitable interest in the lands adverse to or in derogation of the claim of the caveator.\nA company, being registered owner of lands under the Act, entered into a written agreement to sell them to P., who assigned his interest in the contract to G., who then agreed to transfer the equitable interest, thus acquired, to A. Subsequently, without knowledge of A.\u2019s interest, McK. & B. acquired a like interest from G. A caveat claiming interest in the lands was then lodged by A., in the proper land titles office, and, without inquiry or actual notice of the registration of the caveat, McK. & B. afterwards obtained the approval of the company to the assignment which had been made to them. In an action for specific performance,\nHeld, per Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., that, as the purchasers from G. were on equal terms as to equities, A. had priority in point of time at the date when his caveat was lodged; that such priority had been preserved by the registration of the caveat, and that the subsequent advantage which would, otherwise, have been secured by the company\u2019s approval of the assignment to McK. & B. was postponed to any equitable right which A. might have to a conveyance. And, further, per Idington J., that, irrespective of the lodging of the caveat, A. had prior equity to the subsequent assignees.\nThe agreement by the company provided that no assignment of the contract should be valid unless it was for the whole of the purchaser\u2019s interest and was approved by the company, and also that the assignee should become bound to discharge all the obligations of the purchaser towards the company. Until the time of the approval of the assignment to McK. & B., none of these conditions had been complied with.\nHeld, per Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ., that the conditions in restriction of such assignments of the original contract could be invoked only by the company.\nHeld, per Duff J., dissenting, that, as the rights of G. against the company had never become vested in a., according to the provisions of the contract, he had acquired no enforceable right against the company, the registered owner of the lands, and, consequently, he had no legal or equitable interest in them which could be protected by caveat.\nJudgment appealed from (4 Sask L.R. 111) affirmed, Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Johnstone J. and maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The Canadian Northern Railway Company were registered owners of land under the \u201cTorrens System\u201d and gave to a subsidiary company named the Canadian Northern Prairie Lands Company the management of these lands.\nThe latter company, under powers thus given, sold a section to one Potter who in turn sold it to one Gesman, and he, on the second of November, 1909, sold a half of the section to the respondent Alexander who paid $100 cash and was to pay balance of what accrued due to Gesman in respect of his equity, for the selling company had not been paid their price.\nThen on the 4th of November, 1909, Gesman sold the same half section and the other half of the section to the appellants. Each of these transactions was reduced to writing and was so far as respects mere form a valid contract.\nOn the 6th of November aforesaid, respondent Alexander executed a caveat setting forth his claims against the half-section he had so purchased, and registered same on the 10th of November aforesaid.\nOn the 14th of December, 1909, Gesman was paid by appellants the balance of the $1,800 purchase money and they received from him an assignment of the original agreement of sale from the Prairie Lands Company to Potter.\nThe Prairie Lands Company had given a written agreement in which there was a provision guarding against the recognition of sub-purchasers.\nThe assignments to Gesman and by him to appellants were approved by the Prairie Lands Company on the 29th of November, 1909. I will hereafter refer to this feature of the case.\nThe respondent began this action on the 21st of February, 1910.\nThere is little if any dispute of fact. By their respective agreements of sub-purchase appellants and respondent Alexander each acquired an equitable interest in said lands.\nAlexander invokes for his protection the maxim qui prior est tempore potior est jure.\nIt is an undoubted principle of law that as between owners of equitable interests the first in time prevails unless he who has acquired it has either done or omitted to do something he is by law required to do and thereby has lost this prior right.\nAlexander had not done anything to taint his right and so far as I can see omitted nothing he was required to do.\nHis registration of notice of his claim may not have been requisite on the facts here presented, but was, if I understand the practice, exactly what is usually done by prudent purchasers under a time bargain.\nAnd prudent buyers are well advised in making search for such notice of prior purchase. But though claimed to be here notice to the subsequent purchasers I desire not to express my opinion on that point, for in my view of this case that need not be considered merely from the point of view of notice.\nAn argument was presented by the appellants founded on the practice relative to the assignments of choses in action in pursuance of which notices of the assignment thereof are given to the debtor or trustee of the fund provided for the discharge of the obligation in question in the assignment.\nI do not think the argument is well founded. Indeed, the mass of authority against it seems overwhelming.\nIn the case of Taylor v. London and County Banking Company[2], at page 254, in appeal, Stirling L.J. states as follows:\u2014\nAlthough a mortgage debt is a chose in action, yet, where the subject of the security is land, the mortgagee is treated as having \u201can interest in land\u201d and priorities are governed by the rules applicable to interests in land, and not by the rules which apply to interests in personalty.\nHe proceeds to quote from Sir William Grant in Jones v. Gibbons[3], at page 410, and cites Wilmot v. Pike (1845)[4].\nThe authorities cited bear out his statement of the law which is laid down to the same effect in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 13, page 79, where other authorities are collected.\nThere is nothing in this case in hand of what sometimes happens when the party holding the subsequent equity has been able to fortify it by the acquisition of the legal estate or its equivalent a declaration by him holding the legal estate that he so holds as trustee for him claiming.\nNor can I find anything in a minor suggestion made that the respondent purchaser should have possessed himself of the prior contracts or agreements on which his title of recognition must rest. The thing was impossible.\nThe next way it is put is that the respondent should have had an indorsement on the contract of Gesman or, perhaps, one on each contract all along the line to the company. Who ever heard of a sub-purchaser looking for such a thing? And there is no evidence appellants did so. No case is cited to support these remarkable propositions save such cases as arise from mortgages by deposit of deeds or the like where possession of the deeds is of the essence of the transaction.\nIndeed, in transactions such as this, to require that would be, if not a manifest absurdity, most unusual. Nor can I find anything to distinguish, as against respondent Alexander, the case of assignment of a mortgage from that of an assignment of a purchase of land. Any distinction between them is in favour of Alexander, who in truth acquired an interest in the land, but not by way of security only, as a mortgagee does.\nDart in his work on Vendors and Purchasers (5 ed.), page 837, in a section devoted to the subject, treats purchasers of equitable title as bound by the same rule.\nIn this case we have then the ownership registered in the name of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, who were holders of the certificate of title, and then the agreement of sale to Alexander and notice thereof by the registration of his caveat founded thereon, and the holder of the certificated title acknowledging the authority of the Canadian Northern Prairie Lands Company to sell and submitting its rights and duties to the direction of the court. Can there be anything more to do than declare the equities between the other parties and direct accordingly?\nI agree with the reasoning of the judgment of the court below speaking through Mr. Justice Newlands wherein he relies on sections 136 and 139 of the \u201cLand Titles Act,\u201d now sections 125 and 123. By accident it is in the judgment made to appear as if the first of these sections itself declared the effect, whereas it is the caveator who makes the claims and the result is to render the acquisition of the legal estate by another impossible if the caveator\u2019s claim is rightly founded. It is pointed out in argument here the legal estate is not in question, but that does not dispose of the whole argument, for it only shifts the point and does not get rid of many reasons beginning with the scope of these sections and applying others in same Act which together tend to demonstrate that, considering, as in regard to interests in land we must, the equity of a purchaser filing a caveat, it must be held stronger than who does not. I need not elaborate for this case does not need it.\nI still adhere to the views I expressed in the unreported case of McLeod v. Sawyer-Massey Co. (in 1910) that the clause in agreements of sale denying the right of any purchaser to assign unless with approval of the vendor are, as between others, of no consequence.\nThey are designed to protect a vendor from annoying entanglements and that unless and until the vendor sets up for his own protection any of such stipulations in case of a claim made against or through him no one else has a right to do so.\nThe appellants here try to present the approval in a somewhat different light from what was presented in the former case by suggesting that the first purchaser not having got approval, the second was entitled to assume there was no prior purchaser.\nThis is a new contention I gather from the judgments below and we are not pointed to a line of evidence shewing either ever searched or inquired at the company\u2019s land office.\nWithout such like evidence there is, in my opinion, no foundation for such an argument. It was not until long after purchase that the appellants applied to and got the approval in the vain hope it might in some way help. Meantime the respondents\u2019 caveat was entered and he became entitled, indeed bound, to assert in court his right which could not be defeated by such contrivance; without at least the co-operation of the owner cancelling the original agreement, much less when the owner assumes the attitude it takes here of merely submitting to the direction of the court.\nI have referred to numerous authorities cited in appellants\u2019 factum as if to support some argument to be derived therefrom but fail to see their relevancy save to the point I have fully dealt with as to giving notice, and what I am about to refer to.\nTwo of these authorities are worthy of notice. Rice v. Rice[5], is a case where a vendor\u2019s lien existed yet the purchaser got his assignment with receipt for purchase money indorsed and therewith got the title deeds and by means thereof had by depositing them and this assignment raised a sum of money and absconded.\nIn the face of such a clear equitable mortgage induced by the very acts of the vendor claiming the lien, it was found possible to argue for the vendor\u2019s lien being prior. And why so? Because the position of lien prior in time is so strong as to encourage the hope of overcoming such a later title fortified as this was.\nAnd in the case of Gave v. Gave[6], the rule set out in the maxim was followed after a full examination of Rice v. Rice5, and Phillips v. Phillips[7], and the principles underlying them. I need not set forth the complicated facts of that case. Suffice it to say there seems, to my mind, a great deal more in the facts there than in those here to tempt a judge to discard the maxim, yet it was followed.\nHere the man Gesman had in truth and law nothing to sell when he sold to the appellants.\nIt is only by a fiction, as it were, that we can refer to the second assignment, as an assignment, at all. It can only become an assignment by virtue of some act or omission on the part of him holding the prior assignment that may raise an equity in him getting the second to have the man holding the first restrained from setting it up and thus let the later one operate. How can the approval of the vendor in ignorance of another assignment have any such force as the statutory effect gives the first by virtue of the caveat and all it implies.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting). \u2014 On the 28th February, 1906, the Canadian Northern Railway Co. (acting through the Canadian Northern Prairie Lands Company) agreed by two several agreements to sell to one Potter the two quarter-sections forming the south half of section one in township 32, and range 15 west of the Third Meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan. Before the whole of the purchase price was paid Potter assigned his rights under these agreements to one Gesman, who in turn on the second day of November, 1909, agreed with the respondent Alexander (the plaintiff in the action out of which this appeal arises) to assign his rights to Alexander. On the 4th day of the same month Gesman agreed with the appellants to assign the same rights to them. On the 10th day of November Alexander filed a caveat forbidding any transfer of the lands in question and, on the 29th of that month, the assignment from Gesman to the appellants was completed and, on the 15th of December, the consideration was fully paid. In February, 1910, Alexander brought his action in which he claimed specific performance of his agreement with Gesman and in which he also prayed for an order directing the appellants and the Canadian Northern Railway Co. to execute a proper conveyance to him of the lands that were the subject of these various dealings. The trial judge dismissed the action. The full court reversed this judgment on the ground that, while the appellants had the better equitable rights to a conveyance from the company, the respondent Alexander by filing his caveat had gained priority.\nThe agreements between the Canadian Northern Railway Company and Potter are both in the same form, were executed upon the same day and may for the purposes of this case be considered as if they had been one agreement embodied in one instead of two formal instruments. The purchase money (over and above a certain sum that was paid in cash) was to be paid in five annual instalments the last of these instalments being due the 28th February, 1911. The agreement contemplates and makes careful provision for the assignment of the purchaser\u2019s rights; and it will be necessary to dwell a little upon the effect of the stipulations upon this subject as they appear to me to be a governing ingredient in the considerations which determine the relative priority of the claims upon which we have to pass. The stipulations on part of the purchaser are formally declared by the instrument to be binding upon his assigns; and the instrument contains this clause:\u2014\nNo assignment of this contract shall be valid unless the same shall be for the entire interest of the purchaser, and approved and countersigned on behalf of the company by a duly authorized person, and no agreement or conditions on\u2019 relations between the purchaser and his assignee, or any other person acquiring title or interest from, or through the purchaser, shall preclude the company from the right to convey the premises to the purchaser, on the surrender of this agreement and the payment of the unpaid portion of the purchase-money which may be due hereunder, unless the assignment hereof be approved and countersigned by the said company as aforesaid. But no assignment shall in any way relieve or discharge the purchaser from liability to perform the covenants and pay the monies herein provided to be performed and paid.\nBy these provisions it seems to me the parties have expressed their intention to give to the obligations of the company under the agreement the character of rights which should be personal to the contracting parties to the extent at least that they should be enforceable against the company only by the purchaser or his representatives or by such persons as with the consent of the company should become invested with the purchaser\u2019s rights and should become bound to assume his obligations under the agreement.\nNo assignment shall be valid unless the same shall be for the entire interest of the purchaser.\nThat is to say, the purchaser cannot validly make any partial disposition of his rights; he cannot merely charge them, he cannot attach sub-equities to them; he can only affect them by a disposition which wholly divests him of them and vests them in an assignee who is substituted as purchaser for him. No assignment, moreover, though satisfying this condition, can take effect until it has been assented to by the vendors, until the vendors, that is to say, have accepted and approved of the assignee. The purchaser under such a contract stands, of course, in a position very different from that of a vendee of land under a contract of sale which is in the ordinary form and contains no such stipulation. A purchaser under such a contract may multiply sub-equities to any extent he pleases and the holders of such sub-equities again may each in his turn repeat the same process indefinitely. Where lands are sold under terms by which the payment of the purchase money is deferred for a considerable period during which the contract remains in fieri it is obvious that such sub-equities may become a source of embarrassment to the vendor; and it is doubtless in part with the object of escaping such embarrassment that railway companies (holding large areas of land for the purpose of sale only and having, of course, in re-pect of such lands a very great number of dealings) customarily introduce this clause into the form of contract which they commonly use when small parcels of lands are sold, upon credit.\nBut while the clause is thus beneficial to the company it is of even greater value to the purchaser and his assignee. The assignee whose assignment has been accepted gets the advantage of being placed in direct contractual relations with the vendor and being freed from the necessity of concerning himself about possible equities created by the purchaser in the meantime; and as to the purchaser (who cannot, of course, get a registered title so long as the purchaser\u2019s money remains unpaid) the advantage to him of being enabled to transfer to a sub-purchaser an unimpeachable title to his rights is obvious.\nThat the assignee under an approved assignment does get such a title (I am, of course, assuming now that the assignee is free from any imputation of mala fides) is sufficiently apparent. It is manifest that the assignment contemplated and provided for by the agreement is intended to result, when accepted by the company, in a new agreement between the company and the assignee. By the express terms of the contract the obligations of the purchaser are declared to bind his assignees; and the assignee in presenting his assignment for approval undertakes, of course, to submit to this as well as the other terms of the contract. The company, on the other hand, comes under an obligation to the assignee to perform on its part the contract of sale \u2014 whether because of an implied undertaking with the assignee arising out of the acceptance of the assignment or ipso jure in consequence of the assignment vesting in him the purchaser\u2019s rights is immaterial. The original purchaser is not relieved from responsibility under his covenants, but the effect of the transaction is that the assignee is introduced as a party to the contract of sale; and under the contract so re-constituted the assignee is entitled to the rights, and assumes the primary burden of the correlative obligations of the purchaser as those rights and obligations are therein declared. Now one of the terms of the original contract is as we have seen that no rights under it shall be acquired through any disposition by the purchaser unless such disposition complies with conditions which are only fulfilled by the assignment to the accepted assignee; and consequently nobody claiming rights under the contract through any disposition by the purchaser (which rights obviously cannot be constituted in defiance of the express terms of the contract itself upon which they are founded) can dispute the title of the accepted assignee to the benefit of the purchaser\u2019s rights. The company, in a word, by its acceptance of the assignment becomes a trustee of the land for the purposes defined by the terms of the contract thereby constituted, and according to those terms the land is to pass to the assignee on the performance of the conditions defined. It is argued that the provisions we have been considering are for the benefit of the vendor alone, and that he alone can take the benefit and claim the protection of them. It would be sufficient to say that such a proposition applied to the facts of this case means in the last analysis that the company being under no legal disability to carry out its contract with the assignee may lawfully refuse to do so, for it is perfectly obvious that appreciating the rights of the parties as rights governed by the contract alone the company is legally bound to convey this property to the appellants and is under no sort of legal duty or obligation to Alexander, which creates an impediment in the way of its doing so. The contention, moreover, overlooks the circumstance that a new contract has been formed by which the assignees have come under obligations to the company. In entering into that relation the assignees were entitled to rely on this provision. They were entitled to rely upon it because it was one of the terms of the contract to which it was proposed that they should become parties and it was obviously as much for their benefit as for that of the company; and it is to be presumed that they did rely upon it. As against parties to the contract or persons claiming under the contract either directly or indirectly they are indisputably entitled to any protection which that provision may afford.\nIndeed, as I have pointed out, it is an, unwarrantable assumption to say that this clause was originally framed exclusively in the interests of the company. It is obviously to the interest of all parties that subpurchasers under such an agreement shall be able to pay their purchase money with perfect confidence in the title they are acquiring and on an unsophisticated reading of it, it is manifest that one of the main objects of this clause is to secure to the sub-purchaser an unimpeachable title as against the vendors. That being so, it is impossible to argue that the sub-purchaser is not entitled to the benefit of it or that his rights under it can be neutralized by any action of another party to the contract.\nFrom all this it is clear enough that the respondent Alexander cannot succeed in this action unless there is some other fact or circumstance in addition to his agreement with Gesman which gives him some right of action against the company or the appellants. That he has no right of action against the company is clear, and it is clear also, as a result of the special terms of the agreement, that he can only succeed against the appellants by establishing that he is entitled to have the rights vested in them exercised for his benefit\u2014that the appellants, in a word, are trustees of their rights for him. The contention on behalf of Alexander is that such a trust arises on one of these grounds: 1st, that his caveat bound Gesman\u2019s interest under the agreement for sale from the time it was filed and that the appellants took that interest charged with an obligation to carry out Gesman\u2019s contract with Alexander; 2ndly, that the caveat was, in law, notice to the appellants of Gesman\u2019s contract with Alexander and that they consequently must be held to have acquired Gesman\u2019s interest with notice of Gesman\u2019s breach of trust; and 3rdly, that the appellant\u2019s failure to search the register before paying the purchase money to Gesman was such negligence as to deprive them of the benefit of their legal position under the contract or to require the court to impute to them constructive notice of the facts stated in the caveat which, of course, would have been ascertained if the register had been examined.\nThe first and second of these contentions are, I think, based upon a misconception of the purpose for which the machinery of caveats was devised by the authors of this Act. The fundamental principle of the system of conveyancing established by this and like enactments is that title to land and interests in land is to depend upon registration by a public officer and not upon the effect of transactions inter partes. The Act at the same time recognizes unregistered rights respecting land, confirms the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of such rights and, furthermore, makes provision \u2014 by the machinery of the caveat \u2014 for protecting such rights without resort to the courts. This machinery, however, was designed for the protection of rights \u2014 not for the creation of rights. A caveat prevents any disposition of his title by the registered proprietor in derogation of the caveator\u2019s claim until that claim has been satisfied or disposed of; but the caveator\u2019s claim must stand or fall on its own merits. If the caveator has no right enforceable against the registered owner which entitles him to restrain the alienation of the owner\u2019s title, then the caveat itself cannot and does not impose any burden on the registered title. Alexander\u2019s caveat consequently conferred no right upon him, it could only operate to protect such rights as he had and could enforce against the land, that is to say, against the registered owner of the land. It is quite clear, as I have pointed out, that he had no such rights and the filing of the caveat, therefore, was a wrongful interference with the proprietary rights of the company for which Alexander might have been answerable in damages if the company had sustained any loss in consequence of it. It seems equally clear that the caveat could not affect the appellants as bringing home to them notice of the transaction between Alexander and Gesman. The statute does not say that the caveat shall operate as notice of the facts stated in it to intending purchasers, and there is not anything in the statute giving the least ground or colour for attributing to it any such operation. If an intending purchaser chooses to close his purchase by paying his purchase money without first acquiring a registered title, he runs the risk of finding that he cannot get a registered title until some unregistered claim has been satisfied or some unregistered interest acquired. But he incurs this risk not because he is deemed to have had notice of the claim and for that reason to be bound in good faith to recognize it, but because he can only acquire a title by registration and registration he cannot have free from an enforceable claim against the registered title in face of a caveat founded upon such a claim until that claim has been satisfied or the superiority of his claim has been established.\nSection 173 of the Act, when read together with the provisions respecting caveats, would seem to establish beyond controversy that this view of the effect of a caveat correctly interprets the intention of the statute. \u201cNo person,\u201d the section reads,\ncontracting or dealing with * * * owner of land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall except in case of land by such person * * * be affected by any trust or unregistered interest in land any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\nIt would be strange if after this formal declaration the legislature had proceeded to provide a statutory method of affecting the conscience of the purchaser with notice of unregistered interests. The assumption that the legislature has provided such a method in the system of caveats seems to be unwarrantable. The operation of the caveat according to the design of the Act (as affecting a purchaser) is, I think, aptly expressed in Lord Redesdale\u2019s language in Underwood v. Lord Courtown[8], at page 66; it is to \u201cbind his title not his conscience.\u201d\nThe third ground of relief is put in this way. Alexander, it is said, had an equitable right which was prior in time to the equitable right of the appellants, and the subsequent right of the appellants ought not to be permitted to displace his prior right, 1st, because the appellants, in failing to search for caveats before closing their purchase from Gesman were guilty of such gross negligence as to make it inequitable to permit them to retain the advantage arising from their contract with the company; or 2nd, because the appellants, by reason of their neglect to search the register, had constructive notice of Alexander\u2019s claim.\nTo the first of these contentions, there is an objection which seems to me to be absolutely fatal, and it is this. The maxim qui prior est tempore potior est jure, is (as a great equity judge, Turner, L.J., said, in Cory v. Eyre[9], at page 167):\u2014\nfounded * * * on this principle, that the creation or declaration of a trust vests an estate and interest in the subject-matter of the trust in the person in whose favour the trust is created or declared. Where, therefore, it is sought, * * * to postpone an equitable title created by declaration of trust, there is an estate or interest to be displaced. No doubt there may be cases so strong as to justify this being done, but there can be as little doubt that a strong case must be required to justify it.\nLord Westbury explains the maxim in the celebrated case of Phillips v. Phillips[10], in language which is to the same effect. The maxim has never been applied in favour of persons who have neither by themselves nor by those whose rights they are asserting, had any legal or equitable interest in the land which was the subject of the dispute.\nIt is clear, as I have said, that Alexander never acquired any right which he could compel the registered owner to recognize and, therefore, he never had a right which in any lawyerly use of the words could be described as an interest in land. His right was and remained a personal right against Gesman, enforceable no doubt by equitable remedies, both against Gesman and against others who might be implicated in Gesinan\u2019s breach of faith, but still only a personal right because of the special provisions of the contract with the company under which Alexander could acquire no claim against the registered proprietors until they had assented to his assignment. It is argued that Gesman was the owner of the land in equity, but this seems really to be an abuse of language (see Fry, Specific Performance, p. 675, sec. 1382; and Riclout v. Fowler[11], at pages 661 and 662, per Farwell J.). The company, it may be admitted, was a trustee in a limited sense. It is inaccurate to say that the company held the land in trust for the purpose of fulfilling the agreement of sale. But as I have pointed out, that trust is defined by the agreement; and only those can in any admissible sense of the words be said to have acquired a beneficial interest in the land who have acquired or in other words are entitled to enforce some rights under the agreement. In this Alexander fails; his right (in the sense indicated) though in process of consummation was never consummated. The wrong done him by Gesman was not to aid in defeating an unregistered right in the land (or against its registered owner) already constituted, but in preventing Alexander from constituting such a right by effectively transferring to the appellants the rights he had agreed to vest in Alexander. If the appellants were implicated in this wrong the court would find a means of making them account for what they acquired by means of it. But that must at least involve finding in them either guilty knowledge or guilty ignorance of Gesman\u2019s wrong-doing \u2014 neither of which is suggested.\nThe contention, moreover, fails because there is no adequate ground for imputing any such misconduct or negligence to the appellants as would justify the court in holding them accountable as trustees for Alexander.\nThe test to be applied is stated by Lindley, M.R., in Oliver v. Hinton[12], at page 274:\u2014\nTo deprive a purchaser for value without notice of a prior incumbrance of the protection of the legal estate, it is not, in my opinion, essential that he should have been guilty of fraud; it is sufficient that he has been guilty of such gross negligence as would render it unjust to deprive the prior incumbrancer of his priority.\nIt may be observed in passing that Lindley L.J. is not here dealing with constructive notice; he is assuming an absence of notice, either actual or constructive, and even in the absence of notice, the case from which his observation is taken decides that gross negligence, such as a failure to require the production of the title deeds, may deprive even a purchaser for value without notice of the right to retain his legal advantage, whatever it may be, to the disadvantage of the holder of a prior equitable interest. I have pointed out that Alexander is not the holder of such an interest \u2014 but putting aside that objection, we come to consider whether the appellant\u2019s negligence (so called) in failing to examine the register is of the kind or degree which Lindley L.J. had in view.\nI should say before proceeding to apply this doctrine to the facts that I think it is doubtful whether the doctrine is one which can safely or properly be applied to impeach the rights of a purchaser contracting directly with a registered owner under the Act. I think there is something to be said in favour of the view that it cannot be applied consistently with the objects to be obtained by registration of title and that the design of the Act is that, as against such a purchaser, unregistered interests should depend for their protection upon caveats operating directly to bind the title of the registered proprietor. Doctrines developed under the old system of conveyancing for the protection of equitable rights ought no doubt to be applied very guardedly for the purpose of deciding controversies respecting unregistered interests in registered land; and the utmost vigilance ought to be observed to avoid the mistake of yielding a punctilious allegiance to the letter of a rule evolved under widely different conditions without determining to what extent the principle which underlies the rule is in the circumstances properly applicable. For the purposes of this case, however, I assume that the doctrine as stated by Lindley L.J., is applicable. If I am right in the opinion I have expressed as to the effect of the appellants\u2019 contract with the company, it is perfectly clear that negligence cannot be imputed to him because of his failure to make inquiries respecting dealings of Gesman. Gesman produced his agreement with the company and the assignment approved, and the appellants were entitled to rely upon that. A cautious or suspicious man might have done more, but they were not bound to be suspicious, and they are not to lose their legal rights because they might by \u201cprudent caution\u201d (to use Lord Cranworth\u2019s phrase in Ware v. Egmont[13], at page 473), have obtained more information than they did unless they have been guilty of \u201cgross and culpable negligence.\u201d As Lord Selborne said in Agra Bank v. Barry[14], at page 157, the purchaser owes no duty to the \u201cpossible holder of a latent title\u201d to exercise care with regard to the title of his vendor. A purchaser is under no legal obligation to investigate his vendor\u2019s title. Bailey v. Barnes[15], at page 35. The only relevant question is, were the assignees (from the point of view exclusively of their own interests) guilty of \u201cgross and culpable negligence\u201d in not examining the register? As regards the absence of concern respecting dealings by Gesman \u2014 which could not affect him \u2014 the point seems clear; it is only \u201cby falling into the error attributed to those who are wise after the event\u201d (see per Lindley L.J., in Bailey v. Barnes[16], at page 34), that one could charge the appellant with negligence in that respect. Then, can it be fairly said that in view of possible dealings by the company itself their failure to search was \u201cgross and culpable negligence?\u201d\nIt is quite clear that a purchaser acquiring property in the ordinary way under an arrangement such as that entered into by Potter with a great railway company, cannot avoid such risks as there may be in the possibility of fraud by the company with which he deals. No amount of vigilance on his part could, for example, prevent the ultimate registration of a transfer in course of transmission to the registry at the moment of the execution of his agreement for purchase. In the absence of fraud, however, there is no risk; and suffice it to say, that in such purchases the possibility of such frauds does not enter into the calculations of purchasers unless at least they are abnormally given to suspicion. It, in my judgment, would be laying down a rule utterly at variance with the habits and modes of thought of people who engage in such transactions, to hold that it was gross and culpable negligence or indeed negligence in any degree for a purchaser in such a transaction to act upon the assumption that the company\u2019s good faith could be relied upon with absolute confidence. I think, for these reasons, that the suggestion that there was negligence of such a character as to be material here is utterly baseless.\nAs to constructive notice I am inclined to think that as regards purchasers dealing with the registered owner, the doctrine has been swept away by section 173 of the Act, and that the protection for unregistered interests substituted for it is the filing of caveats. As regards titles completed by registration it clearly has no place in the scheme of the Act. I am aware that in the Australasian courts, the first of these propositions appears to have been doubted, but I have seen no case in which the decision depended in any way upon a recognition of the doctrine as applicable to determine the rights of a purchaser from a registered owner. Knowledge and notice, of course, must often present themselves as ingredients in fraud or in the facts from which fraud may be inferred, or in the circumstances giving rise to an estoppel or an equity of some description affecting the relative priorities of unregistered claims; but notice of an unregistered right or interest in itself cannot, I think, affect the right of a purchaser dealing bon\u00e2 fide with a registered owner.\nThere is no necessary analogy between the position of a proposed purchaser dealing with a registered proprietor of land under a system of title by registration, and the position of a purchaser of land where no such system exists. In the course of centuries an elaborate system of rules has been developed touching the proof of title which such a purchaser is entitled to demand from his vendor and the practice of conveyancers points out the course a prudent solicitor will follow in order to protect the purchaser\u2019s rights. It was to avoid the delay, the uncertainty and the expense attendant upon the investigation of titles that the system of title by registration was devised; and one of the most fruitful sources of uncertainty and expense which the authors of this system designed to clear out of the way, was this doctrine of constructive notice. See Report of Commissioners on Registration, 1857, Hogg, \u201cIncumbrances,\u201d pages 8 and 26. Not the least of the difficulties attending upon the application of the doctrine of constructive notice has always been the vagueness of the doctrine itself.\nEvery one who has attempted to define the doctrine of constructive notice has declared his inability to satisfy himself,\nsaid Lord St. Leonards in the 14th edition of his work on Vendors and Purchasers. An attempted definition inserted in a bill introduced by that great property lawyer in 1862 proved to be so unsatisfactory that it was struck out with the consent of the author of the bill. Again and again eminent judges in both common law and equity courts have declared that the doctrine has been carried too far and is not to be extended. In English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Co. v. Brunton[17], at page 708, Lord Esher, M.R. said:\u2014\nIn a series of cases Lords Cottenham, Lyndhurst and Cranworth, Lord Justice Turner and the late Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, have said that the doctrine ought not to be extended one bit farther; all the judges seem to have agreed upon that. In Allen v. Seclcham[18], I pointed out that the doctrine is a dangerous one. It is contrary to the truth. It is wholly founded on the assumption that a man does not know the facts; and yet it is said that constructively he does know them.\nBowen and Kay L.JJ. accepted this view. In the \u201cBirnam Wood\u201d[19], at page 14, Farwell L.J. said:\u2014\nThe courts have of late years been unwilling to apply the principle of constructive notice so as to fix companies or persons with knowledge of facts of which they had no knowledge whatever.\nAnd in the last edition of Dart on Vendors and Purchasers, at page 902, it is stated that\nthe tendency is to restrict the doctrine of constructive notice so far as is compatible with the rules of the court-applicable to fraud. In the latest decision of the Court of Appeal dealing with the subject, the view expressed by Lindley L.J. is that the doctrine comes into play only when there are facts justifying an inference of knowledge or circumstances indicative of wilful ignorance.\nIt is not necessary to decide whether or not the doctrine has any application in this case, because if I am right in the view I have just expressed, that the facts do not warrant any imputation of gross negligence \u2014 \u00e0 fortiori they do not support an imputation of fraud or of that wilful departure from the usual course of business \u201cin order to avoid acquiring a knowledge of a vendor\u2019s title\u201d or that \u201cwilful ignorance of defects\u201d which according to the view expressed by Lindley L.J., in the case above referred to (Bailey v. Barnes[20], at pages 34, 35), it would be necessary to shew in order to impute constructive notice to the appellants. As Lindley L.J. said in that case \u201cthe doctrine of constructive notice,\u201d i.e., as expounded in his judgment,\nis designed to prevent frauds on owners of property; but the doctrine must not be carried to such an extent as to defeat honest purchasers; and although this limitation has sometimes been lost sight of, still the limitation is as important and is as well known as the doctrine itself.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendants, McKillop & Benjafield, appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc reversing the judgment of Johnstone J., who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for specific performance holding that the defendants, although subsequent purchasers, by their diligence in procuring an actual assignment of their immediate vendor\u2019s interest and the approval thereof by the original vendor, the railway company, in which the legal estate was vested, and by obtaining possession of the original contract of sale made by the company with such approval indorsed thereon, had acquired a position \u201cmuch stronger in equity than that of the plaintiff,\u201d who \u201chad nothing more than an agreement to assign.\u201d\nThe sale to the plaintiff was of one-half of the section purchased by his vendor: the sale to the defendant was of the whole section.\nThe court en banc was of opinion that the registration by the plaintiff of a caveat in respect of his claim, prior to the defendants\u2019 completing their purchase and obtaining the assent of the original vendor to the assignment to them of the interest of the original vendee, prevented the defendants from acquiring any right or interest in the land except subject to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nThe facts of the case are briefly, but sufficiently, summarized by Newlands J., as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff first obtained an equitable estate in the said half-section of land. Subsequently, but without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s equitable estate, the defendants, McKillop and Benjafield, also obtained an equitable estate in the said land. Before anything further was done by the said defendants, the plaintiff filed a caveat in the proper land titles office against the said lands, after which the said defendants completed their purchase and had the assignment to them approved of by the owner of the legal estate.\nApart from the effect of the \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d of Saskatchewan (6 Edw. VII. ch. 24), and of the caveat lodged by the plaintiff pursuant to its provisions, I incline to the view that the defendants would have been entitled to succeed, because, although subsequent purchasers, they had the best right to call for a conveyance of the outstanding legal estate and were, therefore, in equity entitled to its protection. Dart on Vendors and Purchasers (7 ed.), p. 845. They held this position not because they had given notice of their purchase to the holder of the legal estate, which the plaintiff had omitted to do, Hopkins v. Hemsworth[21], nor because the plaintiff had omitted to have a note of his purchase indorsed on the original contract from the railway company, Jones v. Jones[22] (points much insisted on at bar), but because they had obtained the consent of the railway company to the assignment to them of their vendor\u2019s interest in the land. As a result of the original sale the railway company became a trustee of the property for its purchaser, who in the eye of a court of equity was the real beneficial owner, Shaw v. Foster[23], at page 338. The defendants were purchasers of his interest for value and without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. They procured the railway company to become a party to the conveyance to them of that equitable interest by obtaining its consent to the assignment under which they claim. Although the company did not formally convey or declare a trust of the legal estate in favour of the defendants, its privity and consent to the assignment to them gave them a position which (apart always from the effect of the \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d and of the caveat lodged by the plaintiff under it) was such that a court of equity would not interfere to deprive them of the better right so obtained to call for the conveyance of the legal estate; Wilkes v. Bodington[24]; Wilmot v. Pike[25], at page 22; Taylor v. London and County Banking Co.[26], at pages 262-3. The effect of this consent of the railway company on the defendants\u2019 rights is certainly not lessened by the presence in the company\u2019s original agreement for sale of the following special clause:\u2014\nNo assignment of this contract shall be valid unless the same shall be for the entire interest of the purchaser, and approved and countersigned on behalf of the company by a duly authorized person, and no agreement or conditions or relations between the purchaser and his assignee or any other person acquiring title or interest from or through the purchaser shall preclude the company from the right to convey the premises to the purchaser, on the surrender of this agreement and the payment of the unpaid portion of the purchase-money which may be due hereunder, unless the assignment hereof be approved and countersigned by the said company as aforesaid.\nBut before the defendants obtained the assent of the railway company and when they had paid only $700 on account of their purchase money and there was still $1,800 unpaid, the plaintiff lodged in the land titles office his caveat forbidding\nthe registration of any transfer or any instrument affecting (the half-section in which he claimed an interest) unless such instrument is expressed subject to my claim.\nThe agreement for purchase held by the plaintiff was an \u201cinstrument\u201d within the meaning of clause 11 of section 2 of the \u201cLand Titles Act.\u201d Under section 136 the plaintiff was entitled to lodge a caveat in respect of his interest under that agreement; and when so lodged and while it remained in force, under section 139 the caveat had the effect of preventing the registrar from registering\nany memorandum of any transfer or other instrument purporting to transfer, encumber or otherwise deal with or affect the land in respect to which such caveat was lodged except subject to the claim of the caveator.\nThat the caveat remained in force is not questioned. Although challenged on the ground that it did not shew the interest of the caveator, the caveat, in my opinion, sufficiently complied with the requirements of section 137. It stated the claim of the caveator to be as\nthe owner of the south half-section one, in township thirty-two (32), and range fifteen (15) west of the third meridian in the Province of Saskatchewan, under and by virtue of an agreement for sale in writing of the said property to me from G. A. Gessman of the City of DesMoines in the State of Iowa, one of the United States of America, agent.\nIt did not give the number of the certificate of title as prescribed in the form \u201cW.\u201d But, in view of the complete description of the land which it contained, that was, in my opinion, unnecessary. The provision of section 137 should, I think, be regarded as directory and intended for the guidance of registrars. Wilkie v. Jellett[27]. If a caveat enables the registrar to identify the land in respect of which it is lodged and if the interest claimed is stated with reasonable certainty, he properly receives it and, when duly lodged, it has the effect contemplated by the statute, although in some particular it should not be in strict compliance with the prescribed form.\nA certificate of title to the land in question had been granted to the Canadian Northern Railway Company. Section 73 of the statute is as follows:\u2014\nAfter a certificate of title has been granted for any land, no instrument until registered under this Act shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in any (sic) land except a leasehold interest not exceeding three years or render such land liable as security for the payment of money.\nBy section 74 it is provided that\nupon the registration of any instrument * * * the estate, or interest specified therein shall pass; and by section 80, it is enacted that\nevery instrument shall become operative according to the tenor and intent thereof, so soon as registered and shall thereupon create, transfer, etc., the land, or estate or interest therein, mentioned in such instrument.\nUnder clause 11 of section 2, \u201cinstrument\u201d means\nany grant, etc., or any other document in writing relating to or affecting the transfer of or dealing with land or evidencing title thereto.\nUnder this definition the contracts both of the plaintiff and of the defendants were \u201cinstruments.\u201d Neither of them created or transferred any interest under the Act because unregistered. But the equitable interests or estates conferred by them would nevertheless be recognized and dealt with and would be enforced against the registered owner and others adverse in interest, in the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity, Re Massey and Gibson[28]. The plaintiff\u2019s caveat from the time it was lodged prevented the registration of any instrument except subject to his claim (section 139). Prim\u00e2 facie that means subject to his claim as it stood at the time when the caveat was lodged. At that time both the plaintiff and the defendant had equitable rights as purchasers. The plaintiff had an agreement for a sale to him in respect of which he had paid $100 on account; the defendants had a like agreement in respect of which they had paid $700 on account. Inasmuch as every conveyance of an equitable interest is innocent, the defendants not having at that time taken any steps which would entitle them to priority or, which is the same thing, would entitle them to ask a court of equity not to interfere to deprive them of any acquired right to call for a conveyance of the legal estate, and the plaintiff not having done or omitted to do anything whereby his priority would be impaired or affected, the defendants\u2019 claim as purchasers was still subject to his prior equity in respect of the half-section bought by him. That the plaintiff\u2019s caveat, if it had been lodged only after the defendants had obtained the formal assignment of their vendor\u2019s contract and had procured the assent of the railway company thereto, would still have sufficed to entitle him to prevent the registration of the defendants as owners under a conveyance to them from the railway company seems to me improbable, inasmuch as, apart from the provisions of the \u201cLand Titles Act,\u201d the defendants would then have had a better right to call for the conveyance of the legal estate and would in equity be entitled to the protection of it against the plaintiff\u2019s prior equitable claim. But that question it is not now necessary to determine.\nWhether a caveat duly lodged should be deemed notice is apparently an open question. General Finance, Agency and Guarantee Go. v. The Perpetual Executors and Trustees\u2019 Association[29], at page 744. Whether the plaintiff\u2019s caveat was in the present case notice to the appellants, in view of the fact that before it was lodged they had already made their contract and paid part of their purchase money, is, in the opinion of Newlands J., open to considerable doubt. But whatever its effect as notice, (and I incline to the view that it must be deemed notice to every person who claims to have acquired, subsequently to its being lodged, any interest in the lands, or to have increased or bettered any such interest already held), inasmuch as it is the only means provided for the protection of unregistered interests and it was obviously intended by the legislature thus to afford adequate and sufficient protection for them, I am of the opinion that a caveat when properly lodged prevents the acquisition or the bettering or increasing of any interest in the land, legal or equitable, adverse to or in derogation of the claim of the caveator \u2014 at all events, as it exists at the time when the caveat is lodged. This, in my opinion, is the necessary result of a fair construction of sections 73, 74, 80, 81, 136 and 139 of the \u201cLand Titles Act.\u201d I would refer to General Finance, Agency and Guarantee Go. v. Perpetual Executors and Trustees\u2019 Association[30]; and Re Scanlan[31].\nMoreover, as a document affecting the transfer of land, a caveat is an \u201cinstrument\u201d; and section 81 provides that\ninstruments registered in respect of or affecting the same land shall be entitled to priority, the one over the other according to the time of registration and not according to the date of execution.\nIt was, I think, incumbent upon the defendants McKillop & Benjafield before completing their purchase, to ascertain that no caveat had been lodged against the land, and, in default of their having done so, they cannot complain if the prior equity of the plaintiff, protected by his caveat, is held to be paramount. As put by Lilley C.J. in Re Scanlon31, it is a\nplain, practical precaution for a purchaser * * * to ascertain that there is no caveat (in the registry) before he pays his purchase-money. * * * People cannot learn too soon that dealings outside, and without reference to the registry, are hazardous. The judgment for specific performance, against the defendants Gesman and McKillop & Benjafield appears to be unimpeachable. The Canadian Northern Railway Company having submitted their rights to the court may be taken to have waived any right which they might have had to refuse to approve of or recognize the assignment from Gesman to the plaintiff. Since they do not set up against the plaintiff the special clause in their agreement above quoted, their co-defendants cannot do so. The judgment for specific performance as against the company would, therefore, appear to have been quite proper. I express no opinion as to what the result should have been, if, in answer to the action, the railway company had pleaded and relied upon the special clause referred to and the exercise of any discretion which it conferred upon them.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Embury, Watkins & Scott.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ferguson & McDermid.\n[1] 4 Sask.

VII. c. 95\u2014R.S.Q., 1909, tit. XI.\u2014 \u201cCities and Towns Act.\u201d\nThe council of the Town of Shawinigan Falls, acting under a special Act of incorporation, 8 Edw. VIL ch. 95, and the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d R.S.Q., 1909, Title XI., enacted a by-law authorizing the purchase by the municipality of the appellants\u2019 electric light and power plant, which was situated outside the municipal boundaries, but within twenty miles thereof, for the purpose of establishing a system of electric lighting and waterworks within the municipality The price was to be paid in part by annual instalments, to be secured by the promissory notes of the municipal corporation, and the balance, being the amount of a subsisting hypothec and interest thereon, was to be satisfied by the corporation assuming the hypothecary obligations. The by-law had not been approved by a vote of the ratepayers, and it did not impose a special rate to meet interest and establish a sinking-fund, as required by article 5668 R.S.Q., 1909.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, (Q.R. 19 K.B. 546), Anglin J. dissenting, that the by-law was invalid.\nHeld, per Davies, Idington and Duff JJ., that the municipal corporation had no power to establish such works outside the boundaries of the municipality. Per Anglin J; dissenting, that in view of the situation of the electric and power plant, the peculiar circumstances of the case, and the special provisions of the Act incorporating the town, it was competent for the municipal corporation to acquire the property and to establish and maintain the works in question.\nPer Davies J., Anglin J. contra, that the by-law was invalid for want of provision, either in itself or in another by-law contemporaneously enacted, fixing the necessary rate for the purpose of meeting interest and establishing a sinking-fund, as required by article 56\u201968 R.S.Q., 1909.\nPer Idington J., Anglin J. contra, that the by-law was one which required the approval of the ratepayers of the municipality, as provided by article 5783 R.S.Q., 1909, respecting loans, and, as their assent had not been obtained prior to enactment the by-law was invalid.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The statutory obligation in respect of the imposition of a special rate to meet interest and establish a sinking-fund would be discharged by the levy of the necessary rates for those purposes from year to year until the debt to be incurred was extinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers, and maintaining the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs.\nBy the judgment appealed from the municipal by-law in question, authorizing the purchase of the electric light and power plant of the Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co., was quashed and the municipal corporation of the Town of Shawinigan Falls and its officers were perpetually restrained from giving any effect thereto. The municipal corporation submitted to the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the hydro-electric company took the present appeal.\nThe issues raised are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion E.G. for the appellants.\nF. Meredith E.G. and Holden, for the respondents. The Chief Justice.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought to annul a by-law passed by the council of the Town of Shawinigan Falls authorizing the purchase from the appellants of immovable property with a power-house and plant thereon for $40,750, the property being admittedly situated outside of and beyond the territorial limits of the town. The sum of $15,750, part of the purchase money, was to be paid the vendor company in certain specified yearly instalments for which promissory notes were to be given by the town to the company. The balance of the purchase money, $25,000, was made payable\nto the succession of the late William Burn to discharge the hypothec for that amount created by the company in favour of such succession.\nIn other words, the town proposed in its by-law to give its promissory notes in part payment of the purchase money and to assume an existing mortgage on the property for the balance. The by-law declared that the properties were being acquired by the town\nfor the purpose of an aqueduct and for the establishment of a system of electric lighting,\nfor the town and its inhabitants.\nThe by-law was adopted without having been previously submitted to the town\u2019s electors for approval and without incorporating in it, or otherwise providing for, a special annual tax to meet interest on the purchase money and provide a sinking fund. There was no indication in the by-law as to who or what property would be taxed.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action holding the by-law to be valid. The court of appeal (Archambault and Lavergne JJ. dissenting) allowed the appeal and annulled the by-law, on the grounds that the manner and way of establishing such a system of electric lighting as that contemplated was either that specially indicated in the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d (1903), consolidated in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, arts 5256 et seq., namely, by the imposition of a special annual tax on certain specially designated properties to defray the annual interest and to provide a sinking-fund and pay off the principal, or by the general method, namely, a loan with the approval of the rate-payers, neither of which was adopted by the council. The court of appeal further held that the town had not the power to issue promissory notes in part payment of the purchase money of the powerhouse and plant, etc., nor to assume the payment of the Burn mortgage which they held to amount indirectly to contracting a loan without the approval of the ratepayers.\nThe town submitted to the judgment of the court of appeal and the vendors (defendants) appeal to this court.\nThe questions raised before us are of great general importance involving the proper construction of the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d of the Province of Quebec, 1903, and the powers and limitations of the councils of the towns and cities which come under its operation.\nThe appellants deny the validity of each and all of the grounds invoked to annul the by-law, and contend that the council had full power to purchase as they did, and give the promissory notes and assume the hypothec for the purchase money.\nThe respondents, in addition to supporting the judgment of the court of appeal on the grounds stated in their judgment contended that the by-law was illegal because the property attempted to be purchased was beyond the territorial limits of the town and necessarily involved, if purchased for the purposes intended, the carrying on of business outside of the town\u2019s territorial limits.\nI have given much consideration to the questions involved and have reached the conclusion that the by-law is invalid and that the appeal should be dismissed on the two grounds, 1st, that neither the Act of 1908, 8 Edw. VII. ch. 95, revising and consolidating the charter of the Town of Shawinigan Falls, nor the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d 1903, to the operation of which the town, by the 2nd section of the Act of 1908, is expressly made subject, authorized the council to pass the by-law in question for the purchase of the power-house, plant and property outside of its territorial limits; and 2ndly, if the extra-territoriality of the property purchased was not a fatal objection, the absence of the statutory provision, either in the by-law itself or otherwise, for meeting the interest on the cost of the purchase and to establish a sinking-fund to liquidate the principal as provided for in the section 5668, R.S.Q., of the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d was fatal.\nThese two clauses of the Act, R.S.Q., arts. 5667 and 5668, are so important and controlling that I set them out in full:\u2014\n5667. The council shall have all the necessary powers for the establishment and management of a system of lighting by gas, electricity or otherwise, for the requirements of the public and of private individuals or companies desiring to light their houses, buildings or establishments.\n5668. The council may, by by-law, in order to meet the interest on the sums expended in introducing a system of lighting and to establish a sinking-fund, impose on all the owners or occupants of houses, shops or other buildings, an annual special tax, on the assessed value of each such house, building or establishment, including the land. I do not think the general loan-clauses of the Act contained in para. 28, articles 5776 to 5789, could be invoked to borrow the purchase moneys required. If they could, any by-law under them would require the\napproval of a majority in number and in real value of the proprietors who are municipal electors and who have, voted.\nOf course no such approval was sought for in this case because no attempt to borrow money under the loan-clauses of the Act was resorted to; but it was strongly contended by Mr. Geoffrion that, if the council could resort to the general loan clauses of the Act to raise the money required and was not limited to the special method designated by article 5668, they could on similar reasoning resort to any other general power the Act gave and that the one they resorted to was, therefore, good.\nIt is true that article 5776 of these loan-clauses authorizes the council to \u201cborrow moneys generally for all objects within its jurisdiction,\u201d but I do not think these general words could be construed to apply \u201cto the establishment and management of a system of lighting\u201d as given in article 5667 because the method of raising the necessary funds for that special purpose is pointed out and defined in article 5668 and involves a special annual tax to defray interest and provide for sinking fund upon a special class of ratepayers and a special class of property.\nThe \u201cspecial annual tax\u201d required to be levied to meet the interest and the sinking-fund, under the general clauses relating to loans, is to be levied upon all the ratepayers and the council is obliged to provide for such interest and sinking fund \u201cout of the general revenues of the municipality\u201d while the \u201cspecial annual tax\u201d required to be, levied for the establishment and maintenance of a system of lighting is to be levied upon the special class of ratepayers who own or occupy houses, shops or other buildings, and upon this special class of property only. This would seem to my mind conclusive as against the right of the council to invoke these general loan clauses for the establishment of a system of lighting.\nI do not agree with the contention that, because the legislature used the word \u201cmay\u201d in this section of the Act and not \u201cshall\u201d that, therefore, the provision is to be construed as permissive only and not imperative. I think the intention of the legislature to authorize the establishment and management of a system of lighting is clearly expressed in article 5667 and the intention that the cost of such establishment and its maintenance should be imposed upon a specially designated class of citizens, and a specially designated class of property is equally clearly expressed in article 5668.\nThe exercise of the power to establish and manage the system necessarily involved resort to the special method prescribed of raising the necessary funds. It was not, in my opinion, open to the council to evade that expressed intention by adopting another and different system, such as borrowing the necessary moneys under the loan-clauses of the Act, or issuing promissory notes for the purchase money, and so throwing the burden off the special class and the special properties the Act said should bear it, upon the shoulders of the ratepayers generally.\nSomething might possibly be said in favour of the council\u2019s power to raise the necessary moneys by \u201cloan\u201d because such method involved the submission of the by-law to the ratepayers for their approval and, from that standpoint at any rate, might not appear as unjust, but for the reasons I have given I do not think resort could be had to an ordinary loan to establish the lighting system.\nBut I certainly cannot find any reason for so construing articles 5667 and 5668 as to justify the council\u2019s action in evading the expressed intention of the legislature by adopting a method of establishing a lighting system which, if sustained, would impose upon the town and the ratepayers generally a heavy debt with its necessary accompanying taxation, without either submitting a by-law, for the power to borrow the money necessary, to the municipal electors or imposing the special tax prescribed upon the owners or occupants of the property built upon for the payment of the interest and the sinking-fund.\nThis by-law, the annulment of which is sought for in this action, neither imposes the special tax required to be levied for the establishment of a lighting system nor provides for the raising of money by loan to pay for such establishment. The method adopted of giving the notes of the municipality for part of the purchase money and assuming the payment of the hypothec then upon the property for the balance of such money without either resorting to a loan which involved obtaining the approval of the electors, or to the prescribed taxation upon the house and building owners, was, in my judgment, a bold attempt to evade the expressed intention of the legislature.\nIt was sought to uphold the power to give the town\u2019s promissory notes for part and to assume the amount of the hypothec then upon the property for the balance of the purchase money under the general powers given to the council by article 5279, but, as I have already said, in my opinion, these general powers are like the loan-clauses and have no application to the special power given to establish and maintain a lighting system which is coupled with a special and prescribed method of raising the moneys necessary for the purpose on special classes of ratepayers and property. This method and this alone, in my opinion, can be resorted to when carrying out the powers given to establish a lighting system and when the council formally determines to establish such a system the duty becomes imperative upon it to provide the means of paying the interest and the annual sinking-fund in the special manner prescribed by the Act. The word \u201cmay\u201d in the section must be read as \u201cshall\u201d and when imposing a debt upon the town for the establishment of a lighting system the council must at the same time provide for the imposition of the taxes prescribed by article 5668 necessary to pay the interest and the sinking fund to discharge that debt.\nIt is contended that the council may yet do this and that the by-law under which the property was purchased and the debt imposed upon the town is not necessarily bad because neither in it nor otherwise concurrently with it was any attempt made to comply with these special provisions of the Act.\nIn my judgment it is entirely opposed to the scheme and objects authorized by the legislature that the council should in the first place establish the system and impose the debt upon the town and leave to the chapter of accidents the adoption of the methods of defraying the expenditure specially indicated by the legislature. The establishing of the system and the incurring of the liability for the necessary expenditure were made, by the statute, duties to be exercised contemporaneously with the imposition of the taxes specially authorized to meet that expenditure. Difficulties of one kind and another have been suggested as to the working out of the statutory scheme, but I do not see any that are insuperable, and if there are any such they can be met only by amending legislation and cannot affect the proper construction of the articles and clauses of the Act as they now stand.\nThe next reason why I hold the by-law to be illegal is that the property purchased by virtue of it and the business to be carried on and in connection with the power-house to generate the electricity required, is beyond the territorial limits of the town and not authorized by the Act.\nArticle 5667 of the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d R.S.Q., 1909, which confers the power to establish and maintain a lighting system was amended by the special Act of 1908 revising and consolidating the charter of the Town of Shawinigan Falls, section 18, by adding words authorizing the council to sell\nthe surplus power produced by the power generating the electricity which it may have acquired or established for such purpose to the municipality of the Village of the Shawinigan Falls or to its inhabitants and to the Grand\u2019M\u00e8re Electric Company or its successors.\nThe village and the company alike are beyond the territorial limits of the Town of Shawinigan Falls, and it has been suggested that the amendment conferred upon the town other and broader powers than the article 5667 of the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d gave. It certainly does so far as the sale of surplus power is concerned; but not otherwise. The legislature evidently thought that the right to sell surplus power outside the town\u2019s territorial limits required express words to confer it, while if the appellants\u2019 contention is sound that the general words of the section as amended authorized the establishment of power-houses to generate electricity outside the territorial limits of the towns, the lesser power of selling the surplus power to other towns or companies would be necessarily implied and the express power to sell outside unnecessary. The amendment, therefore, rather indicates that the legislature did not intend, in passing article 5668 of the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d to confer the greater power upon the towns and cities of establishing power-plants for lighting purposes beyond their limits.\nBut, assuming the amendment not to have any effect upon the construction of article 5667 beyond the express powers the words of the amendment give \u2014 what is the true construction of this article 5667 of the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d?\nThe consolidated Act of 1909, by its first section, is made applicable not only to all cities and towns thereafter incorporated by statute or letters patent, but to all cities and towns under special Acts which shall be declared subject to the general Act and to all cities and towns which had become subject to the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d of 1903.\nIt is, therefore, practically a general Act applicable to the towns and cities of the whole province brought within its operation and is to be construed as such and not with reference to any special local conditions of particular cities or towns.\nNo language of any kind is used indicating an intention that the powers given might be used outside of the territorial limits of the municipality, and to give such a construction to the section it would be essential to hold that the application of such powers extra-territorially was clearly intended because they were necessary to the exercise of the powers themselves. Reading the Act as a whole, I am drawn to the conclusion that general words conferring powers upon a municipality brought within its operation must be given a territorial limitation unless from the very nature of the power it must be held that it was to be exercised extra-territorially, and that where it is intended that general powers, not absolutely necessary to be exercised extra-territorially, should, nevertheless, be so exercised, apt language must be shewn to evidence such a legislative intention.\nBead articles 5280 and 5281, B.S.Q., 1909, which are as follows:\u2014\n5280. The territory of the municipality shall be that specified by its charter.\n5281. The corporation shall have jurisdiction for municipal and police purposes and for the exercise of all the powers conferred upon it, over the whole of its territory, and also beyond its territory in special cases where more ample, authority is conferred upon it.\nHere is found an express declaration that not only for municipal and police purposes, but for the exercise of all the powers conferred upon it the corporation should only have jurisdiction \u201cbeyond its territory in special cases where more ample authority is conferred upon it.\u201d That declaration seems to me to impose upon a corporation, acting under the powers given in that Act, the duty of shewing either that the powers the exercise of which were challenged as illegal were exercised within territorial limits, or, if beyond those limits, were only carried beyond to an extent necessary for their exercise, and so fairly to be implied from the language conferring the power, or that express power to exercise the challenged powers beyond territorial limits was given.\nThen article 5588 (section X.), under the heading or sub-title \u201cPowers of the Council,\u201d repeats over again the statutory limitation as to territory in the exercise of the council\u2019s jurisdiction which article 5281 above quoted enacted. It says:\u2014\nThe council shall have jurisdiction throughout the extent of the whole municipality, and beyond the limits thereof in special cases where more ample authority is conferred upon it.\nNow it is generally the case that special powers to act or carry on works extra-territorially are found in special charters given to municipalities and the general Act I am discussing in several analogous instances to the immediate one before us has conferred the \u201cample authority\u201d required by article 5281 for special cases of extra-territorial work.\nTake section X., para. 10, relating to \u201cWater Supply\u201d for the towns and cities. One would suppose that the necessity in obtaining such supplies of going beyond its limits and constructing the necessary water-works would, in such a case above any other, necessarily be implied, but in this section conferring the powers the legislature first in article 5645 gives in general terms the power to provide for the establishment and maintenance of water-works, reservoirs, etc., to supply water to the municipality and then takes special care in article 5646 to give the municipality power to \u201cconstruct and maintain in and beyond its limits for a distance of twenty miles the water-works,\u201d etc., authorized by article 5645; also in article 5647 power is expressly given the municipality to\nacquire and hold any land, servitude or usufruct, within its limits or within a circuit of twenty miles thereof.\nTake also paragraph 15, relating to \u201cAbattoirs.\u201d Article 5679 gives in express words power to\nestablish, regulate and manage public abattoirs, either within or without the municipality. Here we find two instances at least of analogous powers conferred, one with respect to providing waterworks to supply the towns with water and the other with respect to abattoirs, which concerned the health of the citizens, and in both cases we find extra-territorial powers expressly given while with respect to lighting the town with electricity any such extraterritorial powers are absent and withheld.\nConstruing, therefore, these sections providing for the establishment of \u201ca system of lighting by gas, electricity or otherwise\u201d in the cities, and towns in which sections no reference whatever is made to the exercise beyond the municipality\u2019s limits of the powers conferred, with the sections relating to waterworks and water and to abattoirs where it is specially declared that the powers given may be exercised extra-territorially, and construing them in the light of article 5281, above quoted, which gives jurisdiction to the municipalities (inter alia) for the exercise of all powers conferred upon them over its territory and beyond when specially conferred, I have no difficulty in limiting the exercise of the lighting powers they confer territorially, nor have I for the same reasons any difficulty in construing the general article 5279 giving the municipality the power to acquire movable and immovable property and to draw promissory notes, etc., in the execution of any of the powers conferred upon it by law as being confined to the territorial limits of the municipality and not exercisable with respect to property beyond them unless in cases where express extra-territorial powers have been given or where they will be necessarily implied from the very nature of the power exercised.\nNo such express extra-territorial power is given with respect to the lighting contracts; it should not in my opinion be implied as existing and arising necessarily out of the power to establish a lighting system, and, therefore, does not exist at all.\nI have referred to and read the authorities which the respondents cite in their excellent factum, but I agree with Mr. Geoffrion that the question we have to decide is not one upon which authorities will help us very much. It is one of the fair and reasonable construction of the powers conferred on the councils of cities and towns by a general Act of the Legislature of Quebec.\nI do not understand Mr. Geoffrion to controvert or question the general rule that a municipal corporation can exercise its corporate powers only within its territorial limits.\nWhat he contended was that the general powers of the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d were expressed in terms amply broad enough on a fair and reasonable construction to vest the council with the power of purchasing this power-house and plant admitted to be outside of the municipality, and that the method adopted for its purchase was also within the council\u2019s powers.\nFor the reasons given I cannot agree to either of his contentions, but conclude that the by-law in controversy is ultra vires and illegal.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal is taken by a corporate body that claims to have entered into a contract with the municipal corporation known as the Town of Shawinigan Falls, in the Province of Quebec, for the purpose of selling to the latter corporation an electric plant, including therewith a real estate property beyond the limits of the town.\nThe council of the town passed an alleged by-law to carry out said purchase involving a price of about $40,000.\nThe respondent, the Shawinigan Water and Power Company, being ratepayers objected and instituted this suit to set aside such proceeding on the grounds, amongst others, that, unless and until the ratepayers had approved, the council could not make such a contract, and that, in any event, the municipal corporation had no power to buy such real estate beyond the limits of the town.\nWe must never forget that a municipal corporation is the mere creature of a statute and can only exercise such powers as the statute gives it and in the manner given thereby.\nIt is urged that power was given by statute to the council to establish a system of gas or lighting by electricity and a further power to sell the surplus product when established.\nThese powers pre-suppose that the purpose permitted must be exercised in the manner in and by which the council, by its general power of creating debt, is enabled to so act.\nIf the establishment of either system had been possible within the means of the taxing power the council possessed, it was quite competent for it to have installed such a system.\nIt is conceivable a small beginning of that kind might have been instituted, but this far exceeded such a thing.\nIt is entirely beyond the purview of the special and general statutes on which the council of this municipal corporation rests for all its authority that it without the ratepayers\u2019 vote can make such a contract as herein is involved.\nIf the price to be paid had been such as to fall within the powers of the then existent council relative to the imposition of rates or taxes, it might by virtue of the authority given and exercised have contracted for an electric plant.\nIndeed, had it been attempted to found the contract upon an exercise of the special taxing power given by article 5668, R.S.Q., 1909, relative thereto, I am not prepared to say it would have been absolutely impossible to bind such specially selected classes of ratepayers as there had in view. I have not fully considered what are the possibilities involved therein, for it is entirely another thing that is being attempted. The vendor is not, by the terms of the by-law or bargain, to look to any special class, but to the entire body of ratepayers. We must, therefore, consider it as seeking by this by-law to bind the entire body of ratepayers. It is not a mere question of making one by-law as to part of a project and another later on, as may occasionally happen, in order to complete the business. The attempt is to mortgage, once and forever, the whole ratepaying property of the town, and contract on that basis. It is no answer to say the town had another power even if it had in truth as to which I say nothing.\nThe truth is the whole business seems to have been gone about under a misapprehension of the powers of the council, or disregard thereof.\nThe price exceeded the taxing powers of the council for the then current year and the ordinary power to contract or which by any reasonable implication could extend to a contract covering the long term over which the payments to be made in liquidation were spread.\nCases have been cited where a town has been made to pay for a fire-engine when the sale had been fully executed by the delivery and use thereof by the corporation, even when a doubt existed as to the council having acted properly. In all these cases I have seen, no doubt existed of the power to enforce by sufficient levy the price in any given year.\nEven of such like cases when, as in the case of Waterous Engine Works Co, v. Town of Palmerston[2], which came to this court, the transaction has been nipped in the bud, as is sought to be done here, it has been held null when the goods had not been fully delivered and accepted, and the necessary forms had not been gone through for so completing the contract as to make the town a debtor.\nA clumsily worded section in question here seems to give ground for saying some one contemplated the extensive system of the town not only supplying its own wants and those of its inhabitants, but also undertaking to produce and sell to an unlimited extent to others. But the very words imply that the usual powers vested in the council for the legal establishment of such works must be resorted to. To permit the execution of such a remarkable scheme was going a long way, but for us to tack on to it the power to dispense with the sanction of the people to pay would be going still further.\nThe council never sought the proper means of referring the question to the ratepayers to pass upon it. Appellants should, have got a further amendment to the charter, either imposing the imperative duty on the council to carry out the scheme which might have implied dispensation from consulting the people, or by express language dispensing therewith.\nIt is not merely the form of a loan that is in question, but the absence of any distinct power in the council enabling the creation of an indebtedness which has to be provided for over a term of years in the future. In the absence of any such power to create indebtedness the municipal council has no implied power.\nBorrowing to pay any debt extending over a period of years is what the general power contemplates. Certainly the council cannot do that indirectly which the law does not permit to be done directly.\nIt is urged that the powder of establishment having been given everything else is to be implied, including the power to buy real estate outside the town.\nWhere a duty had been imperatively imposed upon a municipality and had to be discharged in obedience to a statute things necessary to be done to obey the law have been held impliedly as within a council\u2019s absolute power. The case of Pratt v. City of Stratford[3], was such a case. The obligation of the city there rested on a statute imposing a duty, and similar cases are to be found cited in the argument or judgment in said case. No such duty had been imposed here. It was left entirely optional.\nIf every power a municipal council has entrusted to it, were to be held as carrying therewith every possible implication of power needed to execute it and to create without regard to the ratepayers debts to be met in future years, I fear our municipal system would receive some severe strains. It is urged that the town had power to buy land outside the municipal limits for water-works. Such a power has existed ever since 1857 by statute. But this transaction does not proceed thereupon. And, indeed, that power could not be used for any indirect purpose of trying to produce something else.\nThe two purposes might well be executed together if the legislature had said so, but it has not. And the mere fact that such express power had to be given by statute to enable the town to acquire land outside, is evidence of what the law has ever been held to be.\nSome American cases are cited to shew this power exists by implication.\nOf those cited a number clearly give no countenance to the proposition, but rest on statutory powers expressly given.\nI was surprised to hear it said that the late Judge Cooley had given his sanction to such a proposition in the case of The Mayor of Detroit v. The Park Commissioners[4]. But, on reference to that case, page 605, I find his position entirely misconceived. He said in his judgment therein:\u2014\nBut if we were to concede all that respondents claim in this regard the case would be still undetermined. This is not the ordinary-case of a city park. Belle Isle is outside the city limits, and it is not pretended that the city could have purchased, improved, and controlled the same as a public park except by virtue of special legislation. This legislation was obtained (Local Acts, 1879, p. 215), and it not only empowered the city to purchase and create a debt therefor, but to erect a toll-bridge across to the island, and to extend its police authority over the territory. Here were very important franchises which the city could not pretend t\u00f6 claim except by this sovereign grant.\nIn the same case there is an expression in relation to some cases cited which to a hasty reader might suggest some such notion as advanced in argument. But an examination of the sentence does not warrant it and a reference to the cases in question shews clearly the learned judge spoke of something else and in no way related to this point.\nAnother of these cases illustrates how difficult another able judge felt it to maintain even a small contract to procure an outlet to a sewer. The contract only involved the expenses of procuring labour, so far as I can see. And the case might well have rested on the imperative statutory duty to avoid a nuisance. The head-note is entirely misleading in this latter case.\nIt is not necessary, as this case has been fully dealt with in the court below, again to analyze as has so well and exhaustively been done in the court appealed from, all the statutes bearing upon it. I do not bind myself to uphold every opinion on minor details expressed in course of that work, but reaching, in the main, the same results, I do not see fit to enter upon the repetition of what I approve.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed on the short ground that section 18 of the special Act of 1908 (chapter 95) does not authorize the establishment or maintenance outside the municipal boundaries of the works to which that section refers. Article 5281, R.S.Q. (1909), which admittedly governs the municipal corporation in question, provides:\u2014 5281. The corporation shall have jurisdiction for municipal and police purposes and for the exercise of all the powers conferred upon it, over the whole of its territory, and also beyond its territory in special cases where more ample authority is conferred upon it.\nIt seems to me to be indisputable that the \u201cpower to establish and maintain a system of lighting\u201d by gas or electricity with which this municipality is invested by its special Act is one of the \u201cpowers\u201d referred to in this article. Ambiguity, no doubt, lurks in the word \u201cpowers\u201d and there are some corporate capacities and faculties commonly described as \u201cpowers\u201d (the capacity to contract as suggested by Mr. Geoffrion is an instance of them), the exercise of which outside the municipal limits the legislature cannot have intended to prohibit. It is not necessary for the purposes of this case to define with precision the classes of powers which fall within the scope of the section in question. I see no reason to doubt that it does apply to all powers in respect of the establishment or operation of municipal undertakings which are privilegia in the strict sense. Wherever a corporation to which article 5281 applies is empowered by the legislature to construct or operate works which may in the construction or operation of them affect others prejudicially and where, by reason of such statutory authority, the responsibility of the corporation for harm caused by acts done in the course of exercising or professing to exercise such powers is determined by a rule which is not the same as that applicable to determine the responsibility of persons doing the like acts without statutory authority \u2014 then unless there be some legislative provision which expressly or impliedly provides to the contrary the powers so conferred are powers which under the terms of that article must be exercised within the municipal limits. It seems to me to be incontestable that the powers conferred by section 18 are powers of this character. If the corporation were, for example, to establish a system of lighting by electricity under that section, it is not doubtful that their responsibility for harm arising from the operation of such a system would be governed by the principles of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. Y. Roy[5], and Dumphy v. The Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co.[6], and not by articles 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code. It was clearly not intended that the municipality should enjoy such a qualified immunity in respect of works established outside the municipal limits except in cases in which it is otherwise specially provided.\nI should notice Mr. Geoffrion\u2019s contention that it is impracticable to establish within the municipal limits such works as those contemplated by section 18 and that, consequently, the authority to exercise the powers conferred by that section beyond those limits must be implied as necessarily incidental to the powers expressly conferred. Now such an implication is not permissible unless, on reading the relevant provisions of the Act as a whole, you find that they are not incompatible with the inference that the legislature intended to give the authority which is to be implied. It appears to me that article 5281 in terms forbids such an inference unless there is something in the language of the enactment by which the power is conferred indicating an intention that it is to be exercisable beyond the municipal limits. In the special Act there is in respect of the establishment and maintenance of a system of lighting (whatever may be said respecting the authority to sell surplus power) nothing in the least degree indicating any such intention.\nAnglin J. (dissenting). \u2014 In this action the validity of \u00e0 by-law of the Town of Shawinigan Falls providing for the purchase of the plant and undertaking of the Shawinigan Hydro-Electric Co. (the appellants) is impugned by a rival company (the respondents).\nThe grounds of attack are:\u2014\n(1) That the plant to be purchased is situate outside the limits of the town.\n(2) That the purchase involves the making of a loan by the corporation without the assent of the ratepayers required by law.\n(3) That the by-law does not provide for an annual special tax on the owners or occupants of buildings to meet the interest on, and to provide a sinking-fund to repay, the debt to be incurred.\n(4) That the scheme includes the giving of promissory notes by the town corporation for a considerable part of the purchase price.\nOther grounds of attack were abandoned.\nWithout determining whether or not, if its powers depended solely on the general provisions of the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d (R.S.Q. 1909, arts. 5256 et seq.), the acquisition by the Town of Shawinigan Falls of a power plant and electric light undertaking partly situate outside the town limits would be ultra vires, (vide Dillon\u2019s Mun. Corporations (5th ed.), sec. 980, note 1), I am of the opinion that, having regard to the peculiar circumstances and to the special legislation enacted for the town, it was within its powers, if otherwise properly exercised, to acquire this property beyond the municipal limits.\nArticle 5667 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec reads as follows:\u2014\nThe council shall have all the necessary powers for the establishment and management of a system of lighting by gas, electricity or otherwise, for the requirements of the public and of private individuals or companies desiring to light their houses, buildings or establishments.\nThe corresponding provision in the charter of the Town of Shawinigan Falls (8 Edw. VII. ch. 95, sec. 18) reads:\u2014\nThe council is vested with all the necessary powers for the establishment and management of a system of lighting by gas, electricity or otherwise, for the requirements of the public and of private individuals or companies desiring to light up their houses, buildings or establishments, and for selling the surplus power produced by the power generating the electricity which it may have acquired or established for such purpose to the municipality of the Village of Shawinigan Bay or to its inhabitants, and to the Grand\u2019M\u00e8re Electric Company or its successors.\nThe acquisition, as distinguished from the establishment, of a power development is clearly contemplated by this special article. It cannot have been the intention of the legislature to confine the town to the acquisition of a steam-power or plant in view of the many advantages of generating electricity by water-power, the general use now made of water-power for that purpose and the exceptionally favourable situation of the town for the utilization of such power. Moreover, the legislature would seem to have contemplated the acquisition of a power generating surplus energy. It provides for the disposition of the surplus power produced to another named municipality and to a named company. This provision obviously contemplates the acquisition of a water-power. It is most improbable that the legislature would authorize the town to embark in the business of producing power generated by steam in excess of its own requirements and selling the surplus to a neighbouring municipality and an electric company. The capacity of a steam-plant can be accurately gauged. But in order to secure a suitable or available water-power it might be necessary to acquire one which would produce considerable surplus energy. It would perhaps be too much to infer that the legislation of 1908 was enacted to enable the town to acquire the plant of the appellant company, which was actually supplying electric energy to the municipality and the company to which the town is authorized to sell its surplus power, although if this was not intended it is a little difficult to understand why these two bodies were named as prospective purchasers of the surplus. But it is certainly not unreasonable to assume that the legislature was informed of the situation at Shawinigan Falls in regard to water-powers: that it knew that no water-power within its limits was available to the town; that, by its ownership of the lands along the river bank, the respondent company was in a position to prevent the town acquiring any water-power within its limits; and that, if a water-power was to be acquired by the town, it must be in adjacent territory outside its limits. The evidence establishes these facts. When, therefore, the legislature specially provided for the acquisition by the town of a \u201cpower\u201d and for the disposition to a neighbouring municipality and to a company of the surplus energy produced from such power, it seems a reasonable, if not a necessary inference, that it contemplated and intended to sanction the acquisition of a water-power situated outside the town limits. Of course this purpose might have been more clearly expressed. Had it been, we probably should not have had this litigation.\nMoreover, under the by-law, the property in question is to be acquired not merely for electric lighting purposes, but also for the establishment of waterworks. Under the provisions of the \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d now consolidated as articles 5646-7, R.S.Q., 1909, the town had the right to acquire for water-works property situate within a radius of twenty miles beyond its limits. The property in question is within that radius. There is nothing in the record which warrants an inference that the town council did not bon\u00e2 fide intend to utilize it for the establishment and maintenance of water-works \u2014 nothing to justify the conclusion that the reference in the by-law to the establishment of water-works was introduced merely as a cloak to cover up any possible illegality in the acquisition of outside property for the purpose of an electric lighting system.\nArticles 5281 and 5588 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, bear upon the governmental authority of the municipality, not upon its right to own and use property. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sec. 980, n. 1 (5 ed.).\nFor these reasons I think the first objection to the by-law fails.\nNeither can I accept the view that a purchase of property by a municipality on credit involves the contracting of a loan within the purview of articles 5776 et seq., R.S.Q. That it involves contracting an indebtedness is clear; but I think the distinction between the borrowing of money and the contracting of a debt as the result of a purchase on credit is equally clear. Dillon\u2019s Municipal Corporations (5 ed.), sec.\n279(n). The \u201cCities and Towns Act,\u201d in article 5783, R.S.Q., marks the distinction between loan and other municipal indebtedness. A perusal of the articles 1762-1786 of the Civil Code, defining and dealing with loans, has satisfied me that the legislature did not intend to include under the term \u201cloans\u201d in the \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d debts incurred for purchases made on credit.\nNor does the fact that the property is acquired subject to a hypothec put the purchaser in the position of a borrower or give to the transaction any of the legal notes of a loan. True, the borrower obliges himself to pay to the hypothecary creditor the part of the purchase price represented by the amount secured by the hypothec; but he pays it as purchase money, not as the return of money borrowed. Of course, there might be a case in which a vendor had been induced to hypothecate his property on the eve of selling it to a municipality in order to enable the latter to evade the provisions of the law restricting its borrowing powers. When such a case is made out the court will, no doubt, find means to prevent an evasion of the law. This is not such a case. It is an ordinary purchase on credit of property subject to a hypothec with the result that part of the purchase price becomes payable not to the vendor, but to the hypothecary creditor to satisfy his charge.\nI agree, however, with the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the provisions of article 5668, R.S.Q., should, notwithstanding the use of the word \u201cmay,\u201d be construed as imperative in the event of the exercise by the council of the power conferred by article 5667 in such a manner that it involves incurring a debt. Money for the purchase or establishment of a municipal electric lighting system might, I incline to think, be raised by a loan contracted under the provisions of articles 5776 et seq.; and, in procuring money in this way, submission to the \u201cproprietors who are municipal electors\u201d would be requisite (art. 5782, R.S.Q.). Provision for re-payment of such a loan would, of course, be made under article 5777, R.S.Q. The money to pay it having been thus procured, no provision for future expenditure on account of the purchase price would be necessary and the duty imposed by article 5668, R.S.Q., would, in that case, not arise.\nBut if, instead of borrowing the money for that purpose, the municipal corporation purchases its plant upon credit, thus incurring a debt \u2014 a course which the provisions of articles 5667-8, R.S.Q., clearly imply its power to adopt \u2014 the council is obliged to exercise the powers conferred by article 5668 to meet the interest on the debt and to establish an adequate sinking-fund to pay the principal. The \u201cCities and Towns Act\u201d contemplates indebtedness being incurred otherwise than by loan (article 5783), but it contains no provision, such as is frequently found in municipal legislation, (vide \u201cOnt. Mun. Act,\u201d 1903, sec. 389), prohibiting the raising on the credit of the municipality of any money not required for ordinary expenditure and not payable within the municipal year otherwise than under a by-law submitted to the ratepayers. The burden of the special tax for payment of the expenditure being imposed upon the \u201cowners or occupants of houses, shops or other buildings\u201d (article 5668), and the total debt of the town not amounting to twenty per cent, of the value of the taxable immovable property (article 5783), no reason exists for requiring the approval of other ratepayers or proprietors. Not only do articles 5667 et seq. contain no reference to an approval of the expenditure for establishing a lighting system by electors or taxpayers being required, but there is no means provided in the statute for obtaining the approval of \u201cowners or occupants of houses, shops, or other buildings.\u201d If, without the authority of express legislation, such as we find in articles 5667 et seq., a town council would possess the power to make such an extraordinary expenditure as is involved in the acquisition or establishment of an electric lighting system, it certainly would not have the still more extraordinary power to make such a purchase on credit and to impose the debt thus created as \u00e1 burden upon present and future owners or occupants of buildings without their assent. That a town council has the latter powers is an implication from article 5668. It follows, I think, that in exercising them, while the assent of owners or occupants of buildings or of ratepayers or electors is not required, the provisions of article 5668 are obligatory.\nBut, must the council, in the same by-law which provides for the purchase, or concurrently with its passage, at the peril of its being held invalid and quashed should it omit to do so, provicie for the imposition of the special annual tax directed by article 5668? I think not. The exercise of the power conferred by article 5667 entails the obligation to provide for interest on any debt thus created and for a proper sinking-fund. To create this obligation a declarative recognition of it by by-law is not required and would serve no purpose. The obligation arises out of the incurring of the debt. To provide when enacting the purchase by-law for the levy of the annual special tax to meet interest and sinking-fund seems to be both unnecessary and impracticable. Revenue from the system may provide the amount needed in whole or in part. That revenue will vary from year to year. The special tax to be imposed for the annual interest and the sinking-fund, or for so much of them as the revenue, if applied to that purpose, does not cover, is to be an annual tax. The value of the property assessable may also vary from year to year. If the council were obliged to provide at the time of the purchase for the annual rate of the special taxation to be levied in each year, a figure too large or too small might be named. It is the right of the creditor that adequate provision be made; it is that of the taxpayer that the tax shall not be excessive. The rate of the tax may, no doubt, be struck in advance in each year upon an estimate of the amount required to be raised and of the value of the assessable property. An annual bylaw imposing it and directing its levy would seem necessary. The council may be restrained from paying any part of the debt, principal or interest, out of its general funds or revenues. In proper proceedings, it may be compelled, by mandamus, to impose in any year a special tax under article 5668, adequate to provide for the interest and a proper sinking-fund so far as they are not met out of the revenue. But I find nothing in the Act which requires the council, when enacting the by-law for the acquisition or establishment of a lighting system, to provide even for the imposition of the annual special tax for the first year \u2014 still less for imposing that tax during the whole term of the debt. The obligation to impose an annual and an adequate tax exists. The council may be compelled to discharge that duty from year to year. It may be restrained from diverting other funds or sources of revenue to that purpose. The interests of the creditors on the one hand and of the general ratepayers on the other being thus protected, I see no reason to hold the by-law in question invalid because the council has not by it, or by a by-law enacted concurrently, formally declared that interest on the debt incurred and a sinking-fund to meet it shall be provided for by the annual special tax mentioned in article 5668, or that owners or occupants of buildings in the town, shall be liable to such tax when annually imposed. Lex neminem cogit ad inutilia.\nThe failure to provide, in the impugned by-law, for the imposition of the special tax under article 5668 is not alleged in the declaration as a ground of its invalidity. This point was raised for the first time in the judgment of the majority of the learned judges of the court of appeal.\nIf empowered to acquire the property in question and to incur a debt in acquiring it, the town would appear to have the right to give its promissory notes to evidence that debt (art. 5279, E.S.Q., pars. 2 and 4). The provision in it for the giving of such notes would not in any case suffice to render the by-law void although the notes themselves should be held invalid.\nFor these reasons I would with respect allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Cusson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, MacPherson, Hague & Holden.\n[1] Q.R. 19 K.B. 546.\n[2] 21 Can.

Where the mortgage stipulates for a power of sale, on default, without notice, and contains no proviso dispensing with the official supervision required by the statute, a sale by the mortgagee, purporting to be made under that power, without compliance with the requirements of section 110 of the Act or an order of the court, cannot operate to extinguish the registered title of the mortgagor.

B. Coyne, for the appellant.\nC. P. Wilson K.C. and A. C. Galt K.C. for the respondents.\nDavies J. agreed with Duff J.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014In December, 1892, one Beattie mortgaged land in Manitoba to mortgagees whose assignees, exercising a power of sale therein, on default, sold the lands to appellant by a written agreement dated on the 10th of June, 1901, and followed that by a deed of 24th November, 1908, which purported to transfer said lands pursuant to said sale to appellant.\nThe mortgagees had taken possession some six years before the said sale. Prior to all these transactions the land had been brought under the \u201cTorrens System\u201d of registration, and so continued.\nThe registrar refused to register the above mentioned deed of transfer on the ground that the steps required by the \u201cReal Property Act,\u201d R.S.M. 1902, ch. 148, as amended, for selling under mortgage, had not been taken.\nThe issue is thus broadly raised that mortgagor and mortgagee of land brought under said system cannot usefully contract with each other for any power of sale.\nWith great respect, such is the logical result of the reasoning proceeded on by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Perdue in the Court of Appeal, the former pointing to the question of possession which he seems to hold cannot be contracted for but must depend on the terms of the Act, and the latter, that, as the instrument in question is under the Act, failure to comply with the mode of sale provided thereby is fatal to the sale now in question.\nCounsel for respondents properly accepts this as the result for which he argues.\nMr. Justice Richards, if I understand him aright, does not go so far, but rather relies on the construction he gives the power of sale here in question.\nThe power of sale relied upon here is as follows:\u2014\nIt is also covenanted between me and the said mortgagees that if I shall make default in payment of the said principal sum and interest thereon, or any part thereof at any of the before appointed times then the said mortgagees shall have the right and power and I do hereby covenant with the said mortgagees for such purpose and do grant to the said mortgagees full license and authority for such purpose when and so often as in their discretion they shall think fit to enter into possession either by themselves or their agent, of the said lands, and to collect the rents and profits thereof, or to make any demise or lease of the said lands, or any part thereof for such terms, periods, and at such rent as they shall think proper, or to sell the said lands and such entry, demise or lease shall operate as a termination of the tenancy hereinbefore mentioned without any notice being required, and that the power of sale herein embodied and contained may be exercised either before or after and subject to such demise or lease. Provided that any sale made under the powers here in may be for cash or upon credit or partly for cash and partly for credit and that the said mortgagees may vary or rescind any contract for sale made or entered into by virtue hereof.\u201d\nBy a preceding clause the mortgagor had attorned to the mortgagee.\nIf we bear in mind that the main purpose of the exemplars of this Act was, if at all possible, to relegate forever to the juristic lumber-room so many conceptions that had long dominated the ordinary mind of the lawyer as to frustrate the execution of the purposes of men in their dealings with each other, we will be better able to understand and apply the Act and give effect to it in its proper sphere.\nThat sphere is not to limit the powers of contracting in relation to real estate. It is, in the language of the recital, the earliest one, the \u201cLand Registry Act,\u201d 1862,\nto give certainty to the title to real estates and to facilitate the proof thereof and also to render the dealings with land more simple and economical.\nAnd this is the key-note of all like legislation. But it by no means covers the registration of all such contracts.\nWhat we have first to do is throw away some preconceived notions of what a mortgage must be, and apply the common sense of the ordinary man knowing none of these things, but knowing that a mortgage is as section 100 of the Act seeks to constitute it and section 1 interprets it.\nSection 100 reads as follows:\u2014\n100. A mortgage or an incumbrance under the new system shall have effect as security, but shall not operate as a transfer of land thereby charged, or of any estate or interest therein.\nThen the interpretation section 2, sub-section (d) is as follows:\u2014\n(d) The expression \u201cmortgage\u201d means and includes any charge on land created for securing a debt or loan or any hypothecation of such charge.\nAgain let us look at the definition of \u201cmortgagor\u201d in same section, sub-section (f):\u2014\n(f) The expression \u201cmortgagor\u201d means and includes the owner of land or of any estate or interest in land pledged as security for a debt. The preceding sub-section interprets \u201cmortgagee\u201d to mean \u201cthe owner of a mortgage registered under this Act.\u201d\nA good deal has been said in argument here, as well as in text-books, to raise puzzling questions which the above quoted sections give rise to. Most of them are beside the questions we have to resolve.\nThe mortgagees were, in this case, given their power of sale by the very instrument of mortgage registered and, notwithstanding the length at which I will, out of respect to the argument put forward, deal with this case, I have never had but one opinion relative to this phase of the matter. It is this, that the registration was not only a registration of the charge of the statutory character defined by the sections I quote, but of that charge coupled with this power, and this latter became of the very essence of the transaction, duly recognized by the officers on whom was cast, by section 83 of the Act, the duty to pass upon and if need be reject what is not within the provisions of the Act, and also became part and parcel of that claim which the mortgagees tendered and had irrevocably placed on record and is, for that reason, a part of that to which the mortgagee thereof acquired an indefeasible title.\nI have never been able to see, notwithstanding the argument well presented, how it could be cut down to mean something else than the plain language imports.\nIt was a power to sell. To sell what? I answer, all the interest the mortgagor had in these lands; nothing less, nothing more. And once thus properly sold and conveyed by virtue of ordinary common law principles being applied, as well as the recognition thereof given by the Act, the title of the mortgagor disappeared and became rightfully that of the appellant. An estate in fee simple being what the mortgagor had, and the mortgagee was given power to sell, passed thereby as effectually as if the mortgagor had executed the deed himself.\nThe mortgage as registered being a charge and power, there cannot be any difficulty, to my mind, any more than if the power had been (what it is not) a simple power of attorney authorizing a sale and the execution of a conveyance in the name of the mortgagor as vendor. Indeed, a learned writer suggests this latter method as a means of overcoming another difficulty he sees in one of the English Acts of a similar character.\nThe conclusion to which I have referred, that no power of sale can be contracted for, finds no countenance in the grammatical language of the Act.\nThere is not a line therein that specifically prohibits an \u201cowner\u201d or a \u201cregistered owner\u201d from conveying and contracting relative to his land as he may see fit or to render null such conveyances or contracts as he may have made.\nThe language of section 115 at first blush might suggest that the duty of the officers under the Act is absolutely to ignore any proceedings of foreclosure or sale unless the mortgagee had filed a certificate of lis pendens or notice in the land titles office.\nCounsel did not seem to rely on this.\nI think him well advised in that regard. It is only intended to relieve the officers from being bound to take notice of such proceedings as they may progress elsewhere. That is an entirely different thing from dealing with the title the proceedings when completed may result in vesting in the mortgagee, or those claiming under him; when so completed as to shew that the registered title has passed from the registered owner to the mortgagee or purchaser from him, executing a power of sale, and no other conveyance of interest or notice thereof, or of other claim has intervened, the registrar is as much bound to take it up and record it as if presented with a direct conveyance given in the Act to transfer from owner to purchaser. And much less does there appear any prohibition against the resort to statutory or other powers to transfer title.\nThe mortgagee proceeding outside the Act, as Cozens-Hardy L.J. puts the matter in another aspect of the \u201cLand Transfer Act, 1897,\u201d section 20, in the case of The Capital and Counties Bank v. Rhodes[2], at page 656 at foot, and top of page 657, may be unwise in running the risk of some intervention instead of proceeding under the Act, and the Act may thus furnish a sort of indirect compulsion to use the Act\u2019s provisions.\nA new statutory remedy never takes away the old unless the new is given in substitution of the old or henceforth prohibits either expressly or by necessary implication those concerned from resorting to the old mode of relief.\nThe new Act may by its scope and provisions demonstrate such an inconsistency between the old and the new as to lead to the conclusion that the old remedy has been abrogated.\nI infer from the scope and purpose as well as the terms of this Act that there can be no such necessary conflict or inconsistency between the rights and remedies existent before the Act and its enactments as to drive us to the conclusion that this Act must be accepted not only as a registry Act designed to protect purchasers, but as one designed to limit the powers of contract in relation to interests in, or power over, real estate.\nThe Act itself by its very terms in section 70, subsection (j), and section 126, demonstrates that this latter purpose was not within its purview.\nSection 70 excludes specifically those numerous subjects of claim named, and as to sub-section (j) clearly anticipates future caveats, and on what can such caveats rest? I answer on any legal or equitable right enforceable against him getting the certificate.\nAgain section 126 is as follows:\u2014\nNothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of fraud, or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land, or other equitable interest therein, or over mortgages, nor shall anything contained in this Act affect the right of the mortgagee to foreclose or sell through any competent court, which right it is hereby declared may be exercised in such court.\nThe sale in this case was made but only took its effective form by a conveyance some two years after the Act had stood amended as quoted. It is, therefore, to be tested by the Act as amended in latter part of the section.\nHow can it be said in face thereof that it is not competent for the court to declare the rights of these parties and that declaration bind the registrar to register?\nAgain let us look at the language of the section 108, which expressly declares the first mortgagee\nshall have the same rights and remedies at law and in equity as * * * if the legal estate in the land * * * had been actually vested in him.* * * * What does it mean by \u201crights and remedies at law and in equity\u201d if the usual remedy of executing a power of sale or of foreclosure, for example, be not respectively such? If it had used less comprehensive language we might have supposed or imagined from the resemblance the form of security given by the statute bears to a hypothec in civil law, it is to be implied that some judicial proceeding to enforce it must be resorted to as required under that system of law as usually developed in modern times. To simplify and clarify the register is the purpose of this form of mortgage and to supplement that record by this and other sections of the statute and thus give efficiency and practical utility thereto, is the plan or scheme provided.\nThen section 109, which is the basis of the procedure given by the Act for sale or foreclosure, is as clearly permissive as can be.\nCounsel cited as authority to shew that \u201cmay\u201d in certain cases imposing a duty on a public officer to act, must be read in an imperative sense.\nBut there is no duty cast by this section on the officer. It is merely a permissive step for the mortgagee to take as preliminary to and laying the foundation for the proceedings in the subsequent sections where \u201cmay\u201d is possible of the construction claimed.\nBut the initial step, the right of election, lies in the mortgagee alone to invoke these powers of the later sections and is entirely permissive.\nIf the draftsman had any such notions as are now claimed to have governed him, he erred in thus beginning.\nThis is a mortgage where if the power is good no notice was required. We are, therefore, not concerned with the case, respecting which I express no opinion, of power conditional on a notice to be given and which once given it may be argued is imperatively required to be filed in the land office.\nThe power of sale herein is one that does not require notice.\nI am not concerned with the bearing of the expression \u201cwithout notice\u201d in this power, for if notice is not required by the terms of a bare power it becomes operative on the events happening that are stipulated for as preliminary to its execution.\nI am unable to reconcile the proviso at the end of section 110 with the contention set up that there cannot be a power of sale included in a registered mortgage.\nAgain the form of mortgage given by this Act leaves a space for covenants such as parties may agree upon and I would suppose it was intended to enable the parties to insert their agreed on terms and conditions of any kind not clearly inconsistent with the Act.\nNot only does the Act fail to furnish ground for holding its provisions prohibitive of or inconsistent with the existence of a contractual power of sale, but the history of the law in regard to concurrent remedies for sale in the case of mortgages demonstrates them as existent both outside of such Acts as this and in harmony with the workings of such Acts.\nThough foreclosure of mortgages by the court had existed for centuries, it was not until 1852, when by 15 & 16 Vict. ch. 86, sec. 48, an almost universal power of sale to enforce mortgages was conferred upon the court. The power had, as the result of the settled jurisprudence of that court, been before that enactment confined to a limited number of specific instances which are set forth by Story in paragraph 1026, page 207 (8 ed.), of his work on Equity Jurisprudence.\nThe court had half a century or more preceding this enactment reluctantly recognized as settled law that a power of sale might be agreed upon by the parties to the mortgage, and inserted therein, and when exercised honestly and in conformity with the terms of the power, the court could not interfere.\nThe arguments presented to us now as to clogging thereby the right of redemption and ousting or discarding the sacred powers and jurisdiction of that court, were, no doubt, ably presented and weighed for a long time before such an innovation could be conceded as possible.\nThe conferring by statute upon the court the ample powers of sale I have adverted to, never seems to have been so thought of by any one as to constitute that a substitution for the contractual power of sale so long recognized. Yet I venture to think it might as logically have been contended for as is the position taken here.\nThe \u201cCranworth Act,\u201d 23 & 24 Vict. ch. 145, sec. 11, as to trustees and mortgagees, some nine years later enabled the person to whom money secured or charged by a deed (as in the given terms is specified) was payable or his executors or administrators to sell.\nHas any one ever conceived the idea that this new statutory power was so inconsistent with the powers of sale given the Court of Chancery as above or the usual contractual powers of sale that one or the other of these powers were superseded?\nThis Act formed part of the law of England presumably introduced into Manitoba by, if not previous to, the declaratory Act of its own legislature, 38 Vict, ch. 12, which directs\nthe court to recognize and be bound by the laws existing or established and being in England, as such were existing and stood, on the 15th of July, 1870, so far as the same can be made applicable to matters relating to property and civil rights in this province.\nThe terms of the \u201cCranworth Act\u201d exclude the application of its powers from having any direct bearing on this case; but is it not in force in Manitoba? Can there be a doubt of its having been introduced before and in force when the \u201cTorrens System\u201d was introduced? Did any one ever suppose it was (if so introduced) in conflict with the then existing powers of the provincial courts or contractual powers as to affect them? And can the \u201cReal Property Act,\u201d passed later be held to be so inconsistent with it as to repeal it?\nThen we have in England the first indefeasible registration Act, 25 & 26 Vict. chs. 53-59, called by some as I have above, \u201cThe Land Registry Act, 1862,\u201d brought forward by Lord Westbury and so named hereafter as his Act.\nSome lands were brought under that system and the registered owner thereof mortgaged them and later gave two subsequent mortgages.\nOn default the first mortgagee acting upon the power given by the \u201cCranworth Act,\u201d which was the earlier Act, sold and his purchaser applied for registration as appellant did here, and was refused.\nThereupon he appealed, and the appeal having been heard by Lord Romilly M.R., he directed registration. See In re Richardson[3]. The registrar submitted but would not put the record so as to cut out the subsequent mortgages because of the restricted terms of the order, and again Lord Romilly was applied to[4], and he amended the order so that the purchaser got the indefeasible title the mortgagor had when he gave the first mortgage. The same learned judge in Re Winter[5], made an order resting upon similar views of that Act.\nThese cases are all instructive and the Richardson ones especially so when we consider the fact that Lord Romilly was two years before the first decision chairman of a royal commission to consider the \u201cWestbury Act.\u201d The two first named cases are not very fully reported.\nWe have to rely on the statement of counsel for the source or character of the power there in question. The mortgage seems clearly to have been conformable to the Act, but the power was exercised by virtue of the \u201cCranworth Act.\u201d\nLet it be noticed first that the learned Master of the Rolls states\na first mortgagee sells under a power of sale to a purchaser\nand next shews the existing subsequent mortgages on the register. He then points out that the purchaser has nothing to do with the application of the purchase money, which is the statutory protection given him, as is given by section 111 of the Act here in question. He then proceeds:\u2014\nThe registrar appears to think that there would he some inconsistency in registering the purchaser with an indefeasible title while the subsequent mortgages remain on the register; but I do not think that there is any inconsistency. The subsequent mortgagees have no claim against the land. They are entitled to be paid out of the surplus which remains after satisfying the first mortgage; but the purchaser has nothing to do with that; his title is perfectly good, and he is entitled to be registered as indefeasible owner.\nReading this I find much light shed on the peculiar form of mortgage given in the Act here and there which seemed such a puzzle to the court below and on argument here. Its purpose in each case was to create a charge without passing the legal estate and thus relieve from such puzzles.\nThe \u201cWestbury Act\u201d of 1862 expressly permitted the use either of the statutory form or the old form of a deed to create a mortgage, and hence this cannot be said to be a case decisive of the exact questions here. It is as a practical illustration of how the old and the new can be made to harmonize in a more complicated situation than the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d in question here may produce, that these decisions on that Act are instructive and thus demonstrate that it cannot be maintained there is any such necessary conflict or inconsistency as to drive us to hold that the power to contract for a power of sale has been abrogated and, as argued, can no longer exist.\nThe \u201cLand Transfer Act\u201d of 1875, amended in 1897, is much ampler in its provisions than the Manitoba Act, and has in it many provisions that suggest exclusiveness of contract, yet in the Capital and Counties Bank v. Rhodes[6], at pages 653 to 658, the possibility of working out such an Act is found to be quite consistent with the conveyancing powers outside its provisions being exercised.\nIt is true section 49 of that Act makes a reservation to remove any doubt on the subject, and hence the judgment in that case cannot govern this case. But like the cases cited above, it demonstrates how far men may go in dealing with land brought under the Act without resorting to the provisions of the Act and yet no necessity be found for holding them, as contended for here, exclusive.\nWeymouth v. Davis[7], is another illustration. Here the land was on the register, and the possessory title appeared in a man who executed a charge in the form prescribed by the Act, but to save expense did not register it, but registered a notice of deposit of the certificate; and those things were all done after having taken a mortgage deed. The mortgagee foreclosed the latter, and on getting his final order of foreclosure and for possession, sought, though no reference had been made to the formal charge in such proceedings, to have his order of foreclosure registered, and on refusal of the registrar, an application was made to Swinfen Eady J., who ordered the rectification of the register as desired.\nStevens v. Theatres Limited[8], may be referred to as a case where the question of inconsistency between the exercise of the power of sale and foreclosure proceedings at the same time is discussed. However much the power of the court to interfere may exist yet the power of sale is held not extinguished by any mere inconsistency so as to defeat a purchaser\u2019s title under the power of sale.\nI may also observe that in some jurisdictions the courts have passed orders to deprive mortgagees pressing all their remedies of ejectment, foreclosure, power of sale and action on the covenant at the same time, and I think statutory enactments exist to put them to their election in such cases. Such rules of court or statutes rather affirm than controvert the proposition that prim\u00e2 facie they are in law not inconsistent.\nIn the case of Cruikshank v. Duffin[9], raising the question of the power of an executor enabled to mortgage, to give a power of sale in the mortgage, it was held he could. It was treated by the court then as a necessary incident of the power. See also Russel v. Plaice[10].\nThe reasoning upon which the judgment in the case of Belize Estate Co. v. Quilter[11] proceeds, may also be well borne in mind in this connection, as demonstrating that an Act such as the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d is not to be taken as an exclusive code relative to the rights men acquire in real estate.\nQuestions were suggested in argument as to a power of sale in an instrument merely charging the property, and suggestions were made as to the mortgagees not having the legal estate.\nIn the first place without needlessly going here deeply into the question of the legal estate, I may refer the curious to the work of Mr. Hogg on Australian Ownership, Part III., ch. 2, sec. 2 thereof.\nThe ascertainment of where the legal estate may, in any given case, be, under such a system as the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d creates, is there fully discussed.\nI may also, to relieve those troubled about what seems to me vain imaginings relative to the legal estate, again refer to section 108, quoted from above.\nI need not dwell upon the subject in the view I take of the power in question here.\nThe English \u201cConveyancing Act, 1881,\u201d section 21, sub-section 4, provided that the power of sale conferred by that Act may be exercised by any person for the time being entitled to give and receive a discharge for the mortgage money.\nIt is equally competent, I think, for the contracting parties to provide a like power fully as efficient.\nIn the case of In re Rumney and Smith[12], it was contended the power of sale there in question could be executed by the party entitled to receive the money, but Stirling J. held they could not in that case and referred to the law as follows:\u2014\nI am asked to hold that the power of sale contained in the mortgage deed is a mere security for the debt, and is exercisable in the absence of any contrary intention by any person who in equity can give a receipt for the mortgage money. I am far from saying that that would not be a reasonable state of the law, but the question is whether it is the present state of the law. In carefully drawn mortgages there is usually found a clause enabling any one who in equity can give a receipt for the mortgage debt to exercise the power of sale; but no such clause is found in the mortgage before me.\nIn considering this case in appeal, Chitty L.J. says, page 360:\u2014\nWe have now become so accustomed by virtue of improved conveyancing, and by reason of the statutes, to find a power of sale in a mortgage accompanying the debt, that there is a danger of assuming that as part of the general law. No doubt the statutes made it quite plain, and all the conveyances in years past made it perfectly plain.\nI take it there can be no doubt of this and it all comes back to the proper construction of the power of sale herein.\nThe Act manifestly gives a power of sale which extends to and covers the legal estate or rather whatever estate the mortgagor may have. That is independent of any special power such as this in question. The power in question expressly given by the instrument does not depend on the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d for its efficiency or execution, but must depend upon the intention of the parties so expressed.\nA common law power does not need any technical language to give it force. The question always is whether it can be construed as giving the power. And repeating what I have already said there can be no doubt of the meaning and intent of the parties to this power as to what it was to enable the doing of.\nOf course a power to operate by virtue of the \u201cStatute of Uses\u201d or in execution of some trust must, though needing no peculiar language to create it, be so expressed, as to shew its conformity to what such statute or trust may require.\nFinding neither warrant in the statute nor in the principle of law applicable thereto for precluding mortgagees from stipulating for a power of sale in or collateral to a mortgage given on land brought under the \u201cTorrens System\u201d and the sale in question duly made under the mortgage in question I need not enter into the inquiry as to the effect of section 75 relative to the bearing of the statutes of limitations invoked in favour of appellant.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nI may observe that notwithstanding the profuse quotations from the opinions expressed here in disposing of the case of Williams v. Box[13], I fail to see the bearing of that case or what was said therein on this.\nThat was a case of a mortgagee resorting to this statute to enforce his rights of sale and foreclosure seeking to set up his proceedings, which did not conform to the statute he chose to proceed under, to deprive the mortgagor of his property.\nThat case involved the examination of the judicial powers in that regard as contained in the Act. This case apart from the collateral questions incidentally arising, involves merely questions of conveyancing.\nIn turning to the report of that case I find it of the illuminating kind which contains neither full statement of fact nor argument, and hence apt to be misleading.\nSince writing the foregoing the information has been given the court that section 110 was not in force till after the date of contract of sale, but in my view the fact does not alter though it may emphasize what I have already said.\nDuff J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the appellant against the respondents, the National Trust Company, as the administrator of the estate of one James Beattie, deceased, claiming a declaration that an \u201cestate in fee simple\u201d in certain lands \u2014 the property in dispute \u2014 became vested in him by virtue of a certain transfer to him executed by the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation. James Beattie was in his lifetime the registered owner of the lands in question which were registered under the \u201cNew System\u201d established and governed by an Act of the Manitoba Legislature originally passed in 1885, and now known as the \u201cReal Property Act.\u201d In 1892 the property was mortgaged by Beattie as registered owner in favour of the Freehold Loan and Savings Company, to secure the repayment of a loan, and the mortgage (with all the incidental rights and powers of the mortgagees) was subsequently acquired by the Canada Mortgage Corporation. The transfer by the last mentioned company is said, according to the contention of the appellant, to have effectually transferred to him an estate in fee simple in this property on one of two grounds: 1st, that the company had acquired a title by possession, and 2ndly, that the legal authority to convey such an estate was vested in the company by a certain power of sale which was contained in the mortgage executed by Beattie and which, according to its terms, was exercisable by the mortgagees and their assigns.\nAs to the first of these grounds I may say at once that section 75 of the \u201cReal Property Act,\u201d in my opinion, makes it untenable, and I am quite content to rest that view upon the reasons in support of it which have been given by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nThe second contention raises questions of considerable importance which have been very ably discussed by counsel, and deserve a more particular examination. These questions turn primarily upon the effect of the legislative provisions which govern the transactions in dispute. It was assumed on the argument that it was only necessary to consider the Act of 1900 which was in force at the time of the attempted sale. I think it is immaterial in the result whether we confine our attention to the provisions of that Act or consider also the provisions of the enactments in force in December, 1892, when the mortgage was executed. I shall first discuss the effect of these latter provisions, which are to be found in the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d of 1891 as amended in April, 1892.\nThe mortgage in question is in the form prescribed by the Act and was admittedly intended to take effect under its provisions. By those provisions a statutory power of sale is an incident of every registered mortgage. It was not disputed on the oral argument before us that the transfer in question cannot be sustained as an exercise of this statutory power; but it was contended that a special agreement contained in the mortgage conferred on the transferors a conventional power of sale exercisable independently of the provisions of the statute. In considering this contention it is necessary to examine the constitution and characteristics of a mortgage under the Act.\nBy the provisions of the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d the owner of an estate in fee simple in land having applied to register his title under the system established by the Act called the \u201cNew System\u201d and having complied with the statutory requirements leading to registration becomes entitled to a certificate called the \u201cCertificate of Title\u201d which declares him to be the owner of an estate in fee simple in the land of which he is the proprietor. This certificate is bound in a book called the \u201cregister,\u201d and a duplicate of it is delivered to the owner. Thenceforward the certificate not only evidences but constitutes the owner\u2019s title. Title to the land to which it relates can be affected only as the Act permits, and by an instrument registered as the Act provides. The purpose of the Act was to simplify and cheapen the transfer and the encumbering of and to give security of title to the owners of lands and interests therein; and, broadly speaking, the scheme devised is that title is acquired by registration in this register which contains the various certificates of title, each of which shews the interest of the registered proprietor and the encumbrances to which it is subject. The mortgage contemplated and provided for by the Act is a real security which primarily derives its efficacy as a security of that character from the statute itself. Section 99 is explicit, that a registered owner intending to charge or to create a security upon land by way of mortgage (which by the interpretation clause includes \u201cany charge on land created for securing a debt or loan\u201d) shall \u201cexecute a memorandum of mortgage in the form contained in Schedule D., or to the like effect\u201d; and by section 83 no instrument is to be \u201ceffectual * * * to render\u201d any land under the \u201cNew System\u201d liable as security for the payment of money or against any bond fide transferee of such land until such instrument be registered in accordance with the Act. The registered owner can charge his land in such a way as directly to burden the registered title only by the execution and registration of a memorandum in the prescribed form. It is quite clear, moreover, that the registration of a mortgage under the Act is not intended to vest in the mortgagee any registered \u201cinterest\u201d in the mortgagor\u2019s land as that term is used in the Act. By section 100 it is declared that\na mortgage * * * shall have effect as security, hut shall not operate as a transfer of the land thereby charged,\nand, in 1900, this section was amended by adding the words \u201cof an estate or interest therein.\u201d The amendment only had the effect, however, of making unmistakable the real operation of such a security under the law as it stood before the amendment was passed. That such was the effect of the statute appears readily enough when we compare and contrast the provisions relating to the transfer and registration of any interest less than full ownership and compare them with the provisions relating to the creation and registration of mortgages. The Act does not, in a word, treat the mortgage authorized by it as an instrument immediately effecting any dismemberment of the mortgagor\u2019s registered title. The operation of the statute is rather this: When a registered owner wishes to charge his registered title as security for a debt, he is to execute an instrument by which he declares that he \u201cmortgages\u201d his land and that instrument being registered the mortgagee becomes invested with such rights in respect of the possession of the land and its profits and the registered title becomes (for the benefit of the mortgagee) subject to such powers of disposition as the statute expressly or by implication declares. It is in these rights and powers that the virtue of the mortgage as a real security consists; and it is, consequently, to the statute that we must primarily resort to ascertain what are the rights and powers incidental to such a security.\nIt is argued that the view thus stated is too narrow, and another view is put forward, which is this: that the mortgage authorized by the Act is to be regarded as having annexed to it all the legal incidents which by law belong to a mortgage at common law and as being capable of having annexed to it by contract all the incidents which may by contract be annexed to a mortgage at common law in so far as such incidents are not expressly or by necessary implication excluded. I think in either view the practical result of this appeal must be the same; but I must say that it seems to me to be an artificial and unnatural reading of the statute to regard the mortgage contemplated by it as primarily a common law mortgage, and I think that in adopting such a reading one incurs some risk of losing the point of view from which the legislator envisaged the problem to which he was addressing himself. There is much in the Act to indicate an intention on the part of its authors that under the statutory mortgage the powers and rights of the mortgagee should in substance be economically equivalent to those possessed by a mortgagee under a common law mortgage; yet, juridically considered, there is \u2014 as I have indicated \u2014 this essential difference between the two instruments, viz.: that at common law the rights and powers of the mortgagee as such in respect of the mortgaged property are rights and powers which are incidental to the legal or equitable estate vested in him as mortgagee while under the statutory instrument the rights and powers of the mortgagee do not and cannot take their efficacy from any such estate because none is vested in him and his rights and powers must consequently rest directly upon the provisions of the statute itself.\nThis view, of course, does not involve the consequence that the mortgagee\u2019s rights are those only which the statute expressly gives him. It is obvious that many things are left to implication; and where, in any particular case, it appears that the rules governing reciprocal rights of the mortgagor and mortgagee under the mortgage contract in relation to the mortgaged property are left to implication then it is a question to be determined upon an examination of the statute as a whole how far the rights of the parties are to be governed by the rules of law which, apart from the statute, are applicable as between mortgagor and mortgagee.\nIt is to be premised generally that the statute nowhere countenances the idea that a registered owner can, except under the authority of some specific provision of the Act, by instrument inter vivos confer upon another the power to defeat or override his title by transferring a registered title to his property without constituting the donee of the power his agent for that purpose and without transferring any interest to the donee himself. It is probably needless to repeat what was said upon the argument that at common law an attempt by an owner of the legal estate in fee simple in land to endow, by an instrument inter vivos, a third person having no estate or interest legal or equitable in the land with power to vest an estate of freehold in another must, in the absence of an assurance to uses or a trust express or implied, utterly fail for reasons of the most elementary and obvious character; and there is nothing expressly or impliedly abrogating this general rule. There is nothing in a word to indicate any intention on the part of the legislature to declare or recognize any such general principle as that a licensee under a bare license to sell or convey land registered under the new system, given inter vivos, may validly\u2019 transfer a title to such land otherwise than as agent of the registered owner. On the contrary the Act expressly forbids the registration of any\ninstrument purporting to transfer or otherwise deal with or affect land under the new system\u2014except in the manner herein provided for registration under the new system nor unless such instrument be in accordance with the provisions of this Act as applicable to the new system.\nThe provision dealing with the transfer inter vivos generally (sec. 78), authorizes transfer only by the registered owner. Cases in which it is intended that such a power of disposition should be vested in other than the registered owner in consequence of some act inter vivos seem to have been carefully considered and specially provided for. All this, of course, has no reference to powers arising out of testamentary instruments. These stand, as everybody knows, upon another footing; and the rules governing the exercise of them have, of course, no relevancy whatever to any question we are concerned with on this appeal.\nThe statute contains express provisions conferring powers on the mortgagee to defeat the mortgagor\u2019s title by causing a title to vest in a purchaser through proceedings outside the registry (analogous to proceedings under a conventional power of sale in a common law mortgage) as well as by proceedings in the registry. There is nothing in the Act, however, indicating any intention to recognize the exercise of powers in that behalf by the mortgagee in addition to and independently of those conferred by these statutory provisions. On the contrary an examination of the legislation in the light of its history seems to shew that the legislature was dealing exhaustively with the powers of the statutory mortgagee to defeat the mortgagor\u2019s registered title in the express enactments relating to that subject and that in this respect nothing has been left to implication. I am not for the present considering the effect of an agreement introduced into a statutory mortgage as giving rise to equities between the mortgagee and mortgagor affecting the land in the mortgagor\u2019s hands; that I postpone for the present. I wish to examine the legislation with a view to ascertaining whether there is fair ground for an inference that by means of a conventional power introduced into a statutory mortgage, the mortgagee may be endowed with a power of divesting the mortgagor of his registered title by causing a registered title to the mortgaged property to be vested in a purchaser without the intervention of a court of equity and without taking advantage of the machinery expressly provided by the statute for that purpose.\nThe system of title by registration was introduced into Manitoba, as I have mentioned, by an Act of the Manitoba Legislature passed in 1885. The system had then for some years been in force in some of the Australian colonies and on the subject of mortgages the provisions of the Manitoba Act (with one significant exception) appear to be in substance those then in force in Victoria as will be seen by a reference to Mr. Hogg\u2019s invaluable book, \u201cThe Australian Torrens System.\u201d These provisions of the Victoria statute had been the subject of consideration by the courts in that colony as well as by the Privy Council; it is quite clear that judicial opinion was unanimously in favour of regarding these sections as providing the only means by which the mortgagee could extinguish the mortgagor\u2019s title. In the National Bank of Australasia v. The United Hand-in-Hand and Band of Hope Co.[14], at pages 405 and 406, Sir James W. Colville in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said:\u2014\nThe company was the registered owner of the mine under the provisions of the \u201cTransfer of Land Statute,\u201d and the mortgage was made under and subject to the provisions of the 83rd and following sections of that Act, and was duly registered thereunder. The instrument itself is in the form set forth in the 12th schedule to the Act, except that it contains, as that form permits, a special covenant or agreement which will be hereafter considered. Hence the only way in which the mortgagee could extinguish the rights of the mortgagor in the mine was by foreclosure under 31 Vict. No. 317 (of which there is no question here), or by a sale under the 84th, 85th and 87th sections of the \u201cTransfer of Land Act.\u201d To the same effect is the decision of the Chief Justice of Victoria in Greig v. Watson[15], pronounced in 1881. I think it cannot be presumed that the Manitoba Act was framed in ignorance of these authoritative pronouncements upon the effect of the legislation that province was adopting in a matter so deeply important as the rights of a mortgagee in respect of the foreclosure or sale of the mortgaged property. Yet nothing was introduced into the Act of 1885 to negative such a construction; and the only provision of the Victoria statute affording by its terms any plausible support to the appellant\u2019s view, a provision which afterwards (in 1900) was introduced into the Manitoba Act and which was largely relied on by the appellant in this connection, was left out of the Manitoba Act of 1885. The fair inference appears to be that the view of the effect of the Victoria statute expressed by the Privy Council was that which the framers of the Act of 1885 deliberately adopted; and the provisions of the Act as a whole strongly support this conclusion. The form of mortgage prescribed by section 99 contains a direction permitting the introduction of special covenants. There is no suggestion of conventional powers. That circumstance is, in my judgment, not without significance. It is quite true that a power of sale might be expressed in the form of a covenant, but if it is to confer upon the mortgagee the authority to execute an assurance of the mortgaged property and extinguish the mortgagor\u2019s title it is in substance much more than a covenant. The provisions of the Act shew that the distinction which lawyers understand between a power to deal with property in such a way as directly and immediately to effect the title to it and a mere personal obligation was not overlooked by the authors of the Act and in the form referred to the word \u201ccovenant\u201d appears to be employed in this its usual sense. The Act again permits mortgages only in the specified form (sections 83 and 99), and declares this form to be a part of the Act (sections 3 and 4). If the intention had been to permit the introduction of an agreement authorizing the mortgagee to deal with the title in a manner which the Act itself not only does not provide for, but which would appear to do violence to some of its express provisions, I think, in view of these stringent provisions, we might have expected something more explicit than a direction authorizing the introduction of \u201cspecial covenants.\u201d Then there is no provision for the registration of a transfer executed by a mortgagee under such a power. The Act, as I have pointed out, forbids the registrar to\nregister any instrument purporting to transfer or otherwise deal with or affect land under the new system, except in the manner herein provided for registration under the new system, nor unless such instrument be in accordance with the provisions of the Act, as applicable to the new system (sec. 83).\nThe transfer authorized by section 78 of the Act is a transfer by the registered owner; and such a transfer could not, of course, be executed by a mortgagee, as such. Provision is specially made for the registration of the transfers made by the mortgagees in execution of the express powers of sale vested in them by the Act itself (section 110), but that provision is strictly limited to such transfers. Provision, moreover, is expressly made preserving the rights and powers of mortgagees under mortgages existing at the time the land is brought under the \u201cnew system.\u201d In face of all this the omission of any provision touching the execution or the registration of transfers by a mortgagee under a statutory mortgage exercising a conventional power of sale appears to be significant.\nThere is a provision of the Act which was introduced as an amendment in 1889 and requires particular notice. It is contained in section 77 of that Act and is in these words:\u2014\n77 * * * Provided, however, that where an instrument, in accordance with the forms in use or sufficient to pass an estate or interest in lands under the old system deals with land under the new system, the inspector may, in his discretion in a proper case, direct the district registrar to register it under the new system, and when so registered it shall have the same effect as to the operative part thereof as and shall by implication he held to contain all such covenants as are implied in an instrument of a like nature under the new system, and if it is a mortgage the mortgagee may, for the purpose of foreclosure or sale under the mortgage, elect to proceed either under the provisions of this Act or as if the land were subject to the old system, but in case he proceeds under the provisions of this Act, and the mortgage covers other land not under the new system, he must before doing so bring all the land intended to be foreclosed or sold under the new system.\nThere can be little doubt as to the occasion which led to the enactment of this provision. The preparation of conveyances of land by unlearned persons (a practice facilitated by the general use of printed forms for such purposes even by professional lawyers) was, at the time of the passing of this Act, a very general practice in many of the provinces of Canada; and it was probably found that such forms in many cases were made to do duty for mortgaging and transferring land under the new system; and the provision mentioned was doubtless suggested by the frequent occurrence of such cases. It was evidently thought that in those cases it would be unfair to deprive the mortgagee of the benefit of powers which the parties might be presumed to have contemplated he should be entitled to exercise and he was given the option of resorting to them if the inspector of land registries should approve of the registration of his mortgage. The points to be noted are, first, that it was deemed necessary to make a special provision conferring on the mortgagee in such circumstances a right at his election to proceed under his conventional powers, a provision which seems superfluous if the appellant\u2019s contention be correct that the mortgagee under any registered mortgage may ipso jure have the benefit of rights and powers which he might at common law have exercised under a mortgage containing the like provisions; and secondly, the language used in authorizing the mortgagee \u201cto proceed as if the land were under the old system\u201d rather pointedly indicates that in the legislator\u2019s view proceedings by way of sale under a conventional power or by way of sale or foreclosure through a court of equity were as a general rule competent to a mortgagee only in respect of land \u201csubject to the old system.\u201d\nThus far of the legislation as it stood in 1892 when the mortgage in question was executed. In 1900 some amendments were introduced and it was one of these (section 108 of that Act) on which Mr. Coyne chiefly relied on this branch of his argument. That section is as follows:\u2014\nIn addition to and concurrently with the rights and powers conferred on a first mortgagee, every present and future first mortgagee for the time being of land under this Act, shall, until a discharge from the whole of the money secured or until a transfer upon a sale or order for foreclosure (as the case may be) shall have been registered, have the same rights and remedies at law and in equity as he would have had or been entitled to if the legal estate in the land or term mortgaged had been actually vested in him with a right in the owner of the land of quiet enjoyment of the mortgaged land until default in the payment of the principal and interest money secured or some part thereof respectively, or until a breach in the performance or observance of some covenant expressed in the mortgage or to be implied therein by the provisions of this Act. Nothing contained in this section shall affect or prejudice the rights or liabilities of any such mortgagee after an order for foreclosure shall have been entered in the register or shall, until the entry of such an order, render a first mortgagee of land leased under this Act liable to or for the payment of the rent reserved by the lease or for the performance or observance of the covenants expressed or to be implied therein.\nThe contention is that the mortgagee is by virtue of this enactment in the same position for all purposes as if the legal estate were vested in him and it follows, it is said, as a necessary corrollary that a conventional power of sale confers upon a statutory mortgagee the same powers of disposition over the mortgagor\u2019s title as would be vested in a legal mortgagee at common law.\nThe section read by itself with due attention to the phraseology employed appears to me to mean this: So long as the security is on foot as a security and the ownership of the land is consequently vested in the mortgagor the first mortgagee is to have certain rights and powers in respect of the land and they are to be the rights and powers to which he would by law be entitled if the legal estate were actually vested in him under an instrument such as that described. That is not to say \u2014 at least so it seems to me \u2014 that by this enactment the statutory mortgagee is endowed with any novel power to extinguish the mortgagor\u2019s title or to convey an estate to a purchaser; and there are some considerations which I think make it impossible to give such an effect to the section. The first of these considerations is that this section, as I have already mentioned, was to be found in the Act which the Judicial Committee was discussing in the passage I have quoted and I think if the intention in re-enacting the section in Manitoba had been to establish the law upon a footing different from that indicated in the view there expressed we might have expected something explicit to indicate that intention.\nThen this section deals with the rights of the first mortgagee only. That would appear to indicate that those rights only are contemplated with which the law would invest a legal mortgagee as peculiarly incidental to his possession of the legal estate. If rights of foreclosure and sale, independently of the other provisions of the Act, were in view there appears to be no explanation why the benefit of such rights was withheld from the holders of mortgages subsequent to the first.\nIn considering, moreover, the effect of the amendment embodied in section 108 it is to be observed that it must be read with other amendments which were introduced into the statute at the same time and particularly with the amendments affected by sections 100 and 110 of the Act. These latter amendments, it is true, are not expressly (as section 108 is) made applicable to existing mortgages. But it is not, of course, to be supposed that the last mentioned enactment having been declared to be applicable to existing as well as to future mortgages was intended to have an operation in respect of future instruments different from its operation in respect of those already existing; and we may properly look at the whole of the contemporary legislation which is in pari materia in order to ascertain the effect of any part of it. Section 100 makes explicit what, as I have already mentioned, was already implicitly in the Act; that the mortgage does not vest in the mortgagee any estate or interest in the land pledged as security. That section declares that the first mortgagee is to have no \u201cinterest\u201d in the land \u2014 thus emphasizing the characteristic of the statutory mortgage upon which 1 have been dwelling, viz., that, as regards title, the mortgagee has no registered interest, but only powers of disposition.\nThe amendment embodied in section 110 emphasizes another feature of the Act, viz.: that, in course of the exercise of the statutory powers to extinguish or dispose of the mortgagor\u2019s title, the legislature has provided for the protection of the mortgagor by subjecting such proceedings to the supervision of a public officer. The proviso to that section is as follows:\u2014\nProvided that, in case the mortgage or incumbrance contains a provision that the sale may take place without any notice being served on any of the parties, the district registrar may order such sale to take place accordingly.\nThis enactment affords evidence of the care with which the legislature deemed it necessary to protect the mortgagor against oppression or unfairness or mere carelessness on the part of the mortgagee as well as improvidence on his own part in this matter of the sale of the mortgaged property. The provisions of section 109 by which the period of one month which that section requires shall elapse between the mortgagor\u2019s default and the service of notice of intention to sell is permitted to be extended, but is not allowed to be abridged; and the provision of section 110, first introduced in 1892, requiring that the manner in which the sale is to be conducted as well as the conditions of sale shall be determined by the registrar are other instances of the same careful forethought for the interests of the embarrassed mortgagor. I have no doubt these precautions were not taken without good reason; and it would require some language more apt to the purpose than that of section 108 to convince me that the legislature intended by that section to enable the mortgagee by the simple expedient of exacting a conventional power of sale to neutralize these carefully devised expedients for the protection of the mortgagor.\nFor these reasons I think that whether we regard the rights of the mortgagee as governed by the enactments of the Act of 1900, or by those in force in 1892 when the mortgage was executed, the conventional power of sale on which the appellant\u2019s title rests conferred no legal authority upon the mortgagee to extinguish the registered title of the mortgagor except under and according to the express provisions of the statute in that behalf.\nIt is still necessary, however, to refer to the Act of 1906. Sections 2 and 3 of, that Act are as follows:\n2. Section 108 of the said Act is hereby amended by inserting after the word \u201cequity\u201d in the seventh line thereof the words \u201cincluding the right to foreclosure or sell through any competent court.\u201d\n3. Section 126 of the said Act is hereby amended by adding after the word \u201ctherein\u201d in the fourth line thereof the following, \u201cor over mortgages, nor shall anything contained in this Act affect the right of the mortgagee to foreclose or sell through any competent court, which right it is hereby declared may be exercised in such court.\u201d\nThese enactments were passed long after the sale in question took place and, notwithstanding the form of the amendment in section 3 and notwithstanding the fact that the amendment of section 108 would by the express terms of that section apply to mortgages in existence at the time the amendment was passed, they cannot, I think, be taken to have any such retrospective effect as to determine the construction and operation of the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d at the date either of the execution of the mortgage in question on this appeal or of the professed exercise of the power of sale. Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[16], at page 775. These amendments are, however, to a limited degree not without relevancy to the point under discussion. They afford an additional instance in which the legislature, having before it the subject of proceedings by the mortgagee for the extinguishment of the mortgagor\u2019s title, seems to have deliberately avoided any recognition of proceedings under a conventional power of sale; and, furthermore, while these enactments constitute a departure from the strict principle of the earlier enactments as explained by the Privy Council in National Bank of Australasia v. United Hand-in-Hand Band of Hope Co.[17], at pages 405 and 506, in that they provide for proceedings for foreclosure and sale in Equity they indicate no abandonment of the principle to which I have adverted, of requiring all proceedings for the extinguishment of the mortgagor\u2019s title to take place under the supervision of a public officer.\nAs I have already said, I do not think it was seriously contended that the transfer in question could be supported as a transfer made in execution of the statutory power of sale; and I agree that such a contention is quite hopeless.\nI think it is not a forced construction of the Act of 1891, as amended in 1892, or of the Act of 1900, to say that the express provisions of these statutes in respect of the exercise of the statutory power of sale relating to the supervision by the registrar over the manner and conditions of sale and to the giving of notice of intention to sell are imperative provisions; and that the \u201cspecial covenants\u201d which are authorized to be introduced into the statutory mortgage must be such as are not repugnant or contrary to those provisions. Assuming then that the power of sale in the mortgage in question may fairly be read as professing to give an authority to the mortgagee to sell without notice, and assuming also that the rights of the parties are not to be governed by section 110 of the Act of 1900, such a dispensation from observance of the requirements of the statute could, nevertheless, not be permitted to take effect. The respondent\u2019s case, however, does not necessarily rest upon this view that the proceedings by the mortgagee under the statutory power are thus inexorably prescribed by the statute; because it is perfectly clear that there is nothing in the mortgage indicating an intention to dispense with the supervision by the registrar, required by section 109 of the Act of 1891 as amended by that of 1892, and, moreover, there is no pretence that any supervision took place, or that there was any attempt in fact to observe the conditions of the statutory power or any intention to exercise that power.\nBut it is suggested that the power in question gave some authority to a mortgagee to vest equitable rights in a purchaser in defeasance of the mortgagor\u2019s title. On that suggestion I have to make two observations in limine. First: No court governed by equitable principles would permit itself to be made an instrument in effecting the evasion of the imperative provisions of section 110 (either as to notice or as to supervision), under the pretence of protecting equitable as distinguished from legal rights; and, secondly, the action was not brought to enforce equitable rights. There is not a shadow of a suggestion of such rights in the pleadings or in the record from the first to the last page. The right asserted is the absolute legal right to be registered as owner of the mortgaged property. What facts relating to the conduct of the parties having a bearing upon the equities between them might have been disclosed if a claim based upon equitable grounds had been put forward it is impossible now to say. It is clear, however, from the mortgage deed alone that no equitable rights in the land in question have been vested in the appellant. If an attempt were made by a debtor (without formally vesting in his creditor an estate or interest and without creating any trust or executing any assurance to uses) to confer on the creditor as security for his debt a power to sell land held under a common law title then no doubt a court of equity might, in a proper case, find a method of giving effect to such an instrument by way of equitable charge. And in the case of an informal document professing to create such a power a trust in favour of the creditor or in favour of purchasers from him might be implied if it were necessary to imply such a trust in order to prevent the instrument failing of operation entirely. Such a case is perhaps conceivable.\nBut it is clear that it would be a violation of principle to imply any such a trust unless on the one hand it was manifest that the parties really intended a trust to be created or on the other it was necessary to assume they had done so in order to prevent a failure of consideration. Now consider the instrument before us. First the instrument is a formal conveyance prepared, as we may assume, by the solicitors of a great mortgage company. There is not a word in the document to indicate an intention on the part of anybody that a trust in favour of the mortgagees or a purchaser should be created. On the other hand it is indisputable that the instrument was intended to be a statutory mortgage taking effect under the statute and all the probabilities of the case favour the view that the power of sale was intended to be a power taking effect as incidental to such a mortgage and to confer authority to deal with the registered title and to vest in the purchaser a title under the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d by the execution of a transfer which could be registered under that Act without resorting to judicial proceedings.\nThe assumption that the parties intended to create a trust in favour of the mortgagee, or a purchaser to be nominated by him, would really be a very extravagant one; and I do not think it was welcomed by Mr. Coyne when I suggested it to him during the course of his useful and able argument. It is really impossible to suppose that these parties ever entertained the idea of vesting in the mortgagee (in addition to the legal authority to deal with the mortgagor\u2019s estate conferred upon him by the statute) some equitable right to which effect could only be given by proceedings in equity or the authority to confer some such right upon a purchaser. The reading of the clause in question most consonant with the probable intentions and expectations of the parties is, as Mr. Wilson argued, that which treats it as a power of sale to be given effect to under the authority of and through the machinery provided by the statute.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014On this appeal several questions present themselves for determination:\u2014 (1) Whether the title of a registered owner of land under the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d of Manitoba is extinguished by adverse possession of the land held by his mortgagee and persons claiming under him in circumstances and for the period which would under section 20 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, chapter 100, extinguish the title to it of the mortgagor if the land were not under the Act.\n(2) Whether, in the case of a mortgage of land registered under the Act, the mortgagor may, by introducing apt and sufficient words into a statutory mortgage, confer upon his mortgagee a power of sale additional to and independent of the statutory power given by sections 109 and 110 of the Act, and whether such a power, if so created, may be exercised by the mortgagee as in the case of a like power conferred on a mortgagee of land not under the Act and without reference to the provisions of sections 109 and 110.\n(3) Whether the power of sale contained in the mortgage in question in this action should be deemed a power independent of and additional to the statutory power conferred by sections 109 and 110 or should be deemed merely a variation of such statutory power.\n(4) Whether the words used in the mortgage are sufficient to confer an effectual power of sale.\n(5) Whether they give a power of sale without notice; and\n(6) Whether, in view of the fact that the mortgagee takes no interest or estate in, but merely obtains security on, the land (section 100), the special power of sale, if effectually given, can be exercised without resorting to the provisions of sections 109112 of the Act. The clause in the mortgage upon which the five latter questions arise is as follows:\u2014\nIt is also covenanted between me and the said mortgagees that if I shall make default in payment of the said principal sum and interest thereon, or any part thereof at any of the before appointed times then the said mortgagees shall have the right and power and I do hereby covenant with the said mortgagees for such purpose and do grant to the said mortgagees full license and authority for such purpose when and so often as in their discretion they shall think fit to enter into possession either by themselves or their agent, of the said lands, and to collect the rents and profits thereof, or to make any demise or lease of the said lands, or any part thereof for such terms, periods, and at such rent as they shall think proper, or to sell the said lands and such entry, demise or lease shall operate as a termination of the tenancy hereinbefore mentioned without any notice being required, and that the power of sale herein embodied and contained may be exercised either before or after and subject to such demise or lease. Provided that any sale made under the powers herein may be for cash or upon credit or partly for cash and partly for credit and that the said mortgagees may vary or rescind any contract for sale made or entered into by virtue hereof.\nThe mortgage provides that the expression \u201cmortgagees\u201d wherever it is used in the mortgage shall include the mortgagees\u2019 \u201csuccessors and assigns.\u201d\nFor convenience I shall deal with the questions in an order somewhat different from that in which I have stated them.\nAssuming for the moment, that an owner of land registered under the \u201cNew System\u201d can, in a statutory mortgage under the \u201cReal Property Act,\u201d confer on his mortgagee a powder of sale other than and independent of the statutory power, I think that the provision of the mortgage which I have quoted creates such a power. It purports to give to the mortgagee an express authority \u201cto sell the said land\u201d without attaching to it any of the conditions of the statutory power. The statutory power (at all events unless expressly negatived, section 157) is inherent in every statutory mortgage. No words conferring or declaring it are required in the mortgage. Reference is properly made to it only for the purpose of modifying, or, perhaps, of excluding it. Unless another and an independent power was contemplated by the parties, the provision in the present mortgage granting to the mortgagees full license and authority to sell the lands is entirely supererogatory. It is scarcely necessary to refer to the canon of interpretation opposed to such a construction. Moreover, the reference in the concluding proviso of the clause quoted from the mortgage to \u201cany sale made under the powers herein\u201d indicates that the parties contemplated the existence of more than one power of sale \u2014 the inherent statutory power and also the power expressed in the mortgage.\nIn the absence of any other allusion in the mortgage to the statutory power I find no support for the suggestion that the purpose of the clause under consideration was not to create a special and independent power of sale, but merely to modify the statutory power.\nI agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba that the words \u201cwithout any notice being required\u201d apply only to the termination of the tenancy of the mortgagor provided for in the mortgage and do not affect or qualify the authority to sell. But I am also of the opinion that, in the absence of any condition as to notice being annexed to it, the express power of sale conferred by the mortgage may be exercised without notice. Jones v. Matthie[18]; Bythewood and Jarman\u2019s Conveyancing (4 ed.), p. 689; Smith\u2019s Equity (4 ed.), p. 297.\nNo precise or technical form of words is necessary to create a power of sale. It suffices that the intention be sufficiently denoted. Sugden on Powers (8 ed.), p. 182; Farwell on Powers (2 ed.), p. 48. The intention is here clearly expressed; the donor was competent; the instrument \u2014 a deed \u2014is apt; and the object is lawful and proper.\nThe objection to the sufficiency of the power urged on behalf of the respondents, that the donee of it has no estate, legal or equitable, in the mortgaged land, is possibly met, as Mr. Coyne contended, by the provisions of section 108 of the Act which gives to every first mortgagee\nthe same rights and remedies at law and in equity as he would have had or been entitled to if the legal estate in the land or term mortgaged had been actually vested in him, etc.\nI rather think; however, that this provision is intended to preserve to, or to Confer upon the mortgagee, for the protection of whatever interest he may have under the terms of the statutory form of mortgage, rights and remedies other than the power to convey the land and that it would not enable him in the exercise of a power of sale other than that conferred by the statute to give a conveyance which would have the effect of vesting in his purchaser the; mortgagor\u2019s title and estate in the mortgaged registered land. I am confirmed in this view of the scope and purpose of section 108 by the fact that, notwithstanding its presence in the statute, the legislature deemed special provisions necessary to give to the conveyance of a mortgagee exercising the statutory power of sale the effect of vesting in the transferee the mortgagor\u2019s title and estate (sections 111, 112).\nBut the objection, in my opinion, cannot prevail, although it should be held that, for the purposes of powers of sale section 108 is inapplicable and that the mortgagee is in the same position as if he were a stranger without any estate or interest in the land, and although the power should be regarded as simply collateral, or as a power in gross because exercisable for the benefit of the donee. Sugden on Powers, p. 47(8). A power given to nominees of a testator to sell estates vested not in them, but in devisees of the donor was held by Kay J. in Re Brown[19], to be unquestionable and was treated as an instance of the equitable powers arising, as put by Lord St. Leonards in his book (8 ed., pp. 45-6) out of\ndeclarations or directions operating only on the consciences of the persons in whom the legal estate is vested.\nand whom\nequity would compel * * * to convey according to the (donee\u2019s) contract (32 Ch. D. at p. 601).\nIn the Brown Case19, the donor\u2019s devisees of the estate were bound in equity to convey to the purchaser from the donees of the power; in the present case the mortgagor; in whom the whole estate remained notwithstanding the mortgage (section 100) and those claiming under him are subject to the like duty arising out of the trust of the land declared by the mortgagor in giving to his mortgagees a special express power of sale, while retaining the whole estate in the land. If the mortgagees neither had themselves, nor had the right, by a contract made in the exercise of their power of sale, to create in their purchaser an equitable interest in the land, which the mortgagor or his representatives might be compelled to perfect by a transfer or conveyance, they were at all events empowered to confer on him a right to claim such a transfer or conveyance which a court exercising equitable jurisdiction will enforce. The registrar is not obliged \u2014 indeed he is probably not entitled \u2014 to recognize or to register a transfer of the land executed by a mortgagee of new-system land acting under any other than the statutory power. But the equity which the mortgagee acting under a special power of sale creates as against the mortgagor and those claiming under him by the contract with his purchaser, will be recognized by the courts and will in a proper proceeding be enforced against them; Re Massey and Gibson[20]; Wilkie v. Jellett[21]; and the court will give proper directions for the execution of any necessary assurances and for action by the registrar upon them.\nIt is noteworthy that the statute itself contains a provision under which a purchaser from a mortgagee, selling new-system land under a power of sale in his mortgage may, in order to complete his title, be entitled in equity to a transfer from the mortgagor or the registered owner claiming under him and may be obliged to resort to a court of equity to compel such a conveyance. Section 83 provides for the registration of old-form instruments dealing with lands registered under the new system. As to its \u201coperative parts,\u201d when so registered such an instrument is declared to have the same effect as \u201can instrument of like nature under the new system.\u201d Estates or interests in land under the new system are transferable not by execution and delivery of an instrument, but only by and upon registration of it (sections 80 and 81). An unregistered instrument merely confers a right or claim to its registration (section 90). An old-form mortgage of land under the new system, though its registration should be procured under section 83, does not transfer to the mortgagee any estate or interest in the mortgaged premises (section 100). But section 83, nevertheless, provides that\nthe mortgagee may, for the purpose of foreclosure or sale under the mortgage, elect to proceed either under the provisions of this Act, or as if the lands were subject to the old system.\nShould he exercise the latter option and proceed to sell under his power of sale without reference to the registrar, having no estate or interest in the land, he could not, in the absence of some statutory provision giving that effect to his conveyance, vest any legal title in his purchaser. Re Hudson and Howes\u2019 Contract[22]. Such a provision is made by section 112 in respect of conveyance by mortgagees in the exercise of powers of sale contained in mortgages affecting the land before it was brought under the new system:\nUpon the registration of any memorandum or instrument or transfer executed * * * by a mortgagee selling under the power of sale in any mortgage which affected the land when the first certificate of title issued therefor, the estate or interest of the owner of the land mortgaged or incumbered shall pass to and vest in the purchasers, etc.\nIn the case of a purchase from a mortgagee exercising under the old system the power of sale in an old-form mortgage registered under section 83 against new-system land, unless the mortgagee had been made the mortgagor\u2019s attorney to convey his estate and the sale was made while the mortgagor was still the owner of the land, the purchaser or transferee would acquire merely an equitable interest or an equitable right to a transfer which the mortgagor, or his representative, would be compellable in a court of equity to perfect by a legal transfer of the mortgaged property.\nIf, therefore, it is competent for the registered owner of land under the new system, when giving a mortgage under the Act, to confer upon his mortgagee a power of sale independent of and additional to the inherent statutory power conferred by sections 109 and 110 and exercisable without reference to those sections, no case having been made of fraud or mistake affecting the creation, or of imposition or unfair dealing affecting the exercise of the power here in question, I see no reason why the sale under it by the assigns of the mortgagees should not be upheld as giving to their purchasers an equitable interest or right enforceable against the mortgagor or his representatives, or why the plaintiff, who was that purchaser, should not in this action obtain appropriate relief. In the absence of a provision, such as is found in section 112, or of a power-6f-attorney from the mortgagor enabling the mortgagee effectually to transfer the mortgaged land to, and to vest it in his purchaser, the latter must, if the mortgagor or his representatives will not voluntarily execute a transfer in his favour, seek the aid of the courts to perfect his title and to put him in a position to become the registered owner.\nFinding nothing in the statute which ousts their jurisdiction, I know of no reason why the courts should not grant to the plaintiff the relief to which he has shewn himself to be entitled.\nBut, can the owner of land registered under the \u201cnew system\u201d give to his mortgagee a power of sale other than the statutory power and exercisable without observance of the requirements of sections 109 and 110 of the Act? There is no clause in the \u201cReal Property Act\u201d which forbids him doing so. Neither can it be said that the existence of such a right would be incompatible with any provision of the Act or destructive of any right which it confers or of the machinery which it provides for the cases to which it applies. All that the statute enacts is that, without an express power of sale being given him in his mortgage, a mortgagee taking a statutory form of mortgage is authorized and empowered to sell the mortgaged land. If he should elect to exercise this statutory power certain terms and conditions are prescribed which he must observe. But nowhere does the Act say that the statutory power shall be the only power of sale which a mortgagee of land under it shall have or exercise, or that any other power of sale which the mortgage may purport to give shall be exercisable only on terms and conditions the same as those prescribed for the exercise of the statutory power. Neither is it provided by sections 109 and 110, or by any other section of the Act, that, in every case and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary which may have been made in the mortgage, it shall be the right of a mortgagor that his mortgagee shall not exercise any power of sale of the mortgaged premises until there has been one month\u2019s default and (as the Act stood prior to 1900, or 1902) until a notice has been given by the mortgagee under section 109 and another month has elapsed after the giving of such notice. No such right is conferred on the mortgagor. All that the statute provides is that, if the mortgagee wishes to avail himself of the statutory power of sale which it confers, he may do so only upon observing the prescribed conditions. In this respect the provisions of the Manitoba \u201cReal Property Act\u201d are similar to those of \u201cLord Cranworth\u2019s Act.\u201d No one ever thought that the provisions for a statutory power of sale made by that legislation prevent mortgagors and mortgagees contracting for independent and additional powers of sale upon such terms as they may think proper.\nIt is contended for the respondents, however, that it is a fair and reasonable implication from the Act taken as a whole that the legislature intended to deny to mortgagors and mortgagees of land under it the right of contracting for any special power of sale and to prevent a mortgagee of such land obtaining any power of sale other than that which the Act itself confers on the statutory mortgagee; and in support of this view great reliance is placed on the fact that a mortgagee of land under the Act acquires no estate or interest in it.\nIn examining the statute in order to discover whether it affords evidence of any plan or scheme of legislation incompatible with the existence of a right to provide in the statutory mortgage for a special power of sale exercisable independently of sections 109 and 110, I find that in section 99 a form of mortgage of new-system land is prescribed. But by clause (z) of section 2, it is provided that:\u2014\nWhenever a form in the schedules hereto is directed to be used such direction shall apply equally to any form to the like effect * * * and any variation from such, forms not being a variation of a matter of substance shall not affect their validity or regularity, but they may be used with such alterations as the character of the parties or the circumstances of the case may render necessary.\nOn turning to the prescribed form, \u201cD,\u201d I observe that, in the third clause, it contemplates special provisions visions being made \u2014 \u201cHere set forth special covenants if any.\u201d Section 157 of the statute provides that\nevery covenant and power declared to be implied in any instrument by virtue of this Act may be negatived or modified by express declaration in the instrument or indorsed thereon.\nAlthough the power of sale given by section 110 is not \u201cdeclared to be implied in\u201d the statutory mortgage, as are the covenant for indemnity mentioned in section 89 and the covenants and powers in statutory leases mentioned in sections 94 and 95, I incline to the view that the power of sale given by section 110 should be regarded as within the provisions of section 157. But whether that is or is not the case, the special power of sale given by the mortgage now under consideration was a \u201cspecial covenant\u201d and was an alteration in the nature of an addition to the prescribed form which it was, in my opinion, competent for the parties to make, if they thought \u201cthe circumstances of the case rendered it necessary,\u201d and it was not \u201ca variation in substance\u201d and certainly did not affect the \u201cvalidity or regularity\u201d of the instrument.\nIt is not the scheme of the Act that the implication of statutory covenants or powers in other instruments should preclude the introduction of express covenants and powers of an entirely different character and not mere modifications 6f the implied covenants and powers, or the enforcement, in the event of breaches, of such express covenants or of any special remedies for which the parties may have contracted. This has been held in respect to clauses in the New South Wales and South Australian Acts, similar to sections 93-96 of the Manitoba statute, which provide for implied covenants and powers in leases and for the determination of such leases by proceedings in the registrar\u2019s office where there has been non-observance of the implied covenants. Baker\u2019s Creek Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v. Hack[23]; Bucknall v. Reid[24].\nProvision is made by sections 83 and 112 of the Act, already alluded to, for the exercise by a mortgagee in certain cases of powers of sale in respect of new-system land other than that conferred by the statute and without observance of the provisions of sections 109 and 110. The respondent bases on the presence in the statute of sections 83 and 112 an argument, undoubtedly entitled to some weight, that they indicate an intention on the part of the legislature that, except in the cases thus specially provided for, no power of sale other than the statutory power conferred by section 110 shall be exercisable by a mortgagee of new-system land. I rather think, however, that these provisions indicate that the Act was not meant to be so inelastic as the respondents contend; that contractual powers of sale other than the statutory power are not precluded; and that, while, except in the special case dealt with by section 112, the statute does not facilitate the exercise of contractual powers specially created, or aid or give efficacy to transfers made under them, persons using them and claiming under them are permitted to assert and exercise such rights as their contracts expressly give them and to obtain such relief as the courts may allow.\nThere is nothing to prevent the parties inserting a provision enabling the mortgagee who exercises a special contractual power of sale to convey to his purchaser, as attorney of the mortgagor, the latter\u2019s estate in the mortgaged land. Because not essential to its exercise, the power of sale does not, I think, carry such a power of attorney as a necessary incident. To avoid the expense and delay involved in recourse to the courts, such an express provision would, however, seem to be reasonable and desirable in the interest of all parties whenever a special contractual power of sale is given. But when the mortgagee is not so empowered to convey the mortgagor\u2019s estate, or where the mortgagor has parted with his estate, I perceive no reason why the purchaser under a special power of sale lawfully exercised may not successfully invoke the equitable jurisdiction of the courts.\nIf this view be not correct it would be impossible for mortgagors and mortgagees to provide for the sale of land mortgaged under the new system until there had been one month\u2019s default as the Act now stands, and, as it was prior to the introduction in 1900, or 1902, of the proviso to section 110, until there had been at least two months\u2019 default and certain notice had been given. In many cases where the property dealt with is highly speculative in character or where for other reasons the mortgagee is willing to lend his money only if enabled in the event of default to realize immediately upon his security, owners of registered land might find themselves seriously embarrassed and perhaps even driven to sacrifice it because unable to obtain a loan upon it. Again, if the statutory power of sale is the only permissible power, and if it is necessarily inherent in every mortgage (as it must be unless it may be negatived under section 157) an owner of new-system land insisting that his mortgagee should have no power of sale whatever would find himself unable to give a mortgage on his land.\nHaving regard to the tendency of modern legislation towards permitting freedom of contract in dealing with land as with other property and to the inconveniences and difficulties which such a construction of the statute would entail, I think we would not be justified in assuming that the legislature meant to tie the hands of owners of land registered under the new system, as is contended for the respondents, unless, that intention not being distinctly expressed, it is abundantly clear that the scheme of the Act would be defeated if the contrary view should prevail.\nNotwithstanding the explicit language of section 80 that\nevery transfer (of land) shall, when registered, operate as an absolute transfer of all such right and title as the transferor had therein at the time of its execution unless a contrary intention be expressed in such transfer,\nI have no doubt that where it was intended to operate as a security for money, a registered transfer of land under the Act may, as between the parties, have no greater effect than a mortgage of land had under the old system, and that it is within the power of a court clothed with equitable jurisdiction to declare that the person registered as owner under such a transfer is merely a mortgagee and that his transferor has an equity of redemption in the land and to require the person registered as owner to submit to redemption. That such a court may exercise this jurisdiction where there is an unregistered deed of defeasance was determined in Sander v. Twigg[25]. That it can afford the same relief where it is proved that the real understanding of the parties was that a transfer though absolute in form, should be taken by way of security only is, I think, equally clear \u2014 and that apart from the provisions of section 126 of the statute. Williams v. Box[26]. I make this passing allusion only because it is illustrative of the equitable jurisdiction which the statute, notwithstanding its sweeping terms, should be held not to have destroyed.\nAlthough section 71 declares that\u2014\nevery certificate of title hereafter or heretofore issued under this Act shall, so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled be conclusive evidence at law and in equity as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever (that the person named in such certificate is entitled to the land described therein for the estate or interest therein specified,\nwere it not for the express provision of section 75, the title of a registered owner of land holding such a certificate would, nevertheless, be extinguishable by adverse possession for the period prescribed by the Statute of Limitations. Belize Estate and Produce Co. v. Quilter[27].\nWithout committing myself to the proposition advanced by Mr. Coyne that the Manitoba \u201cReal Property Act\u201d \u201cmerely introduced a simpler system of registration\u201d and did not in any other respect interfere with, modify or displace the general law respecting real property, I think, that, in view of the instances to which I have alluded, it cannot be said that there is any clear or well-defined scheme of the Act to which it would be repugnant that a mortgagee should be given by contract a special power of sale independent of, and exercisable without reference to the provisions of sections 109 and 110. It would have been so very easy for the legislature to have provided, if that were its purpose, that, whatever the provisions of his mortgage, a mortgagee of land under the new system should not have or exercise over the mortgaged land any power of sale other than that conferred by the statute, that, in the absence of such a provision, I think we would not be justified in assuming that it was intended that this should be the effect of the statute.\nThe argument against the existence of the right to confer any power of sale other than the statutory power based on the fact that the mortgagee has no estate or interest in the land loses any force it might otherwise have when we find that, notwithstanding that fact, a contractual power of sale and its exercise without reference to the provisions of sections 109 et seq. are expressly permitted under section 83, the purchaser, in the absence of a special provision in the mortgage enabling the mortgagee to convey the mortgagor\u2019s estate, being left to obtain title either by the voluntary act of the mortgagor or his representatives, or through the intervention of a court of equity.\nAlthough the observation of Lord Macnaghten that\nno one, I am sure, by the light of nature, ever understood an English mortgage of real estate (Samuel v. Jarrah Timber and Wood Paving Corp.[28]),\nmay be applied with peculiar fitness and significance to a mortgage under the Manitoba \u201cReal Property Act,\u201d I am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that it is competent for the parties to such a mortgage to provide for a special power of sale exercisable without reference to the provisions of sections 109 and 110; that in the mortgage now before us this has been sufficiently done; that, in the absence of any proof of fraud or mistake in its creation or of imposition or unfairness in its exercise, the power was effectual and was well exercised; and that the plaintiff obtained if not an equitable interest in the land at least an equitable right to a conveyance of the land from the mortgagor or his representatives which the court, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, will recognize and enforce.\nI would, therefore, with respect, allow the plaintiff\u2019s appeal with costs.\nJudgment should, in my opinion, be entered declaring that the sale of the lands to the plaintiff was a valid and proper exercise of the power contained in the mortgage in question, and directing that the defendants, the National Trust Company, in whom as personal representatives of the deceased mortgagor, the legal ownership of such land is vested under 5 & 6 Edw. VII. (Man.), ch. 21, shall execute and deliver a transfer of such lands to the plaintiff, and that, upon the plaintiff filing in the land titles office such transfer together with the deed executed by the mortgagees in the exercise of the power of sale, the districtregistrar shall cancel the existing certificate of title and issue a new certificate of title to the lands in question in favour of the plaintiff for such estate as the mortgagor held therein. The plaintiff should also have his costs of this action including the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nBrodeur J.:\u2014I concur with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, Fullerton, Coyne & Foley.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tupper, Galt, Tapper, Minty & McTavish.\n[1] 20 Man.

Judgment appealed from (20 Man. R. 178) reversed, Davies J. dissenting. Per Davies J. dissenting.\u2014As the agreement was not, in the circumstances, void at common law as being unreasonably in restraint of trade it did not violate the statute.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Mathers C.J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe circumstances for the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. and F. M. Burbidge, for the appellants.\nM. G. Macneil, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The action in this case is brought for an account based upon a contract between the plaintiff and the defendants which is described in the statement of claim as an agreement\nfor the purpose of carrying on their business in a manner mutually profitable to both parties to the said agreement.\nThe defence denies the state of the account as alleged and pleads the illegality of the agreement under sections 496 and 498 of the Criminal Code which are grouped under the general heading of \u201cOffences connected with Trade.\u201d The trial judge decided the point of illegality in favour of appellants. On appeal this judgment was reversed.\nHaving very carefully read the cases cited by counsel at the argument and referred to by the judges below in their notes, I cannot better describe my condition of mind than by quoting from a very recent opinion of an eminent English jurist who said:\u2014 I am convinced it is impossible to give in a few pages a complete and accurate exposition of the English law as to combinations which are in restraint of trade or unduly impede free competition or employment so as to deduce from the numerous and conflicting cases clear and definite principles.\nThe same authority says that the case of The Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow & Co.[2], only decided that an action for conspiracy could not be maintained by the plaintiff, because the defendants did not by entering into the contract under consideration render themselves guilty of a criminal conspiracy. But on the question whether the contract was void and illegal because it was in undue restraint of trade or unduly impeded free competition, there was the utmost diversity of opinion both among the judges and the noble and learned Lords. In Mitchel v. Reynolds[3], the following principles were laid down: that all contracts in general restraint of trade are illegal in the sense of not being enforceable, but that agreements in partial restraint of trade, if for consideration, are valid, provided that the restraint is reasonable, in the sense that it is such as is reasonably necessary for the protection of the person who seeks to impose restraint (covenantee). In this case, however, we are not called upon to consider in what respect the contract declared upon is affected by the principles of the English law as to restraint of trade, nor are we at liberty to invent or give effect to any new ground of public policy. Our duty is to determine its validity in view of those sections of the Criminal Code relied upon. In effect, clause (d) of section 498 of the Code declares in very plain language that an agreement which might in itself be perfectly lawful as made by the parties in the exercise of the freedom to contract or to abstain from contracting, which the English law has for many years recognized in every individual, is unlawful if the object of the parties is to unduly prevent or lessen competition in an article or commodity which is a subject of trade or commerce. In other words, if the object of the parties to the agreement is to interfere with the free course of trade by unduly preventing or lessening competition the agreement is declared to be unlawful. It is not necessary, I repeat, that the agreement should be in itself fraudulent or otherwise illegal; and all agreements which prevent or lessen competition do not come within the operation of the statute; the mischief aimed at is the undue and abusive lessening of competition which operates to the oppression of individuals or is injurious to the public generally. And it is for the courts to say whether in the circumstances of each particular case the mischief aimed at exists. In The United States v. The Trans-Missouri Freight Association[4], it was held that the \u201cSherman Act\u201d applies equally to all contracts tending to create a monopoly, whether or not they are reasonable, or whether or not they are unlawful at common law.\nParliament has not sought to regulate the prices of commodities to the consumer, but it is the policy of the law to encourage trade and commerce and Parliament has declared illegal all agreements and combinations entered into for the purpose of limiting the activities of individuals for the promotion of trade; and preventing or lessening unduly that competition which is the life of trade and the only effective regulator of prices is prohibited. The question for decision here, assuming the law to be as I have stated it, is: Was the contract declared upon entered into for the purpose of unduly limiting competition in the purchase or sale of an article which is ordinarily a subject of commerce? It is admitted by both parties that junk, the subject-matter of the contract, is ordinarily a subject of commerce. The trial judge found that the manifest purpose of the agreement was to prevent competition between the parties to it, and to affect prices. He said:\u2014\nIt cannot be doubted that the tendency of such an agreement would be to lower prices on the junk purchased from the public, and, possibly, to increase the price of junk sold to the consumers.\nThe learned judge also said:\u2014\nIt is true that in the present case the agreement to fix prices was between two dealers only, but these two practically monopolised the whole trade in junk in Western Canada, and when they ceased to compete with each other all competition was gone. The effect of their agreement was not only to limit competition, but to destroy it.\nAnd there can be no doubt on the evidence that the conclusion reached by the learned judge is well founded; the main object and purpose of the agreement was to eliminate competition and to control the junk market in all Western Canada both as to purchases and sales and, on that ground, I hold that the question must be answered in the affirmative and that the agreement is, therefore, bad under the sections of the Code. I can see no distinction in principle between this agreement and one that might be entered into between two or more traders to control the price of all wheat purchased and sold in Western Canada; and if the object was to monopolize the wheat trade of Western Canada instead of, as in this case, the junk trade, would any court hesitate to declare it illegal in that it was calculated to unduly impede free competition to interfere with the free course of trade, and to effect a wrongful purpose? I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba reversing a judgment of the trial judge which declared an agreement made between the parties on which the plaintiff had brought an action to be void as contravening section 498 of sub-section (d) of the Criminal Code.\nThe agreement in question was made between two junk and bottle dealers who purchased these articles amongst others in Winnipeg and elsewhere in Western Canada and shipped them for sale to Chicago in the United States of America.\nIt was dated the 28th of March, 1905, and was to continue from the first of April till the 15th of December following with a provision for an extension thereafter from month to month if mutually agreed upon, and as a fact it was renewed up to the 1st of January, 1907. It professed to fix the maximum prices which each of the parties should pay for the several articles specified in the schedule which prices were to be subject to revision by mutual consent; and provided that each party should make up accounts monthly shewing the profit or loss made on the business done and that the profits should be equally divided.\nThe trial judge held that\nthe manifest purpose of the agreement was to prevent competition between the parties to it and to maintain a fixed price for junk purchased.\nHe further held, however, on the facts as proved and after reviewing a number of authorities, that the agreement in question went no further than that in Collins v. Locke[5]; that the provision for carrying it into effect, viz.: the monthly division of net profits, was not unreasonable and that the restraints imposed were nothing like as great as those in the case cited. He, therefore, held the agreement not to be void at common law as being in restraint of trade.\nBut, while upholding the agreement at common law, he nevertheless held it was void as being in contravention of section 498, sub-section (d) of the Criminal Code.\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba, Richards J. dissenting, reversed the judgment and held the agreement was not void either at common law or as contravening the Code. Richards J., the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, says nothing about the validity of the agreement at common law, but follows the trial judge in holding that it contravened the statute.\nChief Justice Howell held that outside of the criminal law the agreement was binding and that the intention of Parliament in passing the criminal statute was to\nsuppress certain contracts and combinations in restraint of trade and make the parties thereto liable to an indictable offence and that the agreement did not contravene the statute.\nCameron J. agreed with him on both grounds, while Perdue J., agreeing on the first ground that at common law the agreement was not bad, held that it did not violate the statute because it did not \u201cunduly prevent or lessen competition\u201d in the articles it covered.\n\u201cWith respect to the agreement here in question I agree with the trial judge and the three judges of the Court of Appeal that, applying the rule now followed by the courts in determining the validity or otherwise of agreements or covenants claimed to be in violation of the common law, it cannot be held void. That rule, as I gather it from the authorities, is that every case must be decided on its own facts and that the controlling and guilding rule in each case is whether the restraint attempted is reasonable or not with respect to the interests of the parties concerned and to the public interests.\nThe case of Nordenfelt v. The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Go.[6], decided by the House of Lords, determines that a covenant against the covenantor engaging in a particular business though unrestricted as to space was not, having regard to the nature of the business and the limited number of the customers, wider than was necessary for the protection of the company nor injurious to the public interests of the country and, therefore, was valid. The speeches of the distinguished Law Lords who took part in that decision without any dissenting voice united in the test of reasonableness, as being the guiding and controlling test in all cases and whether the covenant or agreement is general or particular. In determining the question of reasonableness they further held that the courts should have regard as well to the interests of the public as of the parties to the agreement and that each case must be decided on its own facts and by the application to them of this general test. The later cases of Dubowski & Sons v. Goldstein[7], and Underwood & Son v. Barker[8], are to the same effect on similar reasoning. In the latter case Lindley, M.R., says, at pages 303-4:\u2014\nThe law as now settled cannot, in my opinion, be more accurately expressed than it was by Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Go.[9]. He said: \u201cThe true view at the present time, I think, is this: The public have an interest in every person\u2019s carrying on his trade freely; so has the individual. All interference with the individual liberty of action in trading, and all restraints of trade of themselves if there is nothing more, are contrary to public policy, and therefore void. That is the general rule. But there are exceptions: restraints of trade and interference with individual liberty of action may be justified by the special circumstances of a particular case. It is a sufficient justification, and indeed it is the only justification, if the restriction is reasonable \u2014 reasonable, that is, in reference to the interests of the parties concerned and reasonable in reference to the interests of the public so framed and so guarded as to afford adequate protection to the party in whose favour it is imposed, while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public.\u201d Time was when all agreements in restraint of trade or liberty to work were regarded as against public policy and invalid. But this view of the law was found mischievous and intolerable, and it was gradually disclaimed and modified. The modern doctrine, as I understand it, is that if an agreement restraining a person from carrying on business is injurious to the public interests of this country such agreement is invalid to the extent to which it is injurious, but not further, if it is so framed as to permit of division into two portions, one of which is good and the other bad.\nOn page 305 he says further: \u2014\nAs was pointed out by Lord Macnaghten in Nordenfelt\u2019s case9 what may be reasonable on the sale of a business may be unreasonable on the departure of a man from the service of his employer; but I do not understand him as saying that a restriction which is reasonably necessary for the protection of a man\u2019s business can be held invalid on grounds of public policy unless some specific ground can be clearly established. If there is one thing more than another which is essential to the trade and commerce of this country it is the inviolability of contracts deliberately entered into; and to allow a person of mature age and not imposed upon, to enter into a contract, to obtain the benefit of it, and then to repudiate it and the obligations which he has undertaken is, prim\u00e2 facie at all events, contrary to the interests of any and every country.\nApplying what I conceive to be the modern rule with respect to the validity or invalidity of agreements or covenants in restraint of trade, I have no difficulty in agreeing on the facts of this case with the finding of the trial judge, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the agreement in controversy from his obligations under which the defendants, appellants, seek to escape, is a valid agreement at common law.\nThe question then remains whether this agreement at common law has been invalidated by the statute. I have reached the same conclusion as that come to by the Court of Appeal that it does not violate the statute. I do not read the word \u201cunduly\u201d which prefaces and controls sub-sections (a), (c) and (d) of section 498 of the Criminal Code as having any greater or wider meaning than \u201cunreasonably\u201d which is the common law test and if that word had been used in the statute the finding of the validity of the agreement at common law would, of course, settle the question. I have heard nothing during the argument, and the consideration given to the case since then has not suggested anything which satisfies me that the word \u201cunduly\u201d was intended to have any broader meaning than \u201cunreasonably.\u201d That some limitation was intended by the word is, of course, conceded. If it does not mean unreasonably I do not know what it does mean. I prefer the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d to any of the others suggested, such as \u201cimproperly,\u201d \u201cexcessively,\u201d \u201cinordinately,\u201d because I think it satisfies the intention of Parliament better than any of the others.\nSection 498 of the Criminal Code was first enacted in 1889 in a statute intituled \u201cAn Act for the Prevention and Suppression of Combinations formed in Restraint of Trade\u201d which had for its preamble the following:\u2014 Whereas it is expedient to declare the law relating to conspiracies and combinations formed in restraint of trade.\nParliament did not pretend to enact something new as part of the criminal law. It was not creating or defining a new offence before unknown to the law. It was simply, as said in the preamble, \u201cdeclaring\u201d and formulating what I venture to think the existing law then was, namely, that a conspiracy unlawfully (a) to unduly limit facilities for transportation, etc., or (b) to restrain or injure trade or commerce, or (c) to unduly prevent or lessen production, etc., or (d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in any article which was a subject of trade or commerce constituted a misdemeanour. Punishments by way of fine and imprisonment were added, of course, as sanctions of the declared law.\nThe drafting of the new statute was, no doubt, faulty. The use of the two words \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cunduly\u201d was necessary, but that it was a declaratory law only and only intended as such I do not doubt.\nThe Criminal Code of 1892 re-enacted this statute in its 520th section retaining both words \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cunduly\u201d and enacted section 516 declaring what a conspiracy in restraint of trade was. That also was declaratory only of the existing law. In 1899 the section was amended by striking out the word \u201cunduly\u201d in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d). In 1900 the word \u201cunduly\u201d was restored in each of the three paragraphs (a), (c) and (d), while the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d was struck out of the main section so that it read every one was guilty of an indictable offence, etc., who conspired, etc., with others to \u201cunduly\u201d limit, etc. In this latter form it remains at present.\nI think the amendment striking out the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d was a desirable one, and that, in view of the enactment of the present section 486 in the Code of 1892, the retention of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d was unnecessary. The history of this legislation, however, throws little light upon its proper interpretation, but it confirms me in my opinion that Parliament was not so much creating a new criminal offence as it was defining an existing though unwritten one and attaching to it punishments by fine and imprisonment.\nIf that is so and the misdemeanour defined by the statute is nothing more than a conspiracy to carry out contracts or agreements which by the common law were illegal as being in restraint of trade, the finding that this contract in controversy was not in restraint of trade would also determine that it was not a violation of the statute.\nI agree with Chief Justice Howell and Cameron J. that this is the real solution of the difficulties arising from construing section 498 of the Code as creating a new offence instead of as declaring and defining an existing one. I also agree with them and Perdue J. that the word \u201cunduly\u201d as used in the section should not be given a greater or wider meaning than the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d and that if so confined the suggested construction as one declaratory only is confirmed.\nHolding, therefore, that the contract in question is not void at common law as being unreasonably in restraint of trade, I am of opinion that it is not within the declaratory law, sub-section (d) of section 498 of the Code, which is directed against conspiracies to unduly or unreasonably prevent or lessen competition in the purchase or sale, etc., of any article, etc., a subject of trade or commerce.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014By virtue of long experience in the business each had separately carried on in Winnipeg, these parties determined to control, by fixing the prices to be paid for the commodities dealt in, the entire purchases thereof between Lake Superior and the Rockies. They adopted, not as a partnership though resembling it, a device or plan of sharing the profits derivable from the dealings each might have in specified leading articles of said commodities for which the maximum prices to be paid were to be fixed by them jointly from time to time. These prices, or the lower prices actually paid, were to be the profit-sharing basis, and thus either transgressing by paying a higher price would be automatically penalized therefor.\nThere was neither joint capital nor mutual contribution of capital in any venture, nor joint action, in use of capital either used, or in the management of the business. Each carried on his own business free from interference of the other. At the end of the year an accounting was to be had of the profit or loss each had made on the basis of the maximum prices so fixed or such less prices as each might have paid. The only recital in the agreement expresses a desire\nof entering into an agreement to facilitate the dealing in various articles hereinafter mentioned, without in any way interfering with the freedom of trade and commerce.\nIn what way and how was this to facilitate dealing? When regard is had to the language used and to what was actually done this much is clear: first, that merely partnership profits was not the purpose of the agreement, and next, that the parties had a consciousness of how perilously near they might be to infringing the statute.\nThey operated and accounted to each other on the basis of this agreement for a year, and then by letters renewed it, but fell out later; chiefly because the appellants did not conform to the purpose of the agreement. They had so far departed from the paths of rectitude as to buy from another Winnipeg dealer who had come into and ventured to operate in the chosen field of these parties. The mind of respondent never contemplated that kind of \u201cfacilitating the dealing in various commodities.\u201d It was clearly repugnant to the common purpose and a breach of faith. The recital must have been a mistaken or defective description of the common purpose. After repudiating this vile deed done by his brothers-in-arms, he sued them for an account. The latter set up section 498 of the Criminal Code as a bar to this alleged right of recovery.\nThe defendants (now appellants) swear the purpose of the agreement was to control the market for themselves within said limits, to cease competition with each other, to get as large a profit by keeping out competition as they could; and he says they succeeded.\nThe learned trial judge finds this story the true one, though contradicted by the plaintiff (now respondent). He says further,\nthe effect of their agreement was not only to limit competition, but to destroy it.\nThe objection to such extrinsic evidence, which is always admitted to prove illegality, cannot prevail.\nI agree with the learned judge\u2019s findings of fact relative to the issue. I do so the more readily as the respondent\u2019s letters and admitted conduct confirm or at least harmonize with the appellants\u2019 oath and contradict the respondent\u2019s.\nThe section 498 in question reads, as it stood amended at the time in question herein, as follows:\u2014\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence * * * who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person * * * (d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of any such article or commodity, etc.\nThe phrase \u201carticle or commodity\u201d is defined in sub-section (a) as anything \u201cwhich may be subject of trade and commerce.\u201d\nThe entire scope and purpose of this legislation and the operative limits to be assigned it, are difficult of accurate comprehension and definition.\nI am, however, with great respect, quite clear that the majority of the court appealed from have misapprehended it.\nIf I understand them aright, the measure of the word \u201cunduly\u201d is to be found in a long line of authorities where contracts in restraint of trade had been held to be against public policy. If the purpose of Parliament had been merely to make parties to such contracts as these authorities relate to, amenable to the criminal law, the expression thereof would have been easy, and, I apprehend, quite different in terms from those used either in the recital or operative parts of 52 Vict. ch. 41, which first enacted the law in question.\nThat Act recited:\u2014\nWhereas it is expedient to declare the law relating to conspiracies and combinations formed in restraint of trade and to provide penalties for the violation of the same. And in the forefront, as it were, of the offences to be dealt with, we find (a) the limiting of facilities for transportation; (b) the restraining of commerce; (c) the limiting of production, or unreasonably enhancing the price of that produced; and lastly (d) which is in substance quoted above.\nThe whole scope of this legislation is clearly something beyond the narrow limits upon which the reasoning in support of the judgment appealed from seems to proceed. It cannot be said to be a purely declaratory Act. It covers ground not covered by the then existing law. In no sense can the field it covers be held to be co-extensive with the field of law relative to restraint of trade wherein these authorities had operated.\nThe case of Nordenfelt v. The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co.[10], relied on to shew earlier cases overruled, or law relaxed, had not even been heard when this statute was enacted.\nNot only that, but who that has had to struggle with the innumerable contracts, and distinctions between contracts, alleged to be in some way in restraint of trade, ever dreamed of the law on the subject being made merely clearer by making it the subject of criminal legislation? Yet the offence against public policy involved in the said cases had been recognized, however ill-defined, for nigh three centuries and never seems to have been directly rested on criminal law; nor yet as a supposed violation of morals. Public policy alone it was said required certain limits of time and space to be observed in such contracts, and these limits were measured by that good old word \u201creasonable\u201d so often found in every phase of our English law. Why should Parliament discard it and adopt another less in use, less easy of comprehension, if merely declaring and clarifying the law as applied in civil cases relative to restraint of trade?\nNot only had the expansion of trade and commerce in England by the year 1889 rendered the lines laid down in many old cases somewhat unfitted to follow under new conditions then existing in England, but their applicability to Canada and its conditions seemed still more grotesque as a foundation and defined field of operation for a criminal statute such as we have to interpret and construe.\nBut it may be asked, why should it proceed by prefacing the whole with the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d? And further asked was it not merely the purpose to fix penalties for doing that which was already unlawful? Is it not clear that the draftsman erred in using both words, \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cunduly,\u201d in the connection in which they were placed? Surely if a thing were unlawful it must be undue. It was never intended to declare that an undue measure of unlawfulness was the thing to become indictable.\nParliament set out, as the recital shews, to declare what was to be held unlawful and evidently intended to declare that the unduly doing that which was referred to in sub-section (d) amongst others, were unlawful things, and must be prohibited.\nAnd to make this clear the Act was in 1899, inadvertently, as I think, amended by striking out the word \u201cunduly\u201d and thus leaving \u201cunlawfully\u201d the test. Next session, on attention being drawn to the inadvertence, the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d was stricken out and the word \u201cunduly\u201d restored. The Act as thus finally amended is what is pleaded here. This legislative history demonstrates as clearly as possible that it was not as against something already unlawful, but the unduly doing that then lawful so far as the criminal law extended that the amended statute was aimed at.\nAnd with all this effort to express its meaning, we are asked to say it was not \u201cunduly\u201d that Parliament intended to use, but another word so commonly in use in relation to part of the very subject in hand.\nIt seems to me that so far from designing a law that must have for its limits of operation the field covered by such authorities, it was the settled purpose to avoid that being done. That was something which did not fit the subject in hand.\nHowever, we are not debarred from looking at the legal history of either unreasonable restraint of trade as interpreted by the courts, or anything else within the common knowledge of mankind, which, in order to effectuate the purpose of the legislature, may help us to find out, if we can, what meaning we must attach to the word \u201cunduly\u201d in sub-section (d) of section 498 of the Code as it stood in 1905 and 1906.\nThe contracts usually designated as in restraint of trade at common law, may be so far as falling within the descriptive language of the statute, prim\u00e2 facie within the field of that which is prohibited by this statute. I can, however, imagine instances of such restraint which may arise and yet not have been unduly made within the Act. And for reasons I am about to advert to in connection with the case of The Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow & Co.[11], its operative range as a criminal statute effecting and invalidating contracts must exceed the narrow limits of the old doctrine referred to. It is now for the first time before this court. So far as I can see each of the other cases cited to us, in which different courts have dealt with its application, presented a mass of facts shewing the conduct of those charged with having infringed it to have been more or less repugnant to the minds of all right-thinking men, and hence the duty to apply it apparently clear.\nThe magnitude of the aggregate business involved, the far-reaching evil consequences likely to flow from upholding as legal the respective schemes attacked in these cases, and the chances that if upheld their peculiar features so obnoxious to the welfare of the community, would be so greatly extended as to become disastrous, all aided the courts to apply the Act.\nWhether if such schemes were allowed to run their own course entirely unfettered and unfostered by legislation, the result would be so dreadful as frightened people imagine, one may be permitted to doubt.\nIf one considers the long history of the abortive attempts exemplified in the long lists of Acts repealed by 22 Geo. III. ch. 71, and 7 & 8 Vict. ch. 24, this doubt will hardly disappear. As we have nothing, however, to do with the wisdom or unwisdom of the legislation, such considerations are only of value here in aiding us by a survey of the whole field of its possible operation to try by drawing lessons from past failures to give it such effect as will not operate detrimentally upon any person, or class of persons, not desiring to improperly defeat competition; and above all, that it may not become itself by virtue of our decision an undesirable restraint upon the freedom of men in their business dealings, and thus another hindrance to competition.\nThis being a criminal statute we must try to find the vicious purpose aimed at in order to bring parties within its prohibitions. What then are to be the distinguishing features that may in any given case, and must in this case, enable us to determine whether or not it falls within any of the prohibitions of the statute? To do that we must examine it in its general bearing and survey if we can its whole possible field of operation.\nOne thing which must appear in any given case is that the agreement or arrangement is one designed to prevent or lessen competition. It must be also an attempt at what would be an unduly doing thereof, that is agreed upon. It needs neither success nor actual operation nor aught but an agreement to try what if successful would be the unduly preventing or lessening of competition.\nCrimes usually imply something all right-minded men condemn. This one may or may not necessarily be so offensive. For example, the contracts of hiring, of leasing, of partnership and incorporation, may in some ways involve an actual, and within some of said cases, unreasonable lessening of competition, and hence be conceivably formed outside the offence created by this statute, or fall well within it. It may be that all of these contracts, or indeed many others prim\u00e2 facie legitimate, and possessing no inherent evil, may involve changes disturbing and possibly lessening competition, yet each and all be so used as to produce a great injury to society. It is this feature of the problem which this Act attacks that requires in the limitation and definition of the offence some qualification such as the word \u201cunduly\u201d has been chosen to serve. The test must in each case be the true purpose and its relation to the activities specified in and by the words of the statute and a finding of an evil or vice answering to the descriptive word \u201cunduly.\u201d\nIt may be asked how can prevention or lessening of competition or attempt thereof be an evil when the fact confronts us that the whole business fabric of Canada is founded upon restraint of competition? It may be said that in face of such fact it is impossible to assign an evil motive or vicious purpose of any kind in merely contracting to prevent or lessen competition.\nIt may well be, indeed, that the one is the logical sequence of the other by force of the development thereof, or the activities induced thereby, yet be unjustifiable for those enjoying the benefits of these restrictions to abuse the power thereby given them.\nWe must, moreover, recognize that there are many statutes for beneficial purposes yet productive of evils which call for amendments to the law to meet the evil by-product thereof, whilst retaining for some wise purpose, the parent statute, as it were.\nCorporate creations are necessary for the promoting of manufacturing and commercial life. Yet the facilities and capacities given them also tend in many ways to produce and do produce much of the evil I conceive to be aimed at by the statute.\nPatent laws may be righteous protectors of the inventor or discoverer, and beneficient stimulatives, yet may be made undesirable weapons of offence.\nIt seems to those whose race and country have had such implicit belief in the sanctity of contract, untainted by immorality or illegality, difficult to justify on ethical grounds the invasion of any field covered thereby.\nIt is important, therefore, to make clear from the observation of the operation of possible causes and the experience relative thereto and in other regards, how such a vicious purpose as implied in violating this Act may spring from being tainted with a desire to do that which may not of necessity and under all circumstances be held in itself vicious.\nThe development of modern industrial and commercial life, however, has certainly, when some of the later results are looked at, justified men in re-examining the profound belief heretofore held in unfettered contract and such competition as may exist therewith. And when they produce as the result of such examination, a statute like this and throw upon the courts the duty of drawing the line at the right place, we must, in order to discriminate properly, examine all such similar suggestions as the several foregoing, and all else within the whole range of legislation bearing on the problem so far as we can, and determine the principles upon which to proceed.\nThe state assuredly has the right to withdraw its aid from him who plots with another to deprive his fellow-men of the reasonable expectations each of them is entitled to cherish if the ordinary results of competition are allowed that free scope upon which so much of the prosperity and happiness of the dwellers in a free country hang.\nIt is at this point the crux of the whole question lies. We must assume Parliament realized that the unlimited power of competition begotten of combination, and the unlimited right of contract cannot any longer exist together with a full enjoyment of the ordinary results of competition to which I have just referred, and hence a new statutory crime had to be created.\nThe necessity for finding in this new crime the vicious or evil purpose inherent in the agreement of the parties to it, renders it necessary to determine in each case as it arises where the ordinary rights of the public to enjoy their reasonable expectation of due and fair competition, (which are yet possible within the limits left when legitimate effect has been given or allowed for the restrictive legislation I have referred to,) are at an end and the absolute right of contract begins. We need not traverse here the whole field, but use, as illustrative, a part of the evil existent under the old law, and the operation thereon of the new, and observe the wide distinction between the operation of the doctrine of public policy relative to restraint of trade, and the effective range of this new law.\nThe law as it stood in England coeval with the first passing of this Act, and till then existent as our law also, was laid down by the highest authority, relative to the right of competition as follows, in the case of the Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow & Co.[12], Lord Halsbury said:\u2014\ni would rather think, as a fact, that it is very commonly within the ordinary course of trade so to compete for a time as to render trade unprofitable to your rival in order that when you have got rid of him you may appropriate the profits of the entire trade to yourself.\ni entirely adopt and make my own what was said by Lord Justice Bowen in the court below: \u201cAll commercial men with capital are acquainted with the ordinary expedient of sowing one year a crop of apparently unfruitful prices, in order by driving competition away to reap a fuller harvest of profit in the future; and until the pre- sent argument at the bar it may be doubted whether ship-owners or merchants were ever deemed to be bound by law to conform to some imaginary \u2018normal\u2019 standard of freights or prices, or that law courts had a right to say to them in respect of their competitive tariffs, Thus far shalt thou go, and no further.\u2019\u201d\nAnd in the same case Lord Morris said, at page 49, as follows:\u2014\nThe object was a lawful one. It is not illegal for a trader to aim at driving a competitor out of trade, provided the motive be his own gain by appropriation of the trade, and the means he uses be lawful weapons.\nIt is to be observed that this was said in a case where the \u201cconference\u201d or league of shippers seemed by reason of its being against public policy to be admittedly not binding between the parties. In that case it seems to have been also made clear that those entering into such contracts committed no offence for which an indictment would lie.\nWe know, as part of common knowledge, that the most effective weapon such combinations have used on a gigantic scale to crush out competition, in the United States, for example, has been that which was adopted by the defendants in that case.\nIf this statute is not aimed at such combinations here, what can it have been aimed at?\nThere are a great many subsidiary methods commonly in use to promote the ends such combinations are directed to. Amongst those are the purchases or leases of factories to hold them in idleness; the combinations to fix prices, and to refuse to deal with any one who will neither accede thereto nor join the association, nor submit to undertaking for an observance of their rules; the restrictive contracts in sales; and the rebates given, or shifting rates of profit conditioned upon the observance of the terms imposed relative to resales and thus and thereby covering the fixed or variable prices, and the lists of parties or classes of people not to be dealt with, or alone to be dealt with.\nOften these devices are aided by the use or abuse of the patent laws which are made to lend a strength to the operation of these compacts dictated by the combinations; and the use or abuse of the incorporating laws are made to bear the like fruit.\nThe combination to remove competition by such like devices means, when pushed far, the ruin of many by the temporary lowering of, and fitful changing of, prices; and though some of the public may reap for a time the benefit of such proceedings, it means later on the payment by the public of much higher prices than in a fair competition at a fair continuous normal rate of profit would have to be paid, and generally as much higher as can possibly be extracted from the public regardless of any measurement of price by way of what a fair profit requires. In the long run it means, if successful, the reaping of enormous wealth by the few, to the detriment of the many.\nThe right in this country to drive others out of trade by such means and for such selfish purposes, so plainly recognized by the quotation above, as legitimate in England and formerly here, is taken away by this statute. The statement of this legal right was not intended by their Lordships to countenance the use of any but legal means.\nBowen L.J., in joining in the judgment from which the above appeal to the House of Lords was taken, says in Mogul Steamship Go. v. McGregor, Gow & Co:[13], at page 614, as follows:\u2014 No man, whether trader or not, can, however, justify damaging another in his commercial business by fraud or misrepresentation. Intimidation, obstruction, and molestation are forbidden; so is the intentional procurement of a violation of individual rights, contractual or other, assuming always that there is no just cause for it.\nIt is quite clear, however, that the covert use of all these means which the late Bowen L.J. refers to, are likely to be facilitated if not encouraged by a recognition of freedom to resort to the schemes this state of law in England permits. This statute is intended to prohibit not only the use of all such schemes but also all else conceivably productive of the like results as such means as Bowen L.J. defines might produce, whether allied together with such schemes or not.\nThe doctrine of Allen v. Flood[14] might also help in conceivable circumstances to lend an appearance of legality to that which would thwart the operation of this Act and in such cases may have to be discarded.\nThe almost exultant tone of exposition several of the judgments in the Mogul Case[15] adopt in maintaining the law as laid down above may be well warranted in a country enjoying free trade. But we have chosen an entirely different commercial system and must have regard thereto. We must act in harmony therewith. We must assume that an Act such as this is not placed on the statute book for an idle purpose. Its operation must not be minimized simply because of difficulties in the way of enforcing it. Its purpose is to crush out of existence an evil. Its success, if any, must depend on its administration. Its great risk of failure lies in the fact that the requisite knowledge of the social and commercial forces shaping the social structure does not lie in the daily path of the lawyer\u2019s life, and that it cannot be well supplied by expert evidence.\nI desire to guard against the impression that each of many of the devices I have referred to by way of illustration, and others of a like kind that do exist, must necessarily be obnoxious to the Act. It is the purpose to which they may be put that is the test. If that purpose be to bring about what the Act is designed to frustrate, it is vicious. My endeavour herein is to point the attitude to be taken and the path or way to ascertain and identify in the concrete an evil which is incapable of concise and accurate definition.\nThe application of tests by which to ascertain the possible evil results the Act seeks to avert may be much facilitated by a study in that regard of the jurisprudence of the United States with a commercial system and an historical development similar to but older than our own.\nThe enhancing or lowering of prices; the variation thereof without obvious causes other than the evil purpose the Act forbids; the margin of profit; the scale of business, the operative field; the frame of the contract; the devices used therein and in its execution; the refusal to deal with others without assigning any reasonable cause, which is so inconsistent with the ordinary motives of men presumed to be governed by a due observance of the Act; the entire conduct of the parties and the results produced, must each and all furnish some aid to determine whether or not the Act has been intended to be violated.\nOn the other hand every step taken in the past to enlarge the bounds of human freedom of thought and action, has stimulated discovery and invention, and as a product thereof, increased competition, which may have left by the way here and there financial wrecks as the result thereof. This has made men cry aloud in denunciation of the waste of human energy, and loss of human comfort resulting from competition. The cry is often a thoughtless one. People raising it seldom reckon with the absolutely necessary waste there is and must ever be incidental to growth; though all nature attests it on every hand. Destroy competition and you remove the force by which humanity has reached so far. The altruism some people would substitute for it may, when it has arrived, bring with it a higher sense of justice, but it has not arrived. All these considerations must always be kept in view and not be lightly set aside or the results involved therein be confounded with the actual products of violation of the Act and used as absolute or necessarily any proof of a vicious purpose.\nFor example, though rate of profit may be some guide, the use of any standard of profit itself apart from the comparison of changes of one time or set of conditions with another, must, as evidence, be of trifling value.\nTo apply the standard of profit that might enable the stupid, the slothful, the ignorant, the overcapitalized man working with antiquated machinery, and a mill or warehouse overmanned, to compete with the standard that may be fairly reached by the men of brains, of energy, of sleepless vigilance, with only adequate capital to earn dividends for, and all the advantages that the latest improvements, invention or discovery can furnish, would be a sorry one indeed for society.\nThe fate of the former class must not be considered But the latter must not resort to unfair devices. They do not need them. They are without them the best kind of commercial asset the world can have and must never be depressed or suppressed by this law.\nThey may, indeed, need to be protected and it ought to be the anxious care of society, and its courts of justice to see that they get protected against the combinations of the men of the other class who ultimately must go to the wall before their onward march if they be given a fair chance.\nIn thus illustrating the law as it was, the evil to be remedied, the principles to be observed in applying the remedy and the difficulties to be met in doing so, I by no means pretend to have covered the whole ground, but enough to enable those concerned in this case to apprehend the law.\nI desire to add a few words here to what I said at the outset on the question of the widely different field covered by the doctrine of public policy relative to restraint of trade and this criminal statute.\nThe Act not only destroys a former right of combination, but also renders illegal every direct or indirect device contrived by the art of men to serve those agreeing in the purpose of acquiring the market for themselves and adopted by them to execute such purpose, and thus also destroys the devices they may have incidentally adopted to promote the main purpose. All that is, directly or indirectly, knowingly used to promote any criminal purpose must be held void.\nA world-wide difference exists and may by grasping this principle of law be appreciated here between the consequence flowing from the application of the public policy principle and that of this statute. It is quite conceivable that in many ways people might have entered into contractual relations of a subsidiary or collateral character with any of the parties to the combination in question in Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow & Co.[16], sub-serving the purposes thereof and be bound by and able to enforce such collateral or subsidiary contracts, even if the existence and purpose of the combination were known to the people so contracting.\nI can find no authority which has ever reached so far as to hold contracts having such an indirect relation to the restraint of trade being held void or tainted thereby, with illegality.\nIndeed, within the principle that \u201cwhen the object of an agreement is unlawful the agreement is void\u201d (see Pollock on Contracts), it is difficult to see how collateral or subsidiary contracts, for example, designed to facilitate the execution of a plan (of which the execution is legal) once agreed upon could be held void. The compact itself in restraint of trade was void, but the execution of the purpose thereof was held to be legal, though involving the destruction of competition. The subsidiary contracts forming no part of the originating compact, but merely legally aiding that execution of it, could hardly be held void.\nOn the other hand every kind of contractual relation attempted to be made with any one of the parties to a combination obnoxious to this statute and to the knowledge of the party so contracting and sub-serving the purposes of the combination in doing that which violates the Act would be clearly void if for no other reason than constituting an aiding or abetting a violation of the criminal law or as part of a conspiracy to defeat the criminal law.\nThis exact distinction I draw between the operation of the doctrine of public policy and this Act was not taken in argument and though I am profoundly convinced of its validity and importance, I am not to be taken as carrying in absence of argument, or necessity of doing so, the suggestion as to the validity of contracts subsidiary or collateral to a scheme formed in restraint of trade as violating public policy too far or indeed further than mere illustration and suggestion.\nThe doctrine of restraint of trade violating public policy is not abolished by this Act which I conceive not to be a substitution therefor. And as suggested by many learned judges the interest of the public means something possibly not yet passed upon in all its shades. Nor am I to be taken as suggesting that the illustration the Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow & Co.[17] furnishes covers all this Act is applicable to; far from it.\nIn this case I do not see such difficulties as I have adverted to as possible and as I anticipate must arise in many others. In addition to the vicious purpose to be sought in such cases which I think is only too apparent herein, we have the extent of field over which it was intended to reign, and did reign in its execution. It would have presented much greater difficulty had respondent\u2019s thorough going contempt for the thought of doing anything like a \u201cmalimid\u201d (Hebrew for school-teacher), or, indeed, in any way regarding the welfare of others, not been made so apparent. His one thought was, if possible, to destroy all competition and, if need be, those who ventured to come in competition with him. His language and conduct portray exactly what this statute strikes at. Its aim was to put out of business use the methods of men banding themselves together to render it difficult if not impossible for others to become rivals, and stop competition in the same field of business.\nThese parties succeeded so far that their profits were nearly doubled. They seem to have been reasonably successful previously to this and thus had no excuse for their conduct. Their purpose was so clearly obnoxious to the Act it would matter not even if increased profits had not been reaped. The legal result ought to be the same.\nIt is because of the novelty of the case and the need that there should be no misapprehension arising from its results, and that honest men may not be entrapped from reliance on the former state of law here and in England, which I have adverted to, and still existent in England, which seems in harmony with the commercial ethics of most men, that I have dealt at such length with it.\nIt is to be observed that the individual seems still free to do as was permitted to the combination in the Mogul Case[18]. The corporation possibly may also, but there a nice puzzle may be presented some day which I will not venture to anticipate. It may itself be founded on a scheme to violate the Act.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the trial judgment be restored. Duff J.\u2014The learned trial judge has in effect found that it was one of the direct and governing aims of the parties to the agreement in question to restrict and if possible suppress competition in the buying and selling of the articles specified in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta with the object of establishing and maintaining a monopoly of the distributing trade in those articles. I think the evidence supports that view. At least one of the articles \u2014 scrap iron \u2014 is shewn to have been a commodity of considerable commercial importance. I think that in entering into such an agreement the parties to it were guilty of an offence under section 498(d) of the Criminal Code.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that looked at from the point of view of the parties alone the provision of the agreement for fixing the prices at which the commodities in question were to be bought would be a provision reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of persons who should agree to share profits and losses in the purchase and sale of such commodities. But that circumstance, in my judgment is not decisive of the question upon which we have to pass in this appeal.\nThe view upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal is based as I understand it, is that the question at issue must be decided by ascertaining whether at common law the courts would have refused to enforce this agreement as being an agreement in restraint of trade: and that the answer to this question must in turn be governed by the opinion of the court upon the point whether or not the term of the agreement providing for the fixing of prices was reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of the parties under their contract to share profits and losses. That view, I think, with respect, is based upon an inadequate conception of the principle of the common law as well as of the theory underlying the enactment we have to apply.\nAn opinion which has often found expression in text-books and sometimes in the judgments of very distinguished judges is that the common law considers freedom of contract of such paramount importance that given a principal lawful contract not in itself affecting any restrain of trade (a partnership, a contract for the sale of a business, a contract of employment) subsidiary agreements restraining trade or competition are entitled to the aid and protection of the law if only such subsidiary agreements are reasonably necessary for the protection of the individual interests of one of the parties in the principal transaction.\nBut it is impossible now to affirm that such is the rule of the common law. In Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co. v. Nordenfelt [19], at page 649, Lindley L.J. said:\u2014\nIn Rousillon v. Rousillon[20], Lord Justice Fry, in one of those admirable judgments for which he was so justly celebrated, came to the conclusion that the only test by which to determine the validity or invalidity of a covenant in restraint of trade given for valuable consideration was its reasonableness for the protection of the trade or business of the covenantee. This accords with the view of Lord James in Leather Cloth Company v. Lorsont[21], and is, in my opinion, the doctrine to which the modern authorities have been gradually approximating. But I cannot regard it as finally settled, nor, indeed, as quite correct. The doctrine ignores the law which forbids monopolies.\nIn the same case Bowen L.J. said, at pages 667-668:\u2014 For the purpose of clearness I will, in conclusion, attempt to summarize the exact ground on which I consider this case should be decided. The rule as to general restraint of trade ought not, in my judgment, to apply where a trader or manufacturer finds it necessary, for the advantageous transfer of the goodwill of a business in which he is interested, and for the adequate protection of those who buy it, to covenant that he will retire altogether from the trade which is being disposed of, provided always that the covenant is one the tendency of which is not injurious to the public. This last element in the definition ought not, I think, to be overlooked, for I can conceive cases in which the absolute restraint might, as between the parties, be reasonable, but yet might tend directly to injure the public; and a rule founded on public policy does not admit of any exception that would really produce public mischief; such might be possibly the case if it was calculated to create a pernicious monopoly in articles for English use \u2014 a point I desire to leave open, and one which, having regard to the growth of syndicates and trusts, may some day or other become extremely important.\nThe judgment of A. L. Smith L.J., at pages 672 and 673 makes it clear that that learned judge accepted the view that an agreement in restraint of trade would not be enforced if it was clearly one prejudicial to the interests of the public however unexceptionable it might be from the point of view of the parties.\nIn the House of Lords[22], Lord Herschell says, at page 549:\u2014\nI must, however, guard myself against being supposed to lay down that if this can be shewn (that is to say, if it can be shewn, to be reasonable from the point of view of the parties\u2019 interests) the covenant will in all cases be held to be valid. It may be, as pointed out by Lord Bowen, that in particular circumstances the covenant might nevertheless be held void on the ground that it was injurious to the public interest.\nLord Ashbourne, at page 559:\u2014\nI do not see anything to lead to the conclusion that the covenant is injurious to the public interest. I entirely agree with the Lord Chancellor in the propriety and prudence of not saying a word which would imply that such an important topic was ignored or lost sight of. Lord Morris, at page 575:\u2014\nThese considerations (i.e., the governing considerations in determining the validity of an agreement in restraint of trade) I consider, are whether the restraint is reasonable and is not against the public interest;\nand finally, Lord Macnaghten, at page 565, states the law thus:\u2014\nThe true view at the present time I think, is this: The public have an interest in every person\u2019s carrying on his trade freely: so has the individual. All interference with individual liberty of action in trading, and all restraints of trade of themselves, if there is nothing more, are contrary to public policy, and therefore void. That is the general rule. But there are exceptions: restraints of trade and interference with individual liberty of action may be justified by the special circumstances of a particular case. It is sufficient justification, and, indeed, it is the only justification, if the restriction is reasonable \u2014 reasonable, that is, in reference to the interests of the parties concerned and reasonable in reference to the interests of the public so framed and so guarded as to afford adequate protection to the party in whose favour it is imposed, while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public. That, I think, is the fair result of all the authorities.\nIt is quite clear that all of these eminent judges had in view the possibility of a state of circumstances arising in which the public interest in restraining encroachments upon freedom of competition might have to be maintained at some sacrifice of the public interest in freedom of contract, even in such common commercial transactions as the sale of a business.\nIt was because, no doubt, in the opinion of the legislature the conditions had actually come into existence which Lord Bowen foresaw as a possibility merely, that this legislation was enacted. The particular sub-section with which we are concerned was plainly intended to protect the specific public interest in free competition. In applying the section the public interest in freedom of contract in commercial matters, and especially in freedom of disposition by the individual of his own labour and skill and in freedom of dealing in private property, must, of course, be kept scrupulously in view; otherwise there might conceivably be some risk of ultimately defeating the objects of the enactment by depriving the legitimate commercial energies of the country of some of their important incentives. But, giving full effect to these considerations, I have no hesitation in holding that as a rule an agreement having for one of its direct and governing objects the establishment of a virtual monopoly in the trade in an important article of commerce throughout a considerable extent of territory by suppressing competition in that trade, comes under the ban of the enactment.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff sues for an accounting of profits made by the defendants in their junk business, to a share of which he claims to be entitled under the terms of an agreement between them. The defendants, who pleaded as a defence the illegality of this agreement, on the grounds that it was designed to effect a restraint of trade unlawful at common law and that it contravened clause (d) of section 498 of the Criminal Code, in that it was an agreement to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the purchase and sale of articles Which were a subject of trade or commerce, appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba reversing the judgment of Mathers C.J., who had held that the agreement, although not illegal at common law, was in contravention of clause (d) of section 498 of the Code.\nIf the determination of this appeal depended solely upon an appreciation of the evidence contained in the record, I should be disposed not to entertain it, notwithstanding the dissent of Richards J.A., from the judgment of the appellate court. As I understand the matter, however, it is upon the meaning to be attributed to the word \u201cunduly\u201d in section 498 of the Code that the Court of Appeal differed from the learned trial judge and it is the appellate judges\u2019 interpretation of that important statutory provision which the defendants ask us to review.\nI agree with the decision in The King v. Elliott[23], that it does not follow that, because an agreement, of which the alleged purpose is\nto unduly prevent or lessen competition in the * * * purchase, * * * *. or sale of some article or commodity which may be a subject of trade or commerce,\nis not unlawful at common law; it may not constitute an offence against clause (d) of section 498 of the Code. As pointed out in that case, Parliament, in striking out the word \u201cunlawfully,\u201d with which the introductory paragraph of section 520 (now section 498) originally concluded (55 & 56 Vict. ch. 29), should be credited with an intention to effect some real change in the law. I cannot think that this word was struck out merely because it was thought that, upon a proper construction, the agreements dealt with in section 498 would be held to be only such agreements as are declared by section 496 to be conspiracies in restraint of trade. As originally enacted in the Code of 1892, section 520 (now section 498) contained both the words \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cunduly.\u201d To constitute an offence under it the parties must have unlawfully agreed \u201cto unduly limit facilities for transporting, etc., to unduly prevent, limit, or lessen manufacture, etc., or to unduly prevent or lessen competition in production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation, etc.\u201d The history of section 498, I think, precludes the view that in amending it, Parliament merely wished to remove a tautologous word. \u201cUnduly\u201d was first struck out (62 & 63 Vict. ch. 46), \u201cunlawfully\u201d being left in; but in the following year (63 & 64 Vict. ch. 46) \u201cunlawfully\u201d was struck out and \u201cunduly\u201d was restored. As the Code was originally drawn, section 516 (now section 496) did not govern section 520. The latter section was complete in itself. Since it contained the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d there could be no occasion to import that restriction from section 516. I see no good reason for now giving to section 496, which is an exact reproduction of section 516, an effect which the latter did not have, and, obviously, was not meant to have, in the original Act.\nIf, however, section 496 should be held to modify or qualify anything in section 498, I would incline to the view that it would be the principal or introductory clause. If so, it would apply to each of the sub-clauses of section 498 and no change would have been effected by striking out the word \u201cunlawfully.\u201d While, as pointed out by Phippen J., in The King v. Gage[24], there are serious difficulties in reading clause (b) of section 498 as wholly unrestricted (the learned judge treating clauses (a), (c) and (d) as specifying particular instances of a generic offence covered by clause (b) thought the word \u201cunduly\u201d should be read into it), as at present advised I am not prepared to accede to the view expressed by Howell C.J., at page 430, and referred to in The King v. Clarke[25], that clause (b) of section 498 should be confined in its application to such agreements as are declared to be conspiracies in restraint of trade by section 496. But it is not now necessary to determine that question, and I allude to it merely to avoid any possibility of leaving the impression that I would import into the clause (b) the word \u201cunlawfully.\u201d\nThe single, if not simple, question before us is whether in the instrument under consideration the parties agreed \u201cto unduly prevent or lessen competition in the * * * purchase, * * * (or) sale\u201d of junk and bottles.\nIt is perhaps doubtful whether there is in the agreement any sufficiently definite provision as to sale prices to bring it within the statutory prohibition. But there is a distinct undertaking as to purchase prices to be paid by the parties, which I cannot read as aught else than a mutual promise that during the currency of the agreement neither would pay for bottles or junk prices higher than those specified in the schedules. That this agreement tended \u201cto prevent or lessen competition\u201d between the parties to it in the purchase of the scheduled articles there can be no question. In view of the fact that they controlled from 90% to 95% of the junk business in the territory in which they operated (a circumstance most material and proper for consideration in determining the true nature of the agreement, its purpose and the intent of the parties to it) it seems to me equally clear that, if carried out, it would tend to destroy in that territory all substantial competition in the purchase of junk and bottles and to leave the public as to the market price for these articles entirely at the mercy of the contracting parties.\nThe suggestion that, if too great a depression in prices should result, competition would be invited rather than discouraged seems to ignore the fact that provision is made for consultation between the parties as to sale prices and that it is declared to be the intent of their arrangement that they are to work for the mutual advantage of both. The evidence establishes that the prices to which they bound themselves to adhere in purchasing the scheduled articles were materially smaller than had been paid by them when there was competition between them. Of course it would be to their mutual interest to place these prices as low as practicable, yet not to put them so low nor to raise their sale prices so high that the margin of profits would invite the invasion of their field by really formidable rivals. Were such an invasion threatened they had it in their own hands at any time to reduce their sale prices to meet it. Small competitors they were in a position to crush. I have no doubt that the purpose of the agreement was to prevent or lessen competition in the purchase of junk and bottles for the advantage of the parties, without regard to the public interest, but with the certain incidental consequence that the latter interest would suffer as the result of the provision for a substantial reduction in such purchase prices below what they would be under fair competition. It is not open to question that the agreement was well calculated to accomplish its purpose.\nBut every agreement to prevent or lessen competition is not declared to be an offence. The elimination or diminution of competition must be undue. It is suggested that if. \u201cunduly\u201d does not mean \u201cunlawfully\u201d \u2014 and the history of the section seems to forbid such an interpretation \u2014 it is used as the equivalent of \u201cunreasonably,\u201d and that before an agreement can be said to provide for unduly preventing or lessening competition, the court must be satisfied that it is designed to do so to an extent not reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of the parties to it, whatever may be its effect upon the interests of the public. I cannot accept that suggestion. It would re-introduce the common law test of illegality as defined in the modern cases such as Collins v. Locke[26]; Dubowski & Sons v. Goldstein[27], and others referred to in the judgments of the provincial courts and at bar in this court. If deemed an interchangeable equivalent of \u201cunduly\u201d the presence of the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d in clause (c) of section 520 as originally enacted and now found in section 498, is scarcely intelligible. If the word \u201cunreasonably\u201d were used in the statute instead of \u201cunduly\u201d there might be much to be said for the view that any agreement reasonably necessary for the protection of the parties to it is not in contravention of section 498.\nThe difference, in my opinion, between the meaning to be attached to \u201cunreasonably\u201d and that which should be given to \u201cunduly\u201d when employed in a statutory provision such as that under consideration is that under the former a chief consideration might be whether the restraint upon competition effected by the agreement is unnecessarily great having regard to the business requirements of the parties, whereas under the latter the prime question certainly must be, does it, however advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business interests of the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive, or oppressive restrictions upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of every one? The King v. Elliott[28].\nApplying this test to the agreement before us, when we find that it was designed and, if carried out according to the intent of the parties, would be effectual to destroy all competition in the articles which it covered throughout the extensive territory in which they operated, that it was intended to bring about a material reduction directly in the prices which had been paid to junk and bottle collectors and indirectly in the prices which had been paid to the public for the purchase of such articles when competition was unfettered and which would obtain under fair competition, and that the situation was such that the parties to the agreement were not subject to other competition and were in a position effectively to combat the introduction into their territory of other competitors, the proper conclusion seems to be that it was an agreement unduly to prevent or lessen competition in the purchase of these articles.\nI might add that if, notwithstanding its utter disregard of the public interest and the incidental prejudice to that interest which it was calculated to cause, such an agreement would nevertheless be lawful if shewn to be reasonably necessary for the protection of the business interests of the parties to it, the evidence in the record does not establish such necessity. The effect of the operation of the agreement would appear to have been to increase the profits which the parties had been previously making by upwards of 15% \u2014 an object which though legitimate, or even laudable, does not sanction the employment of illegal or prohibited means to attain it. It is not established that the profits made by the plaintiff and the defendants before the agreement in question was entered into were not reasonably sufficient; still less that the increase provided for and brought about was indispensable to their conducting reasonably successful business enterprises.\nIt may be that to give effect to the defendants\u2019 plea of illegality will enable them dishonestly to escape from the consequences of a bargain which they made fully understanding and appreciating its effect. But that the purpose of Parliament in enacting section 498 of the Criminal Code should be carried out and that the influence of its provisions for the protection of the public interests should not be weakened or impaired is much more important than that in a particular case a party to an illegal agreement should be prevented from dishonestly evading his private obligation.\nI would, with respect, allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.

On expiration of a term the city elected to pay.\nHeld, that the lessees were entitled to be paid the value of piling and filling in on said lots to form a foundation for buildings erected and in existence at the expiration of the lease, but not for such piling and filling in at a place where no buildings existed, but upon which buildings were intended to be erected for manufacturing purposes.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick varying the decree of the judge in equity and granting the full claims of the respective plaintiffs.\nThe City of St. John leased to the New Brunswick Red Granite Co. certain lots on the west side of the harbour which at full tide were covered with water. By the terms of the lease the lots were to be used for manufacturing purposes only and it contained a covenant that if buildings and erections for such purposes were put up by the lessees they should be appraised at the end of the term and the city, at its option, would pay their value or renew the lease. The Red Granite Co. sold their interest in the lease to, the appellants, who respectively obtained\u2019 new leases from the city with the same covenants. When so transferred a stone cutting plant was on the lots in order to establish which the original lessees had to sink piles for a foundation and to overcome vibration had to fill in the lots with stone and other material.\nThe city expropriated a portion of these lots for the purpose of widening a street, and in the expropriation proceedings the Supreme Court of New Brunswick awarded the lessees the value of the piling and filling in above mentioned. The judgments on these proceedings are reported. See Sleeth et al. v. City of St. John; Gordon v. City of St. John[1].\nOn the expiration of one term of the respective leases the buildings and erections were appraised, the valuators allowing nothing for the piling and filling in. The city elected to pay and the lessees filed a bill in equity to set aside the award. It was set aside by the Chief Justice sitting as a judge in equity, who held that the lessees were entitled to be paid the value of the piling and filling in which served as a foundation for buildings and erections existing on the lots when the lease expired. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick varied this decree in accordance with its decision in the expropriation case. The city appealed.\nBaxter K.C. for the appellant. The plaintiffs seek compensation for piling and filling in where no buildings or erections exist. But these are not, in themselves, buildings or erections. See Adamson v. Rogers[2]. And if they could be deemed erections they are not erections in the nature of buildings which they must be under this covenant. Ex parte Benwell, In re Hutton[3]. See also Truesdell v. Gay[4].\nTeed K.C. for the respondents. The case is concluded by the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Sleeth et al. v. City of St. John[5].

Hutchings[9], at page 304.\nBaxter K.C. for the appellant.\nTeed K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick upholding but varying a decree made by Chief Justice Barker sitting as a judge in equity setting aside certain appraisements made by valuators or arbitrators selected under the provisions of certain leases made by the City of St. John (appellant) to the respondents (plaintiffs) respectively, John J. Gordon and Robert Quinlan and John J. Gordon administrator of the estate and effects of John Sleeth of certain water lots in the City of St. John. These leases contained provisions for their renewal at their expiration at the option of the city or in case of a decision not to renew for the payment of the value of the erections and buildings on the premises when the lease expired in November, 1906, and which had not been included in the compensation awarded by McLeod J. for a part of the leased premises which the city had expropriated a few days before the leases expired. The covenants in the leases are identical and as precisely the same questions arise in each of the cases they have been consolidated for the purpose of argument and decision.\nThe dispute in the case now before us arose as stated in Chief Justice Barker\u2019s judgment\nover the lessee plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation for the earth and stone deposited in the lots for the purpose as they alleged of supporting and stiffening the crib work erected as a foundation for the buildings (which they had constructed on and over the crib work) and which was necessary to prevent the vibration incident to the use of steam engines and the support of heavy weights and necessary in the carrying on of manufacturing for which the lots were by the terms of the leases to be used.\nThe contention on the part of the city was that this filling was in no sense either a building or erecion within the meaning of those words as used in the covenant in the lease providing for compensation being made for them in the event of the city, the landlord, deciding not to renew the lease.\nThe learned Chief Justice found that\nthe arbitrators proceeded on the assumption that the filling in was no part of the erections and they, therefore, excluded its value, if it had any, from their consideration.\nHe, therefore, set aside their valuation or appraisement and made a decree declaring that the words \u201cerections and buildings\u201d for which the tenants under the leases in question were in certain events and contingencies entitled to be compensated\ndid not include any piling, capping or woodwork on the said demised lots or the filling in of the same except where such piling, capping or woodwork should on the first day of November, 1906 (the day of the expiration of the leases), be in actual use as a foundation for a building for manufacturing purposes; and that in that case the plaintiff is entitled by virtue of the said covenant to have included in the appraisement thereunder such amount as the appraisers may find to be the value on the said 1st November, 1906, of such foundation including therein the value of any earth or other material filled in such formation which was necessary to strengthen and support the same so as to render it a safe and suitable foundation.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick on appeal refused to accede to the limited construction of the words \u201cerections and buildings\u201d contended for by the City of St. John which was broadly, as re-stated in this court, that stone or other material filled in upon the water lots was not \u201ca building or erection\u201d within the meaning of those words in the covenant no matter what might have been the object and purpose for which such stone or other material was so filled in and irrespective of such stone or other material being at the expiration of the lease in actual use as a foundation for a building erected over them for manufacturing purposes. The Supreme Court adopted and confirmed the decree as far as it went and substantially for the reasons given by the Chief Justice, but it went further and varied the decree, by adding words to the effect that the compensation to which the tenants were entitled should extend not only to such filling in as was in actual use as a foundation for a building actually existing for manufacturing purposes at the termination of the lease, but to such as had been placed on the lot with the intention of using it as a foundation for a building intended afterwards to be erected, and whether such intention had been carried out or not.\nThis variation and addition to the equity decree seems to me to go much further than the language of the covenant justifies. It opens up a wide field of speculation and in a case such as that before us where filling in may have been made for more than the one and only purpose and object for which compensation could be assessed, carries us away into the region of mist and doubt and makes it incumbent upon us to determine the issue with respect to the filling forming or not forming part of the erections and buildings upon the land when the lease expired, not upon the facts and circumstances as they then existed, but upon the doubtful frame of mind of the lessee when he made the filling. I do not think the covenant providing for compensation extended beyond buildings and erections for manufacturing purposes actually existing at the time of the expiration of the lease. It did not in my judgment cover erections which not being in themselves made or suitable for manufacturing purposes the tenants may have a more or less vague intention of turning into a manufacturing establishment.\nOur attention has not been called to any evidence or proved facts shewing the existence of conditions to which the variation in the degree would be applicable. I do not understand that such an extended right of compensation dependent upon intention was argued before the Chief Justice in the present case or before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in the cases decided in the expropriation proceedings before Mr. Justice McLeod, and which the respondents contend finally settled the law as to the construction of the covenant in question. I do think that if adopted the variation would give rise to interminable difficulties and open up a wide field of doubtful speculation. I think the true construction of the covenant should be limited to the foundation of buildings or erections for manufacturing purposes actually erected or existing at the expiration of the lease as distinguished from work done with an intention of making it part of a manufacturing building which intention was never carried into effect or which for many reasons may have changed before the expiration of the lease.\nNo formal rule, order, judgment or decree was, we are told, ever taken out in the applications made to the court to instruct Mr. Justice McLeod as to what damages he should allow or disallow and we are driven to find out what was really decided from the reasons given by the learned judges who determined the case. There was no stated case; no issue joined and the court were, of course, only asked to construe the covenant in the lease respecting compensation in so far as it dealt with the practical facts relating to the expropriated portions of the lots as to which Mr. Justice McLeod was assessing damages. The question appears to have come before the court three times. We have reports of two of these hearings and one is unreported. As to this latter it appears that Mr. Justice Landry and Mr. Justice McLeod, both of whom sat in the case, do not agree as to what was decided.\nMr. Justice McLeod says that in this unreported case Chief Justice Barker\nexplained that his previous reported judgments were intended only to cover the piling and filling in necessary for the foundations of the buildings on the lot.\nMr. Justice Landry regrets that his recollection of the unreported decision is not in accordance with that of McLeod J., but he does not say in what particular McLeod J.\u2019s statement is at variance with his own recollection, or what his recollection as to the effect of that judgment is.\nHowever, we have the fact that Mr. Justice McLeod assessed the damages on the basis of his understanding of the judgment and that from his award there was still another appeal to the full court. McLeod J. quoted the notice of appeal given in that case which shews that the question in controversy was whether the lessees were entitled to have the value assessed to them of the piling, stringing and capping and filling over the whole of the expropriated lot taken from the plaintiff, or only of those works under the buildings on the said portion so expropriated. No question was raised as to the right of the plaintiff extending to those portions of the piling and filling, etc., on the lot on which no buildings existed, but over which buildings were intended to be erected for manufacturing purposes. This latter part does not seem to me to have been mooted or discussed by counsel, and though there is some language in the reported judgments which might be interpreted as covering the variation in the decree made by the Supreme Court and now before us in this appeal, such language in view of the reported arguments of counsel and of the two questions which Barker C.J. says in his judgment reported in 39 N.B. Rep., at p. 59, were before them then to be settled, must be considered merely obiter.\nThe fact that Barker C.J. in giving his judgment in the case now under appeal adopted and followed what McLeod J. says was his explanation of his reported judgment in 39 N.B. Rep., together with all the facts I have cited convince me that no judgment or decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick was ever given or pronounced upon the special point on which the Appeal Court of New Brunswick has varied Chief Justice Barker\u2019s decree which can be set up or pleaded as res adjudicata upon the point on which the judgment in appeal varies the decree of Chief Justice Barker. Even if the judgment had the effect contended for I wish to be understood as not expressing any opinion as to whether it could or could not support a plea of res adjudicata in this case.\nThe extent to which the decree as varied can be supported must, therefore, depend upon its merits and not upon the point having been res adjudicata.\nFor my own part, I am of the opinion that the decree as pronounced by Chief Justice Barker goes to the utmost limit of the proper construction of the covenant. For the reasons given by him in pronouncing the decree now in appeal and also for those given in his previous reported judgments in 38 and 39 N. B. Reports, pages 543 and 57 respectively, I am of opinion that decree should stand. I think he reached a fair legal conclusion as to the covenants in the leases covering and extending as well to the foundations necessary to uphold and maintain the manufacturing buildings erected on the lots and being there at the time of the expiration of the lease as to the buildings themselves. The substructure necessary to uphold and keep useful for manufacturing purposes the buildings and erections constructed upon them were as much part of the erections and buildings as those terms are used in the covenants of the lease as the superstructure itself. It mattered not whether that substructure was of concrete, of stone cemented with mortar, or of piles strengthened either by timber bolted to them or by stones or other filling placed for the purpose of strengthening and keeping them in place and steady so as to enable the contemplated manufacturing to be carried on. In each and every one of the cases suggested the substructure would, I think, form part of the superstructure within the meaning of the words in the covenant.\nOn this main point I am in full accord with the original decree and with the judgment affirming it of the Appeal Court. For the reasons given by me, however, I am unable to concur in the reasoning of Barry J. with whom the rest of the court concurred as to the variation made in the decree. Nor, as I have said, do I think the doctrine of res adjudicata can be invoked to sustain the variation of the judgment which I think cannot be sustained on its merits.\nThe conclusions I have reached are that the decree of the Chief Justice sitting in the Court of Equity correctly declares the meaning and extent of the covenant in the leases on which the tenants are entitled to have their compensation assessed; and that the variations of that decree made by the court en banc cannot be supported. That the prior judgments of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, reported in the 38th and 39th volumes of the N.B. Reports, do not, properly interpreted, conclude the questions before us so far as the variations in the decree are concerned, and cannot be set up as res adjudicata of the present appeal. That these variations of the decree must, therefore, be supported, if at all, on their merits alone, and that for the reasons I have given they go beyond what I think the covenant calls for or justifies.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal, leaving the costs on the cross-appeal to the Appeal Court as disposed of by that court.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant leased what may be aptly called water lots with the apparent intention that they should be built upon for manufacturing purposes. At least the lessee or successor was, if not given a renewal at the expiration of the term, to be compensated for such \u201cbuildings or erections for manufacturing purposes upon the * * * demised premises\u201d as might have been erected thereon by the lessee or those claiming under him. If the value of such buildings or erections could not be agreed upon, appraisers were to determine same.\nIn January, 1907, the appraisers had made their awards in the cases before us, and in the following April the city tendered the respective sums thus awarded.\nIt had happened that the city prior to these proceedings had appropriated some small part in order to widen a street. In determining the damages to be paid in respect of the expropriation, a question arose as to the right of the respondents there concerned, to have an allowance made for some piling and filling in between the piles upon which the buildings upon that part rested. I suspect the refusal of the money tendered herein was caused by a desire to see the result of that rather prolonged litigation relative to expropriation and by an intention if the respondent concerned therein was successful, to set up the like claim to that made therein as a ground for attacking the award of the appraisers.\nIn 1909, a bill in equity was filed by each lessee or successor to set aside the award in regard to his or their respective claims. I may be permitted to doubt if in the then state of the law such a proceeding was open to them as against an award good on its face and in relation to which neither the good faith nor capacity of the appraisers could be impeached, and no very palpable mistake had occurred.\nIt does not seem to have been desired to take that line of defence and without objection evidence was given by the appraisers of the matters they had in fact considered, and omitted to consider, in estimating the amount to be allowed.\nChief Justice Barker finding error made manifest in this way set the awards aside. From his judgment a consolidated appeal took place to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. That court modified the decree of Chief Justice Barker and in doing so expressed an opinion that the appraisers might have gone somewhat further than he had intimated permissible.\nThe city having appealed from this judgment it is now contended that the result of the litigation in the expropriation case was to create a res judicata governing, in some way I do not understand, the determination of this case.\nMr. Justice McLeod on a second trial of said expropriation proceedings gave judgment therein which was confirmed by the full court and must be taken to be the final pronouncement in that litigation in respect of what seems to have been actually in question.\nSitting as an appellate judge in this case he speaks referring to same as follows:\u2014\nUnder that judgment the damages in the case before me were assessed simply for the piling and filling in intended for and forming a part of the foundation of the buildings and this Court, as I have said, in Hilary Term, 1909, held that that assessment was right and in accordance with the judgment reported in 39 N.B.R., page 56.\nIn the absence of the record, which is not produced, I think this must be taken as clearly defining the limits of any question of res judicata, that by any chance might be held here to bind anybody.\nI have not overlooked a statement of Mr. Justice McLeod in the earlier judgment in appeal indicating that some land piled and filled had not been covered by the buildings. I reconcile it with above by observing the small part of land involved, and the possibility that the piling and filling in may, though not directly under the building, have yet been useful to maintain its stability. Clearly, it is in that regard that Chief Justice Barker and others treated the matter. The stability given the buildings in question seems the key-note of his judgment and of others in that case.\nAs I do not quarrel with Chief Justice Barker\u2019s judgment so far as it relates to the allowance of the value of the stability given to these buildings in question here by the filling in between the piles on which the buildings rest, I fail to see how I can make use of the wealth of learning the agitation of the question of res judicata herein has produced.\nCounsel have very properly tried to make up for a defect in the record, but I do not think they can fairly be supposed to have intended going further than the facts as stated by Mr. Justice McLeod. All they designed doing was to put the record on a fair basis.\nIt is said by counsel for appellant that one of the cases before us involves no more than filling in between piles under buildings erected, to render them stable.\nCounsel for respondent did not clearly concede this, though I suspect it is all that is in truth involved.\nIn regard to the other case respondent\u2019s counsel was quite clear the filling extended much further and involved much more. If so I fail to see how the res judicata can arise to help the plaintiff, though I can see how if given effect to, it may, if applicable, defeat him ultimately.\nI am thus brought to consider the real issue in this case, and consequently the only issue we can properly pass upon in appeal.\nThe suit is one purely and simply to set aside the award. Such is the only express prayer of the bill and the general prayer can only extend to the things incidental thereto.\nNo question is raised now of Chief Justice Barker\u2019s right to set the award aside upon the evidence adduced as it was without objection; nor, admitting that evidence, can there be any question in my mind but that the award was properly set aside.\nNeither directly nor incidentally to reaching such a conclusion can the question of res judicata have any place.\nIt would, for the learned Chief Justice in doing so, and for an appellate court reviewing his work, be quite right and proper to elucidate the law relevant to the parties\u2019 rights as presented to the appraisers, and as existent at that time when they acted, in order to arrive at a proper determination as to whether or not they had discharged their duty or exceeded their powers.\nIn such cases the same or future appraisers being called on to act ought to give due heed to the opinion of the courts thus incidentally expressed.\nBut to introduce something in the nature of res judicata which had transpired a year or two after the award so affecting the rights of the parties and ask the court to pass upon it as we are asked to do here is beyond the power of the court unless it had power given it to direct something further to be done. All that was before the court was the single question of whether or not the appraisers had in the state of things before them properly discharged their duty. That question answered as it is by affirming the learned Chief Justice the court was functus officio.\nI tried, on the argument, to make this point clear, and, if possible, obtain an answer to it, but was unsuccessful.\nIt occurred to me that there might be some statutory provision enabling, as in England and elsewhere, a power of direction given a court, so seized of a case as to set aside an award, to direct a further reference or remit the matter back to the appraisers with proper instructions.\nAnd, of course, if there existed such a power it might be competent for the court to direct the lines upon which the appraisers should proceed and incidentally thereto to pass upon the question now raised of res judicata or its equivalent, the law that is to be applied in future proceedings.\nCounsel were unable to refer to any such power and seemed to concede that such legislation as had taken place was not in force so far as to be applicable to this case.\nThe courts of common law had no power until the statute 9 & 10 Wm. III, ch. 15, to set aside an award. Of course, it might happen, when sued upon, to be held invalid by reason of what appeared on its face.\nThis common law jurisdiction was invoked thenceforward in casks where the submission could be made a rule of court, which was in modern times obtained, as of course, by a side bar rule.\nThe Court of Chancery had been resorted to and exercised a jurisdiction founded, as Story puts it, on the ground of relief to be given in cases of fraud, accident or mistake.\nThis state of things continued until the \u201cCommon Law Procedure Act, 1854,\u201d when the law took a new starting point of a growth I need not dwell upon.\nThe cases since are worth little as guides in this connection unless regard is had to the possible statutory foundation therefor.\nIf, as counsel seem to admit, there is no statute bearing on the question here, then the court\u2019s duty ended when the award was set aside.\nIt has occurred to me that there may have arisen in New Brunswick a local practice which we ought to observe and which may justify formulating the opinion of the court in the decree or judgment. I would not wish nor do I presume to disturb such a practice. But when relied upon, I cannot see how it can go or be taken further than an expression of opinion of the grounds for setting aside the award and thus, as already suggested, having that weight due to judicial opinion in such case.\nIn the absence of statutory authority the court can have no power to interfere with the future of the determination of the dispute; and thus certainly no more right to entertain the question of res judicata which intervened after the award, than it would if a release or aught else had been put forward.\nI may say I have sought to find another state of the law for I think it to be regretted that we cannot refer this case back to the appraisers with binding instructions for their guide.\nI think, therefore, Chief Justice Barker\u2019s judgment should not have been interfered with by the Court of Appeal.\nIf I had to pass upon the case as originally before him, I possibly would have expressed the view, that if a building had been actually in process of erection for manufacturing purposes, and had only got so far as the foundation, consisting of piling and filling in, it might be worth while, considering the uncompleted building, if good reason given to shew it was the result of a definite settled purpose merely unexpectedly broken in upon by the landlord\u2019s desire to terminate the lease.\nSo far as I can see there was nothing of this sort in the case. I suspect if there had been, we should have heard of it.\nTo go further would seem, I submit with respect, to be flying in face of the express language of the covenant. Even what I suggest as possible in such a case may go further than the express language, but is it not implied?\nIn going thus far I feel I may be trespassing when we have no power to direct.\nI have not overlooked the few cases where even before the \u201cCommon Law Procedure Act\u201d a reference back was had at common law to complete the execution of the duty the arbitrators had assumed.\nNor have I failed to consider, though no point was made of it, the difference between appraisers and arbitrators.\nThe sum and substance of the matter is, that where parties have chosen a private forum no one has a right to interfere in the way of managing, controlling or directing that forum, so long as it keeps within its limits as defined in the contract constituting it; and even then the court, unless empowered otherwise by statute, can go no further than set its award aside.\nI repeat that is all that was prayed for here.\nThe appeal should be allowed, as an interference for which there was no warrant, with costs here and in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick save as to the costs of cross-appeal therein, as to which the order providing therefor should stand as to such costs.\nDuff and Anglin JJ. concurred in the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

VII. c. 48, s. 6, ss. 4 (Ont.)\u2014Contesting creditor\u2019s lien\u2014\u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d\u201410 Edw. VII. c. 64, s. 14 (Ont.).\nSection 6, sub-sec. 4, of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d of Ontario provides that \u201cwhere proceedings are taken by a sheriff for relief under any provisions relating to interpleader, those creditors only who are parties thereto and who agree to contribute pro rata in proportion to the amount of their executions or certificates to the expense of contesting any adverse claim shall be entitled to share in any benefit which may be deprived from the contestation of such claim so far as may be necessary to satisfy their executions or certificates.\u201d Section 14 of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d is as follows:\u2014\n\u201c14. An assignment for the general benefit of creditors under this Act shall take precedence of attachments, garnishee orders, judgments, executions not completely executed by payment and orders appointing receivers by way of equitable execution subject to the lien, if any, of an execution creditor for his costs, where there is but one execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, or to the lien, if any, for his costs of the creditor who has the first execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (24 Ont. L.R. 356, sub nom. Re Henderson Roller Bearings, Ltd.), which affirmed that of the Divisional Court (22 Ont. L.R. 306), that the preferential lien given by the former Act to the contesting creditor is not taken away by said sec. 14 of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act.\u201d APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which maintained the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] in favour of the respondents.\nThe appellant was assignee for the general benefit of creditors under an assignment by the Henderson Roller Bearings, Ltd., and the respondents were execution creditors of the insolvent company. Under the executions issued by the respective respondents the goods of the company were seized by the sheriff, but before they were sold the company assigned. The respondents successfully contested an interpleader issue with a grantee of the goods which were then sold by order of court and the proceeds paid into court.\nThe only question for decision of the court on this appeal was whether or not the preferential lien given to an execution creditor by the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act,\u201d sec. 6, sub-sec. 4, which is set out in the above head-note is taken away by section 14 of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act.\u201d The courts below held that it was not.\nLefroy K.C. for the appellant. The intent of the legislature in enacting section 14 of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d was to make it impossible for a creditor to obtain more than a ratable share of an insolvent\u2019s assets unless his execution has been completely executed by payment and the interpleader proceedings cannot defeat that intent. O\u2019Brien v. Brodie[3]. The cases of Reid v. Murphy[4], and Reid v. Gowans[5], relied on in the courts below are distinguishable and do not apply.\nWatson K.C. and J. Grayson Smith, for the respondents. The goods were not sold under execution, but under a court order. See Reid v. Murphy4; Reid v. Gowans5; Federal Life Ins. Co. v. Stinson[6]; the execution creditors had, therefore, acquired a new and independent status.\nThe execution creditors who have borne the brunt of the proceedings and recovered the assets in the interpleader issue should not be deprived of the benefit of their act in favour of other creditors who have held aloof. See Wood v. Joselin[7].\nD.J. McDougall appeared for the respondent the sheriff of Toronto.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The substantial question to be determined upon this appeal is whether the language of the 14th section of \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act,\u201d 10 Edw. VII. ch. 64 (Ont.), is broad and comprehensive enough to embrace and cover creditors of the debtor who have previously to the assignment acquired a preferential claim or lien upon the proceeds of the sale of the debtor\u2019s property under an interpleader order under section 6, sub-sections 4 and 5 of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act,\u201d 9 Edw. VII. ch. 48 (Ont.).\nI confess myself to have been greatly influenced by the able argument presented by Mr. Lefroy for the appellants, who contended that all and any preferences or liens which would ordinarily exist in favour of certain special creditors under the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d had been swept away by the 14th section of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act.\u201d\nA careful consideration of these two statutes, however, has convinced me that the impression made upon my mind at the argument was wrong and that so far as a preference lien, private claim or salvage claim, as my brother Duff prefers to call it, existed in favour of the respondents\u2019 claims under the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d it was not taken away by the 14th section of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act.\u201d\nThat section reads as follows:\u2014\nAn assignment for the general benefit of creditors under this Act shall take precedence of attachments, garnishee orders, judgments, executions not completely executed by payment and orders appointing receivers by way of equitable execution subject to the lien, if any, of an execution creditor for his costs, where there is but one execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, or to the lien, if any, for his costs of the creditor who has the first execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands.\nThe language of the section, it is true, is very broad and general, and the object and intention of the legislature plain, namely, to make an assignment for the general benefits of creditors \u201ctake precedence of attachments, garnishee orders, judgments, executions not completely executed by payments and orders appointing receivers by way of equitable execution.\u201d\nThe question is: Does this extend to the preference, priority, lien, salvage, or what you choose to call it, specially created by sub-sections 3 and 4 of section 6 of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d in favour of those creditors who accept and discharge the onus of defraying the expense of contesting any adverse claim made by a third party to the property or its proceeds seized under execution and as to which adverse claims have been set up, interpleader orders made, and contests entered upon, with the result of defeating such adverse claims?\nDoes the 14th section of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d extend to such a case at all?\nTo determine that requires, of course, a careful examination of the object and provisions of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act.\u201d\nAnd, first, I would remark that the preference, lien, prior-charge or salvage, whatever it may be, given to the creditors who take upon themselves the risk and expense of contesting adverse claims to the property or moneys in dispute is not a preference or lien arising out of an unsatisfied execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands simply, but is a statutory right created as a reward or salvage to those creditors who undertake at their own expense to defeat an adverse claim and who are successful in doing so. Those creditors who refuse to accept the onus or burden the statute makes the price of the prize or salvage to be gained do not share in the latter\u2019s distribution. The creditors who are entitled to join in, or to accept, the statutory burden and to reap the statutory reward are not execution creditors only. \u201cCertificated creditors\u201d are equally entitled to become parties to the interpleader proceedings and to contribute towards the expense of contesting adverse claims pro rat\u00e2 and to share pro rat\u00e2 in the fruits of the contest. These certificated creditors are those who not having obtained judgment for the amount of their claims are creditors who have under the statute obtained from the County Court judge a certificate or allowance of their claim.\nThis \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d not only abolishes priority amongst execution creditors, not only creates a lien or charge in favour of those creditors who agree to assume the expense of contesting adverse claims to the property or its fruits levied upon, but puts the certificated creditor on a par with the execution creditor and entitles him\nto share in any distribution as if he had delivered an execution to the sheriff.\nThe Act also declares, sub-section 3, section 10, that \u201cfor the purposes of interpleader proceedings the certificate should be deemed to be an execution.\u201d\nSub-section 4, of section 6, expressly limits the distribution in cases where proceedings are taken by the sheriff for relief under interpleader proceedings to such execution or certificated, creditors who become parties to the interpleader proceedings, agree to contribute proportionately to the expense of the contest, and if successful become entitled to share in the fruits of success.\nI do not think the general words of the 14th section of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d extend to such special statutory priorities, liens or privileges conceded as a reward for the burden assumed.\nTake a case where the execution creditor on an adverse claim to the property seized being made refused to assume the burden of contesting, and a \u201ccertificated creditor\u201d stepped into the breach, accepted the onus and successfully contested and defeated the adverse claim, the conduct of the proceedings being given to him by the judge would section 14 take away his right of preference or priority of payment which was purely a statutory creation? I venture to think not and that this negative answer to the question answers the appellant\u2019s contention as to the scope of section 14.\nNo reference is made in that section to the certificated creditors\u2019 priority or lien. That did not flow from any execution because none such existed as regards the certificated creditors\u2019 debt. It was a pure creation of the statute, and I find no words in the 4th section broad enough to cover it or take it away. This argument I confess influences me very much in determining the proper construction of that section.\nIt was contended that the special lien created by the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d had been reduced by the 14th section of the \u201cAssignments Act\u201d above set out to the right to have the costs reimbursed to the creditors who had become liable for them.\nBut, as I said, that section does not extend to the special priority or lien given under the 6th section of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act.\u201d\nAt any rate I have not been able to satisfy myself that the judgments of the divisional and appeal courts are both clearly wrong in their construction of these statutes and, therefore, concur in dismissing the appeal.\nI have not in view of my conclusion as above expressed deemed it necessary to refer to any of the other points argued.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I agree in general with the reasoning of the several judgments of the learned judges in the courts below rejecting the claim of the appellant, and do not think it would serve any profitable purpose to repeat same here. Yet I may, in addition thereto, point out that the costs made by section 14 of the \u201cAssignment Act\u201d a preferential claim, are by no means the same costs which the amendment of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d constitute, and always constituted, a lien in favour of execution creditors\u2019 taking upon them the burden of an interpleader issue and which are sometimes very great indeed.\nTo give effect to the contention of the appellant would deprive these execution creditors of all the costs incidental to the interpleader proceedings.\nIf the \u201cAssignments Act\u201d had been amended before or at the same time as the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d was amended in that regard to add such interpleader costs to what section 14 of the former preserves as a preferential lien, then the argument of the appellant might have had more force. The grievance of interpleading creditors had long been manifest and when the legislature undertook to remedy it, surely the only remedy manifest in the legislation ought to be applied.\nIt would be clearly inequitable to expose creditors, entering upon expensive litigation to defeat frauds upon creditors, to defeat and serious loss by such contrivances as manifestly were resorted to in this case.\nIn this regard the amendment to the law was certainly posterior to the original enactment.\nI may also point out as supplementing the alleged technical application of legal principles involved in some of the reasonings I adopt and are relied upon below, that if the appellant or one in the like position was driven to make an independent attack upon any fraudulent assignment, he would, as incidental to relief granted, if creditors such as the respondents were joined as defendants, as inevitably they must be, to give entire relief, have to pay these costs as a condition of relief.\nI am not saying such a course was open to him, but if conceivable it would come with a better grace from an assignee in the appellant\u2019s position, to claim he was only seeking equity than seems open to appellant herein.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed. Apart from statutory enactment an assignee for the benefit of creditors takes only that which his assignor can give him. A transfer of property impeachable under the Statute of Elizabeth as a fraud upon the creditors of the transferor may be perfectly inexpugnable so long as the creditors take no steps to have the property applied in satisfaction of their claims; as against the debtor it may give a perfectly good title to the property transferred. At common law, therefore, an assignee under an assignment for the benefit of creditors as such has no status to attack such a transfer as having been made in fraud of creditors. The \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d appears to treat these transfers in this way. The property affected is regarded as being in the hands of the transferee exigible in satisfaction of the just claims of the creditors generally to the same extent as it would have been so exigible in the hands of the debtor himself. For the purpose of satisfying such claims the transfer is treated as non-existent and an assignee under an assignment to which the Act applies is authorized as the representative of the creditors generally, to take such proceedings as may be necessary to have their rights declared. But in the event of the assignee failing to take steps to make the property affected by a fraudulent transfer available for the creditors generally, the Act authorizes any individual creditor to take such proceedings and confers upon such creditors the exclusive right to enjoy the benefits resulting therefrom if the proceedings should be successful. In this latter case the property affected by the transaction successfully impeached is not captured by the assignment at all.\nProvisions similar in principle are found in the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act.\u201d Under those provisions, speaking broadly, execution creditors who in interpleader proceedings assume the risk of contesting an adverse claim and are successful, become entitled to the benefits arising from their successful proceedings to the exclusion of creditors who have refused to partake in the responsibilities of the contest.\nI think there is nothing in the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d in virtue of which an assignment by the debtor can have the effect of divesting such creditors of this privilege once it has vested in them. It is not necessary to pass upon the question whether the surplus of property, the subject of such proceedings, could after payment of the privileged creditors be claimed by the assignee for the behoof of the creditors generally: it seems to be clear that there is nothing in the Act which can fairly be held to displace the privilege in favour of such creditors. Section 14, which is relied upon, gives the assignment precedence over \u201cjudgments and executions not completely executed by payment.\u201d But the privilege in question is not an incident of the creditor\u2019s judgment or execution, it is a special privilege conferred upon him by the law as a reward for his activity in frustrating an attempt to commit a fraud; and I do not think the language of section 14 requires us to hold that it is within the purview of that section. On the whole, reading the relevant statutory provisions together, a reasonable view appears to be that the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d recognizes the principle upon which the privilege created by the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d is based and there is nothing in the former Act which requires us to hold that the benefit of that privilege once acquired is by its provisions devested for the behoof of the creditors as a whole.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion the assignment to Martin did not deprive the execution creditors who had successfully contested the interpleader issue against Atkinson of the special lien upon the goods under seizure which they thereby acquired in virtue of the provisions of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act,\u201d 9 Edw. VII. (O.) ch. 48. The effect of those provisions was not merely to establish the right of the contesting execution creditors to payment of their executions out of the proceeds of such goods, but also to bar pro tanto the right to share in them of all other creditors (sec. 6, sub-sec. 4), including the real claimant who is prosecuting the present proceedings in the name of the assignee, Martin. If any interest in those goods passed to Martin by the debtor\u2019s assignment, it was subject to the rights which had accrued from the anterior interpleader proceedings. I find nothing in the \u201cAssignments and Prefer- ences Act\u201d (10 Edw. VII. (O.) ch. 64, which deprives the contesting execution creditors of the statutory privilege which their activity had secured to them\u2014nothing which restores to the other creditors rights of which the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act\u201d by reason of their inaction had deprived them.\nMr. Justice Meredith, I venture to think, misses the point when, he says of the statutory privilege acquired by the contesting execution creditors, that it was\na lien which, of course, their executions alone gave them; there could be no other.\nAfter the determination of the interpleader issue in their favour the successful execution creditors, in virtue of the statutory right conferred by the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act,\u201d occupied a much stronger position than that of mere execution creditors. Elsewhere the same learned judge speaks of the creditor in whose behalf the present proceedings are taken as\none who * * * never had the opportunity of joining in the contest.\nIt would almost seem that he had overlooked the provisions of sections 7 et seq. of the \u201cCreditors\u2019 Relief Act,\u201d 9 Edw. VII. ch. 48\u2014particularly that of sub-section 3 of section 10. Neither can I agree with him that\nit is quite clear that the goods in question have always been, as against creditors and the assignee, the property of the debtors.\nThe learned judge writes as if he were under the impression that a conveyance which is fraudulent as against creditors is absolutely void. As pointed out in numerous cases under the Statute of Elizabeth, notwithstanding that such a deed is there declared to be \u201cclearly and utterly void, frustrate and of none effect,\u201d it is good inter partes and not absolutely void, but only voidable at the instance of creditors.\nTill made void by \u201ccreditors and others,\u201d it is a valid deed, and one by virtue of which the legal estate vests in the grantee, subject to its being divested. (See May on Fraudulent Conveyances, 2 ed., pp. 316-7, 325.)\nIt may be that these premises account in part for the conclusion of the learned appellate judge, who differed from his colleagues, that the 14th section of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d \u201cvery plainly covers this case.\u201d\nExcept as against the contesting execution creditors the conveyance to Atkinson had not been avoided when the assignment to Martin was made; nor has it since been avoided. On the contrary, as has been pointed out in the courts below, the re-conveyance from Atkinson, under which the assignee Martin now asserts title, proceeds on the assumption that the debtor\u2019s property had passed to and was vested in Atkinson.\nI respectfully concur in the opinions expressed in the provincial courts by the learned judges who held that the Martin assignment cannot prevail against the rights of the respondents and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: DuVernet, Raymond, Ross & Ardagh.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Watson, Smoke, Chisholm & Smith.\n[1] 24 Ont.

The \u201cMarriage Act,\u201d chapter 105 of the Revised Statutes, 1906, is amended by adding thereto the following section:\u2014\n\u201c3. Every ceremony or form of marriage heretofore or hereafter performed by any person authorized to perform any ceremony of marriage by the laws of the place where it is performed, and duly performed according to such laws, shall everywhere within Canada be deemed to be a valid marriage, notwithstanding any differences in the religious faith of the persons so married and without regard to the religion of the person performing the ceremony.\n\u201c(2) The rights and duties, as married people of the respective persons married as aforesaid, and of the children of such marriage, shall be absolute and complete, and no law or canonical decree or custom of or in any province of Canada shall have any force or effect to invalidate or qualify any such marriage or any of the rights of the said persons or their children in any manner whatsoever\u201d**.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The retrospective part would be good as part of a scheme for concurrent legislation by Parliament and legislatures confirming past marriages which, probably, neither effectively can do. The prospective part, so far as possible to make it an effective prohibition of religious tests, may be good, but doubtful, and the probable purpose can be reached by a better bill.\nPer Davies, Idington and Duff JJ.\u2014The law of the Province of Quebec does not render null and void, unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage in such province between two Roman Catholics that would otherwise be binding.

(a) Has the Parliament of Canada authority to enact in whole or in part, Bill. No. 3 of the First Session of the Twelfth Parliament of Canada, intituled, \u201cAn Act to amend the \u2018Marriage Act\u2019\u201d? The bill provides as follows:\u2014\n\u201c1. The \u2018Marriage Act,\u2019 chapter 105 of the Revised Statutes, 1906, is amended by adding thereto the following section:\u2014\n\u201c\u20183. Every ceremony or form of marriage heretofore or hereafter performed by any person \u201e authorized to perform any ceremony of marriage by the laws of the place where it is performed, and duly performed according to such laws, shall everywhere within Canada be deemed to be a valid marriage, notwithstanding any differences in the religious faith of the persons so married and without regard to the religion of the person performing the ceremony.\n\u201c\u2018(2) The rights and duties, as married people of the respective persons married as aforesaid, and of the children of such marriage, shall be absolute and complete, and no law or canonical decree or custom of or in any province in Canada shall have any force or effect to invalidate or qualify any such marriage or any of the rights of the said persons or their children in any manner whatsoever.\u2019\u201d\n(b) If the provisions of the said bill are not all within the authority of the Parliament of Canada to enact, which, if any, of the provisions are within such authority?\n2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void, unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province,\n(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or, (b) between persons one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic?\n3. If either (a) or (b) of the last preceding question is answered in the affirmative, or both of them are answered in the affirmative, has the Parliament of Canada authority to enact that all such marriages whether,\n(a) heretofore solemnized, or,\n(b) hereafter to be solemnized, shall be legal and binding?\nCounsel on behalf of the promotors of the bill:\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., Eug\u00e8ne Lafleur E.C., Christopher C. Robinson.\nCounsel on behalf of those denying the jurisdiction of Parliament to enact the bill: P. B. Mignault K.C., I. F. Hellmuth K.C.\nRepresenting the Attorney-General of Canada: E. L. Newcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice.\nCounsel for the Province of Quebec: R. C. Smith K.C., Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C.\nCounsel for the Province of Ontario: Edward Bayley K.C., Solicitor to the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am requested by Mr. Justice Brodeur to say that he does not intend to take part in the hearing of this reference owing to the fact that he was a member of the Government when, speaking for the Government, the then Minister of Justice, Sir Allen Aylesworth, said the Dominion Parliament was not competent to pass such legislation. Mr. Justice Brodeur feels that he is to some extent responsible for that opinion and, consequently, he thinks he should not take part in this hearing.\nNewcombe K.C.\u2014I appear for the Attorney-General of Canada to present and explain to your Lordships the question which has been referred, the circumstances of the reference, and the dispositions which the Government has made for the argument of the case before your Lordships. As your Lordships are aware, the bill which is the subject-matter of the first question referred, was introduced in the House of Commons during the early part of the recent session and, when it became a subject of debate, the Government, owing to the very great importance of the subject and the interests affected by the measure, and having regard, moreover, to the somewhat doubtful constitutionality of the bill, considered it expedient in the public interest to obtain judicial advice upon the power of Parliament to give effect, to the proposed enactments, such as they are, before determining its policy upon the merits. In fact, I may say it would be premature, in view of the differences which were expressed upon constitutional grounds, for Parliament to consider and determine its action upon the bill in the absence of better assurance of its enacting authority than the occasion seemed to produce. Consequently, the Government adopted the policy of referring the bill to the court with the question stated so that the views of the various interests might be fully submitted and argued. The Government permitted the promoters of the bill to name the counsel who should appear before this court to uphold the jurisdiction of Parliament to enact. Counsel were named accordingly and Mr. Nesbitt and Mr. Lafleur represent the promoters. They have filed a factum which your Lordships have before you. At the same time the Government named counsel to submit the reasons which seemed to exclude the proposed legislation from Dominion powers and my learned friends Mr. Mignault and Mr. Hellmuth are arguing that view. Then, each Attorney-General of each province was notified so as to give each province an opportunity of appearing and presenting such arguments as it might deem wise. The provinces have acknowledged the notice. We have communications from the Province of Prince Edward Island and from the Yukon Territory that they do not intend to appear upon the hearing. What course the other provinces are taking will develop, I suppose. As it will be necessary to read these questions in the argument as the case proceeds, perhaps your Lordships do not require to hear them read now as a mere formal matter of submission. Therefore, with these observations, I propose with your Lordships\u2019 permission to leave the matter in the hands of the court to be discussed under the arrangement which the Government have made for the argument.\nR. C. Smith E.C.\u2014When we last had the honour of appearing before your Lordships I stated that on behalf of the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec we should enter a respectful objection to the jurisdiction of this court, upon the ground of the doubtful constitutionality of the Act referring such questions. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the 16th of this month rendered a decision in the case which was then pending[1], and I suppose I must say frankly that, with regard to the absolute question of jurisdiction, we must accept it as disposing of the question of jurisdiction and upholding that such a reference is constitutional. On behalf of the Attorney-General of Quebec, however, I think it proper to direct your Lordships\u2019 attention, especially to a few observations of the Lord Chancellor in rendering that decision and I do so especially with reference to question No. 2. I may say that we think question No. 2 is actually involved in question No. 1. We therefore do not propose to raise any further objection to the jurisdiction, of this court, considering it finally decided by their Lordships of the Privy Council. It is specially with reference to question No. 2 that I desire respectfully to invite your Lordships\u2019 attention to some of the observations that fell from the lips of the Lord Chancellor. The second question reads as follows:\u2014\n\u201c2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void, unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province:\n\u201c(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or,\n\u201c(b) between persons one of whom only is a Roman Catholic?\u201d The Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec respectfully objects to the submission of that question and respectfully asks your Lordships either not to answer it, or before answering it to make representations to the Government as suggested by the Lord Chancellor[2]. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee first set out that the real point raised in this important case \u2014 that is the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d \u2014 is whether or not an Act of the Dominion Parliament authorizing questions either of law or of fact to be put to the Supreme Court, and requiring the judges of that court to answer them on the request of the Governor-General in Council is a valid enactment within the powers of that Parliament. Of course, my Lords, the question in that case was not really one between the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces and that of the Dominion, but it raised the broader question whether or not any power whatever existed to ask such questions. Their Lordships determined that the full ambit of legislative power has been conferred by the British North America Act, that is to say, that the legislative power covering every species of matter or subject concerning the internal Government of Canada had been committed. I may say to your Lordships that that is perhaps the first judicial decision which has in so plain terms acknowledged the absolute legislative independence of the countries. Then, after referring to the various questions upon which appeals have been taken to their Lordships, the Lord Chancellor goes on to say:\u2014\n\u201cIn all cases the appeal was entertained; in some cases the answers of the Supreme Court were modified by their Lordships; and in one case Lord Herschell, delivering the opinion of the Board, declined to answer some of the questions upon the ground that so doing might prejudice particular interests of individuals.\u201d\nThere we have an express authority for this court declining to answer this question if private interests be involved in that question. The Lord Chancellor further on says:\u2014\n\u201cThe Supreme Court itself can, however, either point out in its answer these or other considerations of a like kind, or can make the necessary representations to the Governor-General in Council when it thinks right so to treat any question that may be put.\u201d\nThe decision of His Lordship concludes:\u2014 \u201cIt is sufficient to point out the mischief and inconvenience which might arise from an indiscriminate and injudicious use of the Act, and leave it to the consideration of those who alone are lawfully and constitutionally entitled to decide upon such a matter\u201d[3].\nHis Lordship, as I take it, refers with approval, inasmuch as no disapproval is expressed, of the decision of Lord Herschell[4], to which I ask your Lordships\u2019 attention, and, he further lays down the principle that the Supreme Court has full jurisdiction to make any representations to the Government requesting the question submitted.\nThe first case to which the Lord Chancellor is referring is the case of Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorneys-General for Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia2. This is the \u201cRiver and Lake Improvement\u201d case, where a number of questions were submitted with respect to an Act passed by the Province of Ontario (Revised Statutes, Ontario, 1887, ch. 24, sec. 47), with reference to the power of the Province of Ontario to deal with the beds of rivers and lakes. I need not trouble your Lordships by referring to all the questions submitted, but the 17th question submitted was this (page 704):\u2014\n\u201cHad riparian proprietors, before confederation, the exclusive right of fishing in navigable non-tidal lakes, rivers, streams and waters, the beds of which has been granted to them by the Crown?\u201d\nAt page 717, Lord Herschell, rendering the decision of the Board, dealt with that question in these words:\u2014\n\u201cTheir Lordships must decline to answer the last question submitted as to the rights of riparian proprietors. These proprietors are not parties to this litigation or represented before their Lordships, and accordingly their Lordships do not think it proper in determining the respective rights and jurisdictions of the Dominion and provincial legislatures to express an opinion upon the extent of the right possessed by riparian proprietors.\u201d\nThere, we have an absolute refusal to answer that question because it involves private rights and rights of persons who are not represented in the litigation, nor represented in any manner whatsoever before the tribunal. There was the subsequent case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[5]. This was an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario rendered on a reference by the Government of Ontario to that court under a provincial statute which is similar in character to the section of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d in question.\nI shall raise two principal grounds of objection, (1), that this is a question which preeminently affects private rights and private interests, the interests of persons who are not represented here; and (2), that in order to determine whether or not the Dominion Parliament would have any legislative power to deal with the subject-matter at all, it being a pre-confederation law, the first question would have to be determined as to whether it related to marriage or whether it related to solemnization of marriage. If it related to solemnization of marriage the Dominion Parliament would have no power whatever to deal with it so that I shall in the second place ask that that question should be deferred until the main question is determined, or otherwise, it is putting a purely hypothetical question before the court when it is not at all clear that if the state of the law required any amendment the Dominion Parliament would be competent to deal with it at all.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014You say it does not go to our jurisdiction; if it goes only to our discretion you might postpone your argument on that point.\nMr. Smith.\u2014As long as we have an opportunity of pointing that out I have no objection, if that is the view of your Lordships.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Now that you have drawn attention to the difficulty, Mr. Smith, we will take a note of it and expect you to discuss it at a later stage of the proceedings. Will you proceed with the argument, Mr. Nesbitt.\nNesbitt E.C. (after reading questions submitted). \u2014Your Lordships will observe that in one point of view, the proposed bill which I have just read is capable of being predicated on the ground that the provincial legislation requires the marriage ceremony to be performed by some officer, and, that if performed before such an officer, no matter who the parties may be who seek the services of that officer, the marriage is valid. Question 3 will probably involve the broader question: that the Dominion has within its jurisdiction, the whole subject of marriage as such which would include the contract of marriage, and, that, under the term \u201csolemnization\u201d the evidence of that marriage and the machinery by which that marriage is evidenced is the power of the province, and that the extent of its power is not to affect the actual contract of marriage but solely to impose such penalties for the non-observation by the parties of the provincial legislation, as the province may see fit. As for instance, although the parties would be validly married, unless they have entered into that marriage with such form or solemnity that the province may require before its own particular officer, I suppose that the province could say that the wife should be deprived of dower, or that there should be no right of succession, or that the parties contracting the marriage should be subject to fine or the like. That is so, in order to enforce the provincial legislation in reference to the forms that ought to be observed to evidence the contract after the Dominion has said who may make such a contract. Then, as to the second part of the question, namely, as to the rights and duties of married persons, that part of the bill may still be treated as valid even if the first part should be held as infringing upon provincial legislation, as it affects simply the status of the parties and their children, such as their right of citizenship as legitimate persons and the like, which cannot be said to fall in any way within \u201csolemnization.\u201d Referring again to the first part of the bill, if the contention of my learned friends on the other side is to be adopted, that clandestinity is an impediment, then we may argue that the first part of the bill is ultra vires as removing that impediment.\nIf clandestinity, as to a Roman Catholic\u2019s marriage before any person except a priest, is an impediment under the Roman Catholic doctrine on that point, and if that should be held to be an impediment, clearly the Dominion has the right to legislate with respect to that impediment, and the first part of the bill would be, to that extent, a repeal of article 127 of the Civil Code. That would be our submission. Now, to come to questions No. 1 and No. 3, treating them for the moment together, the right of the Dominion is, of course, set out in section 91, sub-section 26, of the British North America Act, and by section 91 the exclusive power is vested in the Dominion on all matters embraced within the sub-heads and that is so \u201cnotwithstanding anything in section 92.\u201d Notwithstanding anything in section 92 the widest legislative power is vested, in the Dominion in relation to sub-head 26 in section 91, namely \u201cMarriage and Divorce.\u201d All that is left in the province is, under sub-section 12 of section 92 \u201cthe Solemnization of Marriage in the Province\u201d and our submission is that everything must turn upon what is meant by the term \u201csolemnization\u201d when read in conjunction with the fact that under section 91, sub-section 26, the whole subject of \u201cMarriage and Divorce\u201d is vested in the Dominion. Our contention is that the line of division is the line between the contract of marriage and the accompanying formalities by way of solemnization; that the Dominion has sole power over the first while the, provincial jurisdiction extends only to the second; that the provinces may require, for purposes of publicity and evidence, such formalities accompanying or subsequent to the contract as they may see fit, and may enforce their requirements by penalties upon the solemnizing official, and upon the parties, but that they cannot make compliance with these requirements a condition of the validity of the marriage contract, nor dissolve, nor annul, nor empower any provincial court to dissolve or annul, any contract of marriage otherwise valid, merely because the provincial requirements have not been complied with; and that, therefore, the Dominion has power to pass the bill referred for the purpose of protecting the contract of marriage against any such invalidating provincial legislation.\nThere is nothing new in the two distinctions involved in this contention, those, namely, (1). between the contract on the one hand and the solemnization on the other, and (2) between the nature of these requirements as on the one hand essential to the validity of the contract and on the other as merely evidentiary, so that, in the one case, non-compliance renders the marriage void, and, in the other, merely exposes those concerned to penalties without affecting the validity of the contract. On the contrary, both these distinctions are to be found throughout the whole history of the subject. Under the canon law, until the Council of Trent, a mere contract per verba de pr\u0153senti constituted a valid and binding marriage \u2014 it was ipsum matrimonium \u2014 and this was also the law of Scotland, and, according to the better opinion of England until the time of the \u201cMarriage Act\u201d of 1753.\nPerhaps I had better briefly refer to one or two of the authorities on that subject. The first is the case of Dalrymple v. Dalrymple[6], at page 62 (commencing at the words \u201cMarriage being a contract\u201d down to \u201cappellavit\u201d); that is the leading case up to that date. Then I refer to Beamish v. Beamish[7]. I cite it in the first place because it contains nearly all the learning on the subject, and I also wish to shew what the view of the House of Lords was as to the case to which I shall next refer. I refer especially to page 334.\nThen at page 336, the chief ground of this decision (The Queen v. Millis)[8] was the ordinance of a Saxon King, in the year A.D. 940, requiring that at nuptials there shall be a \u201cmass priest who shall by God\u2019s blessing bind their union.\u201d\nAccordingly, following that, it was held by the House of Lords, in the judgment of an equally divided court, 3 against 3, that by reason of that Saxon ordinance, there was, so to speak, express legislation which made the ceremonial a part of the contract of marriage, and avoided the contract without that ceremonial. That brings me then to the case of The Queen v. Millis[9]. What I have read from Beamish v. Beamish[10] was to make good the point that the law of Europe and the law of Scotland was as stated in the passages which I have read to you from Dalrymple v. Dalrymple[11]. The Millis Case7 turned entirely upon the point that by the act of one of the Anglo-Saxon Kings, in A.D. 940, the ceremony was made part of the contract, and the whole contract, therefore, was null unless the ceremony was performed. Then, in the case of The Queen v. Millis7 I pass to the judgment of Lord Brougham to which I desire to draw your Lordships\u2019 attention at pages 701, 702, 718, and 723.\nWill your Lordships note Howard\u2019s History of Matrimonial Institutions, vol. 1, pp. 295, 314, 339, 376. Now, following that, let me just point this out: That in the colonies, as shewn by an article in 5 Law Quarterly Review 44, at page 57, to which I will also give your Lordships the reference, Sir Howard Elphinstone, a very great authority on such a subject, points out that the case of The Queen v. Millis7 was not supposed to be applicable to the colonies; indeed, it was held in two cases, one in Upper Canada and one in Lower Canada, prior to the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d to be inapplicable. The first case is Breakey v. Breakey[12], and the other is the celebrated judgment of Mr. Justice Monk in Connolly v. Woolrich[13], at page 224, where it is again stated to be inapplicable to the colonies. I cite these cases for a statement of the law, but it is better put by Sir Howard Elphinstone in this article in 5 Law Quarterly Review where the decisions shewing The Queen v. Millis[14] to be inapplicable are also collected.\nMy contention in a word is just this: that you have to read the word \u201cmarriage\u201d with the word \u201cdivorce\u201d as I understood His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington to point out; the two are interrelated. I ask my friends on the other side where, in the language \u201csolemnization of marriage in the province,\u201d do you find any possible authority to declare invalidity; to declare that, as part of the contract of marriage over which the Dominion has complete jurisdiction, the province might interpose something the absence of which would render null and void that which the Dominion has exclusive authority to legislate upon? The province may, as I say, insist upon any form, of ceremony it may see fit.\nThe province may say it is against public policy to have no solemnization at all and it may prevent certain of the results of such a marriage, and it may impose penalties upon persons who see fit to take advantage of their rights under Dominion legislation to contract a relationship which is indissoluble but which relationship the province declares, as a matter of public policy, should be evidenced.\nMy submission to the court is that the subject of marriage, those who may marry, at what age, who may not marry, the regulation as to the degrees of consanguinity with which persons may marry, the persons to contract and their capacities to contract, are undoubtedly within Dominion jurisdiction. Solemnization of marriage does not, in the natural sense of the word extend to such matters as capacity. Some attention has to be paid to that language because if the Dominion can enact a general law for the whole Dominion declaring what shall constitute a marriage, surely there cannot be an invalidity in that respect in any province; you cannot be obliged to carry a surveyor\u2019s rule with you, to see which province you are in.\nAs to the civil effect of the contract \u2014 rights to property, for instance, succession, dower and the like, \u2014 I should imagine that the province, not under the head of \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d but under the head of \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d might impose such penalties as would make people careful. They have the right to impose conditions with respect to the subsequent relations that will exist between husband and wife as to the property; as, for instance, in reference to community of property in the Province of Quebec.\n\u201cProperty and civil rights,\u201d enables the province, possibly, to legislate upon anything that may flow from the contract of marriage \u2014 the rights of the parties as to property, the rights as to succession, the right of dower and the like.\nThe meaning of \u201cmarriage,\u201d in the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d may, perhaps, be said to be ambiguous, but it must mean, as used in that Act, the contract alone, that is, as opposed to the solemnization. The meaning of the words \u201csolemnization in the province\u201d is what you have to consider. The words \u201cin the province\u201d indicate that the provinces have no jurisdiction over the contract, since if they legislate upon that their legislation becomes, from the nature of the case, effective all over the Dominion. The object of the framers of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d must have been to have uniform legislation upon the essentials of the contract. The result of a contrary construction would be to give the provinces all the power and the Dominion really none. Complete jurisdiction over the contract is essential to effective Dominion legislation. The legislation in question is not an infringement upon the power of provincial \u201csolemnization\u201d properly understood. Nor can the province say that power to nullify the contract is necessary to the exercise of their jurisdiction over the solemnization. I contend that the effect of The Queen v. Millis[15], and all the authorities is, that unless you find express legislation dealing with the subject of the contract of marriage, which makes some use of the evidentiary machinery of solemnization essential to its validity, the contract is perfectly valid. You must have that requirement imposed as it was held to have been by the English legislation. There is nothing of the kind upon the subject here except legislation by the provinces attempting to legislate under the guise of solemnization. I say that such provincial legislation cannot nullify a contract which the Dominion declares, or has the right to say \u2014 and that is the third question\u2014 is a valid marriage. The provinces cannot say that power to nullify the contract is necessary to the exercise of their jurisdiction over the solemnization. I contend that the doctrine of necessarily implied powers has no application to the provinces which have not the benefit of the words \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act,\u201d nor of the last paragraph of section 91. I am free to admit that has never been expressly decided by the Judicial Committee. The best observations on that your Lordships will find in Lefroy\u2019s Legislative Power in Canada, at page 454. I repeat that the doctrine of necessarily implied powers has no application to the provinces, which have not the benefit of the words, \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act.\u201d Your Lordships will remember that it has been held in various cases where Dominion legislation was concerned that where there is a subject expressly given to the Dominion, like railways, powers properly incidental to that subject are also given; that doctrine has no application to any of the subheads of section 92. If I am right about that, then you get a narrower construction of \u201csolemnization,\u201d and any power claimed must be found expressly within these words, not by reading in implied powers such as are read in under the sub-heads of section 91 because section 92 has not the language, \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act.\u201d This must be so, a fortiori, in this case where the entire remainder of the subject is assigned to the Dominion. In any case, I say that the whole history of the matter, as discussed above, shews that such a power is not necessarily implied.\nI contend, moreover, that the annulment of the contract of marriage is an infringement of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion over divorce. Attention has to be drawn to that. When you come to deal with the provincial authority how could a province declare, under the guise of solemnization of marriage, that a contract of marriage, which the Dominion has said may be made, is not a marriage at all.\nI follow that up by saying this: strictly speaking, annulment and divorce are different, the one meaning to declare a marriage void ab initio, the other to dissolve an existing marriage, but the word \u201cdivorce\u201d is here used apparently as meaning every means of getting rid of the marriage tie. And, even when a provincial court annuls the marriage, it does dissolve an existing de facto marriage, which would otherwise remain good and would become unassailable on the death of either party. You will find that running through it all. There is a very good definition in Murray\u2019s Dictionary of the meaning of the word \u201cdivorce it gives it the wider meaning. You cannot give a restricted meaning to the word \u201cdivorce\u201d because, as is to be inferred from what was said by the Lord Chancellor, whom I quoted this morning, the Dominion Parliament is given the most sweeping power, the absolute power on the subject of divorce, and, therefore, you have to give the widest meaning to the word \u201cdivorce.\u201d It results from the judgment of Lord Brougham which I read this morning that every conceivable legislative power is vested under the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d under these two words. The whole subject of divorce, in its widest possible aspect, is, therefore, in the Dominion, and would include both annulment and divorce for cause.\nThis is a point I want to drive home. If the marriage tie is declared to exist and the provinces declare it is non-existent, then they are stepping within the jurisdiction of the Dominion. The provinces cannot interpose and legislate upon the contract at all without having the effect of an annulment; they cannot interfere with the contract.\nTo declare that the marriage does or does not exist must come under the all-embracing word \u201cdivorce\u201d which covers the whole question of the validity of a marriage, de jure or de facto. I quote from Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, vol. II. sec. 786:\u2014 \u201cA suit to declare a marriage null is held to be within the term of divorce suit,\u201d etc. That is the meaning in which I say the word is used in the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d I refer to Murray\u2019s Dictionary, sec. V. \u201cDivorce,\u201d \u201cLegal dissolution of marriage by the courts * * * evidence accepted by the courts.\u201d It is in the first sense that it must be taken in this Act, because the Dominion is given the sole jurisdiction relating to the whole subject-matter of divorce and I submit that it must be given the widest possible meaning. I submit that it covers all three of the jurisdictions, vested by the English Act now in the divorce courts, whether it is separation from bed and board, a decree of nullity, or a regular divorce in the common strict meaning of the word.\nMr. Justice Idington.\u2014I cannot understand how we can escape any one of them under the statute and especially the first and third questions. The other question might have been left out until question No. 1 and question No. 3 were determined.\nMr. Nesbitt.\u2014Will your Lordships let me examine the language of the first section of the bill a little more closely? (The learned counsel reads the section.)\nTo bring it to a concrete case, the evil that was supposed to have arisen was a limitation of the express language of article 129 of the Civil Code, which stated that marriage might be performed \u2014 I am paraphrasing it \u2014 by any one of several officers; which, it was supposed, gave the right to any citizen, not falling within the prohibited decrees, to appear before these parties and have the ceremony performed. The bill pre-supposes the right of the province to declare that marriage shall be performed by certain officers, at certain hours, and so on, and the evidences that are to be observed about the marriage.\nThe bill hits squarely at article 127 C.C. in this, that it says, that no matter who is married before any person, when the provincial law declares to be the proper officer to marry, if they comply with all the provisions of the provincial law, then notwithstanding any difference in their religious faith, that contract shall be good.\nIf your Lordships answer question 2 in the affirmative, as I said to your Lordships early in the discussion, in all probability that will be the end of the whole matter because there will be nothing more to discuss. Now, my Lords, if the provinces have no power to nullify, the Dominion must have the power to confirm. Apart from the question of power to nullify the contract, the Dominion has admittedly exclusive jurisdiction over the capacity of the parties. Differentiation between persons of different religions as to the manner of solemnization affects their capacity and is beyond provincial powers.\nThe real object of question 3 seems to be to ascertain whether or not, if the bill referred does not accomplish the desired object, it can be accomplished by some other legislation. If the contention as to the first question be correct, then plainly it stands, so that the two questions run into one another so far as the argument is concerned. Or, if the distinction between the contract and its solemnization be incorrect, the Dominion can still pass the legislation under (1) power over divorce, (2) power to define marriage.\nI submit, therefore, that question 3 must be answered in the affirmative because, even if the bill referred does not accomplish the alteration of that law, it could be done by the Dominion by a proper enactment.\nI desire only to add, my Lords, a few words in reference to the meaning that is to be given to the word \u201cmarriage\u201d in section 91. My submission is, that as it is used in conjunction with the words \u201cand divorce\u201d the same wide meaning that is given to the word \u201cmarriage\u201d must necessarily be given to the word \u201cdivorce\u201d subject to the qualification that nothing is carved out of divorce while the solemnization of the marriage tie is carved out of the word \u201cmarriage.\u201d\nNow, in reference to one or two observations, which fell from the court, as to the doctrine of civil rights. Just as in the case of banks and banking, just as with railways, and so forth, whenever the doctrine of civil rights has impinged upon the wide jurisdiction given to the Dominion Parliament in section 91 \u201ccivil rights\u201d has had to give way.\nYou have the whole subject of marriage, you have that whole field of legislation given expressly to the Dominion, and over-riding civil rights or anything that may interfere with it. All that is incidental, all that is ancillary to it, all that is impliedly necessary to create the tie of marriage, is vested in the federal jurisdiction, subject only to whatever may be said to be carved out of it in the solemnization or evidence of that marriage which is vested in the provinces, and nothing else. Therefore, if I have been understood in the argument this morning, to admit that the provinces, under the doctrine of civil rights, can take away from any legislation which the Dominion may see fit to pass in this respect, I have been misunderstood. If the doctrine of civil rights impinges upon whatever is impliedly necessary in the opinion of the Federal Parliament fully to carry out the object of their legislation relative to marriage, then the doctrine of civil rights must give way.\nLafleur K.C.\u2014May it please your Lordships, I intend to ask your Lordships\u2019 attention to the second question on this reference which is:\u2014\n\u201c2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province,\n\u201c(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or\n\u201c(b) between persons one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic?\u201d\nI do not know whether I should preface my remarks by pointing out to your Lordships the utility of answering this question. I understand my learned friends on the other side no longer contest that you have the power and the duty, subject to the exercise of your proper discretion, to answer question No. 2, but they do submit that you should exercise your discretion or decline to answer that question in its present form, because they say \u2014 at least I understand they are going to say \u2014 it may affect the rights of private parties. It is just as important for Parliament in the exercise of its right of legislation to know what the law of the province is upon this subject as it is that it should know the extent of the field of legislation that is open to it. Parliament in legislating upon the subject of marriage will necessarily inquire, first, as to the ambit of its own powers, and in the second place as to what grievances, if any, exist, which it is proposed to redress by the promoters of the bill. Now, it is of the first importance, therefore \u2014 when you get over the first difficulty, when you ascertain that Parliament has legislative authority over the subject-matter \u2014 to ascertain whether the law of the province is in such a condition as in the opinion of Parliament requires redress or relief. As my learned friend, Mr. Nesbitt, put it this morning, if this question is answered in our sense, if it is held that these marriages are valid and binding, then cadit quaestio. Therefore, it seems to me, it is just as important for Parliament to know what the law of the Province of Quebec is on that subject as it is for Parliament to know the extent of its own powers to legislate over the subject-matter.\nAs to interference with the rights of private parties who may not be represented here, I suppose that is an objection that may be made to almost any sort of reference of this kind. It is impossible for your Lordships to decide any general question of this nature without in some way affecting private rights, but not judicially affecting them, because your pronouncements upon this, as upon all other matters referred to you in the same way, are merely opinions. Your functions are advisory, and, therefore, you do not preclude the parties \u2014 although, of course, it would be absurd for me to contend that your opinions would not be regarded by the courts as important on the subject. I think your Lordships have even said that you would not be bound by your own opinion given on a reference.\nIt is a little bit perplexing to know what view is ultimately going to be taken on the subject. Take, for example, the \u201cInsurance Reference\u201d which was before your Lordships for adjudication; that was referred by the Government in consequence of a judicial decision in the Province of Quebec upon a prosecution under the \u201cFederal Insurance Act.\u201d If your Lordships are to hold that because there is a pending case you should not answer a question then the \u201cInsurance Reference\u201d should not be heard at all. And, in the present instance, if because there is a case pending in court, that of H\u00e9bert[16], in which the second question on this reference is to be decided, your Lordships do not give an opinion on that question, then, of course, I do not know how far it would be useful for me to go on with the argument. I do not know whether your Lordships intend to decide that before hearing us on question 2, but I submit that it is almost impossible to answer upon any reference at all without the possibility of your affecting private rights prejudicially or otherwise. I submit that the last amendment to the statute requires the court to answer the question.\nI think I have said all I need say for the present upon the discretion which your Lordships should exercise. It seems to me that on a large question of this kind it is of vast importance to the people throughout the whole. Dominion that an answer should be elicited in this inquiry. It is quite obvious that any number of marriages may be affected in the same way as this H\u00e9bert marriage, and the fact that this case has come before the courts does not mean that there are not dozens, and perhaps hundreds, of cases in which the status of the parties if not attacked today may be attacked next year, or ten years hence. It is impossible to consider any question of this kind without necessarily affecting private rights.\nThe question which is submitted to your Lordships depends, in my humble opinion, upon the construction of a number of articles of the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec. I should like to say at the outset that, while I anticipate a very elaborate historical argument will be made by my learned friend Mr. Mignault on the other side, and I understand he relies upon the judgment of Sir Louis Jett\u00e9 in Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[17], which was based on what I may call the historical argument, it seems to me that all that is entirely beside the question. The question of the law as it stood before the Code it is not necessary for us to consider, because, in my humble opinion, the Code is perfectly clear upon the subject. I need hardly do more than refer to a couple of cases which are well known to your Lordships where the principle of construction was clearly laid down in such cases. There is the case of the Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[18], at page 144, in which Lord Herschell, speaking of the very elaborate argument which had been presented as to the state of the law before the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d said:\u2014\n\u201cI think the proper course is in the first instance to examine the language of the statute and to ask what is its natural meaning, uninfluenced by any consideration derived from the previous state of the law, and not to start with enquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the words of the enactment will bear an interpretation in conformity with this view.\nIf the statute, intended to embody in the Code a particular branch of the law, is to be proved in this fashion, it appears to me that its utility will be almost entirely destroyed and the very object with which it was enacted will be frustrated.\u201d\nHe goes on to say that he is far from saying that resort may never be had to the previous state of the law, but that, on the contrary, it is justifiable to refer to it when the provisions of the actual law are of doubtful import or when words are used which had previously acquired some technical meaning. But in this case that seems to me immaterial because we have an enactment which, in my opinion, is clear and free from any ambiguity, and if that is so any examination of the anterior state of the law is only misleading.\nIt seems to me that article 129 of the Civil Code has stated the law so clearly that no possible reference to the previous state of the law is useful or necessary. Let me first read article 128, which says that marriage must be solemnized openly by a competent officer recognized by law, and also article 129.\nArticle 128 says:\u2014\n\u201c128. Marriage must be solemnized openly by a competent officer recognized by law.\n\u201c129. All priests, rectors, ministers, and other officers, authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, are competent to solemnize marriage.\n\u201cBut none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion and the discipline of the church to which he belongs.\u201d Wherein is there any ambiguity in the first paragraph of that article? The language is perfectly general. The authority to celebrate marriage is conferred upon rectors, ministers, and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, and they are the persons who are competent to solemnize marriage. Is not the only thing to be ascertained, who are the persons who are authorized to keep registers of civil status, in order to answer the question who are competent persons to celebrate marriage. Is there any indication at all that the functions of these officers of civil status are to be in any way restricted? Is it not obvious, on the contrary, that the second paragraph of that article, which says they are not compellable, shews that they may receive applications from all kinds of people, belonging to all kinds of faiths, and that this provision was made for the protection and ease of their own conscience. But, does not that imply the idea that they are not exclusively concerned with marriages of their own parishioners, and that their authority and jurisdiction is general. Otherwise, what would be the use of making them non-compellable? If their functions were restricted to their own flocks, if, as is contended, the priest or the minister has to marry those of his own congregation, and if article 127 C.C. makes the rules of that religious community binding upon the members of that community, then it would be no use saying that the minister or priest is not compellable, because, manifestly, he could not be compelled to celebrate what would be an invalid marriage between persons who would be governed by the rule of their own church, which would be his church. Does not the second part of that article, on its face, shew that the jurisdiction of these officers of civil status was general and not restricted?\nAnother thing to which I would like to call your Lordships\u2019 attention is that the article does not contemplate that this jurisdiction or that these functions shall be exercised solely by ministers of religion. It says, all priests, rectors, ministers, and other officers authorized by law to keep registers; it contemplates the possibility of other persons than priests or ministers being authorized by statute to keep registers.\nThere is one provision in the Code in regard to the keeping of acts of religious profession, articles 70 et seq. of the Code, In every religious community in which profession is made by solemn and perpetual vows, registers are kept, and my adversaries argue from that that it is not every one who can keep registers of civil status who are competent to celebrate marriage. But, manifestly, what article 129 means is that these persons can celebrate marriage, who are authorized to keep registers of civil status generally, not merely persons who may be authorized to keep registers of deaths or of religious profession. It means those who have the general power to keep registers of civil status\u2014that is, as to all acts of civil status\u2014and these persons are competent to celebrate marriage. And, if the Province of Quebec to-day empowers an individual, not a clergyman, to keep registers of civil status, that person is a competent person for the celebration of marriage. Whatever may be the case as to births and deaths, as to marriage the Code expressly provides that a person, other than an officer of civil status in the domicile of the party, can be the celebrant. Take article 63:\u2014 \u201c63. The marriage is solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties. If solemnized elsewhere, the person officiating is obliged to verify and ascertain the identity of the parties.\u201d\nIs not that plainly saying that the person solemnizing or celebrating the marriage need not be the functionary to officiate in the parish or domicile of these parties? The only obligation imposed on an outsider who celebrates a marriage is the verification of the identity of the parties, and, of course, all these solemnities are provided in order to prevent clandestinity. The banns themselves are simply protection taken to enable the officiating clergyman to ascertain that there are no impediments. The whole object of this provision is to prevent clandestinity, but the jurisdiction is manifestly not restricted to the officer who is in the place inhabited by the parties; either by one of the parties or by both, because an outsider may marry them, although he must make sure that there are no impediments existing. As your Lordships will see, if he does not publish, the banns, he must see that the banns have been published elsewhere. It is even provided that, when the parties have not been for a certain period in the jurisdiction, the officer must ascertain whether the banns have been published in the foreign jurisdiction, and if they have not, then he must assure himself of the non-existence of any impediment. Articles 131 and 132 deal with that:\u2014\n\u201c131. If the actual domicile of the parties to be married has not been established by a residence of six months at least, the publications must also be made at the place of their last domicile in Lower Canada.\n\u201c132. If their last domicile be out of Lower Canada and the publications have not been made there, the officer who solemnizes the marriage is bound to ascertain that there is no legal impediment between the parties.\u201d\nIn the case of dissenting Protestant congregations the banns are published by the minister who performs the marriage, and he may or may not be the minister who is the minister of the parties. They have never regarded the jurisdiction as being restricted and they have never considered that there was any incompetency on the part of any of the functionaries who are created by article 129 of the Code. Therefore, that question has not arisen in the case of marriages of Protestants. I may add that it has never arisen in the case of a marriage between a Protestant and a Catholic. No doubt has ever been cast, so far as I know, in any judicial proceeding upon the validity of marriages between Protestants and Catholics, whether celebrated\u201d by a priest of the Roman Catholic faith or by a Protestant minister. I do not think any suggestion has been made of the invalidity of these marriages. Now, if you take the wording of article 129, what reason is there for making any restriction in the case of one of these functionaries and not in the case of the other one? And if you say that each of these is subject to the same restriction \u2014 because that cannot depend upon the practice of the different congregations; it cannot depend upon what they are in the habit of doing or of the opinion they have as to the law of the land \u2014 if there are any restrictions as to the jurisdiction of any one of these, they must be derived from law. I submit that you cannot say there are restrictions as to some of these functionaries which do not exist as to the others. If you were to restrict the power of these officers of civil status to the persons who are in their congregation under their spiritual charge, where would any authority be given to any one to marry non-Christians or the numerous immigrants who come to our shores and settle in our cities, and who are not organized into congregations? If that interpretation were, given to it, then these people would be absolutely without any provision for their lawful marriage. You cannot say that a Protestant minister has any greater authority to celebrate such a marriage than a Roman Catholic priest has. If you once get beyond the flock or the congregation of the clergyman or the priest, then where are you going to stop with the jurisdiction. You cannot stop, there is no halting place at all, unless you consider that by a previous article (127) there exists an impediment in the case of people professing the Roman Catholic faith. I will contend later on that there is no such impediment, that such an impediment would not import nullity in any event, and that it is a misapplication of article 127 to say that it could have any influence at all upon the competency of the public officers who are created by article 129.\nBefore I leave the construction of article 129, I desire to ask your Lordships\u2019 attention to an argument that is advanced by my adversaries in their factum. I am considering now article 129 per se without any assistance from article 127. In their factum, my learned adversaries say that article 129 is far from clear and that it is subject to notable limitations, and they say, in the first place, that under article 70, which I have mentioned a moment ago, certain religious communities are authorized to keep registers of civil status, and yet these communities are not authorized to celebrate marriage. I point out that these communities are not authorized to keep registers of civil status; they are authorized to keep a certain kind of register of a certain kind of religious status; that is, solemn and perpetual vows taken in their community. But, that is not authority to keep registers of civil status, and so I contend that does not qualify the article at all.\nThen my adversaries say that another important limitation of article 129 will, be admitted. They say: \u201cAnother most important limitation of article 129 will also be admitted. Are priests, rectors and ministers competent to solemnize marriage whether they are authorized or not to keep registers of civil status, a construction which the general terms, if construed literally, of article 129 would justify, or can marriage be solemnized only by such priests, rectors, or ministers who are authorized to keep registers of acts of civil status.\u201d\nI do not think you can give that restriction to the article. Do the words \u201cauthorized to keep registers of civil status\u201d apply to the priests, rectors and so forth, or only to the other officers? It does not matter from my point, whether you adopt one construction or the other. There is a curious article of the Code, which is referred to by my learned adversaries in their factum, and that is article 53(b), which would seem to imply that there may be persons \u2014 although I have never seen them and I do not know who they are \u2014 who, without keeping registers of civil status may celebrate marriages. The article says:\u2014\n\u201c53. (b) Every person authorized to celebrate marriages, or to preside at burials, who is not authorized to keep registers of civil status, shall immediately prepare, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code, an act of every marriage which he celebrates, etc.\u201d My learned friend. Mr. Mignault, thinks this was intended for a congregation of Jews in Quebec. I have not been able to discover what that particular congregation was that this article is intended to assist, but it is a peculiar disposition of the law.\n23 Vict. ch. 11 refers to Quakers, and it requires them to keep registers. I do not think 53 (b) can refer to the Quakers, because before that article was passed this legislation as to Quakers was in force and they had the necessary authority and duty of keeping registers of civil status.\nIt may well be that the proper construction of article 129 is that priests and rectors and ministers, even if they do not keep registers of civil status, may celebrate marriage, and that, in addition, other officers who are authorized by law to keep registers of civil status may also celebrate marriage. That is not, however, what I should think to be the natural construction of that article. I should have said \u2014 independently of the provisions of article 53(b) and whatever provisions may be made for the unorganized districts \u2014 that this article meant on the face of it that priests, rectors, and other officers, all of whom are authorized to keep registers of civil status, are competent to celebrate marriage. I think that is the plain meaning of that article. Article 53(b) I cannot explain in any way.\nThat statute is authority to keep registers of civil status, and it is conferred upon a person because he has a congregation, and it is within the discretion of the legislature to give to some congregations or the heads of some congregations the right to keep registers of civil status. That all points to the construction of the article, as I have been reading it, that it is only those persons who keep registers of civil status who can celebrate marriage. Sometimes the authority is to individuals by name and sometimes it is the head of the congregation. They are statutes to afford relief to certain religious congregations. I shall deal with that when I am giving the history of the law, and I intend to notice it although I submit it is not necessary for the construction of the article. Still, I cannot neglect it, because my learned friends base an argument upon it. You will see that by these statutes which preceded the Code (with, I think, one or two exceptions), they did not in terms confer authority to celebrate marriage, but simply authority to keep registers of civil status.\nMy contention is that the civil law has nothing to do with the internal government of these religious communities. The civil law creates these persons officers to register acts of civil status. It is often said that we have no civil marriage in this country. What I understand by civil marriage, in the sense in which it is ordinarily used, is that the officiating person is not a clergyman or a priest, but is a public functionary like a mayor, or a registrar, or a justice of the peace, but the religious character of the person who registers the act of civil status does not change the character of the act. It is a civil act altogether; it is an act of the representative of the State, who, by the authority of the State, gives authenticity to his records. But, whatever may be the religious character of these officers of, civil status, when they are officiating as officers of civil status they are not acting in a religious capacity at all. They may accompany their celebration of marriage with any religious ceremony they may choose, but they are still pro hac vice purely officers of civil status. That is my argument as to the jurisdiction and authority conferred on these persons by article 129. I submit there is nothing there which suggests the idea that they must necessarily be of clerical character. What is the meaning of these words, \u201cand other officers authorized to keep registers\u201d? The only requirement is that they be authorized to keep registers, and it is quite competent for the State to empower by proper authority a justice of the peace, or a registrar, or anyone else of similar character, to keep these registers of civil status and to celebrate marriage.\nAnother limitation which is referred to by my learned friends is one which I have noticed already. They say that another limitation is that the priests, rectors, and ministers can only solemnize marriages in the place where they are authorized to keep registers of civil status. I submit that is not so. You have article 63, which clearly shews that the celebration may be made by a clergyman who is not at the domicile of the parties.\nThey say:\u2014\n\u201cBy article 63, under the general rule, marriage is solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties. This rule is no less a general rule, because the article asks that, if the marriage be solemnized elsewhere, the person officiating is obliged to verify and ascertain the identity of the parties, so that the latter provision can only refer to exceptional cases, such as those of vagrants or of persons domiciled outside of the province; otherwise, it would have been useless to say that the marriage was solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties. Therefore, since the general rule requires the solemnization of the marriage at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties, it follows that priests, rectors, and ministers, authorized to keep elsewhere registers of acts of civil status, are not competent to solemnize the marriage, either at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties, for they are not there authorized to keep registers of civil status, nor in the place where they do keep these registers, for the parties are not there domiciled.\u201d\nIt is the general rule, but not the invariable rule, that marriage shall take place at the domicile. The cause of an exception may be the desire of the parties to be married elsewhere as often happens. There is nothing which prevents them from exercising their liberty in that regard. The law has laid down the rule as to publication of banns and formalities and the assumption is that the general rule is that the domicile of the bride is generally the place where the marriage is celebrated. But it has also provided for a case where the parties do not choose to follow the general rule, and it says then what it is incumbent on the officiating clergyman to do in order to prevent clandestinity.\nThe publication of banns is an entirely different thing; the publication is made in their own church or else the parties get a license; they get a license if they wish to exercise their freedom to be married before some person they select. The minister gets the license of the Lieutenant-Governor to celebrate that marriage and the license is granted on proper security shewing there is no impediment. In the Catholic Church, they may be dispensed by the bishop from publishing the banns. The license does not apply to the parties, it applies to the officiating minister and he can get a license from the Lieutenant- Governor, and when the parties present him with one he is licensed upon receiving that document to celebrate the marriage between the two people. The license is to the minister, not to the parties. There is no such thing as licensing the parties. It dispenses with the publication of the banns by the officiating clergyman, whoever he may be, but there is no restriction as to the clergyman who may celebrate the marriage, provided he has a license. The only difference is that with regard to Catholic priests they cannot get a license, they have to get a dispensation from their ecclesiastical head, and as to Protestant ministers they must get a license, but there is no permission given to the parties, it is to the functionary of the State to dispense with certain formalities which would otherwise be required.\nThere is another objection which is made by my learned adversaries. They say that our interpretation of article 129 cannot be sustained because the Code of Procedure, in articles 1107 et seq., provides for an opposition to marriage and requires that the opposition should be served upon the functionary called upon to solemnize the marriage. They say, further, that article 61 of the Civil Code requires that the disallowance of the opposition be notified to the officer charged with the solemnization of the marriage. They ask if it is contemplated that the opposition to a marriage should be served on perhaps two or three hundred clergymen in Montreal, for example, in order to prevent a marriage from taking place. My submission is that the expression \u201ccalled upon to celebrate a marriage,\u201d or, \u201ccharged with the celebration of a marriage\u201d means a clergyman or a priest who is selected by the parties to celebrate a marriage. It does not mean an officer who is competent, because there may be more than one. Even on their own theory there must be two, if the parties reside in different parishes. And, in the case of Protestants where there is no such thing as an impediment on the ground of clandestinity, and when they may select any one of two or three hundred persons to cement the union, they say it would be impossible that all these functionaries could be served with the opposition or notified of the difficulties that existed. What the article means by \u201ccharged with the celebration of a marriage\u201d or \u201ccalled upon to celebrate a marriage\u201d is the clergyman who is selected by the parties to celebrate their marriage, and there must be only one, and that one is the one who is to receive the opposition.\nNow then, my Lords, another objection which is made is that, in the Province of Quebec, marriage is essentially a religious ceremony. They say there is no such a thing in the Province of Quebec as a civil marriage, as the term is generally understood, and as they say would result from the wide construction sought to be placed on article 129.\nNow, is it true that in the Province of Quebec marriage is essentially a religious ceremony? A religious ceremony, in connection with a mixed marriage, for example. I have always understood there was no religious ceremony performed there but that the priest merely acted as a witness and that there was no ceremony at all. There cannot be any religious ceremony, when non-believers or Mahommedans, or Hindus, are married in the Province of Quebec; there is no religious ceremony in their case. There is an authentication of their marriage by the priest or officer of civil status, but it is wrong. I submit, to say that a Quebec marriage is necessarily and essentially a religious ceremony. It generally is accompanied, no doubt, by a religious ceremony, but my submission is that the only part of the ceremony which concerns the law is the authentication of that marriage by the officer of civil status who generally happens to be, who always happens to be now, a clergyman of some church. But, in exercising this function, he is exercising purely a civil function. I would submit that the creation of the officers of civil status to celebrate marriages is merely the exercise of authority by the State to enable these officers of civil status to exercise a purely civil function. The fact that they happen to be ministers of religion in addition to that does not alter the case at all. The words \u201ccelebration of marriage\u201d found in our law are used by the European codes where the only legal marriage is celebrated before a public officer, who is not a priest or a minister of religion. You go before the mayor and he celebrates a marriage. The parties afterwards, if they so desire, may repair to their own church and get what is called the nuptial benediction, but that is entirely distinct from the ceremony of marriage. The ceremony of marriage is celebrated by a public officer, and I say that here you have both done by the same officer.\nThen, of course, all the decrees recognized the possibility of a valid marriage where a priest could not be obtained, so that it is not essential that there should be a ceremony. There may be, resulting from the religious belief of the parties, a ceremony in their sense of the word, but so far as the law is concerned there is no ceremony. There is nothing there but the consent of the parties and their agreeing to be husband and wife, before a person, who is recognized by the law, as capable of exercising that function. All these decrees provide that, while it is desirable that a priest should celebrate the marriages of Catholics, it is not absolutely essential, because if a priest cannot be procured that does not prevent the celebration of a valid marriage. I, therefore, submit that you cannot say that, a \u201cceremony\u201d is of the essence of a marriage. It is imposed upon the parties as a religious duty in most churches, but that is a religious obligation only, it is not one which is required by the law of the country. In the last decree, the Ne Temere decree itself, you will find that article VIII. says:\u2014\n\u201cVIII. Should it happen that in any district a parish priest, or the ordinary of the place, or a priest delegated by either of them, before whom marriage can be celebrated, is not to be had, and that this condition of affairs has lasted for a month, marriage may be validly and licitly entered upon by the formal declaration of consent of the contracting parties in the presence of two witnesses.\u201d\nIt is submitted in this connection that article 65 of the Code, which provides what is to be set forth in the act of marriage, does not in any way refer to the religious belief of the parties; but simply states the day on which the marriage was solemnized, the names, quality, occupation and domicile of the parties, and so forth; whether married after publication of banns, or dispensation, or license; whether it was with the consent of the parents, and whether there has been any opposition. That excludes the idea of anything but a purely civil ceremony, so far as the legality of the marriage is concerned. I will have occasion, in referring to the previous legislation, when I come to that part of the case, to shew your Lordships that in all the statutes which are enabling, or authorizing or relieving ministers of congregations there is no restrictive language of any kind, there is no limitation to their jurisdiction ever imposed by any of the previous statutes; they are generally authorized to keep registers of civil status, and whenever they are authorized to celebrate marriages, in a few cases in which express authorization is given to celebrate marriages, there is no restriction in any of the statutes which I have been able to find.\nThe Act of 1795 expressly authorized and required the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church \u2014 that is the construction put on the Act \u2014 to keep registers of civil status. The other denominations began to complain that they were not entitled to keep registers of civil status. The Church \u00f3f Scotland complained, and the Methodist Church complained, and the Baptist Church, and so on, and they all had extended to them the right which was given by the statute of 1795, to the Catholic Church and to the Anglican Church, of keeping registers of civil status. Now if it were so that the Jews could only celebrate marriages between Jews, and the Quakers between Quakers, and the Presbyterians between Presbyterians, and the Methodists between Methodists, then there would be no officer competent for the celebration of marriages between unbelievers, or Buddhists, or even the people of the Orthodox Greek Church, or in the case of these numerous immigrants who are coming to our shores every day. I do not think anybody has ever disputed the validity of the marriages of these persons. My learned friends on the other side would have to go to the length of arguing that there is no officer of civil status to celebrate the marriage of these people, if they restrict the power of each functionary to the members of his own congregation. There is no greater reason for doing that in one case more than in the other, apart from the provisions of article 127 which have been discussed, and apart from the two statutes which restrict the powers of the Quakers and of the Jews. If you are going to restrict any of these functionaries, you must restrict them all in the same way. There is no halting place, and you must come to the conclusion that a large proportion of our present population in the large cities is under the absolute disability or incapacity of getting lawfully married at all.\nNow, my Lords, I come to the consideration of article 127. It is contended, on the part of my adversaries (and it has been held in the cases which have been decided in accordance with that view) that whatever may be the jurisdiction of the functionaries enumerated in article 129 \u2014 other than those of the Roman Catholic religion, in the case of Catholics at least, by reason of article 127 \u2014there is an impediment which prevents Catholics from being validly married by any other than their parish priest or a priest delegated by the parish priest or by the bishop. I am dealing with the meaning of the word \u201cimpediment\u201d in article 127. May I point out incidentally, that, if it be true that what is called clandestinity is an impediment in the proper sense of the term, the bill can hardly be said to be ultra vires of the Parliament, because, in so far as impediments to marriage are concerned, the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament clearly extends to all matters of that kind. It extends on the subject of marriage, to the capacity to contract marriage, to the impediments to marriage, and to all that goes to constitute a valid marriage, except the solemnization. Now, if it is true that what is called clandestinity is an impediment in the proper sense of the term, then the object of the bill is really to affect and amend article 127, by declaring that no matter what the religion of the parties or of the officiating clergyman may be, that will not present the validity of a marriage, otherwise regular, under the provisions of the law of the province. Now, is it not clear that that bill has for its object the removal of that impediment and the modification of article 127 if that article creates any such impediment as is contended? I would submit that it does not create such an impediment, because I think it is a misuse of the word \u201cimpediment\u201d to apply it to the competency of the officer who is about to celebrate the marriage. It seems to me that the only proper meaning of the word impediment, and more particularly its meaning in article 127, must be an impediment of the same nature as those enumerated in the chapter. The whole chapter in which that article is found is called: \u201cOf the qualities and conditions necessary for contracting marriage.\u201d These are the qualities and conditions in the parties themselves, and the next chapter deals with the competency of the officer for the celebration of that marriage. I submit that it is a subversion of all correct ideas, to say that the incompetency of a civil officer constitutes an impediment to marriage. If it is an impediment to marriage in the sense of article 129, I do not see how my learned friends on the other side can escape from the conclusion that the bill is intra vires of Parliament because. Parliament can unquestionably repeal article 127. It can remove all these impediments, it can say what shall be the natural impediments to a marriage, and upon the theory that it is an impediment, called the impediment of clandestinity, then the object of that bill is to remove that impediment and it does accomplish that purpose if you consider clandestinity to be in the nature of an impediment. I do not want to elaborate this. I refer your Lordships to the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of Mr. Justice Charbonneau in H\u00e9bert v. Clou\u00e2tre[19], where your Lordships will find the whole subject discussed with great lucidity and force. I do not think I could add anything to what Mr. Justice Charbonneau says.\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Lar\u00e0m\u00e9e v. Evans[20] is one of the most interesting on the whole subject because it reproduces what may be called the historical argument, and I desire to say a word about that point without anticipating too much what may be advanced on that head by my adversaries. But I do understand the proposition as laid down by Mr. Justice Jette to be somewhat like this: He says at the time of the conquest there was in England an exclusive jurisdiction on behalf of the Anglican clergy, and there was in France the same exclusive jurisdiction on the part of the Roman Catholic priesthood, to celebrate marriage; they were each exclusive, they recognized no other authority for celebration of marriage. Now, at the time of the capitulation there was nothing said in the articles of capitulation which could affect that situation, nor indeed, I submit, is there anything in the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d of 1774 or in the \u201cConstitutional Act\u201d of 1791, and it was not until the statutes began to be passed with reference to the keeping of registers of civil status that we find the subject is dealt with at all, and Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 puts this question \u2014 he says: \u201cWhat was the effect of the conquest upon this state of things?\u201d he says you had a jurisdiction claimed by the Anglican clergymen on the one hand and an exclusive jurisdiction claimed by the Roman Catholic clergy on the other, and his presumption is that by the very force of things each claimed exclusive jurisdiction as to its own congregation. Now I am quite unable to follow that line of argument. It may be the fault of my logic, but it seems to me that if there was going to be any result produced by the juxtaposition of these two conflicting powers it would mean that they would have concurrent powers as to the celebration of all marriages, or else there came about the predominance of one over the other. If we take the view of Chief Justice Sewell in the case of Ex parte Spratt[21] that this was a function of the State which came from the Crown, we can hardly escape the conclusion that the right to celebrate marriages and to give authenticity to registers derived from the Crown became vested in the clergy of the conquering nation at the time of cession. We find this opinion expressed by him in this case of Ex parte Spratt(1) at page 95.\nIt was held in that case that a dissenter was not included in the terms of the Act of 1795 and it was further held that the exercise of this office depended upon the Crown. If that is good law \u2014 and the authorities he cited are very strong on that point \u2014 then the effect of the conquest was to confer to the Anglican Church the sole authority for the celebration of marriages. It is clearly suggested, and even held expressly in that case, that the source of authority must be from the Crown. However, what I am submitting is that the deduction drawn by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[22] is not a proper deduction if you consider the legal effect of the conquest. I submit that as a matter of logic and inference you cannot come to the conclusion that Mr. Justice Jette does, that each church preserves its rights and functions and jurisdiction but only within its own sphere., If you admitted they were both exclusive of everything else, how could you come to the conclusion that they were restricted to their own parish or their own flock after the conquest? I cannot follow that reasoning at all. Therefore, my submission is that that historical argument does not advance you one bit.\nThe Anglican parochial organization was established almost immediately after the treaty.\nIn 1795, shortly after the conquest, an Act was passed for the keeping of registers of civil status by ministers of that church. The curious thing is that these marriages were not confined to the Roman Catholic church nor to the Anglican church for we find that justices of the peace were celebrating marriages then, and without the slightest apparent authority. I have never been able to find authority for the celebration of marriages by justices of the peace at that time, or since for that matter. I am told, I do not know that it is true, that the United Empire Loyalists who came back to this country after a sojourn of some length in the United States had got accustomed to marriages before justices of the peace and that they imagined, wrongly imagined I should think, that our justices of the peace had the same power and jurisdiction and that that accounted for the celebration of these marriages by justices of the peace.\nThe Act 44 Geo. III. ch. 2 provided that all marriages solemnized since the 30th of September, 1779, by any minister of the Church of Scotland or by any person reputed to be a minister of the Church of Scotland, or by any Protestant dissenting minister, or by any person reputed to be a Protestant dissenting minister, or by any justice of the peace, shall be held to be valid in law, and 1 Geo. IV. ch. 19 validated similar marriages in Gasp\u00e9.\nMy Lords, the only additional reference I desire to make to the law before the Code is to two or three of the statutes relating to marriages celebrated by dissenters.\nMy submission is that these statutes, which conferred the power to keep registers of civil status, by necessary implication confer the power to marry. None of these persons who were permitted to keep registers of civil status were authorized to celebrate marriages but these Acts have always been construed as authority to celebrate marriages in consequence of their being authorized to keep marriage registers.\nThere seems to be nothing before the Code which directly conferred competence on officers of civil status to celebrate marriages, with one exception. I may be wrong as to that, and perhaps my learned friends have discovered some other statute, but I have only discovered one and that is the one referring to the ministers of the Church of Scotland. It uses language different from the language of the other statutes which merely authorized the keeping of registers of civil status and it is the only instance I find as to the dissenting ministers.\nThis is the authority that is given:\u2014\n\u201cBe it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all marriages which have heretofore been or shall hereafter be celebrated by ministers or clergymen of, or in communion with the Church of Scotland, have been and shall be held to be legal and valid to all intents and purposes whatsoever, anything in the said Acts or in any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding\u201d[23].\nThe inference from that is that it was taken for granted that the Anglicans and the Catholics could celebrate marriages, and it seems to have been taken for granted also that justices of the peace could celebrate marriages. It does not shew that there was any lawful authority for doing that but it shews that that was the state of the practice. Now, it is quite possible that in so far as the celebration of marriage by the priest or by an Anglican clergyman is concerned it resulted necessarily from the effect of the cession. That is quite possible, but what I say is that there is no legislative authority at any time given to them, before the Code, either to Anglicans or to Roman Catholic priests. At all events I cannot find any, although, perhaps, my learned friends may have discovered something that has escaped my notice. This is the only statute which, before the Code, appears to confer power to celebrate marriage.\nIt has been suggested that the \u201cHardwicke Act\u201d was introduced into Canada and persisted in notwithstanding the \u201cQuebec Act.\u201d It seems to me that, so far as the law of marriage was concerned, the introduction of the French law \u2014 the law of Canada, \u2014 by the terms of the cession and the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d would pro tanto repeal any provisions of \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act\u201d that were applicable otherwise to the colonies. Your Lordships will remember that the free exercise of the Catholic religion was always subject to the King\u2019s supremacy. You have to read all these things together. It makes up a very perplexing situation and all I can say is that the inhabitants of Lower Canada at the time took it for granted that the Anglican clergymen could celebrate marriages and that portions of the Catholic clergy could celebrate marriages, and they even seemed to believe that justices of the peace could do the same. That being the case, the first Act that was passed relating to marriages of Catholics and Protestants was the Act of 1795.\nAs to the common law right of justices to celebrate marriages, how could it persist, and how could the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace continue after the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d which introduced the law of France into the Province of Quebec. The only limitation I would suggest would be this: That if you regard the authority to celebrate marriages as Chief Justice Sewell regarded it, as a function which derives its authority from the State, then, of course, the effect of the cession would be to abolish all the authorities that emanated from the French Government, and the source of all authority in that respect would then be in the King of England, and that would require new commissions, new instructions, and new authorities. I have always thought that this Act of 1795 was intended to confer the power to celebrate marriage because it is impliedly contained in the power to keep registers of marriages and to enter therein all marriages celebrated by the clergymen. If that is not so, how could you construe the subsequent legislation in regard to the dissenters, which, with the single exception of the one relating to the clergy of the Church of Scotland, did not confer power to celebrate marriages at all but simply conferred power to keep registers, and put them all under the general Act of 1795. Is it not clear that the meaning of the legislature at that time must have been to confer upon those dissenters (who certainly did not have any power to celebrate marriages by any tradition or any antecedent authority) the power to celebrate marriages by giving them the authority to keep registers of civil status? That would be my construction of that statute, or otherwise you would have to come to the conclusion that, until the Code, all these dissenters for whom all this special legislation was passed really could not celebrate marriage at all; they could keep registers, but they must have some other authority outside the statutes to celebrate marriages, That seems to be inconceivable and it seems to me we must construe that legislation as by necessary implication conferring the power to marry.\nI wish to refer to two more statutes which are mentioned by my learned friends on the other side. One of them, 9 & 10 Geo. IV. ch. 75 (L.C.), relates to the Jews. My learned friends were not quite right in their statement about this, because, while it is true there is a restriction, it does not appear to me, under the words of the Act, to be a restriction as to their power to celebrate marriage. The Act, (sec. 7,) says: Every Jewish minister is to keep \u201ca register in duplicate of all marriages and burials performed by him, and of all births which he may be required to record in such register by any person professing the Jewish religion.\u201d It is manifest that the Jews did not celebrate baptism, but they did celebrate marriages and they did officiate at burials, and their power does not seem to be restricted as to marriage or as to burials. But it is restricted as to the case of births which are presented to them to be recorded. I do not know whether that was really the intention of the legislation, possibly they expressed themselves badly, because I do know that in England the acts relating to Jews restricted their power to marriages within their own congregation. I say that this Act has not, in terms done it. The only other statute of this kind to which I will refer, is that respecting the Quakers, 23 Vict. ch. 11 (Can.). The restriction in this Act is not quite so extensive as my learned friends on the other side contend, but it does say:\u2014 \u201c1. All marriages heretofore solemnized in Lower Canada according to the rites, usages and customs of the Religious Society of Friends, commonly called Quakers, and all marriages hereafter to be solemnized in Lower Canada, between persons professing the Faith of the said Religious Society of Friends, commonly called Quakers, or of whom one may belong to that denomination, shall be held, and are hereby declared to be valid to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\u201d I say this special legislation was due to the fact that the Quakers did not appear to have any ministers over their congregation. They are a society who are very much impressed with the personal equality of all members of the congregation, and they refuse to elect or to recognize any one at their head, and consequently it was in the nature of things that a separate legislative provision should be made for the Society of Friends. With these exceptions, and to the extent of these exceptions, all the legislation appears to be directed to authorizing dissenting congregations to keep registers of civil status, but never in terms, except in the one case of the Church of Scotland, authorizing them to marry.\nThere is just one other observation I wish to make before I leave this part of my subject, and that is that it is a very doubtful question whether article 127, if it be relied on, creates a nullity of marriages celebrated in contraversion of the terms of that article. It may be \u2014and I suggest this is a very reasonable construction of the language of that article\u2014that, while it recognizes the religious impediments established in the different communities of Christians, it merely leaves the contravening parties to the penalties which may be imposed by their respective churches. The article simply says that the other impediments recognized according to the different religious persuasions, as resulting from relationship or affinity or from other causes, remains subject to the rules hitherto followed in the different churches and religious communities; the right likewise to grant dispensation from such impediments, appertains, as heretofore, to those who had hitherto enjoyed them. If you compare that article with article 152 which enumerates the nullities resulting from a; violation of the articles of the Code, you will find that any marriage contracted in contravention of articles 124, 125, 126, may be contested either by the parties themselves or by any of those having an interest therein. But, nowhere in the Code is it said that a marriage celebrated in contravention of article 127 of the Code can be set aside. No nullity is pronounced by the Code as to that, and you cannot inter it from the language of 127 which simply says that the impediments recognized in the different religious communities remain subject to the rules which have hitherto prevailed. Nowhere do you find any article in the Code annulling such marriages. If that be the case, then all the force of the argument derived from the application of article 127, as establishing an impediment to clandestinity, disappears. That is a part of the argument, which I have already had the honour to submit, that it is not an impediment within the meaning of article 127.\nNow, my Lords, I pass on to the second branch of the question which I shall deal with very briefly, because a great deal of what has been said on sub-question (a) applies to sub-question (b) necessarily, these two overlap.\nNow, this question says:\u2014\n\u201c2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void, unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province;\n\u201c(b) between two persons, one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic.\u201d\nMy submission is briefly this: by the terms of article 129 all priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized; by law to keep registers of civil status are competent to solemnize marriage. The construction which is put on this article by my adversaries is that the jurisdiction of each of these enumerated officers of civil status is restricted to a certain class of persons. As I understand them, they contend that a Roman Catholic priest is authorized to celebrate marriages between Roman Catholics, and that Protestant ministers are authorized to celebrate marriages between Protestants, and that that results from the cession and from the delimitation of powers which necessarily resulted. I understand that to be the contention of my adversaries. It is the theory which is propounded by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[24]. He says that at the time of the cession there were these two mutually exclusive jurisdictions and that the result of their juxtaposition, without any legislation at all on the subject was necessarily to render them competent each within its own sphere.\nThe question is: what is the limit of the jurisdiction of these functionaries; and is there any limitation? Of course, if you impose limitation in one case, there is no reason for not imposing it in the other. How could you say that, in the case of all these enabling acts, these various persons who are authorized to keep registers of civil status, and in the case of ministers of the Church of Scotland, who are authorized to celebrate marriages \u2014 how could you say there is any restriction? The Act giving power to the ministers of the Church of Scotland says that all marriages celebrated by them shall be valid hereafter. That is not qualified by any restriction of any kind. It is not to be supposed that the ministers of the Church of Scotland were given any authority less than that which was vested in the clergymen of the Anglican Church; it could not have been supposed that greater authority was given to them. My submission is, that there is no restriction, but my friends on the other side say there is some necessary restriction upon all these functionaries to celebrate marriage within their own parishes and among persons of their own flock. They do not admit in their factum but they will probably admit in their argument that that extends further than their own flock, and these functionaries have the authority to marry, providing one of the parties applying to be married is of their flock.\nNow, where is the law for making that distinction? How can you find such a distinction in any of the legislation before the Code; where can you find it in the Code? The whole historical argument, as I understand it goes to this: that the jurisdiction of each of these functionaries is exclusive and restricted, but where do you find any suggestion as to that in any law upon the subject. And the necessary result of that theory would be, it seems to me, that in order to celebrate a mixed marriage, as it is commonly called, it would require the presence of two officiating clergymen and by the very nature of things each would be without jurisdiction in the parish of the other. Suppose, the two parties, the Roman Catholic and the Protestant, belonged to different parishes, \u2014 what would happen? We will take, for simplicity\u2019s sake, the case of an Anglican where there is a parochial division, living in one parish, and a Catholic living in another parish, \u2014 how are you going to get concurrent action on the part of the clergyman and the priest? The clergyman has no jurisdiction in the parish of the priest and, vice versa, the priest has no jurisdiction in the domicile of the other. It seems to be a reductio ad absurdum to say that two ministers could by joint operation validly effect one marriage. Where do you find any authority for saying that the priest has any authority to marry beyond his own flock; or that the Anglican minister has any authority to go outside his own congregation; unless you adopt the perfectly plain and natural meaning of article 129 that there is no restriction whatsoever. To go a step further, how can you celebrate a marriage between a Christian and a Chinaman; by what possible combination of officers of civil status can you validly effect such a marriage; how could you validly effect a marriage between two unbelievers who have no parish and belong to no religious community; how could you marry two Chinese or Hindus or Turks; and we have all of these people in our midst. If you say that there is a restriction there according to the historical argument that is made, which confines the power of each to his own congregation, you are disfranchising, so to speak, this large part of our population, because you will see that there is no officer of civil status competent to marry them. I am only using this argument to shew the improbability of our codifiers having, at the end of article 129, intended to create any such ridiculous restriction as that, which would make it impossible for a large proportion of our population in the large cities to get married at all.\nNow, I submit it is contrary to reason and to common sense to adopt such a construction of article 129. In so far as the construction of that article is concerned, even if the commissioners supposed that they were reproducing the disabilities of the old law, the question is not what they intended to do but what they have done by that language. I submit that they have in the clearest manner established the power to celebrate marriage without any of the restrictions which may have existed prior to the Code. I cannot find any law which gives the authority for the celebration of a mixed marriage, either by a Catholic priest or by a Protestant minister, unless you adopt my construction of the Code, and of all the previous statutes, that the power to celebrate marriage is not restricted to any particular community of Christians or of citizens, and that any persons authorized to marry can marry generally, unless, as in the case of the Quakers, there is a restriction, and that exception proves the rule, and it was a necessary restriction in the case of the Quakers because they do not have any minister, and people would not go to them to get married unless they were members of the Society of Friends and joined the congregation. Marriage was celebrated among the Quakers by the consorts getting up in the middle of the congregation and saying they took each other for man and wife, and there was no priest or minister involved in it. There was no official of any kind, and as soon as they were put under the operation of the Act of 1795 they had to have a registry officer and keep a register of civil status. But there was no one who performed the marriage. That officer attended as a member of the congregation, and, as I say, there was this restriction necessary in the case of the Quakers because of the peculiar constitution of their religious society. I wish to give your Lordships one more reference upon the construction of the Code, and I wish to refer to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[25]. And I wish to add the case of The Bank of England v. Tagliano Bros.[26]: This is an English case, decided in the Privy Council. I refer to the judgment of Lord Macnaghten, in Norendra Nath Sicar v. Kamalbasini Dasi[27], at p. 26. It re-affirmed the rule which was laid down by Lord Herschell in The Bank of England v. Vagliano Bros.24, and applied it to the \u201cIndian Succession Act\u201d; it entirely approves of the principle that was laid down in that case.\nIn regard to mixed marriages, as the Chief Justice has pointed out, the question has not been raised in any judicial proceeding, and I am not aware it is a matter of doubt in our province, and so there is no grievance or anything of that kind that requires to be redressed. I am bound to say that. But I do consider that the argument upon that question is of the highest value in assisting you to interpret article 129, because \u00cc think, when you reflect over the question of a mixed marriage, you must come to the conclusion, my Lords, that it is the reductio ad absurdum of the historical argument. It seems to me to lead to consequences which are repugnant to reason and to a proper interpretation of article 129. As to its being a question of moment in our province, it is not so far as I know.\nMignault K.C.\u2014My Lords, I do not think, especially at this late stage, that there can be any doubt as to the construction which should be put on the Civil Code of Lower Canada, and more especially as to the canons of construction which apply. The question has come up in its general form through some remarks made by my learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, both in his factum and in his argument. I conceive that it is beyond question that the Civil Code is mainly declaratory of the law as it existed in 1866.\nIf your Lordships will look at the sections of the Act; the instructions given by the legislature to the codifying commissioners was, in every case, to express the existing law, and where they thought proper to suggest an amendment it should be indicated as an amendment suggested. My main purpose in referring to this is to state that our Civil Code is mainly declaratory of the existing law. It is not a new law; it is not a law like the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d in England, which, in some ways, may have been a codification, but I think was not so in many respects. I am speaking with all due deference, because I am not as familiar with that as I am with our own laws. But I take it that in the case of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d there were many, \u2014 what I may call reforms, \u2014 which Avere effected by the new legislation. I think that is beyond question. I think that certainly my learned friends will not disagree with me that, mainly, the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec is declaratory of the existing law. It is in no wise \u2014 or if it is I humbly confess that I have not grasped its meaning \u2014 an ordinary statute; it is a body of laws; it is a concise expression of the entire system comprising the whole law of the province as mainly derived from the Coutume de Paris and from several of the old ordinances with the additions which came from certain customs. So that our Civil Code, when construed, must be considered in the light of a declaratory law.\nWe have the reports of the codifiers to guide us. My learned friend in his factum objects to the use of these reports and he cites certain judicial opinions where it has been suggested that it was not proper to refer to reports. There have been Royal Commissions and these Royal Commissions recommended a change in the law and judges have sometimes, and I think in some instances very properly, refused to be controlled by the report of the commissioners in construing a law. But between our case and those cases, I submit, there is no parity whatever. Our courts have been in the habit, rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly, of referring to the reports of the codifiers, and their Lordships of the Privy Council have also referred to them in the case of Symes v. Cuvillier[28]. In that case they referred to them on the question as to the old law and they said that the reports of the codifiers were entitled to the very greatest weight, the greatest respect, but were not to be considered as judicial utterances. But, for purposes of comparison, and that is my point, they have always been considered by our courts as throwing light on the meaning of the articles of the Code. They have been incidentally cited in such cases; they have been cited by your Lordships, they have been cited by every court, and on this point specially is it necessary to refer to them because I will shew to your Lordships that article 129 is not clear, as has been stated, by my learned friend; that there are very serious limitations, and that, considering the whole subject, it raises questions of construction in which certainly your Lordships can be aided by reference to the codifiera\u2019 reports. We have certain rules which have plainly been applied in the construction of our Code as well as in the construction of the French Code. As the Chief Justice has pointed out, Laurent has always been a source of authority as to the meaning of the law in France. These reports have always been referred to before our courts, and I am not aware that the practice of referring to these interpretations has ever been considered as worthy of reprobation. I may say, further, that we have distinct rules in our Code covering construction, which are mainly taken from the French Code. I refer to the familiar rule laid down by article 1020 of the Civil Code which refers to the construction of contracts but which equally applies to the construction of any statute. Article 1020 says:\u2014\n\u201c1020. However general the terms may be in which a contract is expressed, they extend only to the things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.\u201d\nI say that rule applies to the construction of a statute and I find laid down in Beal on Legal Interpretation, 2nd edition, 1908, page 311, under the title of Restriction of Language, the following utterance of Lord Herschell:\u2014\n\u201cIt cannot, I think, be denied that for the purpose of construing any enactment it is right to look not only at the provision immediately under construction, but at any that is found in connection with it, which may throw light upon it, and afford an indication that general words employed in it were not intended to be applied without some limitation.\u201d Cox v. Hakes[29].\nMy learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, to some extent has, so to say, isolated article 129, his argument being that there is no restriction whatever in the terms of article 129, and consequently, that it is to be given the widest application. I propose to consider article 129 \u2014 I think I am right in doing so \u2014 in connection with all the provisions of the law covering both marriages and the case of registers of civil status, the two subjects being branches of the one general subject. Article 129 is in the following terms; and paragraph 1, which I will consider now, reads:\u2014\n\u201c129. All priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status are competent to solemnize marriage.\u201d\nMy learned friend says there can be no doubt about the meaning of this, that it is a general provision to which is to be given the widest possible effect. I have to contest that doctrine in regard to article 129; I think it cannot be given general effect according to its terms. I have to suggest, first, one limitation as to which, to my mind, there can be no doubt, and that is in respect to the words: \u201cand other officers authorized by law to keep registers of civil status.\u201d My submission is that these general words must be restricted so as to extend merely to officers of the same category as priests, rectors, and ministers. Otherwise, I submit, that superiors of religious communities would have the right, according to the contention of my learned friend, to solemnize marriage. Mr. Lafleur says that all superiors of religious communities are not authorized to keep registers of civil status, but that is not what article 129 says. Article 129, if you give it general effect, says, \u201call officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status,\u201d and that according to its general meaning would mean any act of civil status. Consequently, if you give general effect to article 129 it is undoubted that superiors of religious communities are authorized to keep acts of civil status; acts of religious profession, which are acts of civil status. Consequently, here is one indication that the terms of article 129 cannot be followed and so we must begin to look at it with that notable restriction.\nNow, there is a second restriction to the general meaning of article 129 and it is a most important one. Are priests, rectors and ministers competent to solemnize marriage whether or not they are authorized to keep registers of civil status? If general effect be given to article 129 the affirmative might be predicated. I submit that it is evident, by all the provisions of this law, that here again we must restrict article 129 to priests, rectors, and ministers who are authorized to keep registers of civil status. This being granted, then there is the further limitation that priests, rectors and ministers are competent to solemnize marriage only in those places where they are authorized to keep registers of civil status, because elsewhere they have not that authority, and, consequently, priests, rectors and ministers can only solemnize marriage where they are authorized to keep registers of civil status. Then we come to article 63 of the Code.\nI desire to point out to your Lordships that the canons of construction which my learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, would apply to the interpretation of article 129 cannot apply because they omit material provisions which require to be applied in the construction of this particular law. We have article 53b and my learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, practically admitted that he could not say what officers it applied to. Now, I say, that by article 63 and as a general rule marriage must be solemnized at the place of domicile of one or other of the parties,\u2019 but here is an article which requires construction. This law is not so clear as has been stated. Article 63 says:\u2014\n\u201c63. The marriage is solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties. If solemnized elsewhere, the person officiating is obliged to verify and ascertain the identity of the parties.\u201d\nMy learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, says that marriage can be celebrated anywhere, and consequently the first part of article 63 is useless. I say that the first part of article 63 lays down the general rule, and that the reference to marriage being celebrated elsewhere in the second part of the paragraph refers to exceptional cases. But it is evident that, between us, article 63 must be construed and consequently we have an indication which I submit to your Lordships as having, in my humble opinion, very great force. Therefore, this article requires construction, and I will shew your Lordships that article 129 requires construction, when combined, as it must be combined, with another article of the Code. Article 63 indicates that, as a general rule, marriage must \u2014 I use the word must \u2014 be solemnized at the place of domicile of one or other of the parties. I have been at some pains to verify this, and I have referred to the authorities cited by the codifiers, but have derived no light from that. Article 63 says that the marriage is solemnized at the domicile of one or other of the parties, but according to the old law, as laid down by Pothier, the marriage should be celebrated where the bride lives, but with the permission of the parish priest of the domicile of the bride the marriage could be celebrated at the domicile of the husband. That is what was laid down. But, under article 63, the marriage could be solemnized in the place of the domicile of either party. The second part of the article says:\u2014\n\u201cIf solemnized elsewhere the person officiating is obliged to verify and ascertain the identity of the parties.\u201d\nI think we can help ourselves in construing that portion of article 63 by reference to article 132 which uses practically the same phraseology. Article 132 of the Civil Code says:\u2014\n\u201c132. If their last domicile be out of Lower Canada, and the publications have not been made there, the officer who, in that case, solemnizes the marriage is bound to ascertain that there is no legal impediment between the parties.\u201d\nYour Lordships will notice that the language of the two is very similar. In article 63 it is stated that if solemnized elsewhere the person officiating is obliged to verify and ascertain the identity of the parties, and in article 132 it is said that the officer who solemnizes the marriage is bound to ascertain if there is no legal impediment between the parties. I would take the case mentioned in article 132 as being one of the exceptional cases to which the latter part of article 63 refers. There is another case in point. Under canon law, it was a vexed question as to where vagrants, who had no domicile at all, could be married. It was conceded that they could marry, but the question arose as to whether they should go to the parish priest of their domicile of origin and there be married. The decision of the canonists was, and it was laid down authoritatively by the commission of cardinals entrusted with the construction of the decrees of the Council of Trent, that they could marry anywhere, but before marrying them the priest was bound to ask the permission of the ordinary, that is to say, of the bishop, and also to make an inquiry in order to discover whether there was any impediment between the parties. I would refer your Lordships, on this question of the marriage of vagrants, to Esmein, Le Marriage en Droit Canonique. I submit to your Lordships that this case of vagrants is one of the things to which the exception in article 63 would apply. I know of no other case and I would say that outside of these exceptional cases, unless you deprive of any effect the first part of article 63, marriage must be celebrated at the place of residence of one of the parties.\nWith regard to Roman Catholics, \u201cplace of residence\u201d undoubtedly it is the parish; with regard to other religions I am possibly not sufficiently informed to state. Article 63 was considered by this court and by the Privy Council in the case of Wadsworth v. MaoMullen[30] and as I understand the decision it was stated that article 63 referred to residence and not necessarily to domicile.\nI am not prepared to say with regard to other religious congregations, but I believe in the case of the Anglican Church there is a parochial organization. I am not aware whether a parochial organization, that is to say, a distinct territory, exists for the ministers of other religions, but in the statutes which we have printed, there is some reference to a \u201ccircuit.\u201d\nThere is article 133 which reads:\u2014\n\u201c133. If the parties, or either of them, be, in so far as regards this marriage, under the authority of others, the banns must also be published at the place of domicile of those under whose power such parties are.\u201d\nThe point I am making, and from which I have somewhat wandered, is, that article 63 lays down the general rule and that in consequence of this rule article 129 must receive no limitation, and as it would only apply to the priest, rector or the minister of the domicile of the parties, no other could, without the permission of the parish priest or rector of the parties, solemnize marriage either at the domicile of the parties, because they are not there authorized to keep registers of civil status, or elsewhere, because, as a rule the marriage must be solemnized at the domicile of the parties. Consequently, I say we have no limitation to the terms of article 129. There is another article of the Code, which I think your Lordships should consider in connection with the construction of article 129. I refer to the second paragraph of article 44. Article 129, as we know, authorizes priests, rectors, ministers and other officers, authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status as competent to solemnize marriage, and the second paragraph of article 44 says:\u2014\n\u201cIn the case of Roman Catholic churches, private chapels or missions, they are kept by any priest authorized by competent ecclesiastical authority to celebrate marriages or administer baptism and perform the rites of burial.\u201d On the one hand, according to article 129, priests who are authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status are competent to solemnize marriage; on the other hand, by the second paragraph of article 44, Roman Catholic priests who are authorized by competent ecclesiastical authority to celebrate marriage are authorized to keep registers. The juxtaposition of the two articles shews this: that because priests are authorized by competent ecclesiastical authority to solemnize marriage, they are by the civil law authorized to keep registers, and because they are authorized to keep registers according to article 129 they are declared competent to solemnize marriage. I submit to your Lordships that these two articles must be considered together, and it is perfectly obvious, that in view of these articles the wide construction claimed for article 129 is impossible with regard to Roman Catholic priests. My learned friend states in his factum that there is no distinction between Roman Catholics and non-Catholics in article 129, whereas he concedes a sharp distinction between Roman Catholics and other religions under articles 42, 43, and 44. But I takelt, my Lords, that so far as Roman Catholics are concerned, articles 129 and 44 must be read together. I am referring to what my learned friend says in his factum. He says:\u2014\n\u201cArticles 128 and 129 are in sharp contrast in this respect to articles 44, 49, 53a, 59a, which refer expressly to the Roman Catholic church, and distinguish between its priests or members and those of other religions.\u201d\nMy point is that, so far as the Roman Catholics are concerned, articles 128 and 129 and 44 must be read together, because article 129 says that all priests who are authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status are competent to celebrate marriage and, when Ave inquire who are the priests who are authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, we find the answer in the second paragraph of article 44, that they are those priests who are authorized by the competent religious authorities to solemnize marriage. Consequently, I submit that the title of the priest is the authorization given him by the bishop. I am referring to nothing else now than the provisions of the Civil Code, and it is because he is authorized by the bishop to solemnize marriage that he is authorized by the law to keep registers, and it is because he is authorized to keep registers that he is declared competent to solemnize marriage. It is not claimed to give him the power, it is said he is competent to solemnize marriage, and, consequently, I say that the title of the priest is the authorization of the competent ecclesiastical authority, so that in the final analysis, according to these articles of the Civil Code, the priest derives his authority, his right to solemnize marriage, from the authorization of the bishop. If there is any other construction that could be placed on the construction of these articles of the Code, I would be happy to hear it from my learned friend. I see no escaping from my contention and I would submit that it was done deliberately. There was never a doubt, I am speaking perfectly frankly, before the decision in Delpit v. C\u00f4t\u00e9[31], that Roman Catholics could only be married before their own parish priest. My learned friend has referred to the case of Burn v. Fontaine[32], but that is not a case in point because in that case there was no action to set aside the marriage. It was pretended that the first marriage was null ipso facto and that a second marriage had been contracted, and the wife\u2014I am speaking from memory, but it is to be found in Revue L\u00e9gale, vol. 4, \u2014 the wife claimed marital rights or alimony or something of that kind, and it was alleged that one of the marriages, I think the first, was an absolute nullity. The natural position is that the court would not assume the marriage to be null, in the absence of any action taken to set it aside. That case was merely an application of the doctrine of the presumption of the validity of the marriage until the marriage was set aside. As I have said, there never was a doubt before the decision in Delpit v. G\u00f4t\u00e9[33], as to what the law of the Province of Quebec Avas. It is conceded by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9, Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[34]; Justice Papineau had, in that very same case, decided the same thing on demurrer[35]. There never had been any question before.\nIt was argued in the case of Laram\u00e9e v. Evans32 that the marriage was good. To be perfectly frank I should say that one of the earliest commentators on the Code expressed the opinion that, under article 129, such marriages could be celebrated, but Mr. Justice Loranger, in his treatise on the civil law, and Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier, in his course of lectures at Laval University, which have been published, agree that marriages of Roman Catholics must necessarily be celebrated before their parish priest. I was saying that I considered the words used in article 44 were used advisedly. It was never doubted in the Province of Quebec that the authority to solemnize marriage, quoad Catholics and quoad a Roman Catholic priest, came from the church, and that it was a part of the jurisdiction which he received from his superior. We find this idea stated in article 44. My argument on this would be extremely simple: authorization of the bishop, I submit, is the title of a priest to solemnize marriage. This authorization is necessarily restricted to people of the same communion as the Roman Catholic priests, that is to Roman Catholics. If it were held, under article 129, that the competency of these ministers and rectors extended to all marriages, without any distinction, then the power and authority of the non-Catholic priests would be wider than those of the Catholic priests, and that would be contrary to the principle of equality. I take it that article 129 applies to the religious belief, in so far as the Roman Catholic clergy are concerned, and, to my mind, it would be extremely difficult to otherwise satisfactorily construe article 129 with the second paragraph of article 44.\nI think, that it is also possible to discover the true meaning of article 129 by reference to some other provisions of the law. I would direct your Lordships\u2019 attention to the provision concerning opposition to marriage. I may say generally that the chief object of the law in enacting articles 128 and 129 was to secure the publicity of marriage and to prevent clandestine marriages. This was, of course, a consideration of public order, and, consequently, they provided for a procedure for the taking out of oppositions to marriage. I do not know that there is a similar procedure in the English law, but in accordance with our law a marriage might be prevented by reason of an opposition. For instance, the father or the mother or the tutor or a prior consort of one of the parties, in order to prevent a marriage which would be null according to law, might take proceedings. Some construction must be put on article 129 to meet the provisions of the law concerning opposition to marriage. For instance, when an opposition is taken out by article 1107 of the Code of Procedure, it must be served upon the functionary called upon to celebrate the marriage; by article 1109 of the same code service of nonsuit of the opposition must be made upon the person called upon to solemnize the marriage. Article 61 of the Civil Code requires that the disallowance of the opposition be notified to the officer charged with the solemnization of the marriage. My argument is that there must be some officer, some priest or minister, who, in the intendment of the legislature, is charged with the solemnization of marriage. Take the case of a marriage about to be celebrated in the City of Montreal where there are probably fifty Roman Catholic parishes including the suburbs, and perhaps three times that number of non-Catholic congregations. A marriage is about to take place and that marriage may be stayed by means of an opposition. The law requires that the opposition to marriage be served on the officer charged with the solemnization of the marriage. It seems to me obvious that there must be some particular officer before whom the marriage must be celebrated or otherwise effect could not be given with respect to these provisions as to opposition. There is another important article, article 65 of the Civil Code which states what the acts of marriage must contain. That article, 65, sets forth that the act of marriage must set forth that there has been no opposition or that any opposition there may have been has been disallowed. How could a priest or minister make this entry that there had been no opposition to this marriage unless he is the only person on whom such an opposition could be served. I know the point taken by Mr. Lafleur in his argument, and it is that under article 65 of the Civil Code there is no requirement or mention of the religious faith of the parties to be married. He says that, if the competence of the officer solemnizing the marriage depends in any way upon the religious faith of the parties, it is most extraordinary that mention of the religious faith of the parties is not required in the act of marriage. My submission is, and it is a complete answer, that all that is required in the act of marriage is the mention of those facts which go to make out the status of the married people, such as their names, the day on which the marriage was solemnized, whether they are of age or minors, whether they were married after publication of banns, whether with a dispensation or license and whether it was with the consent of their father or mother, tutor or curator, or with the advice of a family council when such consent or advice is required, the names of the witnesses, and whether they are related or allied to the parties, and if so on which side and in what degree. Finally, it must be stated in the act of marriage, that there has been no opposition, or that, if there has been any opposition instituted, it has been disallowed. All these facts go to make up the status of the parties. There is nothing in the act of marriage referring to the competence of the person solemnizing the marriage. It is not necessary, at least article 65 does not require, that his name should be given; it merely states that he will sign. All the facts mentioned in this act of marriage are facts which go to make out the status of the parties as married people, and certain facts relating to the witnesses and to the consent of the parents or guardians in case these parties be minors. But my submission is, that the law evidently contemplated that there should be one special officer or priest or minister, out of perhaps many thousands, who is called upon to celebrate the marriage. I think that is most important from the point of view of the construction of article 129, because the argument of my learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, if it has any force, would shew that a person could be validly married anywhere in the Province of Quebec, from Vaudreuil on one side to Gasp\u00e9 on the other. For instance, a minor might go to any one of the hundreds of clergy in the City of Montreal and produce a marriage license and be married without there being any means of preventing the marriage. Now, the law provides a means for preventing such a marriage, and says that the opposition which is taken must be served upon the person who is called upon, or charged, with the solemnization of the marriage. I say, therefore, that there must be, in article 129, one out of many thousands, who alone is competent to solemnize marriage.\nI have said that in my humble opinion, the provisions respecting opposition to marriage shew the construction which must be placed on article 129. I would say the same as to the banns of marriage. By article 130 banns are directed to be published in the church io which the parties belong and article 57 states that the officer who is to perform the marriage must be furnished with a certificate establishing that the publication of banns required by law has been duly made, unless he has published them himself. What would be the object of publishing banns in a church to which the parties belonged if the marriage could be celebrated one hundred miles away? Why, the object of the law would be absolutely defeated. I submit, with confidence, that taking into consideration nothing outside the provisions of these two titles, \u2014 \u201cOf Acts of Civil Status\u201d and \u201cOf Marriage,\u201d \u2014 the limitation for which I am contending must necessarily be placed on article 129 so far as the Roman Catholics are concerned.\nI will now take up the second question which I propose to discuss; and first, as to the prior state of the law. I think it is very material on this question to refer to the prior state of the law, and I wish to say a few words on the statute of 1795, 35 George III. ch. 4. The title of that Act is:\u2014\n\u201cAn Act to establish the forms of registers of baptisms, marriages and burials, to confirm and make valid in law the register of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, and others which may have been informally kept, and to afford the means of remedying omissions in former registers.\u201d\nIf your Lordships will look at section 10 of the Act, there is a reference to a petition which had been presented to the House of Assembly from the churchwardens:\u2014\n\u201cFrom the Church Wardens and Vestry of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, praying the interposition of the Legislature to legalize the register of baptisms, marriages and burials of the said congregation, which have not been kept agreeable to the rules and forms prescribed by the law of this province, and which, etc.\u201d Through the courtesy of Dr. Roy of the Dominion Archives, I have been able to find the text of that petition which I think should be made a part of my argument. I will cite from the Journal of the House of Assembly of Lower Canada, from the 11th of November, 1793, to the 31st of May, 1794, both being inclusive. It is published in Quebec by order of the House \u00f3f Assembly in the year 1794. At page 62 \u2014 the text is in the two languages, French on one side and English on the other \u2014 at the foot of the page I find the following:\u2014\n\u201cThe petition of the Church Wardens and Vestry of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, was presented to the House by Mr. Richardson and read in both languages, setting forth that the keeping, depositing and preserving in regular and due form and due manner registers of baptisms, marriages and burials, in their parish, most essentially concerns the rights of families and of individuals and that the not keeping and depositing of registers of baptisms, marriages and burials of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, according to the rules prescribed by the law of this province since the first day of May which was in the year of our Lord, 1775, unless provided against and remedied, may be attended with the greatest prejudice to the rights of the families and individuals of the said congregation. And, therefore, praying that leave may be granted to bring in a bill for legalizing the register of baptisms, marriages and burials of the said congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, and for the better keeping, depositing, and preserving the same hereafter.\n\u201cThe House was then moved by Mr. Richardson, seconded by Mr. Frobisher, and it was resolved that the petition of the Church Wardens and Vestry of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, be referred to the consideration of a committee of three members, two whereof shall form a quorum, to examine the matter thereof and report the same as it shall appear to them to the House, with power to meet and to adjourn to such time and place necessary and to send for persons, papers and records.\n\u201cMr. Richardson also moved the House, seconded by Mr. de Rocheblave, that he be exempt from being nominated on the said committee as he will not be present at Montreal when the information necessary will most probably be taken, which, upon the question being put, passed unanimously, and Mr. Richardson was accordingly excused by the House from being on the said committee.\n\u201cOrdered that Messrs. McGill, Frobisher, McBeath do compose said committee.\u201d\nAnd I find at page 220 of the same volume the report of the committee:\u2014\n\u201cMr. McGill, chairman of the committee, to whom the petition of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, relative to the method of keeping the register of baptisms, marriages and burials of His Majesty\u2019s British subjects of the City of Montreal, was submitted, reported that the committee had examined and inquired into the allegations of the said petition and had directed him to report their proceedings therein, which he was ready to do when the House should be pleased to receive the same. Ordered that the report be now received.\u201d\nAnd he read the report in his place and afterwards delivered the same in at the clerk\u2019s table where it was once read throughout in both languages, whereof the following is an abstract:\u2014\n\u201cThe committee met at Montreal on Friday, the 10th day of January last. The Reverend Dr. De-lisle and Mr. Tunstall, assistant clergymen attended, also Messrs. Antill, Davidson, Hughes, Edwards, Finley and Winter, church wardens or parishioners. Dr. Delisle produced the book entitled \u2018Copy of the Register of the Protestants of Montreal, made by me, David Chabrand Delisle, Rector of the Parish and Chaplain of the Garrison, on the 31st December, 1763,\u2019 and informed the committee that he had made up that register from notes and memorandum occasionally taken by himself and the parish clerks who had been employed in that office; and that he had not in his possession nor did he know of any other register that had been kept by any Protestant clergyman of Montreal preceding his arrival in this country in 1766. The committee then proceeded to peruse and consider the copy of the register which they found to contain a list or register of christenings, marriages and burials in the following order:\u2014\n\u201cMarriages.\n\u201cThey begin 22nd November, 1766, and end in 1793, and a copy of the register contains a list of marriages celebrated by the Reverend Dr. Delisle and Mr. Tunstall during that time, the names of the parties married, but the avocations or places of abode not being inserted, or of the witnesses who were present. The better to judge thereof the committee esteemed it proper to subjoin a copy of the first and last entries of marriages as a sufficient specimen of the whole.\n\u201c1. 1766. Mr. Peter Paul Souberiau and Miss Catherine F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Chaumont were married by publication on the 20th November.\n\u201cLast. 1793. 22nd December, Mr. John Turner and Mrs. Mary Knowles, widow, were married by license.\n\u201cChristenings.\n\u201cThe register of christenings is perhaps more regular as it appears that when there were sponsors their names are inserted. The first is in 1766 without sponsors; the second is of the same year and with sponsors in the following manner:\u2014\n1. Ann, daughter of Mr. Lawrence and Mrs. Jemima Ermatinger, born 16th October, baptized 5th November; sponsors, Mr. Horace Oakes, Miss Moore Oakes, Miss Margaret Oakes.\n\u201cThe last is as follows in 1793: Abagail, daughter of Samuel and Mary Brown, born 25th October and baptized 8th of November.\n\u201cBurials.\n\u201cThe first appears to have been in 1767 and is entered in the following words:\u2014\n\u201cIsabella Holmes, died 24th of May and was buried the 25th.\n\u201cThe last is in 1793: Margaret Wraser, died the 4th of December and was buried the 5th. And there is no mention of the parents or other relations or places of abode.\n\u201cThe committee esteem it proper to add that they desired the vestry men and parishioners who are present at the perusal of the copy of the register to examine it and see whether in their recollections there had been christened, married or buried any persons whose names were not therein inserted; Major James Hughes remarked that in the list of christenings no less than three persons in his own family had been omitted, namely, his sons Charles and William and his grandson James Walker; from that circumstance it is inferred that an omission as well as of marriages and burials as of christenings.\n\u201cUpon the whole your committee is of opinion that it is with reason the petition referred to states that the register of baptisms, marriages and burials of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, have not hitherto been kept in the manner prescribed by the law of this province, which may be attended with great prejudice to the right of families and individuals. The committee conceive it their duty to observe that they have reason to believe that marriages, baptisms and burials have been solemnized by other Protestant ministers as well, Episcopalian, and Presbyterians, at other parts of the province without any register whatever having been kept of them. Your committee, therefore, submit whether a law to remedy these and such other like defects should not be passed as soon as convenient, that the mind of His Majesty\u2019s. Protestant subjects and others their relations may be quieted and a mode pointed out for the due and legal keeping and registering of all baptisms, marriages and burials of His Majesty\u2019s Protestant subjects in the future.\u201d\nThe point I desire to make from that is this: The question was put by one of your Lordships this morning to my learned friend Mr. Lafleur, as to what was the law as to the solemnization of marriages in keeping the registers before 1795. Your Lordships will see by section 10 of the Act referring to the petition I have just read, it is stated that these registers at Christ Church, Montreal, had not been kept agreeable to the rules and forms prescribed by the law of the province. At the end of the same section, it is provided that a copy be made of this register and that it be compared by a judge of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench at Montreal, that the copy, therefore, shall have the same force and effect to all intents and purposes as if the same had been kept in accordance with the rules and forms prescribed by the law of the province.\nSection 11 of this Act is also material. It says:\u2014\n\u201c11. And whereas there may be other registers which have been kept in this province, not strictly agreeable to the rules and forms prescribed by law; and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that any register of baptisms, marriages and burials which has been informally kept and not deposited as the law directs before the commencement of this Act, by any rector, curate, vicar or other priest or minister of any parish or of any Protestant church or congregation, and which before the expiration of five years after the passing of this Act, shall be presented along with an exact duplicate or transcript thereof to one of His Majesty\u2019s Justices of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, or provincial judge of the district wherein such register was kept, in order that the original and the duplicate or transcript thereof may be by him, the said justice or judge, compared, certified and signed. And notwithstanding any defect in point of form or otherwise regarding such register, duplicate or transcript, the same shall severally be received as evidence in all courts of justice of the truth of the entries therein contained, according to the true intent and meaning thereof, and shall have the same force and effect to all intents and purposes, as if the same had been kept according to the rules and forms prescribed by the laws of this province.\u201d\nThen, by section 15 of that Act it is further enacted:\u2014\n\u201c15. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that so much of the twentieth title of an ordinance passed by his most Christian Majesty, in the month of April, in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-seven, and of a declaration of his most Christian Majesty of the ninth of April, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-six, which relates to the form and manner in which the registers of baptisms, marriages and burials are to be numbered, authenticated or paraph\u00e9, kept and deposited, and the penalties thereby imposed on persons refusing or neglecting to conform to the provisions of said ordinance and declaration, are hereby repealed, so far as relates to the said registers only.\u201d\nMy submission is that prior to 1795 the law of the province was the old ordinance of France, and, so far as the registers are concerned, more particularly the 20th title of the ordinance of 1667 and the declaration of the month of April, 1736. That is clearly shewn by the statute of 1795 to have been considered as the law of the province.\nThe question of instructions to the Governor is a rather complicated question to discuss, but your Lordships have read the instructions contained in the books of Drs. Shortt and Doughty and you will have noticed that there were public instructions and secret instructions. J may refer generally to the report from the pen of Chief Justice Hey, which is published in the appendix to the first volume of the Lower Canada Jurist and which touches on all these questions. On the 2nd of October, 1763, the famous proclamation of George III. was issued by virtue of which it was claimed that English law has been introduced into the Province of Quebec. Governor Murray acting by virtue of certain instructions \u2014 my impression is that they were not the public instructions, but secret or confidential instructions\u2014passed two ordinances which are referred to in the \u201cQuebec Act.\u201d These ordinances purported to introduce the English common law into the Province of Quebec. They are discussed at length in the report of Chief Justice Hey to which I have referred, and they are also discussed and the whole question most exhaustively treated in the opinion of Chief Justice Lafontaine in the case of Wilcox v. Wilcox[36]. The point taken as to the proclamation of 1763 was that it did not introduce, proprio vigore, the English law into Canada, but provided means by which it might be gradually introduced by means of a legislature to be summoned and which legislature was never summoned. The point as to the ordinances of Governor Murray was that they were beyond his power, that he could not by his own authority introduce the English law into the Province of Quebec.\nThe provisions of the old French ordonnances refer to the solemnization of marriages by the proper cur\u00e9. Now, with all due deference, I would say it is possible that these provisions may have been construed as being applicable in the case of Anglican clergymen and Roman Catholic clergymen. This is a subject with which I am not absolutely familiar and I speak with hesitancy. I take it that the same parochical organization existed in the Anglican Church as in the Roman Catholic Church, and that the provision of the law requiring the solemnization of marriage by the parish priest could be applied in the case of the Anglican Church the same as in the case of the Roman Catholic Church. I say that, with hesitancy, because so far as I am aware there is nothing absolutely conclusive as to the authority on which marriages were solemnized by the Anglican community prior to the Act of 1795. My learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, has stated that there is no statutory authority authorizing the solemnization of marriages by ministers of the Church of England prior to the Civil Code.\nSection 16 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, for the year 1860, which is a consolidation of 35 Geo. III., reads in this way:\u2014\n\u201c16. The Protestant churches or congregations intended in the first section of this Act, are all churches and congregations in communion, with the United Church of England and Ireland, or with the Church of Scotland, and all regularly ordained priests and ministers of either of the said churches have had and shall have authority validly to solemnize marriage in Lower Canada, and are and shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act.\u201d\nQuoad the Roman Catholic Church there never has been provision by legislation prior to the Civil Code which could be construed at conferring on priests the authority to solemnize marriage. I take it as an incontrovertible truth that the provisions of the old ordonnances of the French Kings, which were in force in the Province of Quebec, were preserved in operation under section 2 of the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d and that continued to the Civil Code, and there was no necessity for any provision in the laws of Lower Canada authorizing the Roman Catholic priest to solemnize marriage.\nAs to the Anglican Church any authority its ministers had to solemnize marriage would be an authority derived from the old French law which continued to be in force. At all events that would strike me as the better view. That will come up more particularly under what I may describe as the question of repugnancy, which in two words is this \u2014 it is referred to in my learned friend\u2019s factum and is somewhat extensively treated of in the judgment of Mr. Justice Archibald in the case of Delpit v. G\u00f4t\u00e9[37]\u2014and it is, that these provisions for marriage were repugnant to the ideas and principles of the victors and, consequently, did not remain in operation after the conquest. I submit it as an unquestionable fact that the whole body of the French civil law, including these ordonnances, was maintained in force in the Province of Quebec after the conquest, that at no time did the English common law have any effect in the Province of Quebec, and that it is possible to construe these ordonnances as conferring sufficient official authority to any parish priest to solemnize marriage. That, however, is a question that I discuss with a great deal of deference. It may be that authority was assumed by the ministers of the Anglican Church; it may be, as I thought my learned friend suggested, that they assumed they had authority under the law in \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act.\u201d But I would say this: that undoubtedly the whole body of the civil law was in force, and my submission is that there is nothing therein that could be considered repugnant. The question of repugnancy is an absolutely new one; it was never suggested at any time that the provisions of the French law were repugnant and would have been abrogated by the effect of the conquest.\nThe subsequent special laws I will ask your Lordships briefly to look at, because it is contended by my learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, that they conferred a general authority to solemnize marriage. They were all special laws; they were adopted to come to the relief of certain congregations. I would submit that all these laws which were enacted after the statute of 1795 with respect to different religious communities are merely special laws and do not confer any authority to the ministers outside of their own congregations. I submit that as the proper construction of these laws.\nYour Lordships will observe section 17, of chapter 20, C.S.L.C.:\u2014\n\u201c17. This Act extends also to the several religious communities and denominations in Lower Canada, mentioned in this section, and to the priests or ministers thereof, who may validly solemnize marriage, and may obtain and keep registers under this Act, subject to the provisions of the Acts mentioned with reference to each of them respectively, and to all the requirements, penalties and provisions of this Act, as if the said communities and denominations were named in the first section of this Act, that is to say:\u201d (Here the communities, etc., are enumerated.)\nYour Lordships will see, therefore, that the Act refers to each special statute in which authority is given. Going back to these statutes, if your Lordships will look at 1st Wm. IV. ch. 56 (L.C.), an Act intituled \u201cAn Act to afford relief to a certain Religious Congregation at Montreal denominated Presbyterians,\u201d the sixth line of which says that they are authorized to solemnize and register all such marriages, baptisms and burials as may be performed or take place under the ministry of such minister or clergyman. The words \u201cunder the ministry\u201d I submit refer to the ministry exercised in regard to his own congregation, because the petition they forwarded to the legislature was:\u2014\n\u201cThat the Reverend George W. Perkins, their present minister, or the person who hereafter may have the pastoral charge of the congregation to which they belong, should be duly authorized to solemnize marriages, administer baptism and inter the dead, and to keep registers authenticated in due form of law for that purpose.\u201d\nThe minister is authorized to keep registers of marriages, baptisms and burials which may be performed or take place under his ministry. Your Lordships will find practically identical language in the other statutes. In 3 Wm. IV. ch. 27, which enables the regularly ordained minister of the United Association Synod of the Secession Church of Scotland, to keep authenticated registers, this is the language:\u2014\n\u201cIt shall be lawful for every regularly ordained minister of the United Association Synod of the Secession Church of Scotland, having a permanent and fixed congregation, to obtain, have and keep * * * registers duly authenticated according to law, of all such marriages, baptisms and burials as may be performed or take place under the ministry of such minister or clergyman.\u201d\nI make the point that in each of these particular statutes authority is given of a limited nature. The authority is prayed for in regard to the purposes of the congregation; it refers to baptisms, marriages or burials under the ministry of the minister and I submit the whole effect of the statute is that it never was conceived that any authority was given to these ministers outside of their own church so far as it might affect the rights of other denominations. Your Lordships will find by verification that that is the effect of the statute. I have stated that with respect to one statute and I can state it with respect to all.\nWell now, I come to consider the objections which have been taken to the construction which I have put on article 129. There is an objection which is founded on the second paragraphs of article 129. It is stated, in the first place, that recognizing that the Roman Catholic priests could only celebrate the marriage of their own co-religionists would be to recognize special privileges in the Roman Catholic Church. I respectively submit that that would not be the effect. At all events, to my mind, it would not be a serious argument and I need not do more than mention that objection. The second argument which is of more technical nature is founded on the second paragraph of article 129, which says that none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion and the discipline of the church to which he belongs. The objection is that this provision would be senseless if Roman Catholic priests could only marry their own parishioners. Mr. Justice Archibald states that it would be of no use because then a person against whose marriage an impediment existed could go to another church where such an impediment was not recognized. I think the effect of the second paragraph of article 129 favours the view that Roman Catholics can only be married before their own priests, because it is stated that none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which any impediment exists. My best submission would be that this recognizes an impediment according to the religious belief of the church to which both the parish priest and the parties belong;. To my mind, it does not favour the view that Roman Catholic priests have not exclusive authority quoad their parishioners. On the contrary, if there is no impediment, then surely, under the construction of the second paragraph of 129, the celebration of the marriage can be completed. If there is an impediment, then the law recognizes that impediment because it provides that the priest cannot be compelled to solemnize the marriage. I submit that that is the clear and true meaning of the second paragraph of article 129. It does not go to the length of saying that then somebody else could celebrate the marriage, because if there is an impediment to the marriage I would submit that it cannot be solemnized by anybody. If there is no impediment then the Roman Catholic priest could be compelled to solemnize it. It seems to me that that is a perfect answer to my learned friend\u2019s argument, which is founded on the second paragraph of article 129.\nAnother objection is founded upon the question of marriage licenses. Marriage licenses are issued by officers appointed, in the Province of Quebec, by the Lieutenant-Governor, and the whole object of the marriage license is to dispense with the publication of banns. The granting of marriage licenses in the Province of Quebec is left to certain persons who are appointed or delegated by the Lieutenant-Governor. In order to obtain the issue, of a marriage license it is necessary to give a bond, by two sureties being householders to the extent of $800, stating that no impediment exists to prevent the marriage. The whole object of the marriage license is to dispense with the publication of banns. The Roman Catholic bishop, on the one hand, and the Crown on the other, can both dispense with the publication of banns. The Roman Catholic permission is called a \u201cdispensation\u201d; the permission of the Lieutenant-Governor is called a \u201cmarriage license,\u201d but, the dispensation either of the bishop or the license of the Lieutenant-Governor cannot affect the solemnization of the marriage; in other words, the license does not confer the authority on the officer solemnizing the marriage and, if there be an impediment, the marriage license will not save the marriage from being declared non-existent. Consequently, no sound objection, to my mind, can be founded upon this. But I think there is a distinction made here, the effect of which is significant. The distinction is made between marriages of Roman Catholics and of non-Roman Catholics. As to non-Catholics a license can be obtained; as to Roman Catholics the dispensation is required before the publication of banns can be omitted. But, the license of the Crown cannot relieve the Roman Catholic priest from the necessity of publishing banns any more than the dispensation of the Roman Catholic bishop can relieve the Protestant clergyman from liability from the solemnizing of a marriage without the publication of banns. I take it that no argument of my learned friend can be founded on this, and I submit that it shews a distinction between marriages between Roman Catholics and non-Catholics. There remains one question that I should treat on this branch of the subject, and it is this: Assuming that a marriage between Roman Catholics must be celebrated before a Roman Catholic priest; \u2014 what is the effect of the solemnization of a marriage between two Roman Catholics before a non-Catholic priest? In answer to this, my submission is, that the marriage is non-existent and that there is no valid marriage. The objection is taken that article 152 of the Civil Code refers to marriages contracted in contravention to articles 124, 125, 126, and does not mention article 127, to which I will refer in a moment. I take it that under article 156 such a marriage could be set aside. Article 156 provides:\u2014\n\u201c156. Every marriage which has not been contracted openly, nor solemnized before a competent officer, may be contested by the parties themselves and by those who have an existing and actual interest, saving the right of the court to decide according to the circumstances.\u201d\nThe saving clause has been referred to by both Mr. Justice Charbonneau and Mr. Justice Archibald. I submit that that is taken from the old law. The codifiers, on article 156, refer to Pothier, numbers 361, 362, and 451. The doctrine of Pothier, in a few words, is, that a marriage which is not celebrated before the cur\u00e9 of a party is always null, but that in some cases the courts have been of opinion that the plaintiff was unworthy of being heard and that it was presumed that the priest who had solemnized the marriage had received permission of the parish priest of the parties. That I submit is the effect of the saving clause in article 156. It is taken from Pothier, and Pothier states that the marriage, not celebrated before the cur\u00e9 of the parties, is always null, but that in certain cases the plaintiff has been put out of court being E considered unworthy to be heard. So I submit that, if the marriage be solemnized before another than the proper official, the marriage is null.\nNow, article 161 is cited and 161 says:\u2014\n\u201c161. When the parties are in possession of the status and the certificate of their marriage is produced, they cannot demand the nullity of such act.\u201d\nThat, by all the authorities, is held to refer merely to the certificate of marriage, that is, to the act of marriage; but it does not prevent one of the parties from attacking the marriage itself. It is a mere reference to the act of marriage.\nNow, I shall take up very briefly the provisions of article 127, submitting this point of my case as subsidiary to the first.\nI would like to cite as part of my argument and as bearing on the construction of article 129 the codifieras report on the title of \u201cMarriage,\u201d at page 41, the last paragraph of which reads:\u2014\n\u201cWith the view of preserving to everyone the enjoyment of his own usages and practices according to which the celebration of marriage is entrusted to the ministers of the worship to which he belongs, several provisions are inserted in this title which, although new in form, have nevertheless every source and every cause of existence in the spirit if not in the letter of our legislation.\u201d\nThey were considered to be new in form, but they carried out the spirit of the previous legislation. I also wish to cite to your Lordships an article published by the late Mr. Justice Girouard in the Revue Critique, vol. 3, p. 241. This article is a very exhaustive treatise on the whole subject and contains valuable information, and the learned author construed article 129 as I have done.\nIt seems to me extremely important, in view of the very great gravity, may I say, of the question submitted for your Lordships\u2019 determination, that I may insist once more upon the reasons which underlie the provisions I have quoted. The object of the legislature was to secure, so far as it could be secured by legislation, due publicity of the marriage. The fundamental article under the title of \u201cMarriage\u201d is article 128, which I have referred to and which states that marriage must be solemnized openly by a competent officer recognized by law. The codifier states, and I have cited the reference in the factum at page 7, that the publicity required by the former part of article 128 is with a view of hindering clandestine marriages which are, for reasons, condemned by all systems of law, and they add that the word \u201copenly\u201d has a certain elasticity which makes it preferable to all others, being susceptible of more or less extension. It has been used so that it might be suited to the various interpretations that the various churches and the different religious congregations of the province may require of it according to their customs and usages and the rules peculiar to them upon which it is not wished in any way to innovate. All that was wished was to prevent clandestine marriages.\nTherefore, a fundamental principle of our law of marriage is that the marriage must be celebrated openly, that clandestinity is a radical vice annulling marriage, and, for the purpose of securing the publicity of marriages and the prevention of clandestinity, the law provides ample safeguards requiring the publishing of banns of marriage in the church to which the parties belong. My contention is that the only way to prevent clandestinity is to secure the celebration of the marriage in the place where the parties are known. I do not desire to repeat unnecessarily what I said yesterday, but, as it is so important, I must say again that there would be no object in requiring the publication of the banns in the church to which the parties belonged if the parties could afterwards go to a different part of the province and have their marriage celebrated.\nI must put before your Lordships a statement of the legislation of the Province of Quebec on the subject, up to the present date. We see every day the passage of statutes authorizing religious bodies to keep registers of civil status. Here is a list I compiled from the year 1900 to the year 1911 and I find there no less than 15 statutes passed, all declaring that church bodies shall have the power to keep registers of acts of civil status. I have here the statute of 1900, and in that year no less than five of those statutes were passed by the legislature. They comprise all kinds of bodies. These are Roumanian Jews and other Hebrew organizations, the Free Methodist Church of the Province of Quebec, the Syrian Church, calling themselves the Greek Orthodox Church. The following is the list:\u2014\n\u201cList of special statutes passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec since the year 1900 authorizing religious congregations to keep registers of acts of civil status.\n\u201c1900\u2014Congregation of Roumanian Jews, \u2018Beth David,\u2019 of Montreal, 63 Vict. ch. 107. \u201c1901\u2014Congregation, \u2018The Chevra Kadiska, of Montreal, 1 Edw. VII. ch. 86.\n\u201c1901\u2014The Free Methodist Church of the Province of Quebec, 1 Edw. VII. ch. 87.\n\u201c1902\u2014Congregation, \u2018Beth Hamedrash Haddodol Chevra Shaas,\u2019 2 Edw.

VII. ch. 120.\n\u201c1908\u2014The Congregation, \u2018Beth Budah,\u2019 of Montreal, 8 Edw. VII. ch. 151.\n\u201c1908\u2014The Congregation, \u2018Bais Israel,\u2019 8 Edw.

V. ch. 99.\n\u201c1910\u2014The Syrian Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas, of Canada, 1 Geo. V. ch. 10.\n\u201c1910\u2014The Congregation, \u2018Kehal Jeshurin,\u2019 1 Geo. V. ch. 101.\n\u201c1910\u2014The Jewish Congregation, \u2018Beth Israel,\u2019 of Lachine, 1 Geo. V. ch. 102.\n\u201c1910\u2014The Jewish Congregation, \u2018Nusach Hoaari,\u2019 of Montreal, 1 Geo. V. ch. 103.\n\u201c1911\u2014The Congregation, \u2018Chavayria Hall Yisrael,\u2019 1 Geo.. V., second section, ch. 115.\u201d\nI know nothing of the circumstances which led up to the passing of these statutes. I could venture no opinion which would not be an absolutely rash one as to how long these people were in the country and whether they had suffered under or complained of any of the disabilities referred to. But I do know, and this is the answer to the contention of my learned friend, that so soon as anybody went to the Legislature of the Province of Quebec and asked for these powers the powers were granted.\nMr. Lafleur has made an argument, and insisted on it with much earnestness, that under my construction of article 129 a lot of people could not lawfully contract marriage in the Province of Quebec, but I desire to point out, and this is only secondary to the object for which I cited the statutes, that whenever a religious body desires to get these powers to keep registers they went to the Legislature of Quebec and obtained them.\nAny argument I have made, based on the fact that these people obtained these powers from the Legislature of Quebec, would be in favour of my contention, and an answer to the objection of my learned friend that, under my construction of article 129, people are arriving on our shores every day and that these immigrants cannot get married. I will take up the case of persons who belong to no church in a moment, but what I wish to point out is, and that is why I cited these statutes; what I wish to emphasize to the court is that at the present time a vast number of bodies have obtained and are obtaining from the Legislature of the Province of Quebec authority to keep registers. My argument still is, and I insist on it with all the earnestness I can bring to bear, that all these statutes are special statutes, that, general powers are not given, that any powers which these bodies have are restricted to the persons who belong to these bodies; that the intention of the legislature was not to give them any wider competence than that necessary to register births and celebrate marriages for people who belong to the bodies themselves.\n(Pursuant to questions from the Bench the learned counsel discusses the effect of the conquest on the prior law.)\nI rely on the distinction between the public and the private law. I say the private law remains. The public law is to a certain extent superseded and it is certainly superseded so far as it belongs to the political branch, but I would cite to your Lordships, and I will supplement the authorities I am now citing by others I shall, of course, communicate to Mr. Lafleur; I would cite Salmond on Jurisprudence.\nOn the question of the abrogation of the laws concerning religion I will submit with absolute confidence the capitulation and the treaty. Whatever may be the doctrine of international law as to laws concerning religion, in the present case by reason of the capitulation and treaty stipulations the principles of such international law as is suggested could not be applied here, even though they were adverse to my contention.\nI would ask your Lordships to listen to a quotation from Salmond. He gives the distinction between public and private laws as follows:\u2014\n\u201cPublic law comprises the rules which specially relate to the structure, powers, rights and activities of the state; private law includes all the residue of legal principle. It comprises all those rules which specially concern the subjects of the state in their relations to each other together with these rules which are common to the state and its subjects.\u201d Consequently, private law comprises all these rules which specially concern the subjects of the state in their relations to each other. I would say that laws of religion belong to private law; at least, under our principles it would be an undoubted doctrine to-day. I would also like to refer your Lordships to Holland\u2019s Jurisprudence. At page 168 he treats of marriage as classified under private law. I would also cite to your Lordships on the general question, Halleck\u2019s International Law, vol. 2, p. 516, 4th edition.\nI will read the passage:\u2014\n\u201c\u2018The laws of a conquered country,\u2019 said Lord Mansfield, \u2018continue in force until they are altered by the conqueror; the absurd exceptions as to pagans mentioned in Calvin\u2019s case, shews the universality and antiquity of the maxim. For that distinction could not exist before the Christian era and in all probability arose from the mad enthusiasm of the Crusaders.\u2019 This refers to the municipal laws of the conquered country, but not to its political laws or to the relations of the inhabitants with the Government. On the transfer of territory, it has never been held that the relations of the inhabitants with each other undergo any change. Their relations with their former sovereign are dissolved and new relations are created between them and the Government which has acquired their territory; the law, which may be denominated political, is necessarily changed, although that which regulates the intercourse and general conduct of individuals remains in force until altered by the newly created power of the State. This is a well-settled rule of the law of nations: its provisions are clear and simple, easily understood; but it is not so easy to distinguish between what are political and what are municipal laws, and to determine when and how far the constitution and laws of the conqueror change or replace those of the conquered.\u201d\nI, therefore, take it to be an undoubted principle that the private law is not changed by the effect of the conquest. Coming down to the particular case of the Province of New France, after the capitulation of Quebec and Montreal, the law officers of the Crown were frequently consulted and expressed the opinion that the laws of the Province of Quebec had not been changed by the effect of the conquest. The criminal law was introduced and Attorney-General Thurlow criticized the introduction of the criminal law, but apparently it was done by consent. I submit very confidently, and I can send a list to your Lordships without lengthening unduly the argument, that the law officers of the Crown conceded on every occasion when they were consulted that the conquest had not abrogated the laws and customs of Canada.\nThe law officers of the Crown in England when consulted with reference to the plans of government for Canada expressed the opinion that the King could not by the exercise of his Royal prerogative exempt the Protestant inhabitants of the Province of Quebec from paying tithes to the Roman Catholic clergy. This was cited in the opinion of Chief Justice Lafontaine in Wilcox v. Wilcox (1). I have a copy of the answer by the law officers of the Crown in my hand; the document was, I believe, only found recently. It is referred to in the collection of Short and Doughty, but it was stated that the document had not then been found. Here is what they state on that point:\u2014\n\u201cAs to so much of the 22nd article as exempts Pro (1) 8 L.C.R. 34. testants from paying to the Romish clergy tithes and ecclesiastical dues, we conceive that if by the law and usages of Canada the tithes and dues should belong to the persons who are professing the Roman Catholic religion, His Majesty cannot by his Royal prerogative deprive them of their right to receive or exempt the Protestant inhabitants from the obligation to pay such tithes or other dues.\u201d\nThat document is signed by Sir James Marryat, who was the King\u2019s Advocate, William De Grey, who was Attorney-General, and E. Willis, who was Solicitor-General and afterwards Chief Justice.\nI cite that, of course, as illustrating what I am claiming, that it was never suggested that the laws of the Province of Quebec on a subject of this nature or on a subject concerning religion had been abrogated.\nOn the other question as to whether the establishment came into force by the effect of the conquest I. will first cite to your Lordships the decision of the Privy Council in the Guibord Case[38]:\u2014\n\u201cNor do their Lordships think it necessary to pronounce any opinion upon the difficult questions which were raised in the argument before them touching the precise status, at the present time, of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada. It has, on the one hand, undoubtedly, since the cession, wanted some of the characteristics of an established church; whilst, on the other hand, it differs materially in several important particulars from such voluntary religious societies as the Anglican Church in the colonies, or the Roman Catholic Church in England. The payment of dimes to the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church by its lay members; and the ratability of the latter to the maintenance of parochial cemeteries, are secured by law and statutes. These rights of the church must beget corresponding obligations, and it is obvious that this state of things may give rise to questions between the laity and clergy which can only be determined by the municipal courts. It seems, however, to their Lordships to be unnecessary to pursue this question, because even if this church were to be regarded merely as a private and voluntary religious society resting only upon a consensual basis, courts of justice are still bound, when due complaint is made that a member of the society has been injured as to his rights, in any matter of a mixed spirtual and temporal character, to inquire into the laws or rules of the tribunal or authority which has inflicted the alleged injury.\n\u201cIn the case of Long v. Bishop of Cape Town[39], their Lordships said:\u2014\n\u201cThe Church of England, in places where there is no church established by law, is in the same situation with any other religious body \u2014 in no better, but in no worse position; and the members may adopt, as the members of any other communion may adopt, rules for enforcing discipline within their body which will be binding on those who expressly or by implication have assented to them.\u201d\nThat authority, I submit confidently, is that the Church of England was not an established church in the colonies. It was never an established church in Canada. I submit that the opinion of their Lordships in the Guibord case[40] supports that view. There are no documents which can be cited which would shew that there was an establishment in Canada of the English Church. There are certain instructions issued by the Crown to the Governors who were sent out here to govern Canada. There were two kinds of instructions, and probably your Lordships have read the report of Chief Justice Hay, the second Chief Justice of Quebec under the English rule, on the whole question. Your Lordship will find the report or opinion of Chief Justice Hey in the appendix of the first volume of the Lower Canada Jurist. The Royal instructions are there referred to. There were the private instructions and the instructions under the sign manual which constituted letters patent and which were destined to be published. The former category, or the private instructions, had no force of law and could not be relied upon. The other instructions were of a different character. Now I would say this, that I have read these instructions and, outside of what I stated yesterday, they contain nothing that is of any direct character. They were undoubtedly instructions sent to the Governor to endeavour to do certain things if it were possible or if it were thought advisable, but there is no clause in them, I submit, that would go the length of establishing the English Church in Canada.\nAs to the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London in Canada I will read paragraph 37, which is to be found at page 140 of the volume of Constitutional Documents by Shortt and Doughty:\u2014\n\u201c37. And to the end that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Lord Bishop of London may take place in our province under your Government, as far as conveniently may be, we do think fit, that you give all countenance and encouragement to the exercise of the same, except only as collating to benefices, granting licenses for marriage and probates of wills which we have reserved to you, our Governor and to the Commander in Chief of our said province, for the time being.\u201d\nUndoubtedly, the granting of licenses for marriages was reserved to the Governor of Canada.\nWhile we are on this point I wish to make it doubly clear that there is nothing in this article 37 that points to the establishment of the English Church in Canada.\nParagraph 32 says:\u2014\n\u201cYou are not to admit any ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the See of Rome or any other foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction whatever in the province under your Government.\u201d\nBut that has no bearing on the point. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the See of Rome could be excluded without there being any established church in Canada.\nI will take up the question as to what the English law at the time as to marriage was. Assuming for the sake of argument that the English law concerning marriage was introduced either it was \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act\u201d or the English common law. According to the English common law as defined in the case of Reg. v. Millis[41], the marriage had to be celebrated before a priest.\nTalking the other side of the argument, that under English law at that time marriage per verba de pr\u0153senti was considered a valid marriage then, if the English law was introduced into the Province of Quebec by the effect of the conquest, a marriage in a certain form would be valid if the parties were Protestants and a marriage in another form would have to be resorted to if the parties were Catholics. I am submitting, if it is held that the English law was introduced, that there would be endless confusion. I would understand the logic of the proposition that the whole English law was introduced as to the old inhabitants as well as to the others, but there were the treaty stipulations which prevented this law being applied to the old inhabitants of the colony. Then, I say, that, in the absence of anything shewing that the English law was introduced, with the single exception of marriage licenses, that we are bound to assume that there was no English law introduced on the subject.\nThe license system could not be applied in view of the stipulations to the Roman Catholics. It was at most \u00e0 dispensation of the necessity for publishing the banns. The subject of marriage licenses is not unknown; I think it can be traced far back in the history of England. Dispensations were granted by the Pope prior to the Reformation and afterwards by a statute which was passed, I think, in the reign of Henry VIII., the authority was granted to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Crown has exercised the jurisdiction to grant marriage licenses as part of the Royal prerogative, but it does not shew that the English law of marriage was introduced into this country. There is nothing to shew that. We have\u201d absolutely no documents and no decision under the English law upholding the contention that the English law was introduced here. The first decision that can have any bearing on the subject is the decision of Chief Justice Sewell in Ex parte Spratt[42]. That was after the statute of 1795 and it was on a question whether dissenting ministers had the right under the statute of 1795 to obtain registers of acts of civil status, and he decided that they had not for the reason that they were not in holy orders. The reason I refer to the decision is that it is the earliest on the subject which could have any relation to marriage and the authorities he quotes therein are all French authorities. It may be that looking carefully into old court registers something may be discovered, but certainly nothing has ever been published up to this date.\nThen, my Lord, if that be the case, I would rely on the general principles of international law, that the private law is not abrogated by the effect of the conquest. I point out to your Lordships, as extremely significant, that my learned friends on the other side who are interested in setting out any authority pointing to the introduction of the English law, have not done so, outside of the judgment of Mr. Justice Archibald, who merely expresses an opinion and who is not in any better position than we are to determine the question. I would say, therefore, and I believe I am warranted in saying so, that under the general rule we cannot assume that the English law as to marriage was introduced.\nThen, looking at the treaty stipulations, it has never been doubted that I am aware of that they secured absolute independence \u2014 I am using that word advisedly \u2014 to the Roman Catholics and to their clergy. Whatever doubt there may have been on account of certain answers made by General Amherst, on some points which were put to him at the time of the capitulation of Montreal there is no doubt as to the guarantee of the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion. The wording of the capitulations is worthy of attention. I refer to the articles of the capitulation of Quebec, and the articles of the capitulation of Montreal. The articles of the capitulation of Quebec, 1759, read:\u2014\n\u201cArticles de Capitulation de Qu\u00e9bec, 1759.\n\u201cArticles de capitulation demand\u00e9s par M. de Ramzay, Lieutenant pour le Roy commandant les haute et basse villes de Qu\u00e9bec, Ch. de l\u2019Ordre Royal & Militaire de St. Louis, \u00e0 son Excellence Monsieur le General des troupes de sa Majest\u00e9 Britanique.\n\u201cThe capitulation demanded on the part of the enemy, and granted by their Excellencies Admiral Saunders and General Townshend, etc., etc., etc., is in manner and form hereafter expressed.\u201d\n\u201cArticle 2.\n\u201cQue les habitans soient conserv\u00e9s dans la possession de leur maisons, biens, effets et privileges.\n\u201cGranted upon their laying down their arms.\n\u201cArticle 6.\n\u201cQue l\u2019exercice de la relligion Catholique, apostolique et romaine sera conserv\u00e9; que Ton donnera des sauvegardes aux maisons des eccl\u00e9siastiques, relligieux et relligieuses, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 Mgr. l\u2019Ev\u00e8que de Qu\u00e9bec, qui rempli de z\u00e8le pour la re relligion et de charit\u00e9 pour le peuple de son dioc\u00e8se d\u00e9sire y rester constamment, exercer librement et avec le d\u00e9cense que son \u00e9tat et les sacres myst\u00e8res de la relligion Catholique, apostolique, et romaine exigent, son authorit\u00e9 episcopale dans la ville de Qu\u00e9bec lorsqu\u2019il jugera apropos, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la possession de Canada ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par un trait\u00e9 entre S. M. T. C. et S. M. B.\n\u201cThe free exercise of the Roman religion is granted, likewise safeguards to all religious persons, as well as to the Bishop, who shall be at liberty to come and exercise freely and with decency, the functions of his office, whenever he shall think proper and until the possession of Canada shall have been decided between their Britannic and most Christian Majesties.\n\u201cQue la pr\u00e9sente capitulation sera ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e suivant sa forme et teneur, sans qu\u2019elle puisse \u00eatre sujette \u00e0 l\u2019inex\u00e9cution sous pr\u00e9texte de represailles ou d\u2019une inex\u00e9cution de quelque capitulation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n\u201cGranted.\n\u201cLe pr\u00e9sente trait\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et arret\u00e9 double entre nous au camp devant Qu\u00e9bec, le 18 Septembre, 1759.\n\u201cChas Saunders.\n\u201cGeo. Townshend.\n\u201cDe Ramzay.\u201d\nThe articles of the capitulation of Montreal, 1760, read:\u2014\n\u201cArticles de Capitulation de Montr\u00e9al, 1760.\n\u201cArticles de capitulation entre son Excellence le G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Amherst Commandant-en-Chef les troupes & forces de sa Majest\u00e9 Britanique en l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Septentrionale, et son Excellence le Mis., de Vaudreuil, Grand Croix de l\u2019Ordre Royal et Militaire de St. Louis, Gouverneur et Lieutenant G\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour le Roy in Canada.\n\u201cArticle 27.\n\u201cLe libre exercise de la Religion Catholique, apostolique et Romaine, subsistera en son entier; en sorte que tous les estats et les peuples de villes et des campagnes, lieux et postes \u00e9loign\u00e9s pourront continuer de s\u2019assembler dans les \u00e9glises, et de frequenter les sacramens comme cy devant, san estre inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 en aucun mani\u00e8re, directment ou indirectment.

Amherst.\u201d\nYou will see that there is no restriction as to the free exercise of their religion, and your Lordships will notice in what wide terms this was demanded by article 27, and it is granted without any restriction except as to the obligation to pay tithes to the clergy.\nThe word \u201cestats\u201d is used meaning, no doubt, \u201corders.\u201d The clergy were a distinct order as well as the noblesse. There were the three orders, the clergy, the noblesse and\u201d the tiers d\u2019\u00e9tat, which swallowed up the two others. Now, take the Treaty of Paris, which is material in this connection. After saying that His Most Christian Majesty renounces all pretensions to Nova Scotia and Acadia and so forth, it says:\u2014\n\u201cHis Britannic Majesty on his side agrees to grant the liberty of the Catholic religion to the inhabitants of Canada; he will consequently give the most precise and most effectual orders, that his new Roman Catholic subjects may profess the worship of their religion, according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church as far as the laws of Great Britain permit.\u201d As to the restriction which has been referred to several times, there is abundance of opinion as to what effect the restriction could have.\nI would take it, and I think I can say so, that my position, which I conceive to be founded on authority is, that the Treaty of Paris did not supersede the capitulation. I will be able to refer your Lordship\u2019s to authority for that basis. What is stated is that the treaty is a contract between one Government and another Government, but the Articles of Capitulation is between a Government and the inhabitants of a country. I think your Lordship will find that in the case of Campbell v. Hall[43]. The inhabitants of the country, in consideration of their laying down their arms, are granted certain privileges. To my mind it is an undoubted principle founded on reason that a treaty is between two nations and capitulation is a pact \u2014 I do not think I can choose a more proper term \u2014 between the conqueror and the inhabitants, so I will say that I am entitled to look at these three documents as forming the title for the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion. I would think that the stipulations of the capitulation cover my point, that the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion is guaranteed. I would say that it is guaranteed to the church as much as to the inhabitants. It was guaranteed to all orders of Canadian society. My position on this branch of the argument would be that marriage, according to the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, is a sacrament, and I would say the administration of the sacraments is exclusively attributed to the ministry of the priests of the Roman Catholic Church, and that if any interference with this administration of the sacraments were permitted it would be a violation of these stipulations. I submit that these reasons are fundamental and that they would cover the construction of the provisions which I have cited to your Lordships.\nThen, I have shewn what the construction of these articles are; that article 129 must be, restricted as I have stated and I shall not repeat what I have said on that subject.\nBefore I touch on article 127, I desire to say something which I began to say this morning, namely: that the object of the law is to prevent clandestinity of marriage, that if my learned friends\u2019 contentions are right, clandestinity is rendered not only possible but extremely easy, that some restriction must be put on the provisions of the law to secure the due publicity of marriage, and that the number of religious bodies obtaining statutory authority, as I have shewn, is increasing so rapidly that it becomes a fundamental necessity that the views of the codifiers and that\u2019 the proper construction of article 129 be insisted upon. If my children wanted to contract marriage, in spite of my objection and in spite of the impediments that might be against it, it would not be possible for me to prevent it because some of these people might have a church or place of meeting in a back store, and if my learned friends\u2019 contention is right, that means they will have as much authority as anybody else, then there would be thousands of clergymen irrespective of locality, irrespective of religion, who could solemnize marriage. If that system is to be allowed under my learned friends\u2019 contention, then the law has failed in its main object to secure the publicity and non-clandestinity of marriage.\nArticle 127 of the Civil Code provides:\u2014\n\u201c127. The other impediments recognized, according to the different religious persuasions, as resulting from relationship or affinity, or from other causes; remains subject to the rules hitherto followed in the different churches and religious communities.\u201d\n\u201cThe right, likewise, of granting dispensations from such impediments, appertains, as heretofore, to those who have hitherto enjoyed it.\u201d\nArticle 127 follows articles 124, 125, and 126 which prescribe what might be called the scriptural impediments to marriage as resulting from relationship in the Levitical degrees; marriage in the direct line, ascending or descending; marriage, between brothers and sisters; marriage between uncles and nieces, or between nephews and aunts. After these provisions, article 127 is introduced as a general provision purporting to cover all other impediments.\nThe codifiers at first drafted this article, so that it read:\u2014\n\u201cThe other impediments admitted according to the different religious persuasions as resulting from relation or affinity within the degree of cousinsgerman and other degrees, remain subject,\u201d etc.\nThe codifiers presented a supplementary report in which the words, \u201cwithin the degree of cousins germane and other degrees\u201d were stricken from the article, and the words, \u201cor other causes\u201d introduced. They explained why they did so. One of them, Mr. Justice Day, dissented. The explanation shewed clearly what the meaning, in the opinion of the codifiers, was to be placed on the article. The majority of the codifiers say:\u2014 \u201cTwo of the commissioners recommend a modification of article 11a in the title of marriage, in order to remove all doubt as to the intention to leave the subject in the same state as it is at present,\n\u201cMr. Commissioner Day dissents from the proposed change, because, by the addition of the words \u2018other causes,\u2019 it has the effect of extending the grounds of impediment contemplated by the article as adopted, and appears to him to recognize, as legal impediments, certain obstructions to marriage, dependent upon ecclesiastical rules and discipline, and binding only upon the conscience of the parties whom they affect.\u201d\nI understand my learned friends to take the position that the word \u201cand other causes\u201d must be controlled by the impediments mentioned in articles 124, 125, and 126 as being ejusdem generis, with the impediments mentioned in these articles. The intention of the codifiers would appear to have been entirely different, and further I would say that this rule cannot be applied for the following reasons: in the first place, the rule ejusdem generis does not apply where the genus is entirely exhausted or covered by the preceding words. For instance, if the words which precede exhaust the whole genus, then to give some meaning to the general words following it is necessary to give them more extension. It is only when the general words following such a word compel the enumeration of the special words that they can be restricted to things of similar nature to those mentioned by the special words in the statute. I take that to be the undoubted rule of legal interpretation. Well now, the very wording of the article shews that it was intended here to give a greater extension to the meaning of the words \u201cor other causes\u201d because the first impediments were impediments which have been recognized at all times and I think in all systems by the civil law. Here it was proposed to introduce a new set of impediments which would vary according to the belief of each church. There is in article 127 an enumeration of all causes of impediment, that is to say, causes of impediment resulting from relationship or affinity, and I would say that that relationship or affinity comprises the whole genus of impediments which result from those causes. Then, there were other impediments recognized by different canonical systems which were different. There was the impediment resulting from holy orders, from perpetual vows; there were several impediments of a similar nature. I submit that the words \u201cother causes\u201d comprise all these impediments. They may vary according to the different churches, and it was so intended by the codifiers, and it was deemed by the codifiers impossible to make the enumeration that would be absolutely necessary. It was impossible to do so by reason of the number of religious societies which were in contemplation of the law, and it was necessary to provide by a general article for all these impediments which were recognized by each church, and which had received the passive, if not the express consent, of the members of each church to the rule which their church had decreed. My learned friends opposite say that these impediments are impediments recognized by the civil law. I confess I am unable to follow this argument. Ie seems to me self-evident that the impediments referred to here are impediments not already recognized under the civil law, because the different articles have enumerated the impediments of the civil law. I submit that these are canonical impediments; impediments that have been recognized by the different canonical systems.\nI will discuss the argument which I understand is made, that, these impediments referred to are not necessarily the impediments known to the civil law, but they must be impediments of a similar nature to those enumerated in the three preceding articles. I take issue with my learned friends on this point; I take issue absolutely with them and my submission is respectfully that their contention cannot be maintained, or otherwise article 127 would have absolutely no meaning.\nIf my learned friends suggest any impediment of the same nature as those enumerated or of a similar nature, that could, be comprised by article 127, it would not be necessary to my argument to say that impediments resulting from more remote degrees of relation would, be of a similar nature and would be comprised in article 127. But article 127 enumerates the impediments resulting from relationship or affinity, and consequently the words \u201cor other causes\u201d would have no effect at all. And, as it is necessary to give them an effect, I would say that the construction claimed by my learned friends cannot be sustained. My submission is that it was intended to recognize all canonical impediments without it being thought advisable to attempt any enumeration of them. The impediment of clandestinity was an impediment by the canon law; I think there can be no question about that. It was made in express terms an impediment by the Council of Trent. It greatly strengthens my point that clandestinity was recognized as an impediment by the civil law in France although the decrees of the Council of Trent were not received in France. Nevertheless, the impediments resulting from clandestinity were recognized in France. The old ordinances of the French Kings were to the same effect on this point as the decrees of the Council of Trent. Some of your Lordships are no doubt familiar with the verse in which the canonical impediments were enumerated and among these there is a reference to the impediment of clandestinity. It was also recognized as an impediment; the Council of Trent made it one. This is the verse:\u2014\n\u201cError, conditio, votum, cognatio, crimen, Cultus disparitas, vis, ordo, ligamen, honestas, Aetas, affinis, si forte coire nequibis, Si parochi et duplicis desit pr\u00e6sentia testis, Rapta si sit mulier, nec parti reddita tutas, H\u00e6c facienda vetant connubia, facta retractant.\u201d\nI think that would be absolutely beyond question now, and it has never been questioned by any writer on the French law; on the contrary, the authority is all the other way, that clandestinity was an impediment. I have given in the factum several references and these references enumerate clandestinity among the impediments which were recognized in France in spite of the fact that the decrees of Council of Trent had not been received there.\nI have given in the factum several references to writers under the old French law, shewing that clandestinity was considered in France as an absolute impediment to marriage. I may, perhaps, read a few extracts.\nThus Durand de Maillane, Dictionnaire de Droit Canonique, \u201cEmp\u00eachement,\u201d p. 305, 2nd column, says: \u201cLe Concile de Trente a ajout\u00e9 deux autres emp\u00eachements dirimants qui subsistent dans les lieux o\u00f9 ses d\u00e9crets sont en usage; savoir, la clandestinit\u00e9 et le rapt.\u201d\nPage 306, 1st column:\u2014\n\u201cA l\u2019\u00e9gard des emp\u00eachements dirimants, nous admittons en France les douze qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9daient le Concile de Trente, et les deux que ce Concile a ajout\u00e9s.\u201d\nPage 314, 2nd column:\u2014\n\u201cXIII. Emp\u00eachement, clandestinit\u00e9, si parochi et duplicis desit praesentia testis. Voyez Clandestin, mariage.\u201d\nNouveau Denisart, V. Emp\u00eachement de mariage, vol. 7, p. 518:\u2014\n\u201cXIII. 30. Le d\u00e9faut de c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du mariage en face de l\u2019\u00e9glise par le cur\u00e9 du domicile des parties ce qui forme le dix-huiti\u00e8me et dernier emp\u00eachement dirimant.\u201d\nThese extracts will suffice for the purpose of my argument, the other references in the factum being absolutely to the same effect.\nIt seems to me it would be idle to say that such an impediment would be an impediment more in word than in essence because what article 127 intended to cover were the impediments recognized by the canon law, and if this is an impediment recognized by a canon law, as it undoubtedly is, it is covered by the terms of article 127: Mr. Justice Charbonneau (p. 117 of 18 R.L.N.S. and p. 267 of the Q.R. 41 S.C.) cites Pothier (ed. Bugnet, vol. 5, p. 45,) as considering as an impediment \u201cune d\u00e9qualification subjective, inherente \u00e0 la personne des conjoints.\u201d But Pothier says, vol. 5, at page 42 (ed. Bugnet), No. 85:\u2014 \u201cNous ne traiterons, dans toute cette partie, que des emp\u00eachements de mariage qui se rencontrent dans les personnes. Il y a d\u2019autres emp\u00eachements qui naissent du d\u00e9faut de quelqu\u2019une des choses qui sont requises pour la validit\u00e9 des mariages; cette mati\u00e8re sera trait\u00e9e dans la quatri\u00e8me partie.\u2019\nAnd in the fourth part of his work he treats of clandestinity.\nIt is to be observed that Pothier, in the part cited, stated that clandestinity was absolutely recognized theretofore as an impediment by the canon law. My submission is that, under article 127, consequently, this impediment would render a marriage between two Catholics, before any other than a Roman Catholic priest, impossible. A valid marriage between two Catholics, before any other than a Roman Catholic priest is impossible. The impediment being of the class of absolute impediments, would import nullity.\nThere is another point I should touch on and that is the effect of the impediment as casting a nullity on the marriage. The very nature of an absolute impediment creates nullity. The objection of Mr. Justice Charbonneau is that the nullity is not declared and he says that, by article 152, an action of nullity is given to all parties interested to set aside marriages contracted in violation of articles 124, 125, and 126. But there is no mention of article 127. My submission is that article 127 is comprised quoad an action of nullity. Then by article 156 of the Civil Code:\u2014\n\u201c156. Every marriage which has not been contracted openly, nor solemnized before a competent officer, may be contested by the parties themselves and by all those who have an existing and actual interest, saving the right of the court to decide according to the circumstances.\u201d\nArticle 156 gives an action in nullity to the parties themselves and to all who have an actual interest. The action in nullity is given in each case to the same class of persons. So, I submit that Mr. Justice Charbonneau is wrong when he says that there is no action to have the marriage set aside by reason of the impediment of clandestinity. The decrees of the Council of Trent were published in the Province of Quebec. Of course, on this submission to this court, certain facts, if material, must be taken, I would not say as admitted, but as not contested. I have two certificates from the Vicars-General of Quebec and Montreal stating that the \u201cTametsi\u201d decree of the Council of Trent is read once a year in every church of the Province of Quebec.\nThe following are the certificates:\u2014\n\u201cWe, the undersigned, Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Quebec, in the Province of Quebec, hereby certify that the decree \u2018Tametsi\u2019 concerning the reform of marriage, adopted in the 24th session, 1st chapter, of the Council of Trent, was promulgated by Monseigneur de Saint-Vallier, Second Bishop of Quebec, in the Rituel du dioc\u00e8se de Qu\u00e9bec (edition of 1703) and moreover, that the ordinance requiring the said decree to be read once a year, contained in the said Rituel, judging by the invariable tradition, custom and practice regarding such ordinances, and a personal experience of forty years as regards the Basilica of Quebec, has been executed, and that the text of the said decree has been read in each parish of the Archdiocese of Quebec on the first Sunday after Epiphany since its promulgation until the Decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, 2nd August, 1907, came into force.\n\u201cC. A. Marois, V.G.\n\u201cSeal.\n\u201cArchbishop\u2019s Palace of Quebec,\n\u201cApril 29th, 1912.\u201d\n\u201cMontreal, le 25 avril, 1912.\n\u201cWe, the undersigned, Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, hereby certify that the decree \u201cTametsi\u201d concerning the reform of marriage, adopted in the 24th session, 1st chapter of the Council of Trent, has, since the erection of the Diocese of Montreal and until the promulgation of the decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council of the 2nd August, 1907, been read each year in each parish church of this diocese on the first Sunday after Epiphany.\n\u201cGiven at Montreal, under the seal of the Archdiocese this 25th day of April, 1912.\n\u201cEmile Roy, Canon.\n\u201cVicar-General.\u201d\nAnd the Benedictine Decree was introduced in Canada in 1764. It was published in 1741. The Bishop of Quebec, at the time of the cession, was Mgr. Pontbriand, and he died before Montreal was surrendered and the Vicars-General of Quebec administered the See of Quebec until his successor was appointed some six years afterwards, and questions were put to the court of Rome and the answer was given extending the Benedictine declaration.\nMy submission to the court is, therefore, that the answer to sub-question (a) should be in the affirmative. On sub-question (b) I will state frankly that I do not consider I have any satisfactory reason to give to the court under the construction of article 127. I think it will be sufficient for me to say that the Benedictine Decree concludes the matter.\nThat, my Lords, is the case and the argument which I have to lay before the court.\nHellmuth K.C.\u2014I propose, my Lords, to deal with the first and third questions, both of which may be characterized as questions of jurisdiction.\nThe question of jurisdiction is necessarily, my Lords, an extremely important question, not only for the Dominion and the provinces, but in this matter, for, one might almost say, the people throughout Christendom generally, because for a great many years the lex loci contract\u00fbs has always been the law which, in one respect, governs the validity of a marriage. That is to say, if an Englishman, or a Frenchman, or a German, or an Austrian, came out to Canada and was married here, assuming that by his own law, the lex domicili, he and the woman with whom he desired to contract marriage were capable of contracting it, the absolute validity of that marriage would depend upon whether the parties had observed the form and ceremony prescribed by the law of the place of celebration. Therefore, it is a question whether the law of the place of celebration rests with the Dominion or rests with the individual provinces to enact. If it were to be held that under the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d the law of the place of celebration is that of the province \u2014 whether it be in Ontario or Quebec or any other province \u2014 then any law that might be passed in this respect by the Dominion of Canada would be entirely beyond its powers, and the parties who might assume that they had been married according to the law of the Dominion of Canada in regard to the mode of celebration, would find there had been no valid marriage at all. I say, at the very outset, that this question of jurisdiction involves not merely the rights of the provinces and the rights of the Dominion but the rights of people of other countries, who, although their domicile may be that of a foreign country, may come to the various provinces and be married.\nPerhaps, at the outset, one should inquire what is necessary to constitute a valid marriage. Undoubtedly, consent is necessary, but following consent there are two absolute essentials, or, perhaps, I should say an essential and a requisite, because I think the words are used in that sense in some of the authorities. There must be, of course, capacity to contract and that is invariably governed by the law of the domicile, and, in the second place \u2014 I am differing here entirely from my friends on the other side \u2014 there must be, in order to constitute a valid legal marriage, a celebration or a going through of the form prescribed by the law of the place where the marriage is celebrated. That is covered by innumerable authorities. Dicey, on the Law of Domicile, at page 15, lays down this rule, Eule 44:\u2014\n\u201cSubject to the exception hereinafter mentioned, a marriage is valid when (1) each of the parties has, according to the law of his or her place of domicile, the capacity to marry the other, and, (2) any one of the following conditions as to the form of celebration is complied with; that is to say: (1) if the marriage is celebrated in accordance with any form recognized as valid by the law of the country where the marriage is celebrated, called hereinafter the local form.\u201d\nHe goes on and deals with extra-territorial marriages, and so on, in embassies, and he lays down the requisites in these cases. At page 155, in relation to the subject, he says:\u2014\n\u201cThe result is that the validity of a marriage, with the right depending on its validity, is governed by two different laws, namely: (1) by the law of the parties\u2019 domicile which determines their capacity to contract; by the law of the place where the marriage is celebrated which determines in general the formal requisites of the marriage.\u201d\nThen I cite a very old writer, Shelford, on Marriages and Divorce, at page 5 of the original, which we have not in the library, the page of the book in the library is 27. The heading of the article is: \u201cValidity Depends upon Conformity to Law.\u201d I may say, my Lords, that I am not now in any way dealing with the question of church decrees or anything of that kind; I am dealing with the civil contract of marriage, if one can speak of marriage as a contract at all, which Mr. Bishop seems somewhat to doubt. Bishop says you may call a marriage a contract as you may call a locomotive a horse, because there are more things in which marriage differs from a contract than in which it complies with the terms of a contract. But, there is no doubt there is a portion of marriage which is a contract, it involves the consensual contract of the parties to it, but this is only the beginning of the creation of a valid marriage. Shelford says:\u2014\n\u201cMarriage being a civil contract its validity depends on its having been celebrated in the manner, and with the formalities required by law. In some countries only one form of contracting marriage is acknowledged; thus in England, after the \u201cMarriage Act,\u201d with the exception of Jews and Quakers, all marriages were required to be celebrated according to the form prescribed by the Church of England.\u201d\nThat is to say, that people could not say in England: we desire to be married, we take one another for man and wife, we will go through all kinds of solemn forms; for the law says you must have an Anglican clergyman pronounce you man and wife or you are not married at all. The questions, when I shall come to them are entirely irregular in form, because it is not a question of declaring a marriage null and void; there is absolutely nothing creating the marriage status, no matter what form may be gone through, unless you comply with the requirements of the local law in regard to its celebration. I refer also to Hammick in \u201cThe Marriage Law of England,\u201d second edition, page 23; Foote, second edition, page 70; Eversley & Crays, Marriage Laws of the British Empire, pages 2 and 53; Ringrose, Marriage and Divorce Laws of the World, at page 18.\nA marriage that might be perfectly good according to the forms of England, between parties capable of contracting, but which was celebrated in France where the English form has no force or validity, but where other forms and ceremonies were prescribed, would only be good if celebrated according to the forms prescribed in France, where the marriage is celebrated; except, of course, in exceptional cases when people get married at the embassies. I have the authority here of the House of Lords in regard to that matter, where in one case marriage was celebrated in Austria, between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, according to the form, and the only form, in which marriage could be celebrated in Austria, which was by a Roman Catholic priest. Although that Protestant man, at that time, was, by the law applicable in Ireland, the place of his domicile, not entitled to marry a Roman Catholic by means of a Roman Catholic priest and could not have been so married in Ireland \u2014 the Roman Catholic priest would have been liable at that time to have been hanged or something of that kind, if he had celebrated the marriage \u2014 yet the House of Lords, not later than this very year, held that the marriage celebrated in Austria was a perfectly legal and valid marriage, because it had complied with the lex loci celebrationis, and that the law of the domicile could not be put beyond its territory. That is the case of Swifte v. The Attorney-General for Ireland[44]. The House of Lords held in that case that the law in regard to Roman Catholics in Ireland was only territorial, and only applied, so far as the celebration was concerned, to the celebration of a marriage in Ireland. Indeed, their Lordships, in upholding the judgment of the courts in Ireland, adopted the reasoning of the courts there, and I ask your Lordships to seethe reasoning of the judges in Ireland, because it is the latest case, practically, on this subject[45].\nThen, the question may arise (and again I differ from my learned friend, Mr. Nesbitt): What was the common law of England either at the time of the conquest or at the time of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d? My submission to your Lordships is, that from the time of King Edmund, the Saxon King, A.D. 940, down to the time of the Reformation, the common law of England was that no person could be married in England, except a mass priest was present. And, after the Reformation, the common law of England was that no person could be married except either by a priest or a deacon. That that is so, has never been questioned since the decision in Reg, v. Millis(1). The old rule, as taken from Thorpe\u2019s edition of the Ancient Laws, page 505, is cited in the edition of Holmsted on the Marriage Laws of Canada. I cannot express my concurrence in what Mr. Holmsted says throughout by any means, but I quite accept his citation from Thorpe. Rule 8 of Thorpe \u2014 this is in the time of Edmund \u2014 says:\u2014\n\u201cAt the nuptials there shall be a mass priest by law who shall, with God\u2019s blessing, bind their union to all posterity.\n\u201c9. While, it is also to be looked to that it be known that they, through kinship, be not too nearly allied, lest they be afterwards divided, which before were wrongly joined.\u201d\nWe get some way back there and we find that after the Millis Case[46] in 1844, there was an equal division of opinion in the House of Lords as to whether that was or was not the common law of England, or whether it was not competent and sufficient for two persons who were capable of contracting, who had the capacity, to come together and solemnly per verba de pr\u0153senti declare that they were married. There was, as I say, an equal division of opinion in the House of Lords as to that, and my learned friend, Mr. Nesbitt, read the very able and wonderfully researchful judgment of Lord Brougham. But my learned friend did not say that it was a dissenting judgment. It was a judgment that did not prevail because, the House being equally divided, the judgment of the court below, which held that the common law of England did require a priest to be present, was upheld, and Lord Campbell, who joined with Lord Brougham, in the dissent, was able, in Beamish v. Beamish[47]., to frankly say that while his opinion as one of these dissenting in The Queen v. Millis[48] was an opinion that he might still hold, yet, that the decision in The Queen v. Millis45 was absolutely binding upon him. He said: \u201cHowever, it must now be considered as having been determined by this House that there could never have been a valid marriage in England before the Reformation without the presence of a priest episcopally ordained, or afterwards without the presence of a priest or of a deacon.\u201d\nOne cannot find language, stronger, clearer, or more definite than that. The very judge, who had dissented in the previous case of Millis45, says that what he formerly contended, against must now be held to be the law of England.\nNow, my Lords, I do not wish, at this stage, to take up time unnecessarily, but I think it is incumbent on me at least to point your Lordships to the authorities which render this view practically \u2014 I do not wish to use too strong language \u2014 practically unassailable. There is, in fact, I may say, no decision to the contrary. One can find in some of the States of the Union expressions in regard to common law marriages, but they have no application to any country that is under English rule, in any shape or form. There is no such thing as a common law marriage in England or Canada; there is in Scotland.\nIn Brook v. Brook[49], dealing there with the matter of English subjects domiciled in England, but who had gone to Denmark to be married, and where the other side of the essential or requisite of marriage came up for consideration \u2014 that is, where the offence against the law of domicile could not be cured no matter how correctly the form had been followed \u2014 in that case a man went to Denmark with the view of marrying his deceased wife\u2019s sister, then a marriage incapable of being contracted in England. He was married according to the forms necessary in Denmark and according to the then law of Denmark it was a legal marriage. But, he had only gone there for the purpose of getting married, and he did not in any way abandon or give up his English domicile. The House of Lords in that case held that the marriage was invalid for want of capacity to contract it in such a case.\nI refer to Lord Campbell\u2019s judgment, at page 207. It is laid down here that although the form of celebrating a marriage may be different from that required by the law of the country of domicile, that marriage may be good everywhere; but if the contract of marriage is such in essentials as to be contrary to the law of the country of domicile, and is declared void by that law, it is to be regarded as void in the country of domicile though not contrary to the law of the country in which it is celebrated. This qualification upon the general rule that a marriage valid where celebrated is good everywhere, is to be found in the writings of many eminent jurists who have, discussed the subject.\nI refer further to what Lord Campbell says, at page 218, and Lord Cranworth, at page 223, in discussing another marriage.\nOne more case I cite to your Lordships, the case of Catherwood v. Caslon[50], judgment of Baron Parke, at page 265.\nThat case goes to shew, as it is laid down, that the mere proof of ceremony is not enough; they must comply otherwise with the requirements of the law. A well-known case was cited here, from a judgment in Lower Canada, in the case of Connolly v. Woolrich[51], and your Lordships will find some remarks there quite apposite in regard to this very subject-matter. At page 244, in the judgment, it is said:\u2014\n\u201cBy what law is the validity of marriage, to be decided?\u201d\nAnd then the judgment says:\u2014\n\u201cValidity of marriage depends upon the lex loci of the place of solemnization.\u201d\nAnd for that, several authorities are given.\nNow, I challenge any possible dispute on the proposition that in order to constitute a valid marriage there must be a solemnization. That is, there must be a going through of such forms and ceremonies, whether those be of the most primitive character or of the most elaborate ritual, as are prescribed by the laws of the place where it is celebrated, and that there is no such a thing in Canada, and never has been since the time of the conquest, any law by which there could be a marriage, merely on a consensual contract. But, my Lords, in this case, it is not at all an instance of the Dominion Parliament, by its bill, attempting to say \u2014 marriage may be celebrated, or a valid marriage may be created or constituted by the mere consent of the parties. The promoters of this bill have boldly come out and said \u2014 we propose to deal with the solemnization of marriage. They have, by the very language they have used in the bill, stated that in plain words. The bill says \u201cevery ceremony or form of marriage (that is, every solemnization of marriage) before or hereafter performed by any person authorized to perform any ceremony of marriage.\u201d Let me take a concrete illustration: Rabbi Jacobs, of Toronto \u2014 with great respect for him \u2014 is authorized to celebrate, by the laws of the Province of Ontario, a marriage between Jews of his congregation and professing his faith, and between nobody else, and two Christians go to Rabbi Jacobs and are married. The Dominion Parliament, under this bill, would say that, as Rabbi Jacobs is authorized to perform a certain ceremony between Jews, that ceremony of marriage which he has performed between Christians, and which he is not authorized by the Provincial law to perform, is perfectly good.\nI think somebody has pointed out that the bill only says that a validly solemnized marriage is valid. I do not think that is arguable. Let me get it down again to a concrete case. If the Province of Quebec says a Roman Catholic priest is the only person who is authorized to perform a marriage between two Roman Catholics, if a Protestant of any denomination does perform that ceremony, the bill says it is valid. It cannot mean anything else. It simply means \u2014 we will amend your solemnization of marriage law and widen and broaden it. The Dominion, in effect, says to the province: you cannot say this person may solemnize this marriage, and that person may solemnize some other marriage, but if you give a man authority to solemnize any marriage, you must give him authority to solemnize all marriages. That is the meaning of that bill and I submit to the court that no other meaning can be taken out of it. And that being so, we have the Dominion at once stepping in to deal with matters exclusively assigned to the province, one of which is the solemnization of marriage. Why stop there; why not say \u2014 the province must authorize everybody to solemnize marriage; the province must put no limit in any respect in regard to the form? My submission is, that the Province of Ontario to-day, or the Province of Quebec to-morrow, can alter in any way they, see fit their laws in regard to the solemnization of marriage.\nIt comes simply down to this, that you say to the province: you may play with solemnization of marriage, you may enact penalties, but nobody need pay any particular attention to them; you cannot actually carry out what is admitted in regard to every other subject of legislation assigned to the province; you cannot carry the thing to its logical conclusion; you cannot say that a marriage not solemnized according to your power under the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d is not valid. The bill means that, or there is nothing in it at all. The argument with regard to consensual contracts being sufficient is not open to my learned friends on the other side upon this bill, because they boldly say that the solemnization which the province has laid down is not necessary, in certain cases, or else, this bill means nothing.\nI am going to ask your Lordships, if you come to the conclusion that the Parliament of Canada has no power to enact this particular bill, if you think it necessary or wise or just that the second question should be answered at all. If the Parliament of Canada has no part or parcel in jurisdiction in regard to the solemnization of marriage, if the question of the solemnization of marriage does rest with the province, why then should the Dominion request your Lordships to answer what the law in any province is. If they cannot amend or alter it, should it require amendment or alteration, and if that must be done by the provincial legislature, is it not that legislature only which should ask your Lordships what is the meaning of their own laws. Can the Dominion, in relation to a subject in regard to which they have no legislative capacity \u2014 let us take some subject which is entirely within their jurisdiction beyond all question, such as contracts \u2014 can the Dominion ask your Lordships with regard to a contract, which is solely concerned with the sale of lands in the province, what the meaning of the legislation of the Province of Ontario is with regard to it? I think the only body that could come before your Lordships for any authority to ask for interpretation of that question would be the body that can, if necessary, amend or alter or change that law, and not a body that has no jurisdiction over it.\nThe power of the legislature as to \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d is absolute and full, and the difficulty with this question is really not as great as it appears, because, under our system of government, we have had a lot of these constitutional questions up where the subject-matters have more or less been held in some instances to overlap and the rules have been laid down for construction. Your Lordships are familiar with all these cases; most of them you have taken part in, and in every case it has been held, where there is any overlapping, that the jurisdiction is as clearly defined and as capable of exercise by the province, in its own field, as it is by the Dominion.\nYour Lordships have been referred to the memorandum of the law officers of the Crown in regard to what was covered under the head of \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d in their opinion, and to the remarks, obiter though they are, of Mr. Justice Gwynne, in the City of Fredericton v. The Queen[52], at pages 568 et seq., where he says, in dealing with another matter, that the solemnization of marriage, that is, the power of regulating the ceremony and the mode of its celebration, is a particular subject expressly placed under the jurisdiction of the local legislature as a matter which has always been considered to be purely of a local character.\nIn the Judicial Committee, in the case of the Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons[53], Sir Montague Smith deals with the matter in much the same way. That view was not only taken by judges, but when at a later stage, the acts relating to the marriage of a man with his deceased wife\u2019s sister was discussed in Parliament, the Hon. Mr. Blake made a speech upon that bill which will be found in the Debates of the House of Commons of February 27th, 1880, at page 299. Whatever views one might have as to matters which Mr. Blake advocated, he stood out before the whole of this Dominion, and the whole of the world practically, as a great constitutional lawyer; a man who was not likely in the Dominion Parliament to waive one jot of the powers of that Parliament at that time, and he then recognized that as one of the requisites to a marriage which rested with the province and in regard to which the Dominion has nothing to say.\nThe right to say who shall perform a marriage ceremony, between persons of different religions; how persons of different religions will have to be married as to ceremonial, is a matter which is not a marriage act in the sense of capacity to contract, but is purely a solemnization of marriage act. That is absolutely, I submit, beyond controversy at the present moment, and this court \u2014 whether it is sitting as a court or as an advisory board \u2014 is practically bound by the decision of the House of Lords in Swifte v. The Attorney-General for Ireland[54]. The act there in question was absolutely such an act, dealing with religion \u2014 that is the religious belief of the parties \u2014 and dealing with the persons who might celebrate that marriage.\nNow, a marriage contract, using that loose expression, is not an ordinary contract, it is what may be commonly called a solemn contract, that is, in order to be valid, it has to be entered into in a certain solemn form, and, can any one, looking at the division of jurisdiction between the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces, doubt for one moment that the form, the solemnity of the form, is left entirely with the province. That is the point, I respectfully submit, that has to be decided here. Is not the form of the contract, the solemnities which must follow that form, left entirely with the legislatures? And if they choose to say to-day or to-morrow that all marriages between Roman Catholics must be celebrated in one way, or that all marriages between Anglicans must be celebrated in another way, that is absolutely, whether one approves of it or not, left to each individual provincial legislature, according to the will of people who return members to that legislature.\nThey have the right to draw the line as to beliefs for this reason. When the first Act that one can find dealing with matters of this kind in England was passed they drew the line there. Will your Lordships look at 4 Geo. IV. ch. 76, which is intituled \u201cAn Act for amending the Laws respecting the Solemnization of Marriages in England.\u201d The section therein relating to the publication of the banns set out everything in regard to licenses. It provides about parishes or extra-parochial places, and it provides for the consent of guardians and parents. Everything in relation to what the law officers of the Crown in their report think appertains to the solemnization of marriage, is contained in that Act. That is an Act specially dealing on its face with the solemnization and it goes a long way to shew what in England at that time was deemed to fall within solemnization. But that Act does not say one word in reference to capacity to contract; it does not say anything in regard to divorce; it is an Act to provide the form, the means rather.\nThen, there is a very curious illustration as to what was done with regard to religious beliefs in the Act of 6 & 7 Wm. IV. ch. 85. By the second section of that Act it was provided that the Society of Friends, commonly called Quakers, and also persons professing the Jewish religion, might continue to contract and solemnize marriages according to the usages of the said society and of the said persons respectively, and every such marriage is hereby declared and confirmed good in law provided that the parties to such marriage be both persons of the said society or both persons professing the Jewish religion. Marriage celebrated according to the Jewish religion, I do not know so much about the Quakers, but according to the Jewish religion there was a very, very high ritual and ceremonial. It is a more elaborate ritual than either the Roman Catholic or the Anglican, and I am going to point your Lordships to what has to be done. If that high ritual was performed over a Christian and a Jew, there was absolutely no marriage. If the Rabbi performed the highest marriage ritual in the world over any one except two Jews it was absolutely null; they both had to be Jews. So that the Parliament of England recognized, even in 1836, and subsequently recognized by 19 & 20 Vict. ch. 119, sec. 21, a ceremony in regard to both Quakers and Jews. In regard to both the Parliament of England made the validity of the marriage depend upon two things, the religion of the persons to be married and the religion of the person who performed it, and yet, that all came under the solemnization of marriage.\nThen I want to refer your Lordships, with regard to Dominion and provincial jurisdiction, to The City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[55], at page 343, the judgment of Lord Atkinson, where, dealing with sections 91 and 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u2019 he says to the Dominion, you must not, in a subject exclusively assigned to the provinces under section 92, encroach at all; and the solemnization of marriage is entirely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province and upon that solemnization the Dominion, because they have marriage and divorce assigned to them, cannot trench. The solemnization is a part that is cut out and taken away entirely from \u201cmarriage and divorce.\u201d\n(Counsel was asked as to the effect of the capitulation and treaty.)\nThat refers to the second branch of the case.-Just in regard to that, it has struck me in this way, that the agreement that was made, the capitulation and the treaty, was not a mere guarantee to an individual Catholic at all. It was a guarantee to the conquered country. There is a very curious bit of advice which was given in 1722 and which will be found reported in 2 Peere Williams\u2019s Reports[56]. It is headed: \u201cAn uninhabited country newly found out and inhabited by the English to be governed by the laws of England.\u201d I read from page 74:\u2014\n\u201cMemorandum, 9th August, 1722, it was said by the Master of the Rolls to have been determined by the Lords of the Privy Council, upon an appeal to the King in Council from the foreign plantations,\u2014\n\u201c1st. That if there be a new and uninhabited country found out by English subjects, as the law is the birthright of every subject, so, wherever they go, they carry their laws with them, and, therefore, such new-found country is to be governed by the laws of England; though, after such country is inhabited by the English, Acts of Parliament made in England, without naming the foreign plantations, will not bind them; for which reason, it has been determined that the Statute of Frauds and perjuries, which requires three witnesses, and that these should subscribe in the testator\u2019s presence, in the case of a devise of land, does not bind Barbadoes; but that,\n\u201c2ndly. Where the King of England conquers a country, it is a different consideration: for there the conqueror, by saving the lives of the people conquered, gains a right and property in such people; in consequence of which he may impose upon them what laws he pleases. But, until the conqueror gives them new laws, they are to be governed by their own laws, unless where these laws are contrary to the laws of God or totally silent.\n\u201c3rdly. Until such laws given by the conquering prince, the laws and customs of the conquered country shall hold place; unless where these are contrary to our religion, or enact any thing that is malum in se, or are silent; for in all such cases the laws of the conquering country shall prevail.\u201d\nThat is to say, when a country is conquered, while a conqueror has the right to impose his own laws, the people are to be governed by the laws they have until the conqueror chooses to do so.\nThen there is a very interesting article, in the report of the Canadian Archives, for 1891, from Richard Cartwright, Junior, of the 12th of October, 1792, dealing with this very question, and he speaks of the marriages which have taken place in Upper Canada without any clergyman being present (page 85). He says that officers have celebrated marriages and that some clergymen have subsequently come in, evidently being clergymen of the Anglican communion, and celebrated marriages. I will give a memorandum to your Lordships of Reg. v. Roblin[57], where Chief Justice Robinson says that under the Act of 32 Geo. III. ch. 1, the statute of 26 Geo; IL ch. 33, \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act,\u201d came into force: Hodgins v. McNeill[58]; O\u2019Connor v. Kennedy[59]. Whether \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act\u2019 was in force or whether the common law of England was in force, or whether the French law with the treaty was in force, at all events at the time that the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d came into force, there was no question that marriage could no longer be celebrated in any part of Canada \u2014 I am speaking of civilized Canada at that time \u2014 without some form or ceremony, in order to render it valid. So that it is not necessary to carefully delve into the question of whether it was \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act,\u201d or the common law of England, or the law of France as amended and introduced here, which brought into force at that time the decree of the Council of Trent, so far as Lower Canada was concerned, requiring the presence of a clergyman or priest; there had to be a ceremony or form of some kind used at that time; at all events there had to be, without doubt, at the date of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nBayley E.G. (for the Attorney-General of Ontario).\u2014I wish to make a brief statement as to the position which the Province of Ontario takes.\nWhile of opinion that it is difficult to give an unqualified \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to any one of the questions submitted in this case, and that the law on the subject is difficult to determine, the Province of Ontario favours a uniform general marriage law for the Dominion if so framed that the legislative authority of the provinces in relation to the solemnization of marriage is not thereby violated, and the Province of Ontario adopts so much of the argument of counsel for the Dominion as is consistent with the view above expressed, and no more.\nThe Province of Ontario considers that an Act of Parliament which renders valid throughout the Dominion marriages performed in a province by persons legally authorized by such province would result in consolidating and perfecting provincial authority throughout Canada and, in this view, the passing of such an Act by the Dominion Parliament would enlarge rather than encroach upon provincial jurisdiction.\nR. C. Smith K.C. (for the Attorney-General of Quebec).\u2014My Lords, I come here under express instructions to discuss only the constitutional question, and not to discuss the merits of the second question that has been submitted. I will ask your Lordships\u2019 patience later to add several reasons why that second question should not be considered and answered, but, inasmuch as your Lordships\u2019 attention has been concentrated upon the constitutional questions submitted, I think it would be proper that I should add anything I have to say with regard to that branch of the case before referring to question No. 2 at all. It is not, my Lords, that I at all desire to trouble the waters if I refer to the terms of this reference. The difficulty which I encounter is that arising from the words in the bill \u201cand duly performed according to such laws.\u201d I think it is perhaps common ground now, and we have all agreed to treat the bill as having some meaning, and as having been moved in pursuance of some definite intention, and the only intention that could possibly be evident by the bill as drafted, has been expressed by my learned friend, Mr. Hellmuth. It must mean, and I think it cannot mean anything else than this: that it is intended to legalize a marriage performed by a person or functionary, or solemnized by a person or functionary, who would, in the Province of Quebec, have authority to solemnize marriages between any persons or class of persons. That is to say, that it will be impossible, if this bill becomes law, that there should be a person capable of solemnizing a marriage in the province between any two persons without being equally capable of solemnizing a marriage between all persons. That is the evident intention.\nI submit for your Lordships\u2019 consideration this: that the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d when it was finally crystallized into legislation, was the result of a contract, and I say with all possible respect that those who desire the stability of Confederation, cannot preserve that stability better than by a conscientious and a frank and an honest interpretation of that Act, giving to each section the intention that the framers of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d would give it. I am going to argue this upon very narrow grounds indeed; I am going, I think, to shew your Lordships, as has been so eloquently and logically shewn by those who preceded me, that this bill deals exclusively \u2014 so far as it attempts to deal effectively with anything \u2014 with the quality and the character of the functionary solemnizing the marriage. And, if I have any difficulty in arguing that, it is because the difficulty arises more from the disposition, which I cannot resist, to treat the matter as obvious. The very first words of the bill I submit, condemn it. It says: \u201cEvery ceremony or form of marriage,\u201d and that is what the bill deals with and, with all possible respect, it is what it was intended to deal with.\nNow, before I come to discuss that would your Lordships allow me to refer to the second clause of this bill?\nThe second clause I do not think it is necessary for me to discuss, because I think if it legislated, or purported or attempted to legislate, effectively concerning what appears to be its subject-matter, it would open up a very wide subject as to the purview of the powers of the provinces with regard to property and civil rights, etc. The second clause of the bill uses the words \u201cshall be absolute and complete.\u201d Now, my Lords, Parliament has never legislated with regard to questions of property, succession, or any questions of civil rights and property. I assume that when this bill says \u201cthese rights shall be absolute and complete\u201d it must mean, in accordance with the laws of each province, because there are no other laws. So that section 2 of this bill, while it does declare absolute and complete rights, not only of the persons themselves, but of their offspring, it does not presume for one moment to decree what these rights shall be. I assume, as I am bound to do, that it would naturally mean these rights as defined by competent authority, which is the provincial authority. If it were to go any further it would very greatly broaden the scope of these rights and would involve a discussion even more extended than that to which your Lordships have so far listened. I do not propose to discuss the second section of the bill as though it dealt with the rights of married people because I cannot conceive for one instant that the general authority to legislate upon the question of marriage, quoad marriage, involved the right in the Dominion to prescribe the social relations and the property obligations and everything of that sort, of married people. That would be giving to the word \u201cmarriage\u201d a meaning which never could have been intended. It does not mean that because Parliament may legislate upon the subject of marriage, that Parliament can legislate with respect to every right of a married person. No, it has only the power to legislate upon marriage and, if it had power to legislate as to anything incidental it must be incidental to marriage quoad marriage and not to all the multifarious rights and interests, whether property obligations or otherwise, of the parties themselves. That would be an absolutely impossible view, so that, I do not feel on this reference, and with the particular wording of clause 2 of the bill, that I am called upon to go into any question so broad as that.\nTo revert to the question of jurisdiction to pass this bill, there is one part of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d and one part only, in which there is any power of remedial legislation. When the Imperial Parliament was considering the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d it considered the question of remedial legislation and what remedial legislation should be conferred upon the Dominion, and in section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d we have that power of remedial legislation with respect to education alone, and only within the limits of certain circumstances and in so far as these circumstances should render it necessary. I say respectfully that that is the only clause or section of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d that deals in any way whatever with remedial legislation, and the fact that we have such a section, shewing that the question of remedial legislation was considered by the Imperial Parliament, would be an absolute answer to the suggestion that, because a province exercised either inadequately, imperfectly or wrongly a power conferred upon it, Parliament would have remedial power. I say there is nothing in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d that could sanction such an inference or such an argument.\nNow the marriage ceremony, the persons capable of solemnizing marriage, everything connected with the contract, so far as solemnization is concerned, has always been religious. The qualification of a person celebrating or solemnizing marriage is primarily derived not from civil authority but from ecclesiastical authority. In this, the whole history of France, as well as the whole history of England, agrees entirely. I do not think it can be challenged for one moment, as far as the solemnization of marriage is concerned, that that has been historically always religious, and it does not advance the argument one whit to say it may have been something else, that other functionaries may have been appointed by the State; that we might have had justices of the peace or other civil functionaries; I say it does not advance the argument one whit to say that their might have been other functionairies because the fact of the matter is that historically marriage has been always \u2014 and I need not go further than the two countries from which Canada has been peopled, France and England \u2014 marriage has always been a religious and not a civil ceremony. The State took what was an established institution of the church and enacted laws concerning it. And here I think it is important and relevant to consider that even what is purely evidential was, I say, derived from the ecclesiastical authority originally, and not from the civil authority. Your Lordships have in the decrees of the Council of Trent provisions for the publication of banns and for the keeping of registers, and all the elaborate provisions of civil law which we have to-day respecting the keeping of registers of civil status were foreshadowed in ecclesiastical legislation long ago. The Council of Trent referred to the Council of Lateran and the Council of Lateran provided for the publishing of banns and the keeping of some register of civil status. Therefore, we have not only what relates to the solemnization as regards the persons before whom or by whom it is solemnized, but we have a provision for the publication of banns and the keeping of registers of civil status which we undoubtedly find to be of ecclesiastical origin.\nAs regards France, the first reference as to the keeping of these registers of civil status is found in the Ordonnance de Blois, which is directed to prevent clandestine marriages. We see there that the civil law comes in and adopts what has been decreed by the ecclesiastical law in regard to the publication of banns and the keeping of registers. Then we have the Edit de Henri IV., and the Declaration of Louis XIII.\nThe whole history of marriage in France shews it to have been primarily a religious ceremony, and the most important thing connected with that ceremony was the officer or the person before whom that ceremony could be solemnized. In the Ordonnance of 1667 we have, of course, very precise provisions with regard to the keeping of registers of civil status. In the Edict of Louis XIV., 1697, we find it said that the essential solemnity to the sacrement of marriage is the presence of the proper cur\u00e9 of the parties. I know your Lordships have given attention to all these things, but I am merely following rapidly these papers to shew that throughout the history of France the presence of the person celebrating was considered as of the essence of the solemnization. Perhaps I need not detain your Lordships with this, you will find the special references in the Edict of Louis XIV., Ritual of the Diocese of Quebec, and Declaration of Louis, 1736.\nThen, I ask your Lordships\u2019 attention for a moment to the Act 32 Henry VIII. ch. 38, this being an Act passed in 1540. You will notice that the word always used is \u201cmarriage solemnized.\u201d We have there the expression, \u201csuch marriage being contracted and solemnized in the face of the church.\u201d We have also the expression, \u201cbefore the time of contracting that marriage which is solemnized\u201d and reference is also made to the Levitical decrees in connection with marriage. That Act, so long ago as 1540, adopts the Levitical decrees of consanguinity, and all through, it deals with solemnization in the face of the church and so on.\nOf course, your Lordship is familiar with Mr. Bishop\u2019s reasoning that marriage is not a contract, but a status. Whether the word \u201cstatus\u201d more correctly describes marriage than \u201ccontract,\u201d it clearly involves a contract, and so far as it involves a contract that contract is consensual, but it requires the sanction of solemnization. I do not think we gain any light by dissolving the contract entirely from the solemnization; I do not think we gain anything by that or that it throws any light upon the question.\nThe House of Lords, considering the terms of \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act,\u2019 1753, discussed the fact that the word \u201csolemnization\u201d is used in connection with matrimony as absolute evidence that the word had a well-founded and well-understood meaning. It says the banns must be published on three Sundays preceding the solemnization of the marriage, and at the end of the first section it says that the marriage shall be solemnized at one of the parish churches or chapels where such banns have been published, and no other place.\nThroughout the different sections of \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act\u201d the term \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d is used and it all shews clearly that the words had even at that date an absolutely clear and defined meaning. I am, of course, not pretending to elaborate the very full argument of Mr. Mignault, but when we come down to the articles of the capitulation of Quebec, 1759, and the articles of the capitulation of Montreal, 1760, and the Treaty of Paris of 1763, and the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d of 1774, they all granted the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion. The question has arisen here, as to whether this was a permission granted to certain individuals to resort to churches of their own. It was, in the fullest possible terms, the granting of the exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, and then coming to the Treaty of Paris we find that, whereas that is granted in the fullest and amplest terms in section 4, in the very following section (section 5), there is a provision for the encouragement of the Protestant religion, and a provision that later on, as His Majesty from time to time shall think fit, he will make provision for the support of the Protestant clergy.\nThe point I make here is that both religions were from that moment fully recognized. The granting in the Articles of Capitulation of the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion presupposed naturally the exercise by His Majesty\u2019s other subjects of their religion, and that was acted upon from that very moment and in every subsequent Act both systems are fully recognized. My point now is simply this: that marriage was an established institution of both religious systems and in both religious systems the person celebrating was of the very essence of solemnization of marriage. In the Act 35 Geo. III. ch. 4, 1795, both systems are recognized and that is an Act passed a very short time after. I will not trouble your Lordships by references to these other Acts further than to say that the word \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d occurs in every case. We cannot get away from the fact that in the various branches of the Protestant Church and in the Roman Catholic Church marriage was an established institution and that the person who solemnized was of the essence of the solemnization. Then, we have that recognized in articles 57 and 128 of our own Code, which, it must be remembered, was the state of the law in the Province of Quebec when the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was passed.\nThen we have before us the course of legislation extending over centuries by the very Parliament that enacted the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d If your Lordships have any curiosity to look at these statutes there is a list of them in the first volume of Philimore\u2019s Ecclesiastical Law, pages 643 and 644. There is a list there covering two pages of marriage cases, dealing with solemnization of marriage, curing defects in solemnization of marriage, prescribing the hours in which solemnization of marriage could take place and so on. In that long list there is not a statute that does not deal with the solemnization of marriage as involving as an essential the presence of a priest or a clerk in orders.\nAll our elaborate systems of registration of civil status are directly traceable to the Council of Lateran and the Council of Trent. I have some reason to believe that there were earlier provisions than those particularly with respect to the registration of baptism. Is it conceivable, my Lords, that in the Parliament that for centuries \u2014 I do not require to go back further than Henry VIII. \u2014 had been enacting laws respecting solemnization of marriage, and always treating solemnization as meaning the one thing, and in the whole history of that legislation there is nothing that is antagonistic to this one view or that is at variance or incompatible with this one view \u2014 is it conceivable that the British Parliament in enacting the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d had any doubt whatever as to what the signification of solemnization was?\nOne observation on what is called the doctrine of overlapping. In Hodge v. The Queen[60], page 130, we find this declaration:\u2014\n\u201cIt appears to their Lordships that Russell v. The Queen[61] when properly understood is not an authority in support of the apparent contention and their Lordships do not intend to vary or depart from the reasons expressed for their judgment in that case.\u201d\nOn the following page there is that declaration so frequently referred to, that the legislatures of the provinces are not to be deemed with respect to the matters assigned to them, to exercise a\u2019 delegated authority, but are deemed to have all the power which the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its powers, passed or could confer. The latest declaration on this question is in this recent decision of the Privy Council upon the question of jurisdiction on the Reference in the Insurance Companies cases[62], and Lord Loreburn, the Lord Chancellor, says:\u2014\n\u201cNumerous points have arisen, and may hereafter arise, upon those provisions of the Act which draw the dividing line between what belongs to the Dominion or to the province respectively. An exhaustive enumeration being unattainable (so infinite are the subjects of possible legislation) general terms are necessarily used in describing what either is to have, and with the use of general terms comes the risk of some confusion, whenever a case arises wherein it can be said the power claimed falls within the description of what the Dominion is to have, and also within the description of what the province is to have. Such apparent overlapping is unavoidable, and the duty of a court of law is to decide in each particular case on which side of the line it falls in view of the whole statute.\u201d\nThe point to which I ask your Lordships\u2019 very careful consideration is this (and I must say that it impresses me quite as strongly as any other point arising on this argument), that where you have the general subject committed to the Dominion Parliament and you have a portion of that very subject, as has been not inaptly said, carved out of it, detached from it, I respectfully suggest to your Lordships that there can be no application of the doctrine of overlapping. Neither can there be any application of incidental or implied powers. If your Lordships were to say that under the doctrine of implied or incidental powers the Dominion Parliament by virtue of its general power to legislate on marriage could also legislate regarding the solemnization, the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d would be defeated absolutely. In other words, what I ask your Lordships to hold is that, in this particular case, solemnization of marriage calls for an exact delimitation, and I say that nothing else can possibly be a reasonable or true interpretation of the Act. It calls for an exact delimitation, or, otherwise, why should it have been detached or carved out of the general subject of marriage? If on any pretence whatever the Dominion Parliament is to be allowed to trench upon the solemnization of marriage on the pretence of legislating upon marriage, then I say that the object and purpose of the Imperial Parliament in clearly carving out that portion of the subject would be defeated by such an interpretation.\nAnother thing I submit as an essential consideration is this: If the Legislature has power to legislate it has power to legislate effectively. \u201cTo concede that the legislature has power to pass laws relating to solemnization of marriages that may be violated with impunity as far as the validity of the act done in contravention is concerned, is, I say, to take away the power of legislation. If the legislature is given power to legislate with respect to solemnization, surely it has the power to say, at least within the province, what you do in contravention of this law that we enact is null, or what you do without the sanction of what we have prescribed is null. If you are going to give the power of legislation at all it must be necessary that you are entitled to enact a law which has some force and to provide that a thing which is done contrary to it cannot stand. Again, my learned friend Mr. Nesbitt says that solemnization relates only to what is evidential. I need not go back into history again to shew that solemnization of marriage existed long before there was any evidential proceeding at all, long before there was publication of banns, long before there was any registry kept of it. The act of solemnization is quite distinct from the record of that act. The record of that act may be incidental to it in that sense, as a necessary consequence of it that it should be preserved and so on, but the registration of the marriage and the keeping of the register is one thing, and the actual solemnization is another. The solemnization existed long before any of these requirements, which my learned friend treated as evidential, had any existence at all.\nAnother argument of my learned friend is this: That allowing the legislature to prescribe nullity in case the requirements of the provincial laws are not observed is an invasion of the power of Parliament with regard to divorce. I say with all possible respect that the fundamental error there is this: The distinction between, as we say in civil law, that which is void and that which is voidable. We do not pretend for a moment to say that the effect of the Quebec law is to annul a marriage which has had valid existence. For the purpose of my present argument I would concede my learned friend\u2019s most extravagant claim with regard to divorce, and I say respectfully this, that if the Province of Quebec can validly legislate regarding the solemnization of marriage then if that law be not observed the marriage has no existence and never had any existence. If the Province of Quebec can legislate concerning the solemnization of marriage it can create what is the condition precedent to the existence of the thing at all. It is not, that the thing has to be annulled.\nI would be willing to go to the extreme and say that suppose the Legislature of Quebec at its next session were to pass an Act saying that the laws of the Province of Quebec relating to the solemnization of marriage are hereby repealed, and the Province of Quebec is left without any law whatever relating to the solemnization of marriage, it is not debatable that such a law would be absolutely constitutional. I say that if the Province of Quebec passed such an Act tomorrow it would not invest the Parliament of Canada with a scintilla of legislative power regarding solemnization of marriage. The power is derived from the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u2019 and I say that the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d has committed to all the provinces the power to legislate regarding solemnization, and if they do not exercise it, that does not give the Dominion power. If they abuse it, if they enact an absurd law, no matter what they do in that respect, that does not confer power on the Dominion; as I pointed out this morning the only case in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d in which there is any suggestion of remedial power is in section 93 with regard to education.\nA very plausible argument was presented by Mr. Lafleur in these terms: If clandestinity be an impediment then the bill in question is constitutional because the Dominion would have the power to deal with impediments. That would be altogether too easy a solution of this question. The word \u201cimpediment\u201d has been used by some high authority in connection with this, and I am willing to let it go at that, but it is begging the whole question to say that the Dominion could deal with it. Your Lordships have to inquire first as to clandestinity. Is clandestinity an impediment which relates to the solemnization of marriage, which is within the provincial jurisdiction, or is it an impediment which relates to that which is within the federal jurisdiction? It does not help us a bit to make use of the term \u201cimpediment.\u201d We have to inquire whether it comes within a subject-matter which is assigned exclusively to the province or whether it comes within a subject-matter assigned to the Dominion. In this particular case, beyond all question I suppose it relates to the person who is to give solemnity to the Act and it must come under the terms \u201csolemnization.\u201d I do not think there is much to be gained by citing analogies. The power to legislate regarding solemn declarations one would naturally conclude included the nomination of the person who was to receive solemn declarations. The power to legislate with regard to a notarial instrument would involve the nomination of the person who was to give effect to the instrument, and so on. How could it be otherwise? I could not conceive it possible that solemnization did not include the person who was to give solemnization or who was to solemnize as the bill says. This bill deals exclusively, in both its clauses, with the functionary who is to solemnize. It is not necessary for my argument that I should try to enumerate what powers are included in marriage or what is the residuum of legislative power remaining with the Dominion. All that is necessary for our argument is that this particular bill deals solely with one question, the nature and character of the official who is to solemnize. With that I submit our argument is complete. As I said in opening, I would not be willing to concede as much as has been claimed with regard to the power of the Dominion to legislate as to rights resulting from marriage and all sorts of incidental property rights. I think things of that sort would have to be determined as they arise in proper cases. Our argument is complete in saying that as regards this bill it deals with one thing, and that, we say, incontestably comes under solemnization. I do not think I can add anything on this question, my Lords; it is a question on which I am sure your Lordships are well advised.\nPermit me to say a few words now as to the answer to question 2. The bill uses the expression \u201cwithout regard to the religion of the person,\u201d and the second question refers to marriage \u201cunless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest.\u201d It deals with the one thing throughout and it is enough for our argument to say that that comes clearly under solemnization. The Swifte Case[63] that my learned friend Mr. Hellmuth commented on was a clear authority for saying that the person celebrating certainly comes under the form of ceremony.\nThis division of authority, shall we call it, on the subject of marriage, also follows the general lines of private international law, which, if anything were necessary, \u2014 I do not say anything is necessary \u2014 would also aid in interpreting it.\nJust a word or two on the second question in the reference. It is my duty to pray your Lordships not to answer the second question. In the first place I do it because it seems that probably and inevitably your Lordships will answer to the first question that the bill is unconstitutional as dealing with solemnization of marriage. If your Lordships reach that result, as we hope your Lordships will, is there any necessity for answering question No 2? In the second place we say that there cannot be any question submitted which involves more complete private rights than this question. It involves a declaration which would not only cause disturbance, but would put the ban of absolute nullity upon scores of marriages of persons who are not represented at all before your Lordships. My learned friends, Mr. Lafleur and Mr. Mignault, have been placing before your Lordships their views upon that question, but the individual whose rights as a married person or whose legitimacy is in question is entitled to be represented by his own counsel. My learned friends say that your Lordships\u2019 declaration would be advisory. We know that it would; but, should your opinion go that way, as far as the name and fame and standing of every person married under the conditions set forth in these general questions is concerned, it would place the stamp of illegitimacy upon the children und the stamp of illegitimacy authenticated by the highest tribunal in the country. The Civil Code, which says that marriage contracted in good faith produces civil results, is very indefinite, and it would have this effect. It is conceded at once that while a marriage in good faith or an ordinary putative marriage may have the effect of producing legitimate offspring, that the parties themselves would be free to contract another marriage, and it would be practically dissolving the marriage tie as far as that part of it is concerned. At all events it is obvious that it involves a pronouncement upon the rights of those who are not here represented. My learned friend, Mr. Lafleur, said, while speaking on the H\u00e9bert v. Clou\u00e2tre case[64], that there are hundreds of other cases in exactly the same position. I say that no wider admission could have been made before your Lordships. I cite the declaration of Lord Herschell, in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario, etc.[65], (referred to by the Lord Chancellor in The Companies Case[66],) that their Lordships declined to answer one of the questions because it involved certain private rights with respect to certain riparian proprietors; rights which are not measurably comparable for a moment with the rights of individuals involved in such declarations as your Lordships are asked to make with regard to the invalidity of certain marriages.\nWhat I am asking is, that your Lordships should refer question No. 2 back to the Governor in Council asking his Royal Highness in Council to consider whether there is necessity now for answering that question in view of the answer which I presume you will give to question No. 1; or referring to His Royal Highness the other consideration that there is now sub judice before a competent tribunal the very same question. Your Lordships may make either of these representations to His Royal Highness in Council and I feel that they would commend themselves to him. At all events I am absolutely confident that whatever representations your Lordships would make would be acted upon. Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. (for the Attorney-General of Quebec).\u2014On questions No. 1 and No. 3, which I intend to refer to together, I have little to add to the argument made by Mr. Smith as to the construction of the words \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201csolemnization of marriage.\u201d Mr. Smith has very forcibly pointed out that \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d must be considered as having been carved out of \u201cmarriage\u201d relegated to the Federal Parliament, so as to be exclusively within the power of the province, and, that the doctrine of overlapping does not, therefore, apply. Mr. Smith has given, as a reason why the jurisdiction as to solemnization should be absolutely exclusively in the province, and not divided between both, the decision on the overlapping theory, and the fact that we are here with a general power in the federal and a special power in the province. As was pointed out by Mr. Justice Duff, in every case where the question of ancillary or overlapping power has come up it was in connection with property and civil rights, where the general power was in the province and the special power, carved out, in the Federal Parliament. I would like to quote an authority bearing indirectly on that question which is to be found in City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[67], pages 343 and 344. Lord Atkinson, suggesting that the previous decisions dealt only with the residuum power given by the opening words of section 91, adds that some considerations before the court appear to refer to matters enumerated in section 91, namely, the regulation of trade and commerce. There is here, as you will notice, a departure from the general proposition till then always acted upon as regards the ancillary or overlapping power theory. It is there held that as regards the regulation of trade and commerce which is a federal subject, the natural meaning of the words used has to be restricted so as to a how of the powers expressly granted to the provincial legislatures remaining with the provincial legislatures. This is really only developing further what has been intimated in the Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[68]. In that case their Lordships intimated that the words \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d had been restricted and could not have the full effect the words otherwise would have because if so it would absolutely nullify powers given expressly to the provincial legislatures. In the Montreal Street Railway Case[69], they go further and they state that the residuum power can never be used so as to curtail the special powers given to the provinces. And, while the general express powers given especially to the Federal Parliament do curtail the special powers given to the legislatures, their Lordships go on to assimilate to the residuum, the trade and commerce clause without any apparent reason to distinguish, except that they cannot apply to the trade and commerce power the same rule of construction as they applied to the bills of exchange power, the bankruptcy power, without absolutely nullifying the power of property and civil rights given to the legislature. The analogy between that case and the present case is complete. If you apply to the general allowance of \u201cmarriage\u201d in the federal authority, the theory of overlapping as it has been applied to bills of exchange, railway legislation and so on, you completely nullify the solemnizing power or at least you completely nullify its exclusive character. All that could be suggested as regards the effect of giving to the words \u201ctrade and commerce\u201d their true construction, was that if you did so it would, to a large extent, nullify the exclusive character of the allowance of property and civil rights to the local legislature. It was shewn that whenever there was federal legislation dealing with trade and commerce, which also affected property and civil rights, then the power of the provincial legislature became void, if the construction applied to bills of exchange and bankruptcy was to be applied to trade and commerce, and it would, therefore, nullify in great part the exclusive authority of the province to legislate respecting property and civil rights. In the present case, if this court does not hold that \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d is carved out from \u201cmarriage\u201d completely, so as to be exclusively given to the province, and so that the Federal Parliament under the word \u201cmarriage\u201d cannot touch it, you will nullify absolutely the exclusive power of the provincial legislatures regarding solemnization. I would suggest that the logical working out of this analogy should lead your Lordships to hold, either broadly, that the rule about overlapping as applied in the cases summed up in these last decisions applies only when the general power is in the province and the carved out power is in the federal authority or, if your Lordships are not prepared to go that far, I would ask your Lordships to hold, at least, that giving effect to the overlapping theory so as to extend the federal power would have the effect of nullifying the exclusive power of the provincial authority in this matter, and that, therefore, the overlapping theory cannot be applied. We should read the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d as regards the words \u201cmarriage and divorce,\u201d as marriage laws minus all laws respecting solemnization of marriage. That is all that has ever been assigned to the federal authority. I was trying to answer the point that the law respecting the solemnization of marriage is also a law respecting marriage. I submit that the authority is assigned to the two powers from different points of view: one as being a law respecting marriage, and the other as being a law respecting solemnization. I am pointing out that \u201cmarriage\u201d absolutely has never been assigned to the federal authority, and we must read the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d as a whole, qualifying the allowance of marriage to the federal authority by the allowance of solemnization to the province. And so the only thing left to the federal power is marriage minus solemnization. And, I submit, that the moment that marriage minus solemnization is the only thing assigned to the federal power, the whole question is at an end. This, I submit, disposes of every one of the objections made so far.\nI do not intend to add anything to the argument as to what solemnization is. I respectfully submit that the very authorities cited by Mr. Nesbitt shew that the designation of an officer, or of a person before whom one must appear to get married, is legislation respecting solemnization. The American authorities which he cited say that solemnization consists of a third party appearing at the making \u00f3f the contract, but, I submit that, in the days when the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was passed, the word \u201csolemnizing\u201d had a more limited meaning. Even taking Mr. Nesbitt\u2019s own definition, the designation of the person, or of the officer before whom the parties must appear to make the contract, is obviously legislation respecting solemnization. I submit that any law that touches that question, that specifies that for certain purposes it shall be one officer and for certain other purposes it shall be another officer, is necessarily legislation respecting solemnization. Then, if it is legislation respecting solemnization, the next point is as to the argument of Mr. Nesbitt to the effect \u2014 and I understood this to be his main argument \u2014 that, while the power to prescribe how marriages shall be solemnized is in the province, the power to determine when nullity results from failure to comply with that law is in the federal authority. Mr. Nesbitt might have suggested that the power to make that mandatory provision is with the province and the power to impose the sanction is with the federal authority, a rather unusual division of legislative power. But, Mr. Nesbitt has gone further, and he has stated that the province has the right to impose penalties for non-observance. His argument amounts to this, that the province can legislate as regards solemnization, can prescribe what forms must be followed in order to get married, and can impose one definite condition, namely, a penalty for disobedience to its laws, but cannot impose, what is the most ordinary condition in such cases, nullity for non-compliance with the law. I submit that such a distinction is illogical. It would have been more logical to say that the power of imposing a sanction would be in one authority, while the power of making the mandatory order would be in the other. Surely, the legislature which imposes the formality must be able to say what would be the consequence of non-compliance. Our Quebec Code says that the failure to make publication, in marrying without a license, entails only a penalty. There are many formalities that the parties would be willing to frustrate if the result would be only a penalty and not a nullity. There are other formalities as an essential condition of the contract, and it is clear that the judgment of the legislature in prescribing what formalities it may prescribe will be influenced by the consideration of the success and the failure to comply with these formalities. The suggestion of my learned friend is that the provincial legislature could, plainly legislate requiring formalities, but without knowing what, the Federal Parliament would do about it; whether it would prescribe an absolute or a relative nullity or a penalty. It is obvious that any legislature which undertakes to declare a mandatory provision, must, in order to make that provision wisely, know what will be the consequences flowing from disregard of it. It is unheard of where the division between the power to make a rule and the power to impose a consequence for disregard of it has been divided between two independent bodies. And yet, the theory of my learned friend, Mr. Nesbitt, would lead to this. He says that the province can prescribe formalities, but he says the province cannot say whether there will or will not be a nullity for non-observance of them. He admits that some person has the power to say that nullity shall result from non-observance, and, therefore, he contends it must be in the Federal Parliament. It seems obvious that the moment a provincial legislature repeals a requirement that a certain form shall be followed \u2014 a requirement which under the laws existing anterior to Confederation had to be followed \u201cor if not their non-observance resulted in a nullity \u2014 it seems to me that the common sense view is that the repeal of the requirement would carry with it the repeal of the nullifying clause. But the suggestion of my learned friend would be that the nullifying clause would have to remain in force until the Federal Parliament would repeal it. We can work out indefinitely a regular Chinese puzzle which would result from giving the power to prescribe forms, to repeal requirements as to form, to amend the laws as regards forms, to one authority, and to put in the other authority the power to say whether the consequence of non-observance shall be a penalty, an absolute nullity, or a relative nullity.\nThis brings me to deal with the argument in reference to divorce and I think the word \u201cdivorce\u201d should be given a construction \u2014 if it is the only construction that can be given to it \u2014 that does not produce the results I have indicated. The word \u201cdivorce\u201d may be given a meaning which, when tortured, may include actions in nullity, but in its strict sense it does no such thing, or, at least, it is possible of being construed as not including nullity. Under the law of our province the distinction is obvious. We have an absolute nullity, we have a voidable relative nullity, and we have, beyond that, the right to rescind a contract at the request of one party for non-fulfilment of his obligation by the other. I cannot do anything better than to suggest it as pointing out the distinction between the three actions; an action to have it declared that a marriage has always been void, an, action to annul a voidable marriage, and a divorce action to cancel an absolutely previously binding contract, because one of the parties has broken his engagement. I submit that this distinction is recognized expressly by the English Act The \u201cMatrimonial Clauses Act\u201d of 1837 clearly distinguished between actions to annul and divorce. What was called divorce a mensa et thoro is now called judicial separation. In that Act, however, the previously existing distinction is recognized, between an action for dissolution of marriage, which is divorce, and an action to annul, which is not, but which declares that on account of a defect in the making of the contract it should be set aside. It is difficult to argue conclusively, with any chance of success, that when there is an absolute nullity the judgment that recognizes it divorces. I am discussing the question of formalities now, because to a certain extent the Civil Code makes certain want of formalities a nullity, and I want to say a few words as to where a distinction should be made between absolute and relative nullity. Is it logical to use the word \u201cdivorce\u201d in the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which at the time of its passing had such a definite meaning, so as to import into the Act such an illogical distinction as this \u2014 that if the provincial legislature prescribed a form it is denied the right to say that there will only be a nullity if the parties are in bad faith, or that it will only be annulled if the judge thinks the circumstances justifiable?\nIt seems to me perfectly obvious that this bill purports to legislate on solemnization of marriage, because it says that although the laws before Confederation said that if you do not follow certain formalities you are not married this bill undertakes to say that, nevertheless, although you have not observed these formalities prescribed by the pre-Confederation laws, you are validly married. That is amending the law respecting solemnization of marriage. The whole question lies in the submission that it is only \u201cmarriage,\u201d minus \u201csolemnization,\u201d that is left to the federal authorities. If that is correct, then this\nbill which says that, in future, your marriage will be good even if you do not go through certain formalities prescribed by the province, and which previously were neglected under the pain of penalty, is absolutely ultra vires of the Federal Parliament. Can it be suggested that the jurisdiction as to prospective legislation is in one authority, while the jurisdiction as to retrospective legislation shall be within another authority? I fail to see any justification for such a proposition. What is done under the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d is invariably to leave to the same authority the power as to prospective and retrospective legislation. The validity of an Act as regards its retrospective character depends on its validity as regards its prospective character. The prospective character of this bill, worded as it may be, is simply saying that in the future you need not comply with certain formalities which the previously existing law required.\nIt has been suggested by one of your Lordships, that suppose there is no law in the province respecting solemnization, and that province refuses to pass a law respecting solemnization, that the Federal Parliament could do so, and then that would constitute a valid marriage, or if you like, that they could go back to the Roman form of marriage and declare, that that would be a marriage, and then make it subject to conforming to the solemnization. My submission is that if the legislature repeals every law governing marriage, there is only one effective remedy in the hands of the federal authority and that is the disallowance of such a provincial act. The fact that the province repealed all its solemnization of marriage laws would give no authority to the federal parliament.\nI want to protest against the theory advanced that the law of Quebec, as construed by Mr. Mignault, is what your Lordships call an abdication, and that that should be given as a reason why the Federal Parliament should interfere in the matter of solemnization. I think your Lordships are entitled to construe the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d by the conditions existing in Canada at the time of its passage. The fact that there are a number of French people, having French laws, living in Canada, is referred to in the various cases before the Privy Council, defining property and civil rights. In the present case, what your Lordships may think absurd is considered by a large part of the population of Quebec as the only right thing to exist. It may seem to your Lordships extraordinary, but nevertheless the people of the Province of Quebec think it is right. And, when Confederation was brought about, why was there this extraordinary division between marriage on the one hand and solemnization on the other hand. It was not because one was of national importance and the other was not; it was because of the religious differences and the resulting difference in the points of view of the majority in one province compared with the majority in another. It was because the Roman Catholic majority in Quebec thought the views of their co-patriots of other religions so entirely different from theirs that they would not understand their views, and so the Catholic majority in Quebec would not entrust their other co-patriots with the power to legislate upon the solemnization of marriage, and that is why the solemnization was entrusted to the province. The people of Quebec were convinced that the majority of other religions and origin could not understand their feelings as they did themselves, and so they were not willing to allow them to interpret them for them, and so the solemnization of marriage was entrusted to the provinces in the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d By the Roman Catholic people of Quebec, rightly or wrongly, it was considered more of a religious than of a civil ceremony, and they were unwilling to entrust the matter to the Dominion and they wanted to be the sole judges as to when and how they would change their minds on the question of marriage. They were unwilling to abandon their authority over the question as to how they could get married to any other authority than themselves.\nWhen the Roman Catholic population of Quebec entered into Confederation they had to make certain concessions from their religious point of view, and, no doubt, the people of Protestant religions, had to make concessions, and it is to be assumed that the people of the other provinces agreed to leave the question of mixed marriages, and even Protestant marriages, as to solemnization, in the hands of the provincial authorities in Quebec, trusting either to the reasonableness of the Quebec Legislature to pass just laws, or to the power of disallowance by the Dominion which was for them an effective protection. At all events, whatever the reason, the solemnization of marriages, mixed marriages and Protestant marriages, was left in the power of the provincial authorities. I do not understand that Mr. Mignault, in his argument, insisted very strenuously on the point that mixed marriages were null unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest. I have only, my Lords, to add a few words. The position of the Province of Quebec, with respect to questions No. 1 and No. 3 is in favour of maintaining its jurisdiction. The position of the Province of Quebec, with regard to question No. 2, is that it has no opinion to offer and no argument to present as to what is the existing state of the Quebec law. All it has to state on that point is that the law of Quebec is the law of Quebec and that the Province of Quebec alone can change it. If the law of the Province of Quebec is Quebec law alone, the law of Quebec being the law of Quebec, Quebec alone can change it, and the only reason why the Supreme Court should be called upon to give an opinion disappears. I submit, that there is excellent ground to justify this court in asking the federal executive whether it insists on an answer to question No. 2, notwithstanding the answer which may be given by this court to questions No. 1 and No. 3. I need not insist on the fact that the answer to question No. 2 may lead to very serious results. If it is answered in the sense of the invalidity of these marriages, then there may be many who want a divorce who will be willing to step into the box and say they were Roman Catholics, when, as a matter of fact, they were practicing no religion at all. It may not affect the illegitimacy of the offspring because bad faith would be hard to prove and illegitimacy in the Province of Quebec depends on there being bad faith in contracting an invalid marriage. I am instructed to point out some of the possible consequences that might follow from the answering of question No. 2, and I submit that every ground of public policy and good sense suggests that it should not be answered by your Lordships. Is it not well to leave things as they have been going along and under conditions in which no great harm has resulted to anybody? Before the agitation arose we were getting along in perfect peace and harmony, and there were only three or four cases in dispute, but the moment the agitation arose we heard of a great many others. I point out to your Lordships that in the Province of Quebec the H\u00e9bert Case[70] is pending in the Court of Review, and that on that case a decision will be given.\nI am instructed to submit the point to your Lordships, as to whether the decision of the Privy Council is conclusive that, when an opinion is asked by the federal authority concerning a matter which exclusively affects the Province of Quebec, there is jurisdiction in the federal authority to ask that question, and whether you are bound to answer it. The recent Privy Council decision[71] proceeds on the basis that the power to consult the court must be somewhere and that admittedly if it is not in the province it must be in the Federal Parliament. In that case, what was being dealt with incidentally was the power of the provincial legislature to legislate but, practically, it meant the power of the Federal Parliament to legislate, because, in almost every case, the question as to what is the power of the Federal Parliament to legislate, involves the question as to what is the provincial power to legislate. In that case it could not be contended that it appertained to the provincial legislatures alone. The question as to whether the Federal Parliament can pass an act is a question which the Federal Parliament can refer, but I submit, your Lordships, that if the question is one which concerns exclusively a provincial law, or on which the Federal Parliament has no power whatever to legislate \u2014 the disallowance period having passed \u2014 the Federal Parliament has no right to refer such a question to the court.\nNewcombe K.C.\u2014If your Lordships please, speaking on behalf of the Attorney-General of Canada, I am principally concerned to answer the objections raised by my learned friends, Mr. Smith and Mr. Geoffrion \u2014 and to some extent apparently supported by Mr. Hellmuth \u2014 to the answering of what are termed here questions No. 2 and No. 3. The attitude of the Province of Quebec is, of course, in this respect, not quite consistent with that which she has maintained throughout the proceedings from the very commencement. But, my Lords, these provincial objections which were formerly urged before this court, and which were raised here yesterday by my learned friends, Mr. Smith and Mr. Geoffrion, have been conclusively and finally over-ruled by the Privy Council in its recent decision with reference to companies legislation[72]. It is well known that, the contention of the provinces was a very broad one, going to deny entirely the authority of the Parliament to require this court to answer in an advisory capacity any sort of a question at all, whether relating to the construction of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d to the interpretation of Dominion statutes, to the administration of the laws of Canada, or to provincial powers of legislation, or to the enactments of the provinces in the execution of those powers. But, there was also a more limited contention put forward which found favour with some of your Lordships \u2014 that, while questions affecting federal powers, questions the answers to which might be made the basis of Dominion legislation, questions affecting the interpretation of these powers which are to be executed by the Dominion under the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d might be submitted, that questions of interpretation of provincial powers or questions of interpretation of provincial statutes, on subjects within the jurisdiction of the provinces as distinguished from the Dominion, could not be put to this court. And although that distinction was not urged very forcibly upon the appeal before the Judicial Committee, still it was there.\nNow, the result of the judgment (upon the construction of it which I submit to your Lordships) involves the power in the Dominion, in the broadest terms, to submit any question of law or fact which the Governor-General in Council may be advised in his own good judgment to submit for the consideration of this court. But, while it is quite open to my learned friends of the Province of Quebec, if they think there is room in view of what has been decided, to renew that contention, so far as my learned friend Mr. Hellmuth is concerned, in the observation which I happened to hear during the time I was listening to his argument, he has no brief or instructions from the Government to submit or to suggest to your Lordships that any one of these questions should go unanswered.\nWe have a factum filed denying the jurisdiction of Parliament to enact bill No. 3, signed by Mr. Mignault and Mr. Hellmuth, counsel retained by the Dominion of Canada, and whatever weight your Lordships may attach to Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s observations I wish you to consider them subject to the statement that he certainly has no instructions to submit on behalf of the Government that any one of the questions which have been solemnly submitted by the counsel for the Government to your Lordships, should not be answered. Outside of instructions he should make no suggestion on that point. He is either instructed or he is not instructed; his instructions are the limit of his authority to submit anything to the court. As to the course your Lordships should take I have submitted and I maintain that the power of the Governnor-General in Council to submit every one of these questions and to require your Lordships to answer them is conclusively set at rest by the recent decision of the Judicial Committee[73].\nThe practical question remains as to what course should be adopted by the court under the circumstances of the present reference and I would like to direct your Lordships\u2019 attention for a moment to the circumstances out of which this reference arose. A bill was introduced into the Parliament which is set out in what is termed the first question. That bill came up for discussion and being a bill predicated upon nothing but the solemnization of marriage it seemed hard to resist the conclusion that it did not relate to that very subject. But, it was maintained that it did not relate to the solemnization of marriage; that there was either an overriding power in the Parliament to control provincial legislation in the exercise of its powers to solemnize marriages or that this bill did not relate to that subject; I think the latter was the contention upon which the promoters of the bill rested. Now, my Lords, in these circumstances the absence of jurisdiction by the Parliament to enact the bill seemed to be reasonably clear, but considering the uncertainties of the law and that, in these constitutional questions particularly, the variety of judicial opinions is only limited by the number of courts to which resort may be had, it seemed necessary to submit a question upon the subject. Now, I say a \u201cquestion,\u201d because in the view I submit there is really only one question here. You may say that there are five questions here if you like, or you may say there are three, but, in my view, there is really only one question before the court, because what exists is an interrogation of the court arising out of the circumstance that this bill was introduced into the House of Commons and was advocated there as a measure which the House had authority to pass and which, in the exercise of its judgment, should receive effect as law. Then, the subject being very important and the authority of the Parliament to interfere with it at all being, at least, very doubtful, the Government concluded that the matter should stand over until judicial advice could be obtained, and the result was this interrogation which is before your Lordships.\nNobody says that what they call question No. 1 is not a perfectly proper question. It is the main point of the interrogation: Is this bill a bill which the Parliament has authority to enact? But, it is very plain to see that when a question is submitted to a court it cannot be foreseen what the answer to that question may be, and, therefore, in order to cover the ground so as to put Parliament in a position to deal intelligently with the subject, (if it be renewed,) it is necessary to put several inquiries, the one bearing upon the other, anticipating any sort of conclusion which the court may arrive at. Now, if your Lordships should conclude that Parliament has jurisdiction to pass this bill, it is obvious, I submit, that it is a very important and necessary inquiry as to what is the law of the Province of Quebec in respect to the point raised by the second question. Questions No. 2 and No. 3, in that view, especially question No. 2, become of the utmost importance, and I would respectfully urge that your Lordships should not hesitate by reason of any of the considerations which have been urged, to answer these questions on their merits if your conclusion be favourable to the jurisdiction of the Parliament upon the first question.\nIt is said that these questions may affect marriages, the status of parties who are not and cannot be represented in this court. The same is true, my Lords, of every case that is heard in this court, because other interests which are not represented and which cannot be represented under the practice of the court are affected, and are determined in every case which your Lordships decide. If the H\u00e9bert Case[74] comes to this court, the decision on it might affect hundreds of people, and yet they are equally without representation and without means of representation in that case as they are upon one of these references. The sanie is true of every case that has been heard and determined by this court by way of reference under the procedure of section 60 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d It is true that my learned friend points to one question of the Fisheries Case[75]\u2014and a single one\u2014which Lord Herschell objected to answer because it related to the rights of riparian proprietors acquired previous to Confederation, and in that case his Lordship said that these people were not, and could not be represented before the court and he did not see fit to answer. But he did answer all the other questions and these other questions affected existing rights to the fullest extent. Take the question, for instance, as to the section in the \u201cFisheries Act\u201d where it was enacted \u2014 and the Act had been standing there ever since the Union \u2014 that the Dominion might make leases of property in fisheries. The Department of Marine and Fisheries had been exercising that jurisdiction to grant fishery leases from the very beginning; there were hundreds of these leases outstanding; and yet the court proceeded cheerfully and without any protest to say that the Government had no power to grant these leases, but, the lessees were not and could not be represented although the property which they thought they had was taken away by that very decision. The same result may be shewn with regard to the other references.\nThen, there is the public interest and there is the private interest to consider and the public interest overweighs the private interest. Your Lordships cannot question the policy of any action of the Parliament within its jurisdiction, and if the Parliament has considered it good policy for the peace, order and good government of the country that these questions should be set at rest generally in this way, then I say that no single private interest, or group of such interests, should stand in the way of the determination of such questions as the Governor-General in Council sees fit to submit. The constitution, it is said, is carefully balanced so that no one of the parts of the Dominion can pass laws for itself except under control of the whole acting through the Governor-General. The Governor-General in Council in the exercise of that control, and by the authority of the Parliament, has submitted these questions in view of the situation which I have endeavoured to state. If your Lordships conclude, therefore, that there is jurisdiction, I submit that on no consideration which has been or can be suggested should your Lordships fail to advise upon every point that has been placed before you. On the other hand, if it be determined that there is no jurisdiction to enact the bill a different situation is before your Lordships. If there be no jurisdiction to enact the bill, if you answer the first part of the interrogatory in the negative, I see no reason to suppose that the latter part is not to be grouped with that; Question No. 1 and question No. 3 as they stand here appear to go together:\u2014\n\u201c3. If either (a) or (b) of the last preceding question is answered in the affirmative, or if both of them are answered in the affirmative, has the Parliament of Canada authority to enact that all such marriages whether,\n(a) heretofore solemnized, or,\n(b) hereafter to be solemnized,\nshall be legal and binding?\u201d\nThat reference is in reference to the character, status, or qualification of the person before whom the marriage is celebrated. The bill says:\u2014\n\u201c3. Every ceremony or form of marriage heretofore or hereafter performed by any person authorized to perform any ceremony of marriage by the laws of the place where it is performed, and duly performed according to such laws, shall everywhere within Canada be deemed to be a valid marriage, not withstanding any differences in the religious faith of the persons so married and without regard to the religion of the person performing the ceremony.\u201d\nThat speaks of the religion of the person performing the ceremony and as to the religious faith of the persons married. Question 2 reads:\u2014\n\u201c2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province,\n(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or\n(b) between persons one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic?\u201d\nThat has to do with the person before whom the celebration takes place, and question No. 3 is concerned with the power of the Parliament to enact whether such marriages whether heretofore or hereafter solemnized would be legal and binding. These questions go together and if No. 1 be answered in the negative, No. 3 must be answered in the negative.\nNow, my Lords, I have very little to add; it is certain, I submit, that between the view of the executive and the view of the court as to whether a question should be answered or not, in the last resort the view of the executive prevails. But in the meantime situations change and opinions develop, and if it appear on the reading of this submission that there is in effect one interrogation, that it is divided into clauses having regard to what might follow from the different views which the court might entertain, it is quite open and proper for the court, no doubt, to submit that, in view of the opinions which are handed in upon certain parts of the interrogation it becomes unnecessary, in the view of the court, to answer the rest. And if the Government upon that submission, entertain a different view, I presume the Government would communicate that to the court for further consideration.\nThe two bodies are engaged, each in its own sphere, in working out the constitution of the country. In arguments before the court extreme cases are often put, but they are not good as illustrations for the purpose of arriving at the principle. It would be an extreme case that the Government insist upon very extravagant questions, unusual and improper, being put and answered by the court. It is time enough to consider that when such a case arises. It never has arisen yet and I do not anticipate, and I do not see that there is any reason to anticipate that there should ever be any conflict between the executive and the judiciary in the administration of section 60 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d That section contains a very useful power and one which has been often invoked and which the courts have accepted and acted upon in the settlement of the great constitutional questions of the country. The Government in the submission of questions, so far as intention goes, is certainly very careful to submit nothing but what is of public importance and what, in the view of the Government, may properly be answered by the court. The court, in its superior knowledge of the constitution and the working of the laws, may upon the consideration of these questions see reason, instead of answering categorically, to submit points for the consideration of the Government with regard to the matter. That is the situation here. I submit that the matter is in your Lordships\u2019 hands here as one interrogation arising out of a situation created in view of the public agitation and the introduction of this bill.\nNesbitt K.C. (in reply).\u2014My Lords, my desire first, is, to get back to what is, after all, the real question, namely, whether the Dominion has power to pass the bill referred, and to arrive at a right conclusion upon that question.\nThe first essential is a careful examination and a right understanding of the terms of the bill itself. The bill pre-supposes three things: (1) It pre-supposes a provincial official, appointed and authorized by one of the provinces to solemnize marriages \u2014 no matter for the moment what marriages, but \u201csome\u201d marriages \u2014 in other words, it pre-supposes some machinery established by the province for the solemnization of marriages in the province. The power of the province to establish such machinery is in no way questioned or impaired by the bill. (2) It pre-supposes also that the parties seeking the protection of its provisions shall have their marriage solemnized before this provincial official \u2014 that is, that they have availed themselves of the solemnizing machinery established by the province. (3) And lastly, for more abundant caution, it pre-supposes that all other relevant provincial requirements, with the one exception to be mentioned in a moment, have been complied with. Unless the requirements of these three suppositions have been complied with, the benefit of the bill cannot be obtained. In short, the language of the bill is confined strictly to the object which it is designed to effect, and neither touches nor impairs anything but the difficulties which it is intended to remedy. It does not dispense with the performance of any ceremony, nor relieve any one concerned from any penalty which they may have incurred under the provincial law owing to failure in such performance. What it does, and all that it does, is to relieve the persons who have fulfilled its requirements from the effect, upon the validity of their marriage not upon any other liability to which they may have exposed themselves \u2014 which the province has said shall prevent\u2019 them from availing themselves of the machinery of solemnization which it has established. In other words, it relieves them from the effect upon their marriage of article 127 of the Civil Code.\nIt is admitted \u2014 indeed learnedly contended by the other side \u2014 that the incapacity of the parties to avail themselves of the provincial machinery I have mentioned is an impediment so-called, and an impediment within the meaning of that article. It is admitted also that the Dominion has jurisdiction to create and remove impediments to marriage under its undoubted jurisdiction over the capacity of the parties. What foundation, then, is there for the objection of the power of the Dominion to pass this bill, which is designed to remove this impediment of clandestinity as it is carefully worded so as to do nothing more.\nMy submission is that the Dominion, under the right to legislate upon the broad subject of marriage, as to the status or capacity of the parties, can enable any person to enter into that state, to obtain that status and can prescribe what is precisely necessary to create that status, leaving it for the provinces to pass any laws they see fit to solemnize the status which the Dominion has so allowed to be created.\nBut my friend, Mr. Mignault, has endeavoured to put his case on question 2 upon the provisions of the Code apart from article 127. I shall leave it to my friend, Mr. Lafleur, to discuss how far it is possible for Mr. Mignault to support his contention without the assistance of that article. But, Mr. Lafleur has pointed out in opening, and I point out again that, even as so put, Mr. Mignault\u2019s contention involves this \u2014 that there is no way in which those who profess any religious belief not recognized by one or other of the special Acts that have been referred to and no way in which those who profess no religious belief whatever can validly contract marriage at all. That has been referred to at somewhat greater length since I made this note \u2014 my learned friends opposite are left in the extreme dilemma that, although the Dominion has complete and absolute jurisdiction on the subject of marriage to declare throughout the length and breadth of the Dominion what shall constitute marriage, so far as the Province of Quebec is concerned, if Mr. Mignault is correct, there are great numbers of people in that province with an absolute inability to obtain that status from any jurisdiction. My friend, Mr. Mignault, has no answer to the contention that those who profess no religious belief whatever cannot, under his argument, validly contract a marriage in the Province of Quebec at all. His idea is that such persons can, if they choose, and if they can afford it, apply to the legislature for a special Act of their own, which they may or may not obtain. So that the situation is, if he be right in his contention, that many of the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec have no capacity to marry, there being an absolute impediment to their marriage. Why, if this be so, is it not competent to the Dominion, in the exercise of its admitted jurisdiction over capacity and impediment, to confer upon such persons the capacity which my learned friend, Mr. Mignault, by his answer to the difficulty, admits that they now lack, and to remove the impediment to their marriage, which under his contention is imposed upon them.\nAs to the second clause of the bill it is, I submit, interesting to discuss any questions as to the power of the Dominion under the word \u201cmarriage,\u201d to legislate upon the property rights and so forth which may flow from the establishment of the marriage contract. The bill, which alone is before your Lordships, touches none of these matters, but simply leaves the parties to such rights in these respects as, their marriage being established, they may have under the provincial law. It gives them no greater rights than such as may be conferred by the province legislating in its own sphere, upon any other married people, the words \u201crights and duties as married people,\u201d obviously mean only such rights and duties as the competent authority \u2014 the Dominion, possibly, in some respects; the provinces, in others \u2014 may confer upon persons validly married.\nI turn now to the argument of my friend, Mr. Hellmuth, and it seems to me, if I may say so, that he has completely misapprehended the argument which I addressed to your Lordships in opening this discussion. I am quite prepared to admit to the fullest extent\u2014 I could not do otherwise if I would \u2014 the principles laid down by the authorities he has cited. But I was unable to understand their effect upon my argument. They establish, as I understand them, that a marriage validly solemnized according to the laws where the solemnization takes place, is, qu\u00e2 that solemnization, valid everywhere \u2014 in other words that the \u201cform\u201d of the marriage is governed by the lex loci contract\u00fbs, or celebrationis as it is sometimes called, and differs in that from the capacity of the parties to the marriage, which is governed by the law of their respective domicile. And, consequently, if a marriage be solemnized in a country by the laws of which certain ceremonies are essential to the formation of a valid marriage, or, in other words, where those ceremonies are actually made part of the very contract, and those ceremonies are omitted, or defectively performed, the marriage, being invalid by the lex loci contract\u00fbs is invalid everywhere. No one, I should think, could dispute that proposition. But, it has no application to my argument or to any of the questions before the court, for it assumes the very point at issue in all of them. It assumes, and is based upon the assumption, that by the law of the place where the marriage is contracted the proper observance of the prescribed forms and ceremonies is essential to the validity of the marriage. But the very questions before the court in this case are: (1) Has the province made a particular form of solemnization essential to the validity of a marriage, and, (2), if it has purported to do so, is such legislation within its powers?\nI am, of course, not dealing with the former question because an affirmative answer to it is just as necessary a pre-supposition of my present argument as it is of my learned friend\u2019s proposition. But, my friend\u2019s authorities can have no application to the latter question either, which is the one I am now discussing, that as to the legislative power of the province, because those authorities equally pre-suppose an affirmative answer to this question as well. Every case that Mr. Hellmuth discussed is based upon the ceremony, the form being made an essential part of the validity of the contract, and made by a power with undisputed rights to deal with the whole subject-matter, contract, solemnization and everything else. But, that does not forward the discussion here. What we have to discuss is a question of legislative power under a divided jurisdiction, and the only question with which I am now concerned is one on which my friend\u2019s authorities throw no light at all, namely, whether or not it is within the powers of the provinces under \u201csolemnization of marriage in the province\u201d to make any ceremony at all essential to the validity of a marriage.\nThe \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d says \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d; that is, solemnization of that status, of that condition pre-supposing the status existed. I should think that a very large majority of your Lordships \u2014 I hope not all \u2014 are startled by the argument, but, were it not for the fact that it had been taken in, so to speak, the breath of our lives from the beginning that marriage means something connected with a ceremony and that a ceremony is essential to it, I should have thought that the language of the Act would be perfectly plain \u2014 the solemnization of the status, which status is entirely within the sole and absolute jurisdiction of the Dominion to deal with entirely; and when the Dominion says what shall form that status when people are married the provinces can pass any legislation they please with reference to the solemnization of it, but they cannot for one moment interject or interpose something that is essential to the validity of that marriage. The Dominion alone has the power to deal with that.\nMy contention, as I have said, is that ceremony is not essential to the validity of a marriage. And here again my learned friend, Mr. Hellmuth, seems to have fallen into some misapprehension. He appears to have thought that the purpose for which I cited The Queen v. Millis[76] and Beamish v. Beamish[77] is answered by pointing out that what those cases actually decided was that under the law of England a certain form or ceremony, namely, the presence of a priest, had always been essential to the validity of a marriage. But that decision \u2014 that is, the point actually decided \u2014 has no application to my argument, for the same reason that my friend\u2019s other authorities have none, namely, because it was based upon special legislation making the ceremony essential. The purpose for which I cited The Queen v. Millis(1) was to shew, from the reasoning and authorities to be found there, what the situation was and always would be apart from such special legislation, and to establish that, apart from legislation to the contrary, the contract of marriage and its solemnization are two separate and distinct things, and that, even when some ceremony was prescribed, its absence did not invalidate unless it appears from the legislation that that was the intention. My friend cited Swifte v. Attorney-General for Ireland[78], but I should think that that authority made perfectly clear the difference. Lord Loreburn says that legislation relates only to the form of ceremony and, therefore, is not extra-territorial, but he points out the distinction. In that case the form or ceremony was made an absolute essential, a condition precedent to the validity of the marriage, and the legislation was passed by a legislature fully competent to deal with the subject. It throws no light on it except the sort of side-light that may be gathered from case after case cited by Mr. Hellmuth where the statutes used the word \u201csolemnize\u201d as distinct from the other, and, as I say, with every submission; points to the one conclusion to be drawn from this Act \u2014 that what you are dealing with is the power of the provinces, not to legislate upon marriage, but simply on the solemnization of the existing status \u2014 of a status, the right to prescribe all the essentials of which are in the Dominion. Deny that proposition and you will say that although the Dominion has complete and absolute power, notwithstanding anything contained in section 92, to deal with the subject of marriage, to create that status with the subject of marriage, and, therefore, to create that status and, therefore, to legislate upon all its essentials, yet the provinces can step in and, by interposing anything they see fit under the guise of solemnization, can say that that status cannot come into existence. I submit that such a result will certainly make your Lordships pause a long time before you bring it into effect. It was for this reason that I quoted so largely from Lord Brougham and Lord Campbell. They held that there was no such special legislation in England, and, consequently, discussed what the position was in its absence. And what they say as to this neither was disputed, nor, I suppose, could be disputed. From their reasoning I argue that the power claimed by the provinces to make any ceremony essential to a valid marriage, and to invalidate marriages where such ceremony has not been performed, cannot be conferred on them by the words \u201csolemnization of marriage,\u201d in any proper meaning of these words, and, consequently, the power to override any such invalidating provincial legislation must be in the Dominion under the word \u201cmarriage.\u201d Under the word \u201cmarriage\u201d the Dominion must have power to define what marriage means, to say what are, and, consequently, what are not essentials, of a valid marriage; in other words, as Mr. Justice Idington put it, to say that marriage is what marriage is; and you cannot get out of the word \u201csolemnization\u201d the power to add another essential to marriage. The result I submit is, that, even though the bill cannot be supported as removing an impediment or conferring a capacity,\u2014 for that argument has nothing to do with the argument I am now urging \u2014 it is still within the power of the Dominion as asserting its jurisdiction over marriage.\nOne other observation about the Montreal Street Railway Case[79]. That case, I submit, has no bearing whatever upon the real point of the construction of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d involved here. As I understand it, what is involved here is this: Granted the subject is one for which there is a special heading under section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d anything that is necessarily incidental to that can be passed by the Dominion Parliament, this overrides any of the matters involved in section 92. I think that is established beyond doubt. But His Lordship, the Chief Justice, puts this, which needs to be grappled with, \u2014 as I understand him he says you have out of that head in 91 a special head of its own delimited and coupled with property and civil rights and, therefore, that it hinges upon the rule of construction that I have been urging. Now, I say that, if anything, it points and adds force to the rule that I have been urging. You have got to take first marriage, and out of that is taken \u2014 they have seen fit not to leave property and civil rights to be dealt with at all \u2014 but out of that they have taken the solemnization of that condition. Suppose they said \u201cthe solemnization of that status,\u201d would your Lordships say that they could say that under the head of \u201csolemnization\u201d they could destroy that status by inserting terms that would render the bringing of that status into existence absolutely useless. You have the word \u201cmarriage\u201d coupled with \u201cdivorce\u201d and you have to read the two together. Divorce must be given the meaning of anything that relates to the untying of the supposed de facto condition of marriage. Why should you make marriage of a less breadth or importance than divorce when you have eliminated out of that simply the solemnization of that status? Now, the answer to the first question is only with regard to the bill and the answer to the third question is as to the general validity. The Dominion can create a court and can give that court full power to deal with, if I am right in my argument, the undoing of that marriage which would set the parties loose, as for instance, on the ground of physical incapacity. Under this authority the Dominion could give that court any rules it sees fit, to declare what it shall be governed by. Could the Dominion not say that if the parties have gone through the solemnization in a form that is prescribed they may have the status or may not have the status; and could not the Dominion legitimize the children and declare that the parties had the status of married people? Could a province, under the guise \u2014 and this is my last suggestion \u2014 could a province, under the guise of solemnization, limit the right of a citizen to enter into the state of marriage; could the provinces say that a red-haired man must only be married to a red-headed woman? Can the provinces curtail and fetter the rights of a citizen in that respect upon which the Dominion alone has the right to legislate? Can a province declare as to the right of a citizen to enter into the married state; can a province limit his capacity by any attempt to say that he can only do it by so and so?\nLafleur E.C.\u2014My Lords, as I intimated in my opening remarks, an investigation of the conditions of our laws immediately after the conquest does not seem to me to be pertinent or necessary for a decision in this case, because, as I observed to your Lordships, we have a declaratory statute immediately preceding the Code which seems to me to do away with all doubts as to the rights of the several churches to celebrate marriage, and it only becomes a matter of construction as to how far the authority of the clergymen of each of these communities extends in the celebration of marriage. That there is no restriction as to the persons whom they may marry is my view on the matter, and nothing that I have heard up to this time has disturbed that. The declaratory Act is the Consolidated Statutes of 1860. May I say this with reference to the law before that date, and I consider it useful only in leading up to a statement of what the law was in 1860 and at the time the Civil Code was enacted. It appears to me that the Articles of Capitulation in 1759 and the Articles of Capitulation in 1760, and the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, had this effect, and no more: It gave to the Roman Catholic subjects of His Majesty free exercise of their religion and the fullest and freest rights in that respect, but it appears to me that it cannot be successfully contended that the grant of this right and privilege to the Catholics of the colony implied the exclusion in any sense of the religion of the conquering nation or delimitation or restriction of the rights of the clergy of the conquering nation who were clearly entitled to exercise their ministry in the conquered country. It seems to me that any other contention is repugnant not only to the British constitution but to a reasonable construction of these Articles of Capitulation and to the language of the treaty. It would seem to me on the face of it that you cannot pretend that by tolerating a religion, which was then repugnant to the religion in the constitution of the conquering country, that you restricted in any way the religion of the conqueror in the conquered territory. That would seem to be self-evident as a matter of constitutional law.\nTherefore, it does not seem to me to be reasonably arguable that the grant to the Roman Catholic subjects of His Majesty of the free exercise of their religion whether under the capitulation of Quebec or the capitulation of Montreal or the Treaty of Paris gave them any exclusive rights as against the Anglican Church. That, I think, is reasonably clear. I say that so much of the French canonical law as was inconsistent with the free exercise of the ministry of the Church of England, after the conquest, was repugnant and could not survive the conquest. So much of that law as would exclude the ministry of the Anglican Church clergymen would be quite incompatable with the law of the conqueror and would be repealed, and I find that is the law by reason of the declaratory statute that says that Anglican clergymen had the power before 1861, which presupposes existence of that power from the time of the conquest down to this date; and remember, when you come to the next step after the capitulation of Quebec, and the capitulation of Montreal in 1760, you have in the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d of 1774, language which introduces, in the 8th section, the laws of Canada. Now, that must mean the laws of Canada as they existed immediately before the Act. It says that resort shall be had to the laws of Canada as the rule for the decision of matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights. That means and includes the law that was brought in as a necessary part of the conquest, and which had not been repealed. The \u201cQuebec Act\u201d simply repealed the proclamation of Governor Murray, which purported to introduce the English civil law as a whole into the country, and all the previous ordinances and other Acts and instruments which had been issued thereunder. But it did not affect what I contend was a necessary part of our system immediately after the conquest and that is the exercise of the ministries of the Anglican clergymen according to the rites of their church, and in that respect their authority was absolutely unrestricted, and they could marry any one whomsoever. What confirms that view is the fact that between 1774 and 1860 you find no statute which purports to give to the clergy of the Anglican Church the power to marry. You have statutes granted to dissenters to give that power; and you have it given at a very early date to the Church of Scotland, and you will find from the statute that the authority given in 1827 to the Church of Scotland is absolutely unrestricted.\nNow, with regard to the Anglican Church no special statute was necessary because of the position of things which necessarily occurred at the time of the conquest, viz., the introduction of the power of the clergy of the conquering nation and of the exercise of that religion. It is only in 1860 that any reference is made to the subject by a statute which recognizes the rights of the various communities to celebrate marriage.\nI submit that Act, being a declaratory interpretative Act, justifies my contention. That statute with reference to the Scotch Church is absolutely unrestricted, the clergy of that church can celebrate all marriages.\nIt helps one to understand this legislation when we see that section 16 of the Act, ch. 20, Con. Stat. L.C. 1860, made provision separately for the Church of England and the Church of Scotland. Then you pass on to section 17 of that Act, which recites the numerous statutes passed to enable various religious communities, to keep registers of civil status, beginning with the Baptists and ending with the Quakers. The recital of these Acts covers two pages and includes almost all the dissenting sects which had arisen in Canada, up to that time. Of course many more have arisen since and we have had a great deal of private legislation giving them the right to keep registers. But the enacting part of that Act says, that this Act extends also \u2014 independent of the Anglican Church and the Scotch Church \u2014 to the several religious communities and denominations in Lower Canada mentioned in this section of the Act, to the priests or ministers thereof, who may validly solemnize marriages and may obtain and keep registers under this Act subject to the provisions of the Act mentioned, with reference to each of them respectively. So that if there was any restriction in any Act applying to a religious denomination its powers would be restricted pro tanto. It is not very material, but, if your Lordships refer to the Act respecting the Jews you will find that they did not effectually restrict the powers of the Jews in that respect, but that they did restrict the power of the Quakers by saying that they should have the right to celebrate marriages between persons professing the faith of the said religious Society of Friends commonly called Quakers or one of whom may belong to that denomination.\nBut I suggest that this interesting inquiry into the old law becomes superfluous when we have the law immediately before the enactment of the Civil Code clearly laid down in the statute of 1860. I say it is the source of the Code, and that statute gives the state of the law which you have to consider, if you are going to consider the antecedent law at all, in explaining unambiguous words in the Code. But, my submission is that there is no ambiguity in the Code, that nothing could be clearer than article 129 and that it needs no reference to antecedent law to construe it, and if you go beyond the existing law then you must take the law that existed immediately before the enactment of the existing law, and not go back one hundred years before for your authority. The law which immediately preceded the Code is the law laid down in the statute of 1860, and it gave no restricted authority to the ministers of religion, except in so far as a special Act in some cases may have restricted them. That brings me once more to article 129, to which I am loth to return, because it seems to me I have taken up a great deal of your time over it already. To the Baptists, to the Presbyterians and so on, the powers are given to the ministers of these bodies almost in the same words in each statute.\nIt would be impossible, where all religions are tolerated as, they are with us, where all sects are lawful and are able to carry on their ministry without any difference being made between them by the law of the land, to carry out a system in these days that originated at a time when there was only one State Church. It is inapplicable in its terms to the present complicated state of things and there, I take it we find an explanation of the general terms used in article 129 of the Code. The observations of the commissioners which have been cited by Mr. Mignault go no further than this: That it was intended to frame this article in general terms because of the difficulty of the situation but not to make any distinction between one and the other in law. My learned friend\u2019s contention, if I understood it at all, was this: that the Catholic priest\u2019s authority to marry was restricted to the Catholics, the Anglican clergyman\u2019s authority was restricted to the Anglicans, and so on, every sect was restricted to its own congregation. I submit you cannot find that even suggested by the terms of article 129. I say, on the contrary, it is precluded by the language of article 129. The first paragraph of article 129 is of so general a character that you cannot import any such idea into it unless you had it in your mind beforehand. I would defy anyone who is not familiar with the history of this country to take that article per se and read into it all that the ingenuity of Mr. Mignault has read into it. He is filled with all the historic lore that he has so well expounded to your Lordships, but take any judge who is free from any such prepossession and get him to construe article 129, \u2014can you imagine he would introduce any such restriction into it? It says:\u2014\n\u201cAll priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status are competent to solemnize marriage.\u201d\nIt says they are competent to solemnize marriages generally; not, to solemnize particular marriages between certain persons. And then it goes on to say what is inconsistent with the idea of their being so restricted; it says that\n\u201cnone of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage if any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion and the discipline of the church to which he belongs.\u201d\nMr. Mignault suggests that that means that where there is an impediment to the marriage the priest or clergyman is not compellable to marry. Of course he is not; if there was an impediment he would not need article 129 to relieve him of the obligation; he would not have the right to celebrate the marriage. The provisions of that paragraph are intended to apply to a case where there is no legal impediment but where there is conscientious objection on the part of the minister. Can it be doubted that the Parliament since Confederation has the power to pass bills for the relief of consorts who have been married and to authorize them to marry again? That power has not been disputed. Take the case of two persons who have thus procured divorce from the Parliament of Canada and who have been authorized to marry again, presenting themselves before an Anglican clergyman or a Roman Catholic priest; surely that is a case where the article applies. That clergyman is not compelled to celebrate that marriage because it is contrary to the doctrine of the church to which he belongs although the parties are free to marry. They are free to marry but they cannot compel that clergyman to marry them. That is surely the natural meaning of that article, and to give it any other meaning is to deprive it of any sense at all.\nJust one or two observations with regard to the other articles you are referred to in connection with article 129. It seems to me that if you look first at the place where the marriage is to be celebrated, and I do not think that would be conclusive in any event, but even if it were there, which I contend it is not, and that the marriage must be celebrated in the parish of the parties, it could not always be celebrated in the parish in one place because the parties might have different parishes. I will comment on article 63 as to that. However, that is not the question, the question is:\u2014Assuming that the locus of the marriage is defined and restricted, that does not restrict the capacity of the officer to marry persons who come from another place, as long as he performs his ministry within his jurisdiction, if jurisdiction there be. I shall refer briefly to these articles. By article 57 the banns must be published where the parties reside, in their respective churches, but as you see from this article the marriage is not necessarily solemnized by the person who publishes the banns, and all the person who performs the marriage has to do is to get a certificate shewing that the banns have been published.\nTake the case where they are in different parishes, and then there must be two competent since the marriage is celebrated by the cur\u00e9 of the parties. By article 63 the marriage is celebrated at the place of domicile of one or other of the parties.\nMy learned friend says there may be two competent to solemnize the marriage, and I say there may be more, but at all events he cannot contend there is only one competent. The marriage is to be celebrated at the place of domicile of one or other of the parties and if it is solemnized elsewhere the person officiating is obliged to ascertain the identity of the parties. That is a natural consequence of having your marriage solemnized outside of your domicile. Surely, that shews that the provision is merely directory. If you look at article 1105 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which has not been referred to, you will find it confirms the idea that the locus is not a matter of necessity, but the obligation is placed on the officer of identifying the parties if they are married elsewhere than at their domicile.\nI do not attach the slightest importance to the question of the locus where the marriage is to be celebrated, because it does not seem to me that touches the question of the capacity of the clergyman when he is officiating in that locus. I merely wished to give your Lordships my construction of these articles which, I admit, leave the law in an unsatisfactory condition, though not as unsatisfactory as the law with regard to marriage licenses.\nNow, as to the application of section 127 of the Civil Code \u2014 that is really the last fortress of my learned friend, Mr. Mignault. After he is driven from the field in his restricted construction of article 129, he still says that, under the provisions of article 127, there is an incapacity in the case of Catholics to have a marriage celebrated before any one else than a priest of that religion. What I have to submit, with respect to article 127, is that, whatever may be regarded by the canonists as its meaning, we must construe what is the meaning and application of the word \u201cimpediment\u201d in article 127, having regard to its place in the Civil Code and to the context. You find that it is under the chapter headed: \u201cOf the Qualities and Conditions Necessary for Contracting Marriage,\u201d and among the disabilities there enumerated you will find there is want of puberty, impotency, minority, alliance and relationship. Articles 123, 124, and 125 deal with relationship or affinity, and article 127 says:\u2014\n\u201cThe other impediments recognized according to the different religious persuasions, as resulting from relationship or affinity or from other causes, remain subject to the rules hitherto followed in the different churches and religious communities.\u201d\nMy submission was and is, that these other causes must be causes of the same nature, causes within the purview and scope of that chapter, that is, they must be qualities and conditions necessary for contracting marriage and of the character of the others, viz., they are disabilities of the persons. The whole chapter deals with the competency of the candidates for marriage. The next chapter deals with a totally different subject, and that is the competency of the officer who solemnizes the marriage. I say you introduce a hopeless confusion if you construe article 127 as in any way referring to the formalities relating to the celebration of marriage, and I say it is a misnomer and a misuse of language for lawyers to say, when they are construing article 127 of the Code, that that is an impediment to the marriage of the parties, when the heading of the chapter within which the article is found treats of the qualities and conditions necessary for contracting marriage in the parties themselves.\nMy submission is that that must all refer to the qualifications and conditions of the candidates for marriage. The next chapter deals with the qualities of the celebrating officer. You cannot say that in a chapter that deals with the qualifications and conditions required for marriage, you could consider the objection to or incompetency of a public officer. Article 127 has left that subject-matter of canonical impediments to the diffierent churches and in the next chapter, which deals with the competency of the public officer, it has not left it to any church to say; the Code itself says what a competent officer is. I submit that the language of that section is very plain.\nNow, I have only one word to add as to sub-question (b) of question No. 2. I shall say very little on that for the obvious reason that my learned friend, Mr. Mignault, does not support the view that mixed marriages are at all in jeopardy; he believes that they are valid. An expression fell from the Chief Justice yesterday to the effect that the whole question was settled by the terms of the Benedictine declaration, and I concede that settles the question so far as the application of article 127 is concerned. That is clear, because under the Benedictine declaration it seems to be a canonical impediment and so there is an end to that question. But I say it does not do away with the difficulty which does result from the restrictive interpretation put upon article 129 independently of article 127.\nIf the minister of each sect were restricted to his own congregation, then there would be an end to the possibility of mixed marriages at all, there would be no clergyman by which they could be celebrated. That is the legitimate conclusion of Mr. Mignault\u2019s argument, but he recoiled from that legitimate conclusion when it comes to be applied in practice.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014As this is the end of the argument, it remains for me, on behalf of my brother judges and myself, to say that we are extremely indebted to the bar for the very valuable assistance they have given to us throughout the whole of this argument. We have all been impressed with the unfailing patience and courtesy of counsel, and the learning displayed by them, which we all agree is quite worthy of gentlemen who occupy the very high position that you occupy at the bar of your respective provinces.\nThe court reserved its decision and, on the 17th day of June, 1912, their Lordships proceeded to give the following reasons for their respective opinions. The Chief Justice.\u2014To the first question, my answer is \u201cno.\u201d\nWhatever may be, with respect to the capacity of the parties, the authority over marriage which is vested by section 91 in the Dominion Parliament, there can be no doubt, in my opinion:\u2014\n1st. That a marriage is not valid and can produce no civil effects until solemnized.\n2nd. That solemnization, which includes the form and ceremony of marriage, is, by virtue of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d within the exclusive legislative competency of the different provincial legislatures.\n3rd. That there is no marriage within a province where all the legal formalities prescribed by the legislature of that province are not observed.\n4th. That Parliament has no power or authority to remedy any omission or defect or to dispense with any of the requirements with respect to form or ceremony which are prescribed by the legislature of the province within which the marriage is solemnized.\nTherefore, Parliament has no authority to enact in whole or in part Bill No. 3 of the First Session of the Twelfth Parliament of Canada, intituled \u201cAn Act to amend the \u2018Marriage Act\u2019\u201d the purpose of which is to provide a legislative remedy for or dispensation from any defect or requirement in \u201cevery ceremony or form of marriage\u201d and to regulate the \u201crights and duties of the persons married and of the children of such marriages.\u201d\nIn answer to question 2:\u2014\nIn view of the replies given to questions 1 and 3 and the reasons assigned therefor by the majority of the judges here, I beg to ask that I may be relieved of the obligation to answer the first branch of this question No. 2 for the following, among other, reasons:\u2014\n1st. Because Mr. Newcombe and Mr. Hellmuth, both acting for the Attorney-General of the Dominion, have informed the court, in substance, that this question was predicated on the assumption that questions 1 and 3 would be answered in the affirmative.\n2nd. Because, as at present advised, I am of opinion that there is no appeal to this court from the judgment of a Quebec court in a case which would involve the determination of this abstract question;\n3rd. Because the question Involves the determination of a point that is in issue in a case now actually pending before a competent Quebec tribunal, and I respectfully suggest that in such circumstances proper respect for judicial ethics requires us to abstain from unnecessarily expressing an opinion which must be without force or effect;\n4th. Because the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec, who is immediately responsible for the administration of justice in that province and the guardian of the legal rights of its inhabitants has represented to this court that although the answer to the first branch of this question is only advisory in its character, litigants in that province will necessarily be prejudiced by any answer that may be given, to use the language of the Lord Chancellor \u201cwithout so much as an opportunity of stating their objections.\u201d In these circumstances, adopting the suggestion of the Lord Chancellor, I give the above reasons as some indication of the \u201chigh degree of constraint and inconvenience\u201d which is certain to result from a merely academic answer to the first branch of this question. To the second branch of this question, I answer \u201cno.\u201d\nIn answer to the third question, I can add nothing to the reasons given in support of my answer to question No. 1. If the power to authorize the solemnization of marriage in a province is vested exclusively in the Provincial Legislature, there can be no authority in the Parliament of Canada to retrospectively validate a marriage defectively solemnized or to provide that future marriages may be solemnized otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of the provincial law.\nDavies J.\u2014Question 1(a). \u201cHas the Parliament of Canada authority to enact in whole or in part Bill No. 3 of the First Session of the Twelfth Parliament of Canada, intituled \u2018An Act to amend the Marriage Act\u2019\u201d?\nThe bill provides as follows:\u2014\n1. The \u201cMarriage Act,\u201d chapter 105 of the Revised Statutes, 1906, is amended by adding thereto the following section:\u2014\n\u201c3. Every ceremony or form of marriage heretofore or hereafter performed by any person authorized to perform any ceremony of marriage by the laws of the place where it is performed, and duly performed according to such laws, shall everywhere within Canada be deemed to be a valid marriage, notwithstanding any difference in the religious faith of the persons so married and without regard to the religion of the persons performing the ceremony.\u201d\n\u201c(2) The rights and duties, as married people of the respective persons married as aforesaid, and of the children of such marriage, shall be absolute and complete, and no law or canonical decree or custom of or in any province of Canada shall have any force or effect to invalidate or qualify any such marriage or any of the right of the said persons or their children in any manner whatsoever.\u201d\n(b) If the provisions of the said bill are not all within the authority of the Parliament of Canada to enact, which, if any, of the provisions are within such authority? I construe this bill as attempting, in its first section, to validate by Dominion legislation marriages solemnized by or before a person having only a limited provincial authority to solemnize marriages in cases where such person has ignored such limitations and attempted to solemnize a marriage beyond the powers given him by a provincial legislature.\nThe bill is supported on the ground that the subject-matter of \u201cMarriage and Divorce\u201d was assigned by the 91st section of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d to the Dominion Parliament, and that as a consequence that Parliament has the exclusive power of legislation with regard to essentials over the whole subject-matter, and that this exclusive power has not been lessened or diminished by the assignment in the 92nd section of the same Act to the Provincial Legislature of the exclusive power to legislate with regard to \u201cthe solemnization of marriage.\u201d\nThe contention submitted by Mr. Nesbitt was, in effect, that under our constitutional Act of 1867, all questions relating and essential to the contract of marriage, namely, its definition, the capacity of the parties to enter into it, and all the circumstances upon which its validity are to depend, are assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament while the regulation of the evidential formalities authenticating the contract, they not being essential to its validity, are assigned to the legislatures of the provinces. All matters of substance would thus be assigned to the Dominion. Mere matters of form would be assigned to the provinces and their neglect or violation though punishable by penalties prescribed by provincial law would not in any way affect the validity of the marriage. The conclusion was submitted by counsel for the promoters of the bill that the contract of marriage is and always was \u201centirely independent of any religious or other ceremonial accompaniment\u201d and that in the absence of Dominion legislation the common law had to be resorted to in order to determine whether parties were legally married or not,\nI cannot bring myself to believe that these contentions can prevail. They are not in my opinion based upon a true construction of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d In my judgment the division of legislative power created in that statute and assigned respectively to the Dominion and the provinces was not one which, gave exclusive legislative power over all the essentials of the subject-matter of marriage to the Dominion, and that over non-essential formalities only to the provinces. The Imperial Parliament, when passing that Act, will at least be credited with the knowledge that so-called common law marriages were not valid in England and that it had been judicially determined by the House of Lords in the case of Beamish v. Beamish[80], that\nit was settled by the decision of The Queen v. Millis[81], that to constitute a valid marriage by the common law of England it must have been celebrated in the presence of a clergyman in holy orders.\nIn the light, therefore, of the law as it existed in England at the time of the passage of our constitutional Act, 1867, on the subject of marriage and also as it then existed in the colonies being confederated into the Dominion and also in view of the differences of race and religion prevailing amongst the inhabitants of the various provinces, I cannot doubt that in assigning the exclusive power of legislation over the solemnization of marriage to the provinces, the Imperial Parliament intended to confer upon them a much greater power than that of legislating on mere non-essential formalities.\nThe subject-matter, \u201cthe, solemnization of marriage in the province.\u201d covers and aptly expresses, in my judgment, every manner or mode in which competent parties, intending to contract marriage with each other, might validly so contract. No limitation was placed upon the power of the legislatures to which that subject-matter was assigned. Their powers are plenary. The legislatures of the several provinces may within their several legislative jurisdictions make religious ceremonies necessary to validate a marriage or may make its solemnization before a civil functionary of any kind sufficient for the purpose with or without witnesses. It is probable that they would have power to declare the solemnization of marriage to be complete without the presence of a priest, clergyman, minister, civil functionary, or witness, and by the mere consent of the parties intermarrying evidenced in writing or by mere words. As their powers of legislation are plenary and exclusive over the subject-matter assigned to them, no limitation can be placed upon their exercise and any invasion of their jurisdiction by the Dominion Parliament under the guise of legislating upon carriages and divorce would be ultra vires. If apt and proper language is used in provincial legislation, making any form of solemnization or the presence of any designated person or any person of a designated class, religious or civil, essential to the validity of the solemnization of a marriage and such requisite is disregarded and ignored, the marriage is ipso facto void and cannot be validated by the Dominion Parliament.\nI construe the division of legislative powers made by our constitutional Act as carving out of the subject-matter of marriage and divorce assigned to the Dominion a distinct and essential part denominated \u201cthe solemnization of marriage.\u201d The legislative powers of the Dominion cover the subject-matter of marriage and divorce minus that part of it carved out and assigned exclusively to the provinces. The judicial rule of construction of the two sections, 91 and 92, of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d that the Dominion Parliament in exercising its powers of legislation under any one of the enumerated powers of section 91 may do so to the extent of invading or interfering with the subject-matters assigned to the provincial legislatures, so far as is necessarily incidental to effective legislation on the part of Parliament within the enumerated subject being legislated on, is a rule of construction necessary to the practical working out of the division of legislative powers assigned to the Dominion Parliament on the one hand and the provincial legislatures on the other. Efficient legislation could not be had if such salutary rule was not adopted. But that rule has no application, in my opinion, to the unique case we now have before us where a special subject-matter is assigned to the Dominion Parliament and a portion of that subject-matter carved out and deducted from at and specially assigned to the provinces. If the rule was applied to such a case it would defeat the very object and purpose of the division as I construe its meaning.\nThe conclusions above expressed seem to have been those of the Crown law officers of England as found in the despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General dated the 15th January, 1870.\nThe questions submitted to them were whether the authority to grant marriage licenses was vested in the Governor-General of Canada and whether the power of legislating on the subject of marriage licenses was solely within the Parliament of Canada. That opinion is stated by the Secretary of State, as follows:\u2014\nIt appears to them that the power of legislating upon this subject is conferred on the provincial legislatures by 30 & 31 Vict. ch. 3, sec. 92 , under the words \u201cthe solemnization of marriage in the province\u201d; the phrase \u201cthe laws respecting the solemnization of marriages in England\u201d occurs in the preamble of the \u201cMarriage Act\u201d (4. Geo. IV. ch. 76)., an Act which is very largely concerned with matters relating to banns and licenses, and this is, therefore, a strong authority to shew that the same words used in the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d were intended to have the same meaning, \u201cMarriage and divorce,\u201d which by the 91st section of the same Act are reserved to the Parliament of the Dominion, signifying in their opinion all matters relating to the status of marriage between what persons and under what circumstances it shall be created and (if at all) destroyed. There are many reasons of convenience and sense why one law as to the status of marriage should exist throughout the Dominion which have no application as regards the uniformity of the procedure whereby that status is created or evidenced.\nConvenience, indeed, and reason would seem alike in favour of a difference of procedure being allowable in provinces differing so widely in external and internal circumstances as those of which the Dominion is composed and of permitting the provinces to settle their own procedure for themselves, and they are of opinion that this permission has been granted to the province by the Imperial Parliament and that the New Brunswick Legislature was competent to pass the bill in question.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the proposed bill, the constitutionality of which is submitted for our opinion is, upon the construction we put upon its language, beyond the authority of the Parliament of Canada to enact.\nI answer the first question in the negative.\nThe second question submitted to us, reads as follows:\u2014\n2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec, render null and void unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province,\n(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or (b) between persons one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic.\nIn view of the answer I have already given to the first question that the Dominion Parliament has not the power to pass the bill submitted to us as it is construed by me, and that the exclusive power to legislate on its subject-matter is by our constitutional Act assigned to the provinces, I proceed to examine the law of the Province of Quebec and I am of opinion that the answer to both parts of the second question above set out must be in the negative.\nThe answer depends entirely upon the construction of the legislation of the Province of Quebec as embodied in the Civil Code and its amendments. That Code was enacted by the late Province of Canada and became law before our constitutional Act was passed in 1867. The legislature of the late Province of Canada had jurisdiction over the whole subject-matter of marriage. There was no divided jurisdiction as there is now between the Dominion and the provinces. The Code, therefore, contains many provisions upon the subject-matter of marriage, such as title 5, chapter 1, of Marriage, defining \u201cthe qualities and conditions necessary for contracting marriage,\u201d and chapter 2 \u201cof the formalities relating to the solemnization of marriage,\u201d and chapter 3 \u201cof oppositions to marriage.\u201d It is necessary to bear this in mind when putting a construction upon the articles of these several chapters of the Code.\nI am of the opinion that Mr. Lafleur\u2019s contention is sound, namely, that the question now being discussed can be decided by reference to the Code itself without reference to the historical aspect of the question or the state of the law antecedent to the passing of the Code and must be so decided without reference to previous legislation on the subject if the language of the articles which control and govern the answer to be given the question are intelligible and unambiguous.\nI think the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[82] ample authority for that latter proposition. In delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Watson says, at page 487:\u2014\nIn the course of the argument, counsel for the parties brought somewhat fully under their Lordships\u2019 notice the law of reparation applicable to cases like the present, as it existed prior to the enactment of the Code; and they discussed the question whether, and if so, how far, chapter 78 of the statute of 1859 altered or superseded the rules of the old French law. These may be interesting topics, but they are foreign to the present case, if the provisions of sect. 1056 apply to it, and are in themselves intelligible and free from ambiguity. The language used by Lord Herschell, in Bank, of England v. Vagliano Brothers[83], with reference to the \u201cBills of Exchange Act, 1882,\u201d (45 & 46 Vict. ch. 61), has equal application to the Code of Lower Canada: \u201cThe purpose of such a statute surely was that on any point specifically dealt with by it, the law should be ascertained by interpreting the language used instead of, as before, by roaming over a vast number of authorities.\u201d Their Lordships do not doubt that as the noble and learned Lord in the same case indicates, resort must be had to the pre-existing law in all instances where the Code contains provisions of doubtful import, or uses language which had previously acquired a technical meaning. But an appeal to earlier law and decisions for the purpose of interpreting a statutory Code can only be justified upon some such special grounds.\nBut apart from judicial authority, I agree that article 2613 of the Civil Code is conclusive upon the point, as express provision is therein made upon the subject-matter of the question.\nWhile I contend that the Code itself until altered either by Parliament or the Legislature\u2019 of Quebec under their respective powers is the sole arbiter of the law on the subject-matter of marriage and its solemnization irrespective of what that law was previous to it being enacted, still the subject of the antecedent law was so largely discussed at bar and the whole subject is so important that I may be pardoned if I shortly refer to this antecedent law and its gradual development.\nBefore and up to the time of the conquest the Roman Catholic religion was the only one tolerated in Quebec, and the priests of that church were the only ones who could solemnize marriage there.\nIn England, on the contrary, the Anglican Church was at the time of the conquest the only one tolerated. Its ministers and priests were the only ones who could solemnize marriage in England, and Roman Catholics were subjected to severe penalties.\nAnything, therefore, in the law of Quebec at the time of the conquest which required any person not a Roman Catholic to be married before a priest of that religion or prevented any person of that religion who so desired from being married before a priest or clergyman of the Anglican Church, was so far opposed to the will of the Government of the conquering power as it had been previously expressed upon the subject, that it must be taken to have been abrogated by the conquest.\nThe capitulations of 1759 and 1760, and the provisions of the Treaty of Paris, 1763, conceded to the Roman Catholic inhabitants of Quebec the \u201cfree exercise of their religion as far as the laws of Great Britain permitted.\u201d\nIn 1774, eleven years after the Treaty of Paris, the Quebec Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament and it declared, section 5, that \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s subjects of the said province (Quebec) professing the religion of the Church of Rome of and in the new Province of Quebec may have, hold and enjoy the free exercise of the religion of the Church of Rome, subject to the King\u2019s supremacy.\u201d\nI do not doubt that under these concessions,\u2019 treaty rights and statutory provisions, the priests of the Church of Rome could legally solemnize marriages between the Roman Catholic inhabitants of Quebec, but their exclusive power to do so was gone. The privileges and concessions made to the Roman Catholic subjects of the King as to the free exercise of their religion was what it expressed to be, a concession, a privilege, a right, granted to the people, not to the church. They involved necessarily, it seems to me, the right, amongst other things, to have the marriages of Roman Catholics solemnized by the priests of their own church, but they neither recognized nor in any way sanctioned any exclusive right which would be repugnant to the laws of the conquering nation and they were in the treaty and in the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d made expressly \u201csubject to the King\u2019s supremacy.\u201d\nThere cannot be any doubt either in my mind that the clergy of the Anglican Church, the established church of England, and which, it seems to me, became the established church of Quebec, retained also their power to solemnize marriage in Quebec. That power was not exclusive either. It was concurrent with the privilege involved in the grant to the Roman Catholic inhabitants of the conquered country to have their marriages solemnized by priests of their own church.\nBeyond that, it does not seem to me there was any limitation upon the exclusive right which they, as the priests and clergy of the established church of England, possessed and brought with them to Canada after the conquest.\nThen followed the statute of Lower Canada, 35 Geo. III., ch. 4 (1795), enacting amongst other things, that\nin each parish church of the Roman Catholic communion, and also in each of the Protestant churches or congregations within this province, there shall be kept by the rector, curate, vicar or other priest or minister doing the parochial or clerical duty thereof, two registers of the same tenor, each of which shall be reputed authentic, and shall be equally considered as legal evidence in all courts of justice, in each of which the said rector, curate, vicar or other priest or minister doing the parochial or clerical duty of such parish or such Protestant church or congregation, shall be held to enregister regularly and successively all baptisms, marriages, and burials so soon as the same shall have been by them performed.\nThe judicial construction placed upon this Act was that it extended to priests or ministers of the Anglican Church only, and did not include what were then called Protestant dissenting churches or their clergymen.\nAlthough the statute did not expressly confer the power to marry upon the clergy required to keep the registers of baptisms, marriages and burials, it assumed the existence of such powers and was a statutory recognition of them. And here I may remark that at no time subsequently was express power to solemnize marriage given by statute to the priests and clergy of the Anglican church until 1861, or to the priests of the Roman Catholic Church, until the Code was passed in 1866.\nIn the meantime, however, Scotch and other immigrants had come to Quebec, accompanied by the clergy or ministers of their own churches. These solemnized marriages amongst their own people, and in 1804 the Legislature passed an Act confirming these marriages and adjudged them \u201cto be good and valid\u201d except in cases where the parties were incompetent to contract marriage with each other, without, however, conferring upon these clergy any powers to marry in the future.\nIn 1821, another similar confirmatory Act was passed, 1 Geo, IV. ch. 19, while in 1827 the Act of 7 Geo. IV. ch. 2, was passed, which inter alia enacted\nthat all marriages which have heretofore been or shall hereafter be celebrated by ministers or clergymen of, or in communion with, the Church of Scotland, have been and shall be held to be legal and valid to all intents and purposes whatsoever, anything in the said Acts or in any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThis Act not only confirmed past marriages, but also validated\nall marriages which should thereafter be celebrated by ministers or clergymen of or in communion with the Church of Scotland.\nThere was no limitation at all with respect to the place where the marriage should be solemnized or the persons between whom these ministers should solemnize marriage, no suggestion or language from which it could be implied that the religious beliefs of both or either of the contracting parties had anything to do with the validity of the marriages solemnized. The statute I am citing would, of course, be construed as embracing only marriages the parties to which could legally intermarry with each other.\nThen followed a series of Acts conferring on the ministers of different Protestant denominations being previously licensed thereto by the governing power and authority \u201cto have and keep registers of baptisms, marriages and burials according to the laws of the province.\u201d\nThe language of these statutes differed somewhat. Some of them conferred the power upon \u201cregularly ordained\u201d clergymen of a denomination having a permanent and fixed congregation. The power was conferred in the case of the Wesleyan Methodists\nupon the Wesleyan preachers or ministers in connection with the society in Great Britain known as the Conference of the people called Methodists being previously licensed thereto by the Governor, etc.\nNothing was said about these preachers or ministers being regularly ordained or having either permanent or fixed congregations.\nA great many of these statutes, were passed; none of them conferred express power to marry, though it seems to have been universally accepted that the power was of necessity impliedly given. Some gave simply the power to keep registers of such baptisms, marriages and burials as might be performed or take place under the ministry of such minister, etc.\nWith the exception, however, of the Quakers, there was no limitation confining the marriages these clergymen celebrated to their own denomination. In the case of the Quakers, there was the limitation that one of the contracting parties should belong to that body. In the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860, ch. 20, the general Act is found, and this is a most important Act.\nThe first section reads as follows:\u2014\n1. In order by the keeping of uniform and authentic registers of the baptisms, marriages and burials in Lower Canada, to secure the peace of families, and to ascertain various civil rights of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects therein.: In each parish church of the Roman Catholic communion, and also in each of the Protestant churches or congregations within Lower Canada to which this Act extends, there shall he kept by the priest or minister doing the parochial or clerical duty thereof, two registers of the same tenor, each of which shall be reputed authentic, and shall be legal evidence in all courts of justice,\u2014in each of which the said priest or minister of such parish or church or congregation shall enregister regularly and successively all baptisms, marriages and burials, so soon as the same have been by him performed.\nThe sixth section is also important:\u2014\n6. In the entries of a marriage in the registers aforesaid, mention shall be made in words, of the day, month and year, on which the marriage was celebrated, with the names, quality or occupation and place of abode of the contracting parties, whether they are of age or minors, and whether married after, publication of banns or by dispensation or license, and whether with the consent of their fathers, mothers, tutors or curators\u2014if any they have in the country\u2014also the names of two or more persons present at the marriage, and who, if relations of the husband and wife or either of them, shall declare on what side and in what degree they are related\u2019:\n(2) Such entries shall be signed in both registers by the person celebrating the marriage, by the contracting parties, and by the said two persons, at least, \u2014 and if any of them cannot sign his or her name, mention should be made thereof in the said entries. 35 Geo. III. ch. 4, sec. 4.\nIt will be noticed while many facts have to be set out in the register nothing whatever is said requiring the mention of the religious faith or connections of either of the contracting parties between whom the marriage was to be solemnized and if the limitations sought to be read into the powers conferred, upon these clergymen were intended, surely they would have been required to state the facts on which their very jurisdiction to marry depended.\nThen comes the 16th section declaring that\nall regularly ordained priests and ministers of either of the said churches (the Church of England and Ireland and the Church of Scotland) have had and shall have authority validly to solemnize marriage in Lower Canada.\nCould language be broader or stronger? By what authority could any court read any limitation into the power so declared to exist in the clergy of the Anglican and Scottish churches beyond the necessary one that the contracting parties were persons who could lawfully intermarry?\nThen comes section 17:\u2014\n17. This Act extends also to the several religious communities and denominations in Lower Canada, mentioned in this section, and to the priests or ministers thereof, who may validly solemnize marriage, and may obtain and keep registers under this Act, subject to the provisions of the Acts mentioned with reference to each of them respectively, and to all the requirements, penalties, and provisions of this Act, as if the said communities and denominations were named in the first section of this Act.\nThen follow the names of the different religious communities and denominations, twenty-one in number.\nThe powers given to the clergymen of these several denominations are given subject to \u201cthe provisions of the Act mentioned with reference to each of them respectively, and if it is sought to impose any limitation upon these powers, these \u201cspecial Acts must be appealed to and the limitation shewn.\nI have already quoted one, the Wesleyan Methodist, and have examined all the others and I fail to find any except that relating to the Quakers and possibly the Jews, which justifies the argument that the power to marry conferred on the several clergy of the different churches named was limited either with respect to the place where the marriage was solemnized or to the religious faith or affiliations or connections of the contracting parties.\nThis law continued until the Code was passed and I again repeat that unless clear and distinct language can be shewn in the Code limiting and reducing the powers which those clergy at the time of its enactment possessed under the statutes I have cited, no count can properly read such limitations and restrictions into the Code.\nAccording to my construction of its language, article 129 C.C., confers powers, as large as those which existed in the Act of 1861.\nThe clergy of the Anglican Church certainly did not derive their power to marry from the Act of 1861, though, as a matter of precaution, that Act expressly professed to give and declare the power.\nI ask again, as I asked during the argument, where can, you find any statute or law from the time of the conquest down to the passing of the Code, which in any way limited the power of the Anglican clergy to marry after licenses or publication of banns any two persons competent to intermarry on the ground of their religious faith or affiliations? If no statute impairing that power can be found then I venture to say it must be maintained unquestioned.\nThe same question may be put with respect to the clergy of or in communion with the Church of Scotland after the passage of the Act of 1827 conferring upon them express power to marry. And it may also be put with respect to the clergy of the other Protestant denominations expressly mentioned in the Act of 1861 and in all these cases must receive the same answer that there exists no such statute or law.\nNow what are the articles of the Code which control and govern the question we are discussing. They are, in my judgment, articles 128 and 129, and read as follows:\u2014\n128. Marriage must be solemnized openly, by a competent officer recognized by law.\n129. All priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, are competent to solemnize marriage. But none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion, and the discipline of the church to which he belongs.\nThere are other articles which have been invoked by counsel on both sides which are important to be considered, namely, articles 57 to 65, article 127 and articles 136 and following relating to \u201coppositions to marriage.\u201d But, as I have said, the two articles 128 and 129 are the controlling ones, and if they are, as I think they are, clear, intelligible and unambiguous, they are, in my opinion, conclusive of the question asked. They provide that a marriage must be solemnized openly, and by a competent officer, and that all priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status are such competent officers. There is no restriction upon their powers as to the persons whom they may marry beyond the one necessarily implied that such persons must be competent to contract matrimony with each other, nor is there any restriction upon the place where the marriage may be solemnized, nor as to the religious views, affiliations or church connection of either or both of the parties.\nBut article 129 expressly enacts that none of these officers can be \u201ccompelled\u201d to solemnize marriage to which any impediment existed according to the doctrine and belief and discipline of the church to which he belonged.\nThe classes declared to be competent officers to solemnize marriage, embrace, it is conceded, priests and rectors of the Roman and Anglican churches, as well as clergymen of the different Protestant denominations who were, or might be, authorized to register acts of civil status.\nThe question raised is whether any and what limitations can be read into this 129th article, respecting the powers conferred on these rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status.\nMy desire is not to go beyond the question submitted for our opinion. It assumes the competency of the contracting parties to marry each other and invites an opinion simply as to the competency or power of a non-Roman Catholic priest or clergyman to marry or solemnize marriage in the Province of Quebec between two Roman Catholics, or between two persons one of whom is a Roman Catholic.\nIn my opinion the law does not render either one or other of such marriages so solemnized either illegal or null and void.\nThe first observation one would naturally make in reading article 129 is that on its face at any rate there is no limitation or restriction upon the competency of the officers who are authorized to solemnize marriage. Its language is as broad and general as it possibly could be, \u201call priests, etc., authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status are competent to solemnize marriage.\u201d\nTheir authority is general and there is nothing which expressly or impliedly limits their power to marry those persons only who are their own parishioners or members or adherents of their own church or congregation. It extends, in a word, to all persons who, being competent to intermarry, obtain a license authorizing the priest or clergyman to marry them. The second part of the article is for the ease of the conscience of the priest or clergyman and provides that he cannot be compelled to solemnize a marriage as to which any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion and the discipline of the church to which he belongs.\nThis conscience clause, as I may call it, is a reasonable, fair and necessary one in view of the unrestricted breadth of the officer\u2019s power to marry. No one would think it right to place a priest or clergyman in a position to be compelled to celebrate a marriage which the doctrine, belief and discipline of his church forbade him to celebrate.\nThe insertion of such a conscience clause in the article is, therefore, in view of the unrestricted power conferred by the first part of the article upon the priest or clergyman a reasonable and proper protection for him. It confirms the view that persons competent to celebrate marriages may receive applications to be married from people of different faiths or religions, and if not prevented from doing so from conscientious reasons arising out of the rules, doctrine, or discipline of their church, such priest or clergyman may, under license, legally marry the persons so applying.\nIt also confirms the view that such officers or clergymen were not restricted in their powers to their own congregations or their own parishioners.\nIf their functions were restricted to the members of their own churches or to their own congregations, and if article 127 makes the rules of those churches or congregations binding upon their members, there would be no use in this conscience clause at all, because the clergyman manifestly could not be compelled to celebrate a marriage between two members of his own congregation or church the rules and discipline of which prohibited such marriage or created an impediment to its solemnization. If, on the contrary, his power to celebrate as to persons competent to marry each other by law is unrestricted, the clause was a reasonable and necessary one.\nMr. Mignault, however, contended that several limitations had to be read into the clause to make it compatible and consistent with other articles of the Code, and first he contended that not everyone who can keep registers of civil status is competent to celebrate marriage, because those who register under article 70 and following religious vows or professions, are not so competent, but the answer is clear that those and those only who are authorized to keep registers of acts of civil status generally can celebrate marriage and not persons authorized merely to keep registers of limited acts such as those of religious professions.\nThen, as to the necessity of the marriage being solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties, it is sufficient to say that article 63 which begins with this general enacting declaration goes on to make provision that if solemnized elsewhere the person officiating must verify and ascertain the identity of the parties, plainly shewing that the rule was not obligatory or applicable to all cases and that if not observed the only effect would be to throw upon the person officiating the duty of verifying the identity of the parties.\nMr. Mignault took what from his standpoint was the only logical position possible with respect to the powers of solemnizing marriages possessed by non-Roman Catholic clergymen. He contended that they only had the power to marry those who were \u201cmembers of the church\u201d over which they respectively had spiritual control. Mere adherents of that church, or those who worshipped there regularly or irregularly would, therefore, if not \u201cmembers of the church\u201d be excluded from those powers. And by his contention, not only one, but both the contracting parties must be members of that church. The consequence would be that apart possibly from the Anglican Church no Protestant clergyman could marry two persons unless they were both members of the same church as that of the clergyman. If this extreme pretension prevailed, and each Protestant clergyman outside of the Anglican Church could marry only those who were \u201cmembers\u201d of his Own particular church or denomination, the consequence, in view of the practice which has hitherto universally prevailed, would be somewhat appalling. Even if the limitation of the powers of the clergyman was extended beyond the \u201cmembers\u201d of his church so as to include those who were adherents and attendants regular or casual of it, the results would be startling indeed. No Baptist or Methodist or Presbyterian or Congregationalist could be legally married except to either a member or an ad-herent of his or her own denomination, and only members of the same denomination could be legally married who were domiciled or lived in the same place and were either members or adherents of that church. Not only, therefore, would this limitation prevent intermarriage between persons belonging to different denominations, but it would limit intermarriage between persons belonging to the same denomination to those who resided in the same place and were within the special limited jurisdiction of the officiating clergyman. Now, as the clergyman of those different denominations have no \u201cparishes\u201d or other specially limited territorial areas to which their spiritual jurisdiction is confined, it is apparent that the suggested limitation can have no foundation. It is one utterly inapplicable to these Protestant de-nominations and its attempted application to them would be absurd and deplorable in its results.\nMany hundreds of marriages must have taken place since the passage of the Civil Code in 1866 between persons who belonged to different denominations of Protestants or between members of the same denomination who lived in different parts of the province, and every one of them would be invalid. The only good marriages would be those solemnized by a clergyman between two persons both of whom were members of his own congregation and church and were resident in the same locality. Such a result need only to be stated to be repudiated as based upon a totally erroneous construction of article 129 and as imputing to the legislature an intention almost inconceivable. In addition to what I have said the limited construction put upon the article 129 by Mr. Mignault would leave a large portion of the non-Roman Catholic population of Quebec without any means of being legally married at all. Thousands of immigrants are coming yearly to Quebec. Many of them are not Roman Catholics. Some belong to the Greek Church; some do not belong to any Christian church. If the construction of article 129, which Mr. Mignault is driven logically to contend for, is maintained, none of these people could be married in Quebec at all.\nAnd yet there does not seem to be any halting place between that construction of the article contended for by Mr. Mignault, and the broad construction which I submit is the correct one, and which gives unrestricted power to every priest, rector, minister and other officer authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, to solemnize marriage under license between any two contracting parties not prohibited by law from intermarrying and irrespective of their religious beliefs or connections, or their residences or domiciles. Such marriages need not necessarily be solemnized in a church or chapel of the officiating clergyman. They may be solemnized (as outside of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches is generally the case) at a private residence or other place and this from the absence of any requirement to the contrary. Those of the Protestant churches, outside of the Anglican, have, as I have said, no defined \u201cparishes\u201d or areas within which alone their jurisdiction extends. The members and adherents and persons who attend their religious services and form part of their congregations do not necessarily come from any particular defined locality. They may reside in any part of a city or in its adjacent suburbs. Locality, therefore, as determining the jurisdiction of the clergyman to marry, must be eliminated, and either the broad construction of article 129, which in determining the power and jurisdiction of the clergyman to marry, disregards alike the domicile and the religious opinions or connections of the parties, or the narrower one which confines such jurisdiction, to the members of the church of the officiating clergyman, must be adopted. As a matter of fact, I understand that all these marriages by Protestant clergymen outside the Anglican Church and a large number of those within that church also are solemnized under license and not after publication of banns. The only security which the law provides in such marriages, against the existence of legal impediments, lies in the bonds which the applicants for the license are obliged to give before obtaining it.\nObjections were raised that this broad construction, placed upon article 129, precluded the invocation or application of many of the articles of the Code providing for \u201coppositions to marriage.\u201d These articles, it was argued, would be without any effect if such a construction prevailed and their object to prevent clandestinity defeated. The short, and to my mind, complete answer to such objections is, first, that they apply equally forcibly to marriages solemnized by Roman Catholic priests under dispensation from the publication of banns by the bishop, and, secondly, that these articles were never intended to apply to marriages solemnized under license.\nTheir proper application and the only application which, it seems to me, gives them any efficacy and usefulness is with respect to marriages solemnized after publication of banns in the churches where parishes or other territorial boundaries limiting the clergyman\u2019s jurisdiction exists. Proper legal effect can be given to them and the object they were enacted to carry out, if they are held as applicable only to marriages so solemnized.\nIt was conceded at the argument, as I understand, that there never had been and was not now any doubt as to the validity of a marriage under license by a non-Roman Catholic clergyman, of two competent contracting persons, one of whom only was a Roman Catholic. But if that is so, if such marriages are legal and valid, then the entire force of Mr. Mignault\u2019s argument respecting the limited effect to be given to article 129, is destroyed. I am unable to appreciate the force of much of the reasoning against the validity of such marriages where both persons are Roman Catholics. I repeat again, I fail to find any logical resting place between the broad proposition that article 129 authorizes the solemnization of marriages by any of the persons mentioned in the article, between any two persons competent by law to intermarry irrespective altogether of the religious belief or affiliations or connections of either or both, and the one contended for by Mr. Mignault that the contracting parties must both be members of the church of the officiating clergyman and residents within his spiritual jurisdiction. If the non-Roman Catholic clergyman qualified to solemnize marriage under article 129, can legally do so between two persons, one of whom is a Roman Catholic, why can he not do so in the case where both parties are Roman Catholics?\nThe language of the article does not, in my opinion, permit of the drawing of any such distinction. It would seem to me that either the argument must prevail as to the absence of any limitations upon the power of the clergyman authorized to solemnize marriage beyond the competence of the contracting parties to intermarry, or the contrary one that non-Roman Catholic clergymen can only legally solemnize marriage between two members of the church or congregation of such officiating clergyman. If the latter limitation must be read into article 129, then what becomes of the concession that marriages solemnized by or before a Protestant clergyman between two competent contracting parties, one being a Roman Catholic, are good?\nArticle 127 of the Code was invoked as rendering null and void a marriage of two Roman Catholics unless solemnized by a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. But this article, in my judgment, has reference only to impediments to marriage existing in the parties themselves (and has no reference to the competency of the officiating clergyman who solemnizes the marriage. From what I have already said, it will be apparent that in my judgment the competency of all priests and clergymen authorized by law to keep registers of Acts or civil status is unrestricted with respect to the marriage of all persons competent to intermarry irrespective of their religious faith. Once that conclusion is reached the answer to the question put to us is plain.\nArticle 127 must be construed, having regard to its place in the Civil Code and its context. We find the article in the chapter headed \u201cOf the Qualities and Conditions necessary for contracting Marriage.\u201d And amongst the disabilities in that chapter enumerated are, want of puberty, impotency, minority, affinity and relationship. All disabilities in the parties.\nThe articles in the chapter previous to article 127, deal with these disabilities. Then article 127 says:\u2014\n127. The other impediments recognized according to the different religious persuasions, as resulting from relationship or affinity or from other causes, remain subject to the rules hitherto followed in the different churches and religious communities.\nThese words, \u201cor from other causes,\u201d must be confined to those within the purview and scope of that chapter, they must be qualities and conditions existing in the parties themselves and not in the clergyman who may marry them. That whole chapter deals with the competency of the parties contemplating matrimony and section 127 must be confined to disabilities of that class. The competency of the officer solemnizing the marriage is dealt with and defined in the succeeding chapter headed, \u201cOf the Formalities Relating to the Solemnization of Marriage.\u201d If you construe article 127 as extending in any way to the formalities relating to the solemnization of the marriage, you introduce hopeless confusion. The chapter in which article 127 is found deals with one subject-matter, namely, disabilities in the parties themselves, which now belongs exclusively to the Dominion Parliament to deal with. That in which article 129 is found deals with the subject-matter of the solemnization of marriage, with which the provincial legislature is now alone competent to deal.\nI would construe the words \u201cother causes\u201d following relationship or affinity not as ejusdem generis with these two disabilities simply, but with all the disabilities of the parties mentioned in the chapter and not as extending to any rules, regulations or decrees of any church relating to the place where the marriage should be solemnized or the particular priest or clergyman before whom it should be solemnized. But whatever they may cover beyond the disabilities expressly mentioned in the chapter, they cannot extend to the competency of the officiating clergyman who solemnizes the marriage. That is dealt with exclusively in the next chapter.\nTo put the construction upon article 127 contended for by Mr. Mignault, would not only do violence to the express language of article 129, but would, in my opinion, radically alter and change the law which up to the passing of the Code existed in Quebec as to the competency of at least Anglican and Church of Scotland clergymen to marry any two competent persons, irrespective of their religious affiliation or connections. To make such a radical change would require the use of clear and definite language which I do not find in the article invoked.\nThere is no half-way house or halting place between the two contentions. I adopt the broad construction of the article because I think it is a fair and reasonable construction of its language; and that such a construction has been practically adopted and followed ever since the Code was enacted.\nIf it is held that the language of the article is doubtful and ambiguous and we are driven to ascertain its meaning by reference to the state of the law antecedent to the Code, then as I have attempted to shew there can be no reasonable doubt on that point, and the broad construction of the article ignoring the religious faiths or affiliations of the contracting parties to the marriage must be adopted.\nI, therefore, would answer both questions (a) and (b) in the negative, holding that the law of the Province of Quebec does not render null and void, unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding which takes place in such province,\n(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or\n(b) between persons, one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic.\nThird question:\u2014\nAs I have answered both parts of this second question in the negative my answer to the third question is, perhaps, unnecessary, but to avoid misunderstanding I answer it in the negative.\nIdington J.\u2014The questions submitted raise many grave issues. But the conclusions I have reached are such that, though I purpose answering each question, it seems to me my expositions of reason relative thereto will be better understood by my first disposing of sub-section (a) of the second question.\nThat question is as follows:\u2014\n2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province,\n(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or,\n(b) between persons, one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic.\nAs I understand the contention set up, all who have been either in infancy or in later life baptized according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church, fall within the definition in the question.\nMen may, and women may, not find themselves honestly able to conform to the faith of those who procured their infant baptism, and yet be averse to and honestly unable to conform to the creed of another church. If the claim made be well founded they cannot intermarry; and neither man nor woman so situated can marry one who has conformed to the original faith of their baptism; yet it is suggested he or she so unable to conform may lawfully marry a pagan. Though the language of the Code seems clear, and I accept the construction thereof contended for by Mr. Lafleur, I think it due to the argument, entirely founded on the law of France at the time of the conquest, put forward by Mr. Mignault, and to the need of clearing away, so far as I can, the misconceptions on which it appears to me to be founded, to deal briefly therewith.\nIn the articles of the Quebec capitulation, on the 18th September, 1759, the following concession appears:\u2014\nThe free exercise of the Roman religion is granted, likewise safeguards to all religious persons as well as to the Bishop, who shall be at liberty to come and exercise freely and with decency, the functions of his office, whenever he shall think proper and until the possession of Canada shall have been decided between their Britannic and Most Christian Majesties.\nIn the articles of the capitulation of Montreal, on the 8th September, 1760, appears the following:\u2014\nGranted as to the free exercise of their religion; the obligation of paying the tithes to the priests will depend on the King\u2019s pleasure.\nThese were followed by and merged in the Treaty of Paris, 10th February, 1763.\nArticle 4 ends thus:\u2014\nHis Britannic Majesty on his side agrees to grant the liberty of the Catholic religion to the inhabitants of Canada; he will consequently give the most precise and most effectual orders, that his new Roman Catholic subjects may profess the worship of their religion, according to the rites of the Romish Church, as far as the law of Great Britain permit.\nHow can there be found in such clear and express language anything except the liberty assured thereby to the inhabitants of Canada, whereby His Majesty\u2019s new Roman Catholic subjects \u201cmay profess the wor-ship of their religion?\u201d\nThe last part of the sentence is suggestive of restrictions conflicting with the pretensions set up for an extension of church power, not expressed.\nHow could it ever enter into the mind of any one that this language giving people individually a liberty to profess a religion, had in fact handed them over to another power or authority to prevent them from exercising the fullest liberty to depart from such profession of faith as and when and under such circumstances as they might, or any one or more of them might, desire and so far as they might desire?\nYet, in the last analysis the claim made is of a right in some one to deprive descendants of these people, or others coming, no matter whence, into Quebec, who have been baptized by the authority of the Roman Catholic Church here or abroad, of the liberty to intermarry unless in conformity with the rites of that church. Surely that is a claim of dominion which savours not of liberty.\nMr. Mignault answers by an appeal to the general principle relative to the rights of the conquered, as is usually conceded, to enjoy until changed the old law of property and civil rights, and to the effect of the Quebec Act passed in 1774. I will first examine the general principle and such facts as we have to apply it and then return to the consideration of that Act.\nThe Master of the Rolls, Sir William Grant, in The Attorney-General v. Stewart[84], is reported as citing, apparently with approval, a passage from Blackstone, vol. 1, page 100. Lord Mansfield, in the ease of Campbell v. Hall[85], (Lofft\u2019s report being preferable, by reason of the arguments in the case given therein, to the report by Cowper), lays down the law broadly\nthat the laws of a conquered country continue in force until they are altered by the conqueror,\nand again:\u2014\nNeither has it hitherto been controverted that the King might change part or the whole of the law or political form of government of a conquered nation.\nIn 2 Peere Williams Reports, page 75 (A.D. 1722), is a note of an anonymous case wherein the Master of the Rolls said it was determined by the Lords of the Privy Council, upon an appeal to the King in Council, from the foreign plantations, amongst other things, as follows:\u2014\n2ndly. Where the King of England conquers a country, St is a different consideration; for there the conqueror, by saving the lives of the people conquered, gains a right and property in such people; in consequence of which he may impose upon them what laws he pleases. But,\n3rdly. Until such laws given by the conquering prince, the laws and customs of the conquered country shall hold place; unless where these are contrary to our religion, or enact anything that is malum in se or are silent; for in all such cases the laws of the conquering country shall prevail.\nThis last form of expression of the opinion of the time commends itself as the most compatible with reason on the subject now in hand. Lord Mansfield had not to deal specifically with the question of religion.\nThough in that tolerant spirit, which he had, he incidentally rebukes Coke\u2019s intolerance toward conquered infidels, he did not quarrel with the definitions I have quoted, which were before him.\nAs regards religion, the law of the conquered country here in question was not silent, but, as I conceive it, absolutely repugnant to the rights of the conquerors or those they invited there.\nSurely, at least that part of the laws of a conquered nation which had been directly aimed at those professing the faith of the conquerors, could not be held to prevail, for an instant, over the conquering people.\nSuch incompatibility as existed between the respective laws of France and of England at the time in question, in relation to religion and marriage, rendered, I submit, the continuation of the law of the former, as applicable to any but those voluntarily conforming thereto, an impossibility in a free country. It was quite compatible with reason and a proper spirit of toleration to deal with the question as it was dealt with in the Treaty of Paris. The doing so could not imply that the disabling and penal laws of France bearing upon Protestants or others not professing the Roman Catholic religion must continue to operate in Quebec or only be held partially abrogated.\nThe remarkable development of eighteenth century freedom of thought in both countries might indicate an indifference.\nUnfortunately, whatever spirit of toleration was then in fact abroad the laws of each of these countries at that time were essentially repugnant to each other\u2019s state religion and despite the influence of learning, literature and philosophy, such laws were maintained. From this condition of things, how can we infer the recognition of the marriage laws of France as being predominant?\nThe acts of the conqueror emphasize the contrary thereof. The Royal Proclamation of October 7th, 1763, foreshadowed\na council and assembly of representatives of the people to make laws * * * * for the peace, welfare and good government, as near as may be agreeable to the laws of England * * * * and in the meantime, and until such assemblies can be called as aforesaid, all persons inhabiting in or resorting to our said colonies may confide in our Royal protection for the enjoyment of the benefit of the laws of our realm of England.\nIn the joint appendix submitted to us, the late Sir John Macdonald in his opinion relative to the power to issue marriage licenses, sets forth the following facts:\u2014\nExpress power to issue marriage licenses seems to have been given in every commission of every Governor-General of Canada, or in the instructions accompanying such commission.\nIn the instructions addressed to the Hon. James Murray, as Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Province of Quebec, dated 7th December, 1763 (the first Governor after the conquest), it is provided in the 37th paragraph, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cAnd to the end that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Lord Bishop of London may take place in our province, under your Government, as far as conveniently may be, we do think fit that you do give all countenance and encouragement to my exercise of the same, excepting only the collating to benefices, granting licenses for marriage and probate of wills, which we have reserved to our Governor and our Commander-in-Chief of our said province for the time being.\u201d\nAll subsequent commissions or instructions seem to contain the same power.\nIf these acts of His Majesty with whom, on the high authority I have referred to, rested the power to modify the law, do not under the circumstances I have adverted to demonstrate sufficiently that the law of France in regard to marriage was thereby displaced, save what the treaty bound him to observe, I am at a loss to know what would.\nWe cannot forget in this regard the \u201cRoyal Supremacy Act,\u201d which, if anything were needed, would supply the kingly authority and impliedly create a duty which presumably was observed.\nThe French law, so far as capacity for marriage or provision for its celebration is concerned, had thus been abrogated save so far as the liberty assured by the treaty to those professing the Roman Catholic faith.\nThe \u201cQuebec Act\u201d of 1774 set aside as of and from the 1st of May, 1775, the Royal Proclamation, the commission and ordinances made thereunder, as inapplicable under the circumstances, but by its terms \u201cfor the time being\u201d clearly implied them as valid until said last date.\nThen the following sections of said Act define the religious situation thereafter:\u2014\n5. And for the more perfect security and ease of the minds of the inhabitants of the said province, it is hereby declared that His Majesty\u2019s subjects professing the religion of the Church of Rome of and in the said Province of Quebec, may have, hold, and enjoy the free exercise of the religion of the Church of Rome, subject to the King\u2019s supremacy, declared and established by an Act made in the first year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, over all the dominions and countries which then did, or thereafter should, belong to the Imperial Crown of this realm; and that the clergy of the said church may hold, receive and enjoy their accustomed dues and rights with respect to such persons only as shall profess the said religion.\n6. Provided, nevertheless, that it shall be lawful for His Majesty, his heirs or successors, to make such provision out of the rest of the said accustomed dues and rights, for the encouragement of the Protestant religion, and for the maintenance and support of a Protestant clergy within the said province, as he or they shall from time to time think necessary or expedient.\nSection 8 enacted that all His Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects, the religious orders and communities only excepted, might\nalso hold and enjoy their property and possessions, together with all customs and usages relative thereto, and all others their civil rights in as large and ample a manner as if said proclamation * * had not been made, and as may consist with their allegiance to His Majesty * * * and that in all matters, of controversy relative to property and civil rights, resort should be had to the laws of Canada as the rule for the decision of the same * * * until varied.\nOrdinances touching religion, etc., were not to be in force without His Majesty\u2019s approbation, and nothing in the said Act was to prevent His Majesty and his successors from constituting, courts of criminal, civil or ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\nThe \u201ccustoms and usages\u201d preserved to the people in section eight are relative only to their property.\nThe Royal supremacy is reserved and the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church are confirmed in their accustomed dues and rights \u201cwith respect to such persons only as shall profess the said religion.\u201d\nThe Protestant religion is to be encouraged and the maintenance of a Protestant clergy is provided for.\nI fail to understand how, in face of all this, there could ever have been anything implied that would restrict the personal liberty of any one either baptized by the rites of the Roman Catholic religion or even professing same, from being married by any legally constituted authority.\nIn the treaty it was liberty for those \u201cprofessing the worship of their religion\u201d that was agreed to.\nIn sweeping aside the proclamation, etc., it is also clearly expressed that \u201csubjects professing the religion of the Church of Rome\u201d may enjoy the free exercise of their religion. Nobody concerned themselves with those who had merely been baptized and later chose to resort elsewhere for marriage. How can such people be said to be professing the religion of the Church of Rome? How can they be heard to set up such a pretension to invalidate their own deliberate act?\nThe statement above as to the instructions given the Government of Canada relative to marriage licenses shews that the rights at least of the clergy of the Church of England, authorized by the Crown in regard to marriages, never were suspended; and the facts shew were continuously asserted.\nIndeed, may it not be said that a legal duty rested upon them to officiate as witnesses and otherwise so far as necessary to render a proposed marriage valid for those asking it, no matter of what faith?\nIn Davis v. Black[86], Denman C.J. assumes such full right and duty.\nThe statute of 32 Henry VIII. ch. 38, sec. 2, cited therein says in parenthesis, after referring to marriages of lawful persons (\u201cas by this Act we declare all persons to be lawful that be not prohibited by God\u2019s law to marry\u201d).\nThis Act, though repealed as to pre-contracts, is said by some one to stand so far as its declarations relate to other matters.\nOthers than the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, impliedly authorized by the terms of the treaty, and of the Church of England, authorized by what I have referred to, might require express authority to solemnize marriages, and such authority was given from time to time in a great many instances.\nIn 1795, an Act, 35 Geo. III. ch. 4 (L.C.), was passed imposing upon the clergy the duty of keeping registers of baptisms, marriages and burials. This applied equally to the Roman Catholic priest in charge of a parish and to the Protestant clergy doing the parochial or clerical duty of or for a parish or Protestant church or congregation, and revoked an ordinance of April, 1667, of the French King, and a declaration of the 9th April, 1736, of another French King, so far as relates to the registers there in question only.\nA uniform system of such registrations and the enforcement thereof upon the clergy in question, thus constituted them all public officers, and, if it was not done before, thereby cut the connection in that regard, between the old law and the Roman Catholic clergy.\nIt casts no doubt on the right or duty of the Anglican clergy to perform marriage, but rather recognizes it.\nFrom this time till the consolidation of the Lower Canada statutes, in 1860, there were a number of Acts. varying in form enabling various Protestant and other churches, or those in charge, to keep the like registers.\nIn relation to some of those as well as justices of the peace who had performed marriages there were confirmatory Acts passed.\nThen, later, as to the Church of Scotland ministers, an Act for removing doubts, 7 Geo. IV. ch. 2 (L.C.), was passed. It not only was confirmatory of past ceremonies, but empowered as to the future as follows:\u2014\nThat all marriages which have heretofore been or shall hereafter be celebrated by ministers or clergymen of, or in communion with the Church of Scotland, have been and shall be held to be legal and valid to all intents and purposes whatsoever, anything in the said Acts or in any other Act to the contrary notwithstanding.\nAnother church, later, gets an Act enabling its minister or his successor to obtain and keep registers which when kept\nshall have the same effect as if it had been kept by any minister in this province of the Established Church of England or Scotland.\nAs to the Church of England, its clergy were not, since long before the conquest of Quebec, by law restricted from marrying any persons of any creed otherwise eligible to be married. The \u201cLord Hard-wicke Act\u201d never extended beyond England and Wales except so far as introduced by local legislation. The parallel claimed between that Act and the Quebec Code and its relation to the Roman Catholic church there fails sadly. Under the former anyone but Jews or Quakers could get married, but under the latter none can, in that church, save those in actual communion with the church.\nAnd the Church of Scotland had by the Act just quoted such comprehensive powers conferred upon its ministers or clergymen that I cannot see any restriction therein or reason for implying any.\nAlthough some of the other enabling Acts are not in as express language as the latter, and the power to marry rests on the implication of the enactment enabling the ministers to keep registers, yet I see no restriction in the language used implying that they cannot register the rein marriages of Roman Catholics who choose to apply therefor.\nThe question submitted does not impose upon \u201cus the interpretation of all these Acts.\nIf any doubt existed before the consolidation of the statutes it seems, to have been thereby removed to a very large extent.\nAnd then article 129 of the Code is as follows:\u2014\n129. All priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, are competent to solemnize marriage. But none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion, and the discipline of the church to which he belongs.\nThe authority to keep registers is made the basis of action, yet the conscience of him applied to is properly spared from the discharge of a duty which the doctrine or belief of his religion or discipline of his church forbids. The language used dispels all doubt.\nI have carefully considered the many suggestions and arguments put forward to cut down this express language, which to my mind is as clear as it is enlightened, but I find no warrant for cutting it down.\nSo far from the historical argument helping to do so, it seems to effectually destroy any of the pretensions for reading into the Code what is not there.\nIt would be rather anomalous to find the Parliament of Old Canada sanction, either in the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada or the Code, amendments that would cut down the privileges that the liberality of Lower Canada had extended to the Anglican and Presbyterian churches and probably others.\nNor do I think article 127 furnishes ground for doubt.\nI may observe that Mr. Mignault\u2019s argument that the statutes enabling Protestant clergymen to marry are confined in their operation to marriages between those belonging to the same faith or form of religion as the clergymen so enabled and performing the marriage ceremony, must if well founded lead to remarkable and, I venture to think, undesirable results. If it is correct, then an Anglican cannot be married in Quebec to a Presbyterian woman or vice versa; and so on through the whole list of those other churches of which the ministers or clergy are enabled to perform the ceremony.\nThe language of those Acts does not, in my opinion save possibly in the case of the Jews and Quakers, warrant any such contention.\nIndeed, if correct, what authority would a Roman Catholic priest have to solemnize marriage between a Catholic and a Protestant? It is no answer to say that by the rules of the Roman Catholic Church a dispensation can be had from the church authorities permitting such marriage. The Code, which is the law for all, treats all alike and is the basis of action and limit of authority for each and all.\nThe Roman Catholic Church may forbid, its priests to solemnize marriage in such cases unless in the case of a proper dispensation. That is its right which no one can complain of, but when it so directs and grants a dispensation it does not thereby add to the statutory authority.\nCounsel did not argue against the possibility of the marriage of a Catholic and Protestant under the law of Quebec and the sub-question (b) of the second question was not argued.\nNot only does the Code fail to make any distinction between the powers given each of those authorized to keep registers save in the details leading up to the actual solemnization, but also the declaratory statute \u00f3f the 14 & 15 Vict. (1851), ch. 175 (Canada), was evidently designed to put an end to discrimination or preference.\nAs to these disturbing suggestions and their bearing on past marriages, I may refer to the case of Cattcrall, v. Sweetman[87]. Dr. Lushington held that as the Act there in question, being a New South Wales Act, much like many of the Acts of Quebec, did not expressly declare a marriage supposed to have taken place under the Act yet not attended with all the formalities prescribed in the Act, null or to be null by reason of such omissions, it could not be held null. See also Catterall v. Catterall[88].\nI have no hesitation in answering the second question in both its sub-divisions in the negative.\nBefore proceeding to dispose of the first and third questions which I propose treating together as the answers must in the main be founded on the same reasons, I desire to call attention to the nature of the bill submitted. Its brevity may be commendable, but thereby blending too many things in one sentence is very confusing. If a marriage ceremony, as it assumes, has been \u201cduly performed according to such laws\u201d as it refers to, does it need ratification? Again is the \u201cduly performed\u201d referred to in that phrase to be taken as relating only to the validity of the ceremony itself, notwithstanding the differences in religion, etc.? Or is it intended to cure any and every want of capacity in the parties? And is it intended to prevent any questions being raised anent any impediment that may have existed and which, according to the law of the place where the marriage took place, may have rendered the marriage null or voidable, although the ceremony itself may have been perfect so far as mere form is concerned?\nAgain the retrospective part of the bill might from some points of view be well maintained; yet the prospective feature of it be quite untenable, and vice vers\u00e2. The legislative validating of marriages which have been called in question for want of authority in the officer who had performed the ceremony or made the record thereof where ceremony was not required, or for the non-compliance with other details required by law in relation to marriage, has many precedents.\nWe have examples before us in the Joint Appendix filed herein containing the Acts of 44 Geo. III. (1804), ch. 2 (Lower Canada), and 1 Geo. IV. (1821), ch. 19 (Lower Canada). Each of these avoids some of the objectionable things in this bill.\nIf there are other existing marriages liable to be called in question for similar wants of form or by reason of any impediment, it may be that Parliament, having assigned to it the exclusive jurisdiction over the subject of marriage, has jurisdiction to declare such marriages good or to be held good. In that sense, part of the bill may be well founded.\nThere are, however, cogent reasons leading to the conclusion that in order to satisfactorily remedy such a state of things in Canada, concurrent legislation on the part of Parliament and of the local legislature would be the safer plan.\nWhen a question was raised of cutting down the old number necessary to constitute a grand jury, such a course was adopted and some corporations or corporate powers are founded on concurrent legislation.\nI may point out further that the bill as framed extends to foreign marriages as well as those which may be supposed to have taken place in Canada. Is it competent for Parliament or for it and a legislature combined thus to interfere? It has been pointed out that the enabling Acts dealing with Jews and Quakers respectively, seem confined to cases of parties of the same faith as the officiating officer performing the marriage ceremony. In such case, clearly the concluding part of the first clause of this bill would hardly be a proper exercise of the power of Parliament unless by way of concurrent legislation such as I have suggested.\nThe second clause of the bill deals with the rights and duties of the married parties and of their children, the issue of such marriages, in a very sweeping manner. For aught we know, many cases may exist where all the questions involved have been tried out in a competent court and adjudicated upon long ago.\nThe provincial legislature, it has been said, may take one man\u2019s property and give it to another, but Parliament cannot do this except in some way incidental to its execution of a power exclusively assigned to it.\nDoes not this second clause go too far?\nI cannot, therefore, answer this question by a simple yes or no; nor can I segregate as sub-section (6) suggests, the good from the bad. The bill, if passed as it stands, might operate in the North West Territories, of which nothing was said in argument.\nI can only answer by indicating what in my opinion are the limits of the power of Parliament in this regard and leave it for those concerned to decide if any part of this bill falls within same.\nThe important question raised in argument and by these questions is that of the relative powers given Parliament and the provincial legislatures respecting marriage, the former being assigned the exclusive legislative authority over \u201cmarriage and divorce\u201d and the latter over \u201cthe solemnization of marriage.\u201d\nIt seems to me that in order to appreciate clearly the relation of these powers, we must assume, for argument\u2019s sake, the Dominion to have exercised all its powers and enacted a Code relative to all the substantial questions involved in marriage, and divorce, and then ask ourselves what is in such case implied in the words \u201csolemnization of marriage.\u201d Can anything be done, in way of solemnization, after due compliance with everything required or possible to be required, when the former power has been exhausted, to add to the legal strength of the tie thereby formed or change the nature of the obligations thereby incurred or the consequences to flow therefrom?\nIf we found such apparently conflicting powers in any other instrument, how should be interpret them?\nAt once we should seek for the plain ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cthe solemnization of marriage.\u201d\nIf we turn to the Century Dictionary, we find marriage defined, 1st, \u201cthe legal union of a man with a woman for life,\u201d etc. 2ndly. \u201cThe formal declaration or contract by which act a man and a woman join in wedlock.\u201d 3rdly. \u201cThe celebration of a marriage, a wedding.\u201d And again, \u201ccivil marriage, a marriage ceremony conducted by officers of the state, as distinguished from one solemnized by a clergyman.\u201d\nIf we turn to Murray, we find, amongst others, this definition, \u201cEntrance into wedlock; the action or an act of marrying; the ceremony or procedure by which two persons\u201d are made husband and wife.\u201d And if we turn to the \u201cCentury\u201d again for the meaning of \u201csolemnization\u201d we find that defined as \u201cThe Act of solemnizing; celebration.\u201d If we turn to the Imperial Dictionary \u201csolemnization\u201d is thus defined:\u2014\nThe act of solemnizing; celebration. Soon after followed the solemnization of the marriage. Bacon,\nThe title of 4 Geo. IV. ch. 76, has been referred to as justifying the giving of an extended meaning to the term \u201csolemnization of marriage.\u201d\nThe Century Dictionary refers me to the Book of Common Prayer and quotes therefrom: \u201cThe day and time appointed for solemnization of matrimony.\u201d\nThe second section of said 4 Geo. IV. ch. 76, in terms requires the publication of banns for three Sundays preceding \u201cthe solemnization of marriage.\u201d When banns are replaced by license the latter, as well as the former, I submit, do not necessarily form a part of \u201cthe solemnization.\u201d It was quite appropriate in a plenary parliament to call such an Act one for solemnization of marriages. It is quite a different thing, when powers are or may be as here divided, to use the name of an Act to supplement the dictionary.\nI submit \u201cLord Hardwicke\u2019s Act\u201d also in its recital distinguishes clearly the publication of banns from the solemnization of matrimony.\nIf we look at any passages incidentally discussing these questions, we find solemnization refers invariably to the ceremony. And one of the best illustrations is, accidentally as it were, supplied by Pollock and Maitland in their chapter on marriage in the history of English law. At foot of page 377, in vol. 2, a case in itself well worth considering is referred to and ends thus: \u201cThey preferred the unsolemnized to the solemnized marriage.\u201d In the chapter on Marriage Laws of Scotland, in Eversley on Domestic Relations, will be found examples of how other notices may be substituted for banns and the latter may be used in Scotland for a marriage to take place in England.\nIf we found a party given, for valuable consideration, the comprehensive power, possession or property, indeed the whole, determined to use it and to another assigned the mere right to define the form of asserting such right, of which there were many modes known, and the latter refused to apply either of those that could be satisfactorily used in the exercise of the substantial power, what would we be apt to hold in such case? Would we interpret the instrument so that the power and indeed the purpose thereof would be defeated? Or would we so hold that he attempting to defeat the whole purpose or convert it into something else, should succeed?\nHowever that may be, this is not an ordinary instrument. It is but the outline of what was meant to found and form the government for, a great state. And as I have heretofore said, we must in the interpretation of its terms and construction of it as a whole, view it if we can as statesmen should, even if we be not such. We must summon to our aid history and especially constitutional history, and some knowledge of the social structure if we would understand aright how to harmonize the various parts when apparently conflicting, and as here by the literal meaning of the terms, even in actual conflict.\n\u201cMarriage and divorce\u201d literally cover the whole field and leave nothing for the words \u201csolemnization of marriage.\u201d\nWe know that those engaged in the formation of this frame of government had first assigned the whole field to the Dominion Parliament, and as an historical fact that the power assigned to the provincial legislatures as it stands was the result of representation made by those having a care for religion. We know also as a matter of history that marriage amongst the Romans, it is said even from the time of the twelve tables, might be the result of consent merely, though concurrently therewith for centuries, forms of solemnization were almost universally adopted, and as the use thereof died away mere consent became almost universally, for centuries, the common mode of constituting marriage; that by degrees as the Christian religion gained the ascendancy and its bishops greater control, the sanction of the Christian Church\u2019s solemnities was advocated, and in many places added by law or practice in various ways; yet that, outside of England, consensual marriage prevailed over western Europe till the Council of Trent, and thereafter its decrees prevailed directly in some places, indirectly in others, until in modern times men\u2019s views so changed that in France and elsewhere the law treated the matter in an entirely different way by substituting the civil officer as the witness and his records as the means of perpetuating the necessary legal evidence of that upon which so much depends.\nIt is common knowledge that this did not and does not satisfy the hearts and minds of vast numbers of people of Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. Even, of those who care little for the usual religious ordinances, many think the solemnities of a church marriage, or marriage by a clergyman, even if not in a church, tend to add to the strength of the bond of union by the greater sanctity of the occasion and a degree of sentiment that the coldness of a magistrate\u2019s office is destitute of.\nThe wise men having in charge the formation of our. Confederation, tried to satisfy this respectable feeling by inserting the power given the legislatures relative to the solemnization of marriage. It fitted in with the past and no jar was given to the state or to the feelings of any one.\nBut after all, what does it amount to in law? The substantial part of the whole field or subject-matter was assigned to the Dominion. And, before going further, let us examine the language so assigning it in section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nParliament is\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the provinces; * * * it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\nCould language more comprehensive be used to give efficiency to the power over the subjects of \u201cmarriage and divorce\u201d which are amongst those so enumerated? And when heed is given to the words \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act\u201d can there be any doubt that, if a provincial legislature either refused or failed to furnish adequate means of solemnizing any marriage between those Parliament had declared capable of marriage, and of whom in such case it had declared that by their consent they were to be held as married to all intents and purposes, they must be in law by virtue thereof held to be married? Can there be any doubt in such a case that Parliament would be the only power which could, by direct enactment or by decree of any divorce court it had constituted, dissolve such a union as might have been formed by virtue of such legislation? Or can there be any doubt of the competency of Parliament to invoke its exclusive power over the criminal law and to declare that any one so married should on marrying during the life of the other party thereto, unless the tie were dissolved by Parliament or by a divorce court of its creation, be guilty of bigamy? Or can there be any doubt that all the laws that Parliament has enacted or may enact relative to the crime of failing to support a wife or child, would be applicable in such a case?\nThe word \u201cmarriage\u201d is not, as I conceive its use in this Act, to be interpreted as only such form of marriage as the laws of England had deemed marriage, or part of this country at the time of Confederation had deemed such.\nIt is to be taken for the measuring of the power, in the widest sense that the word can have a meaning in any civilized country, including, for example, the widest sense in which any one of the court engaged in resolving the case of The Queen v. Millis[89], would have held it to mean; or, for example, in the sense that so long prevailed over Western Europe and up to recent years in Scotland; in short, consensual marriage of any kind.\nIn Beamish v. Beamish[90], it was suggested, at page 353, that the ruling in The Queen v. Millis86 had not been held to extend to the colonies and is supposed to be left open. And see the case of McLean v. Cristall[91], there cited, but not in our library. No argument was made here, expressly on that point. It may be open to argue that such holding as in the Millis Case[92] is not, and that the holding by Sir William Scott in Dalrymple v. Dalrymple[93], is law in Canada unless where declared otherwise. See also Lightbody v. West et al.[94]. Parliament in such case may not need to regard solemnization as necessary to constitute marriage. It is, however, not necessary to, and, in absence of argument directed thereto, I cannot press that point further than suggestion.\nEven if the Millis Case89 is law here, it would, I conceive, be quite competent for Parliament to enact according to the exigencies of each case. It might either enact that a consensual marriage, as indicated above, of such persons as it declared eligible, should be held valid, in cases of the default of the legislature of any province to provide for all those therein found eligible to intermarry, such suitable mode or modes of solemnization of marriage as would adequately enable them to be married; and it might also alternatively enact that such persons so consenting, pursuant to its authority, should be held to be married, upon their conformity with any one of such existing forms of solemnization of marriage as a local legislature might have, by any competent Act required, or might thereafter so require, or by such mode of civil marriage as it might provide.\nIt might also, if necessary, provide for cases of intermarriage in the cases of parties domiciled in different provinces.\nOn this head of the conditional legislation by Parliament, see the case of The Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion[95], and especially at 369, and Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, pp. 164 and 165, and notes thereto. I see strong arguments against the assumption by Parliament of dispensing with local forms of solemnization so long as reasonably provided within what I have no doubt was the original purpose.\nThere is not, I conceive, any difficulty in working out harmoniously the seemingly conflicting provisions so that the purpose thereof, to which I have adverted above, may meet the views and proper feelings of all, so long as the aspirations of free men are respected and not sought to be controlled by some power or authority free people are entitled to disregard.\nI am not implying that there must of necessity be either in Parliament conditional legislation or concurrent legislation therein and in the legislatures. For I have no doubt that in the case of a conflict between the two powers, brought about by any legislature engrafting upon its form of solemnization something in the nature of an impediment or right to dissolve the tie of marriage believed by those concerned to have been constituted, that the power of Parliament should be held to be paramount on this subject of the complete constitution of the legal status of husband and wife.\nTo hold otherwise, would be to give to the power naming a mere form, the power to swallow up the substantial power given over the whole field. Indeed, that was the attitude in argument to such an extent that it seemed to be thought that to give it validity marriage must have a provincial form observed and that if the legislature of a province saw fit to attach any such condition as it chose to any form of solemnization it provided it could thereby debar those refusing to comply therewith, from marrying even if such conformity involved the impossible thing of a man honestly professing a faith he had not. It is idle to say that case has not arisen, for it is the very case that elaborate argument in effect says has arisen; indeed, is the root of the whole matter in controversy.\nI need not dwell upon the desirability of precautions being taken against secret marriages or the case of those under parental or other guardianship committing youthful folly. I need not elaborate the question of clandestinity. But when we find clandestinity has heen given a definition which implies that those once baptized in a certain church must conform to the marriage ceremony of that church and all the regulations thereof, as conditions to be observed preceding the ceremony, or remain unmarried, or if marrying elsewhere, that then such marriage carries in it by virtue of clandestinity an impediment invalidating it, I submit that is ultra vires any provincial legislature to enact.\nI am glad to say I have found that Quebec never did legislate in any such way or attempt any such things.\nBut the claim has been made and seems to have been maintained in some cases. Whatever may be the law as to these cases under past legislation, they can be no longer valid once Parliament takes possession of the field assigned to it by the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d respecting marriage and divorce.\nOnce it has exhaustively dealt with the power assigned to it, then it will be clearly incompetent for any local legislature to do more than provide for or require submission to such mode of solemnization, as it sees fit. These modes cannot properly impose any religious test which honest men and women cannot accede to, nor enact any such impediment to marriage, if Parliament see fit to declare otherwise.\nIt might as well enact that the solemnization forms it prescribed were only to apply or be available in the case of a black-haired man marrying with a fair-haired woman, or a fair-haired man with a black-haired maiden.\nAnother view is presented for which much can be said. It is this, that while Parliament has the plenary power which the language of the Act is capable of, and it may be held must mean; yet it may be well within the power of the legislature to enact any reasonable mode of solemnization to be observed before the consummation of the marriage and add for default thereof such reasonable sanction in the way of penalties as may be calculated to induce the due observance thereof.\nThus effect is given to all the language used and probably the full effect intended.\nIt has been assumed such legislative power over solemnization implies of necessity control of all marriage licenses and, indeed, all that precedes and leads to the solemnization. I cannot agree in this. I think it is quite competent for Parliament to provide and insist upon a Dominion license for such cases as it enables a solemnization to be provided for by a provincial legislature, or such other cases as it may constitute a marriage by way of a marriage by consent; not only the idle form that the license has too often become, but one designed to secure compliance with such set of rules for determining and declaring who, in the judgment of Parliament, can marry, and who must not. Parliament alone has the power to determine all questions relevant thereto, and can debar any provincial license from having any effect unless and until the conditions precedent which Parliament has enacted have been found to have been satisfied or complied with.\nOnce these Parliamentary conditions have been fulfilled, the province can impose no prohibitive barrier under pretext of providing for solemnization. I do not say that a license required by a province merely as a preliminary to solemnization, would be, as, of course, ultra vires a provincial legislature. I need not follow that subject further. I desire only to indicate wherein the assumption heretofore made relative to the question of marriage license as necessarily part of the \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d within the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d leads to error, indeed is, I submit, a misconception involving or resulting from confusion of thought.\nIn itself, I see nothing of material consequence. I do see, however, that a sanction is sought therein for what seems unwarranted ground taken to give a vitality to the doctrine of clandestinity and thereby constitute it a matter of undue importance and, indeed, an impediment.\nBy using in argument the accidental application thereof in the Code, counsel seemed to think it might by this means be imported into the interpretation to be given the Act I am now dealing with. We must, if we would clearly apprehend these provisions of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d lay aside the Code for a moment.\nI think no foundation should be laid by an extension of the minor one of the supposed conflicting claims to create future mischief or make a source of grievance where none should exist. The utmost publicity can be secured by either Parliament or legislature without the local legislature or those resting on its authority creating an impediment and constituting a divorce court to try the question of that impediment.\nIt seems to me all such things as impediments of any kind and consequence thereof including the judicial power to pass thereon must rest in and be dealt with by the power of Parliament. A clear perception being had of what solemnization of marriage means, and I think it means no more, no less, than it really is, and the rest is clear and the respective spheres of legislative action are then made clear.\nIf the bill in question were made to cover the whole ground I have indicated as within the power of Parliament, it would assuredly enable people, so long as otherwise eligible, to marry though now possibly by local legal conditions unable to do so. It could be made thereby clear that, notwithstanding any differences in the religious faith of those so marrying and without regard to the religion of the person performing the ceremony they must be held as married.\nIf the bill in question, as it stands, can be read in any of its parts so as to fall within this power which I have indicated Parliament possesses then such part may be held competent for Parliament to enact. I need not repeat my difficulties in the way of finding such part.\nI assume, however, from the whole submission of the questions before us, that the root of the trouble is to be found in the religion of the parties to be married and the religion of the officer who may be appointed to perform a marriage ceremony differing from those to be married.\nI have no hesitation in answering that Parliament can so effectively deal with the matter that there can be no difficulty in Roman Catholics marrying each other or a Roman Catholic and a Protestant marrying each other without resorting to a priest of the Roman Catholic church, appointed by it for the purposes of the marriage service or ceremony, to perform the ceremony of marriage; and hence can remove or dispense with any condition of things, by reason of religion, that may be now supposed in law to debar such marriages. It cannot, however, impose on the clergy of that or of any other church against the will of the church the duty of performing such ceremony.\nI apprehend that this answers substantially what questions one and two are in truth aimed at.\nI have already indicated how I think the retrospective part of the bill should be dealt with. I may add that in the judgment in The Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion[96], it is stated by Lord Watson that the Dominion Parliament\u2019s enactments, so far as within its competency, must override provincial legislation, but that Parliament has no authority conferred upon it to repeal directly any provincial statute; and that can only be effected by a repugnancy between its provisions and the enactments of the Dominion.\nOn this principle the court pronounced therein against the authority of Parliament to repeal, by the \u201cCanada Temperance Act of 1886,\u201d the old Provincial Act of 1864, and proceeded to lay down in express terms the limits of authority in this regard as follows:\nIt appears to their Lordships, that neither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial Legislatures have authority to repeal statutes which they could not directly enact.\nI am not clear that this part of the bill does not infringe in principle on what is thus laid down, and must be observed in legislating.\nI have assumed that though question three is put alternatively I am not entitled to take it for granted that my personal view as to question two will ultimately prevail. Until it does, I presume I am expected to answer the third question and have accordingly done so.\nI may be permitted to point out that the condition of the law as existent in any province in relation to these questions of marriage and divorce continues until changed by a competent authority. But it has never, since the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d came in force, been competent for any local legislature to change any of these things falling within the subject matter of marriage and divorce.\nI may also be permitted to point out that divorce in said Act means and must cover every matter of substance or form that the word implies and is not, in my humble opinion, to be confined to the ordinary divorce bills passed by Parliament. As to the objections strongly pressed by counsel for Quebec that we should not answer the second question, I may observe that incidentally to dealing with the like questions in a recent reference I assumed that private rights might be touched and urged all I could in the same direction as counsel do now argue as ground of refusal to answer. The Judicial Committee\u2019s judgment indicates such objections were hardly worthy of notice. If I understand their Lordships aright, the statute creates this court pro tanto an advisory board. They suggest the answers need not bind. But, I respectfully submit, we and the other colonial courts have been told more than once that their Lordships\u2019 judgments bind us at least and we follow them. Hence their judgment in this case must bind us and all colonial courts, notwithstanding the large powers of self government, the judgment informs us Canada is possessed of.\nI admit this case involves in a two-fold way what I had conceived to be the vicious principle of interrogating judges.\nIt involves, I respectfully submit, the sweeping-aside of the modern constitutional doctrine of separating the judicial, legislative and executive functions of government and I fear imperils private rights in a way that seems to deprive those concerned of trial by due process of law.\nThe answer is the statute is held by the court above as binding us, and I respectfully submit in such case the duty is clear and I have tried to discharge it, feebly it may be, but as well as I know how. I find no power given therein to remonstrate. I am not, as a Privy Councillor possibly is, entitled by constitutional law and custom to remonstrate. I have only the limits of a statute to define my duty once the statute is held as it has been not to be ultra vires and to be operative despite the indirect results likely to bear on private rights.\nThe ultimate consequences of this grave change in our mode or form of government the men of later times alone can accurately comprehend and deal with. I fear Quebec is late.\nMy answers, therefore, are as follows:\u2014 As to the first question; it is an impossible bill as it stands.\nIf I must answer categorically, then I say as follows:\u2014\nThe retrospective part would be good as part of a scheme for concurrent legislation by Parliament and Legislatures confirming past marriages which probably neither can effectively do.\nThe prospective part, so far as possible to make it an effective prohibition of religious tests may be good, but doubtful, and the probable purpose can be reached by a better bill.\nAs to the second question, I answer \u201cNo.\u201d\nAs to the third question, sub-section (a) I answer yes, to be concurred in by the respective legislatures of provinces concerned; and to sub-section (b) I answer yes, if and when a province fails to provide adequate means of solemnization.\nDuff J.\u2014The first and third questions must, in my opinion, be answered, in the negative. I agree generally with the reasons given by my brother Davies in support of this view, but I desire to add two observations. First, I should not wish to express any opinion upon the question of what observances in point of form were necessary or sufficient to constitute a valid marriage in the provinces other than Quebec at the date of the passing of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d The point has not been discussed and in the absence of argument I do not feel qualified to deal with it in a satisfactory manner. Secondly, the doctrine of necessarily incidental powers has never been defined with precision. I do not think it has reached that point of development at which it is safe or wise to attempt to formulate it definitively; and it ought, I think, to be applied only with great caution. It can have no possible application to the question before us. The union effected, by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was the result of a compact among the colonies thereby brought together. The Act itself, in the first two paragraphs of the preamble, expressly recognizes the federal character of the union to be created. With respect to legislative powers, some of the powers possessed by the provinces so united by the Act were assigned to the Dominion, others were specially reserved to the provinces themselves and in Lord Watson\u2019s well-known words \u201cin so far as regards those matters which by section 92 are specially reserved for provincial legislation, the legislation of each province continues to be free from the control of the Dominion and as supreme as it was before the passing of the Act.\u201d Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. The Receiver-General of New Brunswick[97].\nIt has been found in applying the Act that the fields of legislative jurisdiction in some cases overlap. In such cases, either authority may legislate and when conflict occurs in the common territory it is settled that the Dominion legislation must prevail. But outside any such common domain, each has exclusive dominion over the field assigned to it; and the failure of a province to legislate, however capricious or unreasonable its conduct may appear, affords no ground or excuse for the invasion by the Dominion of a sphere which is wholly witheld from its jurisdiction. The remedy in such a case does not lie by way of appeal to the Dominion Parliament but rests with the body that in the last resort exercises the political sovereignty of the province itself. The special provisions of sections 93, as Mr. Smith observed, only bring into relief the rigour of the general rule.\nLegislation in terms of the proposed bill and any legislation on lines suggested in the third question would, in my judgment, be legislation on the very subject of \u201cSolemnization of Marriage\u201d which, by section 92 , is withdrawn from the general subject of marriage and assigned to the provinces exclusively, and such legislation consequently would be ultra vires of Parliament.\nAs to Question 2, which reads as follows:\u2014\n2. Does the law of the Province of Quebec render null and void unless contracted before a Roman Catholic priest, a marriage that would otherwise be legally binding, which takes place in such province?\n(a) between persons who are both Roman Catholics, or\n(b) between persons one of whom, only, is a Roman Catholic.\nBoth branches of this question must, in my opinion, be answered in the negative. The question is whether, in the cases mentioned, or either of them, the requirements of the law in respect of all other matters being duly observed, Catholic priests alone are competent to celebrate marriage. The central provisions of the Civil Code relating to this subject are found in articles 128 and 129. The first of these requires that marriage shall be solemnized openly, and by a competent officer recognized by law. Article 129 is in the following words:\u2014\n129. All priests, rectors, ministers and other officers, authorized by law to keep registers of acts of Civil Status, are competent to solemnize marriage.\nBut none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion and the discipline of the church to which he belongs.\nBy chapter 20 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860, which was in force at the time the Code became law, the priests and ministers of the Protestant churches or congregations mentioned in sections 16 and 17 of the Act were authorized to keep registers of acts of Civil Status, that is to say, of baptisms, marriages and burials. By the express terms of article 129, therefore, all such priests and ministers are, in respect of the solemnization of marriage, competent officers \u201crecognized by law\u201d within the meaning of article 128. In the case of marriages by the Roman Catholic clergy the marriage must in the absence of a dispensation by the proper authority, be preceded by the publication of banns as required by articles 57, 58 and 130. Protestant ministers are, however, authorized by the provisions of articles 59 and 59(a) to solemnize marriage in the absence of banns, where the parties \u201chave obtained and produce\u201d a marriage license under the hand and seal of the Lieutenant-Governor. It is my opinion that except in cases in which there is some specific statutory restriction, a Protestant minister, competent to celebrate marriage by reason of being authorized to keep a register of acts of civil status has, when acting pursuant to such a license, authority to solemnize matrimony between any two persons lawfully capable of contracting marriage together, and that his authority is not in any way restricted by reason of the religious faith or the ecclesiastical affiliations of such persons.\nMr. Mignault\u2019s first and principal contention is a general one and it is this: although, he says, according to the words of article 129 read literally, such a minister is competent to celebrate marriage between any two parties capable under the law of entering into that relation with one another, nevertheless, reading that article in connection with other provisions of the Code dealing with the subject and by the light of the history of the law, it must be construed as conferring only a limited authority; and that authority so limited is to solemnize marriage between persons who are, or one of whom is, a member of the communion to which the officiating minister belongs and domiciled in the parish of which he is in charge where that communion has connected with it a parochial system, or between persons who are or one of whom is a member of the communion and of the congregation to which he ministers where there is no such system.\nAccording to this view, a Presbyterian clergyman is incompetent to marry two unbelievers or two Anglicans; and the view it is admitted if accepted must necessarily involve the conclusion that the law of Quebec makes no provision for the marriage of persons who are not connected with any of the religious persuasions whose ministers are specifically authorized by a statute to keep registers of acts of Civil Status. One cannot, of course, bring oneself to adopt a construction having such consequences without examining very critically the reasoning upon which it is based; and it may be observed that we are asked, in adopting it, to refuse to give effect to the words of the articles quoted according to their ordinary meaning, and to arrive at this most extraordinary result by discovering in the law a restriction which the authors of it have left unexpressed. The main argument by which this interpretation is supported, may be stated in this way. It is said that according to the law in force at the time the Civil Code came into effect the jurisdiction of priests and ministers in respect of the solemnization of marriage was limited to persons who were members or one of whom was a member of their respective churches and congregations. It is argued that on this subject of marriage the provisions of the Code were intended to be declaratory of the law as it then existed and that it is only by construing it in the manner now proposed that full effect can be given to its various provisions on this subject.\nA brief reference to the history of the law upon the points in controversy is therefore necessary.\nThe provisions of the law relating to the solemnization of marriage in force in Quebec, at the date of the cession (1763) in so far as we are concerned with them are stated by Pothier (Bugnet\u2019s Edition) 6th vol., articles 319, 354 to 360. It was essential to the validity of a marriage that it should be celebrated \u201cin facie ecclesi\u0153\u201d and, in the absence of a dispensation, only after the publication of banns; and the general rule was that the ceremony must be performed by the \u201cproper cur\u00e9\u201d of the parties; that is to say, by the cur\u00e9 of the parish in which one of the parties was domiciled. It was, however, competent to the bishop, or to a cur\u00e9 acting with the permission of the bishop or with the permission of the \u201cproper cur\u00e9\u201d of the parties, to perform the ceremony. The law further required the officiating priest to record in an official register a statement of the particulars of each marriage solemnized by him, which was signed by him, by the parties to the marriage, and by at least two witnesses of the ceremony. Under the French R\u00e9gime the public exercise of the Protestant religion was not tolerated by the law of Canada, and, consequently, the cur\u00e9 within the meaning of this law was necessarily a Roman Catholic priest. The change of sovereignty, which took place in 1763, naturally brought in its train substantial modifications. The conquest was followed by the influx of a considerable Protestant population, coming in part from the United Kingdom and in part from the British colonies to the south. Steps were immediately taken by the Imperial Government (as appears from the Instructions to Governors in 1763, 1768, 1775, and 1786; see Shortt and Doughty, pp. 139, 140, 141, 217, 218, 425-427, 556-559) for the introduction of a beneficed Protestant clergy under the patronage of the Crown and subject to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of London; and later under the sanction of the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d 1774, and the \u201cConstitutional Act,\u201d 1791, and other Imperial legislation, provision was made for their support out of the public funds of the colony. It was from the outset assumed that these clergy were competent to solemnize marriage, and it is admitted that from the first, marriages were in fact solemnized by them. No express statutory authority in this behalf was conferred upon the clergymen of the Church of England until 1861; but during the century which had then elapsed since the conquest, various Acts of the Canadian legislatures had conferred authority to celebrate marriage upon the ministers of other Protestant denominations, and these and other statutes shew that the competency of the Anglican clergy in this respect had always been assumed by the legislative authorities; and there can be, I think, no possible question (apart altogether from the implications arising from the change in the sovereignty itself) that a grant of such authority was involved in the provisions to which I have referred, which are found first in the royal instructions to the governors, and afterwards in the Imperial legislation.\nFrom the date of the cession down to the passing of the Quebec Act in 1774, \u201csuch laws were in force\u201d (to use the words of Baron Parke, speaking for the Judicial Committee in Beaumont v. Barrett[98]), \u201cas the King, by his supreme authority, may choose to direct,\u201d subject always, of course, to the provisions of the Treaty of Paris, which the King had no constitutional authority to violate. Chitty, Prerogatives, p. 29. There seems to be no reason to doubt that an effective \u201cdirection\u201d in this regard might be given, by commission or by instructions under the King\u2019s sign manual, as well as by order-in-council: Cameron v. Kyte[99]. The Instructions which accompanied General Murray*s Commission contain a sufficient declaration that the royal supremacy in matters ecclesiastical extends to Quebec, and this necessarily involved such alterations in the existing law as might be required to confer on the clergyman appointed to benefices under the authority of the Crown the jurisdiction to solemnize marriages. This jurisdiction was confirmed by the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d which expressly recognizes the royal supremacy as declared by 1 Elizabeth ch. 1.\nThe contention made by Mr. Mignault is that all grants of authority to marry, made since the cession, whether by express statutory enactment or otherwise, were subject to the condition that one at least of the intended consorts should be a member of the communion and congregation of the minister performing the ceremony. Whether the competence of these ministers in this regard was so limited is altogether a question of the intention of the law making competence. I think there is overwhelming evidence against the existence of an intention so to limit their authority except in those few cases (I think there is only one) in which the restriction is expressly declared.\nFirst, as to the Church of England. In the Instructions to the Governors already referred to, we find repeatedly expressed intentions with regard to the status of the Anglican Church in Canada and with regard to cognate matters, which appear to be incompatible with the view that at that time any idea was entertained of placing any restriction upon the Jurisdiction of its clergymen in respect of the celebration of marriage. (See Shortt and Doughty at the . pages already referred to.) In 1795, an Act was passed (35 Geo. III. ch. 4) requiring the Protestant clergy in charge of parishes, churches and congregations to register in official registers to be kept by them \u201call baptisms, marriages and burials as soon as the same shall have been by them performed.\u201d (Section 1). There is in this statute no express declaration touching the legal competency to celebrate matrimony of the clergy to whom the Act was intended to apply; their competency in that respect is assumed. There can be no doubt that the Act applied to all clergymen of the Church of England in charge of parishes, churches and congregations; and what is noteworthy for our present purpose is that the Act contains no hint of any limitation upon the authority of the ministers affected by it in respect of the classes of persons who might contract marriage under their ministry. The language of the Act of 1860, ch. 20, Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, section 16, is absolutely unqualified.\nAll regularly ordained priests and\u2019 ministers of either of the said churches\n(meaning churches and congregations in communion with the United Church of England and Ireland or with the Church of Scotland)\nhave had and shall have authority validly to solemnize marriage in Lower Canada.\nThe case of the Church of Scotland is equally clear. An Act passed in 1827, 7 Geo. IV. ch.2, enacts\nthat all marriages which have heretofore been or shall hereafter be celebrated by ministers or clergymen of or in communion with the Church of Scotland, have been and sha11 be held to be legal and valid to all intents and purposes whatsoever;\nand this sweeping declaration is in substance repeated in the provision above quoted from the Act of 1860. With respect to other Protestant denominations, a series of statutes was passed during the period that elapsed between 1829 and 1861, authorizing the ministers of various denominations and communions in charge of churches or congregations to keep registers of baptisms, marriages and burials. In some cases, the authority to solemnize marriage is given expressly; in others, it is given by implication. In one case only, in the Act relating to the Society of Friends, the enabling provisions of the Act are limited in their application to marriages between persons one of whom is a member of the communion according to whose usages the ceremony is to be performed. An intention to create a similar restriction is indicated, although not very clearly expressed, in the Act of 9 & 10 Edw. IV. ch. 75, which relates to persons who profess the Jewish religion. There may be, although our attention has not been called to them, other special cases in which similar restrictions are imposed by special statutes. The existence of such isolated instances is not material to my present purpose, which is to point out that the legislative enactments dealing with this subject of solemnization of marriage by Protestant clergymen and ministers, before the Code came into force, are expressed in such terms as to negative the theory that, as a rule, the authority of such clergymen and ministers in respect of that subject Avas intended to be or was regarded as affected by any restriction such as that now contended for. The alteration effected in the law of marriage, as it stood at the time of the cession, by this recognition of the competence of all Protestant ministers to celebrate marriages was fundamental. The law in force under the French R\u00e9gime pre-supposed two things; a single church in union with the State, and a complete, or at all events, a very extensive parochial system. Given these two things, the application of the law was simple and certain; but to marriages celebrated by the ministers of Protestant denominations, having no parochial organization connected with them, some important requirements of that law became impossible of application. The rule, for example, which in effect limited the jurisdiction of the cur\u00e9 of a given parish\u201d to the solemnization of marriage between persons, one of whom was domiciled within his parish, is a rule which utterly fails of application to the matrimonial jurisdiction of the minister of a Protestant church or congregation whose jurisdiction in that behalf has no relation whatsoever to a defined territory or to the connection of the parties with his particular faith or communion.\nThe theory of the older law, namely, that there is one cur\u00e9 who, for the purposes of celebrating marriage, is the \u201cproper cur\u00e9\u201d of the parties (or at most two, one of whom is their \u201cproper cur\u00e9\u201d) necessarily falls to the ground where marriages by such an officer are in question. For this reason, I am unable to agree with Mr. Mignault\u2019s argument that article 63 of the Civil Code, read together with the provisions of the law relating to oppositions, requires us to hold that the law of Quebec, as it stands to-day, is framed upon the assumption that, with regard to any two intended consorts about to be married in that province, there is one person who is solely qualified, or a fixed, limited and ascertained number of persons who are exclusively qualified, to celebrate marriage between them. So to hold would, in my judgment, be tantamount to disregarding the course of legislation on this subject during the century succeeding the conquest.\nThis view of the powers of the Protestant clergy derived from these various sources is confirmed by the law and practice relating to marriage licenses. It is not disputed that the practice of solemnizing marriages without the publication of banns, and in disregard of any supposed requirement that marriage should be celebrated in facie ecclesi\u0153, under the authority of a license granted by the Crown, became at an early date a general practice among Protestant ministers. Prior to the year 1871 there appears to have been no statutory enactment expressly authorizing the granting of such licenses in Quebec; the granting of them Avas considered to be a proper exercise of the royal prerogative and the practice received statutory recognition in various enactments,\u2014for example, 35 Geo. III. ch. 4, sec. 4 (which Avas reproduced in the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860, ch. 20, sec. 6) and article 59 of the Civil Code. Provision was made by ch. 4 >of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, 1860, sec. 1, for the application of the fund derived from these licenses in liquidation of the \u201cRebellion Losses\u201d debentures, and no doubt appears to have been entertained at any time as to the validity of them or as to their sufficiency in point of law to legitimize marriages solemnized with publication of banns at any time or place when acted upon by a Protestant minister in charge of a church or congregation of any of the various communions where ministers Avere invested with a general authority to keep registers of acts of Civil Status.\nThis view is clearly correct. At common law authority in respect of marriage licenses was vested in the King as an incident of the royal supremacy in matters ecclesiastical.\nSuch licenses, of course, were not confined to dispensations from the publication of banns. Licenses were granted for the solemnization of marriage at any convenient time and place, (Halsbury, Laws of England, \u201cEcclesiastical Law,\u201d par 1388, note (h)); and dispensation from observance of the requirement that the marriage should take place in facie ecclesi\u0153 was one of the normal objects of a marriage license. The statute of Henry VIII. (25 Hen. VIII. ch. 21), vested a right to grant such dispensations in the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the statute left the Royal Prerogative unimpaired. Chitty, Prerogatives, p. 53. The effect of the Commission and Instructions to the Governors of Quebec between the Treaty of Paris and the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d was, to vest in the Governors the legal authority and possibly even the sole legal authority, (see paragraph 32, Instructions 7th Dec. 1763), to exercise this dispensing power in the colony. The existing law of Quebec was to that extent amended through the exercise of the legislative authority of the Crown as evidenced by the Royal Instructions. The Quebec Act, in recognizing the royal supremacy, recognized the existence of this incident of the Prerogative as part of the law of Quebec, and licenses for the solemnization of marriage without banns, and at any time and place, continued to be issued under the authority of the Governor in professed exercise of the Prerogative down to the enactment of the Civil Code in 1866. In granting these licenses the Governors acted under the authority of these Instructions. (Paragraph 37 of the \u201cInstructions to Governor Murray\u201d of 7th December, 1763, is the typical provision.) The following interesting observations are taken from an article by the late Mr. Justice Girouard in 3 Revue Critique, p. 282:\u2014\nLa licence n\u2019est pas seulement une dispense de la publication des bans; c\u2019est encore un ordre, un d\u00e9cr\u0113t \u00e0 tout ministre protestant de marier les parties qui y sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9es, sans bans, \u00e0 l\u2019endroit\u201d et \u00e0 l\u2019heure qu\u2019il leur plaira, pourvu qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas d\u2019emp\u00eachement. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, elle \u00e9manait uniquement du Bureau des Pr\u00e9rogatives, Prerogative Office, au nom du Gouverneur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et elle \u00e9tait exp\u00e9di\u00e9e par des agents, r\u00e9pandus dans toutes les parties du pays, qui signaient comme Deputy-Governors. Dans la pratique, ces licences \u00e9taient sign\u00e9es en blanc par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 gouverneur, et remises \u00e0 une foule de gens qui les remplissaient et les vendaient. En voici la formule textuelle: \u2014\n\u201cTo any Protestant minister of the Gospel. \u2014 Whereas there is a mutual purpose of marriage between\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014for which they have desired my license and given bond, upon condition that there is no lawful let or impediment, pre-contract, affinity or consanguinity, to hinder their being joined in the holy bonds of matrimony; these are therefore to authorize and empower you to join the said\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 in the holy bonds of matrimony, and them to pronounce man and wife.\u201d\nAvant le code, il n\u2019y avait aucune loi dans le pays qui autorisait l\u2019\u00e9mission de ces\u2019 licences; n\u00e9anmoins, le droit n\u2019en a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ni\u00e9 \u00e0 la couronne, dont il est, para\u00eet-il, une des pr\u00e9rogatives; et c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il est un droit de pr\u00e9rogative royale qu\u2019il existe dans ce pays, sans y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit par Une l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale.\nIn 1871 an Act was passed by the Legislature of Quebec (now reproduced in articles 1494 to 1499 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (1909)), providing that such licenses should be furnished to all persons requiring them who should previously have given a bond in the form prescribed by the statute. The bond is conditioned upon there being no\nlawful let or impediment, pre-contract, affinity; or consanguinity, to hinder their being joined in Holy Matrimony and afterwards their living together as man and wife. In other words, all parties capable of intermarrying are entitled to obtain a license authorizing, the marriage of them by any competent Protestant minister ] without reference to the place of residence or the religious creed of either of them. This seems hardly consistent with the view that, as a rule, the competence of Protestant ministers in respect of the solemnization of marriage is subject to restrictions with reference either to the domicile or to the religious faith of the parties; and, of course, the practice established by this system of granting marriage licenses to all persons competent to intermarry was, and was intended to be, utterly subversive not merely of the letter, but of the principle of the older law by which, as a rule, marriage must be celebrated, in facie ecclesi\u0153, and by the incumbent of the parish of one of the parties.\nI think, therefore, that the proposed construction of article 129 cannot be supported. It was freely admitted by Mr. Mignault (and with him I agree) that assuming his construction of that article to be rejected, an affirmative, answer to this question if supported at all could only be justified on one of the two following grounds:\u2014\nThe first of these grounds is that the effect of article 127 is to incapacitate Roman Catholics from contracting a valid marriage in the absence of a Roman Catholic priest.\nThat article reads as follows:\u2014\n127. The other impediments recognized according to the different religious persuasions, as resulting from relationship or affinity or from other causes remain subject to the rules hitherto followed in the different churches and religious communities.\nThe right, likewise, of granting dispensations from such impediments appertains as heretofore, to those who have hitherto enjoyed it. It is asserted, and it is not disputed, that in the eye of the Roman Catholic Church, clandestinity is an impediment; but the question is, is it an impediment within the meaning of this article? I desire to refrain from saying anything as to the effect of the article upon a marriage affected by an impediment within the meaning of it. For the purposes of this opinion, all that it is necessary for me to say is this: article 127 is grouped with other articles in a chapter which professes to deal with impediments arising out of some personal disability which incapacitates two given persons from intermarrying, that is to say, which disqualifies them from intermarrying under the ministry of a clergyman who, if it were not for such disability, would be competent to validly solemnize matrimony between them. That chapter is followed by another which deals with a different subject, namely, the formalities connected with marriage; and in this latter chapter the qualifications of those persons who are competent to celebrate marriage are dealt with. The impediment that, according to the discipline of the Roman Catholic Church, arises out of the absence from the ceremony of a priest of that church is not an impediment arising from incapacity in the parties themselves in the sense of the chapter in which this article occurs; it is, on the other hand, a matter of the class dealt with in the chapter following. It is, therefore, a matter which (in accordance with the scheme of classification adopted by the authors of the Code) would rather fall to be dealt with in the second than in the first chapter. It appears, consequently, to be opposed to principle to construe the general phrase \u201cother causes\u201d found in article 127 as embracing such an objection as we are considering. This view of article 127 is borne out by a reference to the passage in the codifiers\u2019 report referring to this article. That passage leaves little doubt upon one\u2019s mind that in framing the article the codifiers had no thought of an objection of the kind referred to in this question. The following is the passage which is on page 179 of the first report of the Commissioners:\u2014\nThere are, in the collateral line, as resulting from relationship and affinity, other impediments which are not of a general, character but applicable only to members of churches or religious congregations, which admit them, as forming part of their dogmas or belief; such is the relationship, in the degree of cousins-german and other more distant degrees, in which marriage is forbidden, according to doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, although not according to that of Protestant churches.\nAs that species of impediment could not be governed by general provisions, it became necessary to leave it subject to the rules followed up to the present time by the different churches which recognize it.\nIt was necessary, at the same time, to leave to the authorities, entitled to grant dispensations from such impediments, the power to do so for the future.\nThese two objects are provided for by article 11a, which is new.\nThe last point made by Mr. Mignault is this: Roman Catholics, he says, are in a special position by reason of the provisions of the Treaty of Paris, and because of that special position ought to be held to be excluded from the jurisdiction of Protestant clergymen in respect of marriage in the absence of some express provision of the law bringing them within that jurisdiction. It is said that by the provisions of that treaty a guarantee was given to the Roman Catholic Church that the exclusive authority which the clergy of that church enjoyed under the French r\u00e9gime to celebrate marriages between persons who had been received into its communion should be maintained. I cannot agree with this view.\nThe Instructions to the Governors to which I have already referred, and other contemporary documents as well as the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d itself, shew conclusively that the view taken by those who were charged with the duty of giving effect to the treaty rights was that the \u201cliberty\u201d conserved by the treaty, whatever its extent, was guaranteed to \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s new subjects\u201d as individuals; and that there was no undertaking to maintain the corporate authority and jurisdiction asserted by the Church as such. These documents afford a contemporanea expositio which cannot be ignored; and the construction they suggest appears to accord with the natural reading of the words of the Treaty of Paris themselves.\nSome passages in the documents may perhaps be usefully quoted. In a letter dated 13th August, 1763, from Lord Egremont, the Secretary of State, to Mr. Murray, apprising him of his appointment as Governor, the following account is given of the negotiations relating to the 4th article of the Treaty of Paris:\u2014\nFor tho\u2019 the King\u2019 has, in the 4th article of the Definitive Treaty, agreed to grant the Liberty of the Catholick Religion to the Inhabitants of Canada; and though His Majesty is far from entertaining the most distant thought of restraining His new Roman Catholick Subjects from professing the Worship of their Religion according to the Rites of the Romish Church: Yet the conditions, expressed in the same Article, must always he remembered, viz.: As far as the Laws of Great Britain permit, which laws prohibit absolutely all Popish Hierarchy in any of the dominions belonging to the Crown of Great Britain, and can only admit of a Toleration of the Exercise of that Religion; This matter was clearly understood in the Negotiation of the Definitive Treaty; the French Ministers proposed to insert the words, comme ci-devant, in order that the Romish Religion should continue to be exercised in the same manner as under their Government; and they did not give up the Point, till they were plainly told that it would be deceiving them to admit those Words, for The King had not the Power to tolerate that Religion in any other Manner, than as far as the Laws of Great Britain permit. (Shortt and Doughty, p. 123.)\nThe 32nd paragraph of the Instructions, dated Dec. 7th, 1763, is in these words:\u2014\nYou are not to admit any ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the See of Rome or any other foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction whatsover in the province under your government. (Shortt and Doughty, p. . 139.)\nThis is repeated in the Instructions to Sir Guy Carleton, in 1768, in paragraph 31, and continued in the Instructions to the Governors as late \u00e1t least as 1786, (Shortt and Doughty, p. 217).\nThe Instructions to Sir Guy Carleton, of 1775, contain more elaborate prohibitions against the exercise of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction incompatible with the royal supremacy (which, in the meantime had been expressly recognized by the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d) in paragraphs 20 and 21. (Shortt and Doughty, pp. 425, 426, 427). The 2nd clause of the first of these paragraphs is in the following words:\u2014\nSecondly, That no Episcopal or Vicarial Powers be exercised within Our said Province by any Person professing the Religion of the Church of Rome, but such only, as are essentially and indispensably necessary to the free exercise of the Romish Religion; and in those cases not without a License and Permission from you under the Seal of Our said Province, for, and during Our Will and Pleasure, and under such other limitations and restrictions as may correspond with the spirit and provision of the Act of Parliament, \u201cfor making more effectual provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec;\u201d And no person whatever is to have holy orders conferred upon him, or to have the Cure of Souls without a License for that purpose first had or obtained from you.\nAnd in the 8th clause there is this:\u2014\nThat such ecclesiasticks as may think fit to enter into the Holy State of Matrimony shall be released from all penalties to which they may have been subjected in such cases by any authority of the See of Rome. These clauses are reproduced in the Instructions to Lord Dorchester, of the year 1786. These provisions were not the result of inadvertence; they were passed only after the most careful consideration of all questions of right as well as of policy involved, including of course, as of primary importance, the meaning and effect of the treaty stipulation now relied upon. The following passage from the Report of Sir Alexander Wedderburn, December 6th, 1772 (see Shortt and Doughty, pp. 298 and 299), indicates the principles upon which the Government proceeded in framing the provisions on this subject in the Quebec Act as well as the Instructions of January, 1775:\u2014\nThe religion of Canada is a very important part of its political constitution. The 4th article of the Treaty of Paris, grants the liberty of the Catholic religion to the inhabitants of Canada, and provides that His Britannic Majesty should give orders that the Catholic subjects may profess the worship of their religion according to the rites of the Romish Church, as far as the laws of England will permit. This qualification renders the article of so little effect, from the severity with which (though seldom exerted) the laws of England are armed against the exercise of the Romish religion, that the Canadian must depend more upon the benignity and the wisdom of Your Majesty\u2019s Government for the protection of his religious rights than upon the provisions of the treaty, and it may be considered as an open question what decree of indulgence true policy will permit to the Catholic subject.\nThe safety of the State can be the only just motive for imposing any restraint upon men on account of their religious tenets. The principle is just, but it has seldom been justly applied; for experience demonstrates that the public safety has been often endangered by those restraints, and there is no instance of any State that has been overturned by toleration. True policy dictates then that the inhabitants of Canada should be permitted freely to profess the worship of their religion; and it follows, of course, that the ministers of that worship should be protected and a maintenance secured for them.\nBeyond this the people of Canada have no claim in regard to their religion, either upon the justice or the humanity of the Crown; and every part of the temporal establishment of the church in Canada, inconsistent with the sovereignty of the King, or the political government established in the province may justly be abolished.\nThe exercise of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction under powers derived from the See of Rome is not only contrary to the positive laws of England but is contrary to the principles of government, for it is an invasion of the sovereignty of the King, whose supremacy must extend over all his dominions, nor can His Majesty by any act divest himself of it.\n* * * * * * *\nThe point then, to which all regulations on the head of religion ought to be directed, is to secure the people the exercise of their worship, and to the Crown a due controul over the clergy.\nThe first requires that there should be a declaration that all the subjects in Canada may freely profess their religion without being disturbed in the exercise of the same, or subject to any penalties on account thereof, and also that there should be a proper establishment of parochial clergymen to perform the offices of religion.\nThe present situation of the clergy in Canada, is very fortunate for establishing the power of the Crown over the church. It is stated, in the reports from your Majesty\u2019s officers in Canada, that very few have a fixed right in their benefices, but that they are generally kept in a state of dependence, which they dislike, upon the person who takes upon him to act as bishop, who, to preserve his own authority, only appoints temporary vicars to officiate in the several benefices.\nIt would be proper, therefore, to give the parochial clergy a legal right to their benefices. All presentations either belonging to lay pastors or to the Crown, and the right in both ought to be immediately exercised with due regard to the inclinations of the parishioners in the appointment of a priest. The Governor\u2019s license should in every case be the title to the benefice, and the judgment of the temporal courts the only mode of taking it away. This regulation would, in the present moment, attach the parochial clergy to the interests of Government, exclude those of foreign priests, who are now preferred to the Canadians, and retain the clergy in a proper dependence on the Crown. It is necessary, in order to keep up a succession of priests, that there should be some person appointed whose religious character enables him to confer orders, and also to give dispensations for marriages; but this function should not extend to the exercise of a jurisdiction over the people or the clergy; and it might be no difficult matter to make up to him, for the loss of his authority, by emoluments held at the pleasure of the Government.\nThe maintenance of the clergy of Canada was provided for by the payment of one-thirteenth part of the fruits of the earth in the name of tythe, and this payment was enforced by the Spiritual Court. It is just that the same provision should continue, and that a remedy for the recovery of it should be given in the temporal courts; but the case may happen that the land-owner is a Protestant, and it may be doubted whether it would be fit to oblige him to pay tythes to a Catholic priest.\nThe design was, while allowing the fullest liberty of worship according to the rites of the Church of Rome, to preserve scrupulously the Prerogative of the Sovereign as the head of the Church. This object was strictly observed in the \u201cQuebec Act.\u201d The provisions contained in the existing Commission and Instructions were abrogated as from May 1st, 1775, and it was provided that in all matters of controversy relating to property and civil rights resort should be had to the laws of Canada. But the King\u2019s supremacy in ecclesiastical matters was also expressly declared, a declaration involving (it may be observed in passing), this consequence, that in such a matter as marriage in which civil rights under the law of Canada had their birth in the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the King became the fountain of jurisdiction. This view of the effect of the Act was strictly adhered to in the framing of the Instructions to Governors down, at all events, to the date of the \u201cConstitutional Act.\u201d And, indeed, three-quarters of a century after the conquest (as late as the year 1842), the authority of the Crown as head of the Church appears to have been invoked at the instance of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Montreal in respect of the establishment of a Roman Catholic Metropolitan See in British North America. On that occasion the following opinion was given by Sir Frederick Pollock and Sir William Webb Follett (a lawyer second to none of the great lawyers of his time):\u2014 Sir,\u2014We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 16th of October last, stating that the Reverend M. Power having been deputed by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Montreal to submit for the approval of Her Majesty\u2019s Government a proposition for dividing the Diocese of Kingston into two distinct sees, and for \u201cthe formation of an ecclesiastical province to be composed of all the British North American provinces under one Archbishop or one Metropolitan See;\u201d and further stating, that you had received Lord Stanley\u2019s directions to state that, as preliminary to advising Her Majesty as to the course which it might be expedient to take in respect to this application, His Lordship would wish us to report to him our opinion whether, adverting to the \u201cAct of Supremacy,\u201d and any other Acts of Parliament relating to the exercise within the Queen\u2019s dominions of the religion of the Church of Rome, and also adverting to the terms of the capitulations of Quebec and Montreal, in 1759 and 1760, and to the statutes 14 Geo. III. ch. 83; 31 Geo. III. ch. 31, and 3 & 4 Vict. ch. 35, any authority is vested in the Queen to regulate, or in any manner interfere with, the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops or archbishops in Canada, or to determine what the number or what the character of the ecclesiastical functionaries of the Roman Catholic Church in that province shall be-?\nIn obedience to his Lordship\u2019s commands, we have considered the subject referred to us with great care, and beg leave humbly to report that we think, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1763, . and of the statute 14 Geo. III. ch. 53, sec. 5, and with reference to the provisions of the statute of 1 Elizabeth, Her Majesty has an authority vested in her to interfere with, and to make regulations respecting, the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops and archbishops in Canada; and with respect to the particular proposal which is mentioned in the letter, we think that the consent of the Crown is properly asked for, and that it may be lawfully given to, the division of the Diocese of Kingston into two sees, if Her Majesty, in her discretion, shall think fit to do so. (Forsyth \u201cCases and Opinions on Constitutional Law,\u201d p. 51.)\n* * * * * *\nAt the date when this opinion was given the Crown no doubt would have abstained from interference in the affairs of the Roman Catholic Church except at the instance of the authorities of that Church themselves. With the progress of modern ideas it may be assumed that, in 1842, English statesmen had learned the wisdom of leaving to each church not only the care of the spiritual welfare of its adherents, but the regulation of all matters strictly pertaining to ecclesiastical jurisdiction as well. These documents, however, to which I have referred, shew how repugnant the present proposed construction of the treaty would have been to the ideas of the generation of English statesmen and lawyers who were responsible for carrying its provisions into effect. By the light of history, the argument that in the 4th article the Grown gave bonds to the Hierarchy of the Church of Rome to maintain its ecclesiastical authority over the subjects of the King in Canada, will not bear examination; it falls to pieces in one\u2019s hands.\nIt is proper to observe that in the discussion of this question I have confined myself to the case in which a license has been obtained and the clergymen performing the marriage ceremony acts under the authority of it. In my view of the points in controversy, it is not necessary to consider other cases. I pass no opinion, therefore, upon the question whether, in the absence of a license (and where consequently the publication of banns is a necessary preliminary to the ceremony of marriage) the banns having been published in one church by one priest or minister, the ceremony can, at the discretion of the parties, be validly solemnized at any convenient time or place, and by any priest or minister. The point was discussed, but I express no opinion upon it.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have already stated my concurrence in the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Davies for answering the first question submitted in the negative. I am, however, unable to agree in his reasons and conclusions in regard to question No. 2, and must, therefore, express my own views upon it. Since the majority of the judges of this court are of the opinion that the Dominion Parliament does not possess jurisdiction to legislate in respect of the subject-matter of question No. 2, it is difficult to perceive how an answer to it can be useful either to Parliament or to the Governor-General in Council. It concerns the interpretation of a provincial law dealing with a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial Legislatures. I find it almost impossible to believe that it was expected that in the event of this court answering questions Nos. 1 and 3 in the negative it should proceed to answer this second question which would thus have become purely academic.\nI think we might well have acted upon the suggestion presented by the Deputy of the Minister of Justice, when, towards the close of the argument, he said:\u2014\nIf your Lordships conclude, therefore, that there is jurisdiction, I submit that on no consideration which has been or can be suggested should your Lordships fail to advise upon every point that has been placed before you. On the other hand., if it be determined that there is no jurisdiction to enact the bill a different situation is before your Lordships.\n* * * * *\nIf it appears on the reading of this submission that there is in effect one interrogation, that it is divided into clauses having regard to what might follow from the different views which the court might entertain, it is quite open and proper for the court no doubt, to submit that in view of the opinions which are handed in upon certain parts of the interrogation it becomes unnecessary, in the view of the court, to answer the rest. And if the Government upon that submission, entertain, a different view, I presume the Government would communicate that to the court for further consideration.\n* * * * *\nThe court, in its superior knowledge of the constitution and the working of the laws, may upon the consideration of these questions see reason instead of answering categorically to submit paints for the consideration of the Government with regard to the matter. That is the situation here. I submit that the matter is in your Lordships\u2019 hands here as one interrogation arising out of a situation created in view of the public agitation and the introduction of this bill.\n* * * * *\nMr. Justice Duff.\u2014If the substance of No. 1 and No. 3 is answered in the negative\u2014assuming that the substantial question which is to be found in these two questions is answered in the negative?\nMr. Newcombe: If that be the purpose of your Lordship\u2019s question I concede immediately that it is a case in which it would be proper for your Lordships if you so consider to submit an inquiry to the Government or to submit any suggestion which your Lordships within the limitation of the Lord Chancellor\u2019s judgment may deem proper.\nMoreover, counsel representing the Province of Quebec have stated to us the view of the Government of that province (the legislation of which can alone be affected) that, while in the event of the reply to either the first or the third question being in whole or in part in the affirmative, this second question might properly be answered, a reply should not be given to it if the other questions should be answered wholly in the negative. They insisted that an expression of opinion by this court upon the law of Quebec, whatever answer chould be given to the second question, especially if it should not be unanimous, and if the Privy Council should, as seems not improbable, decline to deal with this part of the reference, must have a disturbing effect, inasmuch as it would cast doubt upon the status of many married persons in that province and upon the rights of a still larger number of persons in regard, to property. They have also called our attention to the fact that there is at present pending, in the Superior Court at Montreal, in Review, a case inter partes in which the very point covered by clause (a) of the second question is presented for judicial determination. They further stated that no case has ever come before the courts of the Province of Quebec in which the validity of such marriages as are dealt with by clause (b) of the second question has been challenged.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the recent case of the Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario, et al. v. the Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada[100] known as the Companies\u2019 Reference, the Lord Chancellor after alluding to the refusal by Lord Herschell, when delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee in the Fisheries Case[101], to answer one of the questions there put \u201cupon the ground that so doing might prejudice particular interests of individuals\u201d and referring to the questions propounded in the Companies Case[102], at page 589, as:\u2014\na series of searching questions very difficult to answer exhaustively and accurately without so many qualifications and reservations as to make the answers of little value,\nadded that:\u2014\nThe Supreme Court itself can, however, either point out in its answer these or other considerations of a like kind, or can make the necessary representations to the Governor-General in Council when it thinks right so to treat any question that may be put.\nUpon carefully weighing all these considerations, it seemed to me to be eminently proper that before proceeding to deal with the second question we should respectfully represent to the Governor-General in Council the undesirability in our opinion of our answering it since the view of the majority of the judges of this court is that the Parliament of Canada is entirely without jurisdiction to legislate in the direction suggested; and that we should proceed to reply to that question only upon being officially informed that it is the wish and the intention of the Governor-General in Council that it should be answered notwithstanding the negative reply made to the other questions propounded.\nBut a majority of my learned brothers have reached the conclusion that we should answer the second question without making any such representation. In deference to their views I proceed to express my opinion upon it.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nBeing charged to define and declare the civil law of the Province of Quebec upon this question to the best of our ability, it is, in my opinion, our duty as judicial officers of a Canadian civil tribunal to consider and to give effect to the ecclesiastical law, whether of the Catholic or of any other church, so far, but so far only, as it is found to be incorporated in the common (civil) law or the legislature has seen fit to recognize and adopt it and to give civil efficacy to it. We are in nowise concerned with the policy, the propriety or the impropriety, the desirability or the undesirability, of whatever course the legislature has in this regard seen fit to pursue in the exercise of its descretion, which, within the ambit of the jurisdiction committed to it by the Imperial Parliament is, for all judges of civil courts in this country, supreme.\nI desire to call attention to the fact that we have no evidence before us of the law of the Catholic Church bearing upon the questions submitted, other than what is furnished by the documents which have been admitted and are printed in the joint appendix. Except in so far as it 4s admitted, that law would require to be proved as any other matter of fact. I necessarily proceed upon the assumption that the admitted documents state it as fully as is necessary for the disposition of the questions submitted.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nThe Civil Code of Lower Canada became law in 1866\u2014the year preceding Confederation. The legislature which enacted it had complete jurisdiction over the subject of marriage in the then Province of Canada. The Fifth Title of the Civil Code deals with marriage. The first chapter of that title treats:\u2014\nOf the qualities and conditions necessary for contracting marriage (Des qualit\u00e9s et conditions requises pour pouvoir contracter marriage); the second \u201cOf the formalities relating to the Solemnization of Marriage; the third \u201cOf opposition to marriage; the fourth \u201cOf actions for annulling marriage.\u201d\nIn the first chapter are grouped a number of articles enumerating various impediments which render persons incapable of validly contracting marriage and stating several conditions precedent the non-observance of which, when applicable, invalidates marriage; (vide articles 148-155 C.C.)\nThe last article of the first chapter, No. 127, reads as follows:\u2014\n127. The other impediments recognized according to the different religious persuasions, as resulting from relationship or affinity or from other causes, remain subject to the rules hitherto followed in the different churches and religious communities.\nThe right likewise of granting dispensations from such impediments, appertains, as heretofore, to those who have hitherto en-enjoyed it. Inasmuch as \u201crelationship\u201d and \u201caffinity\u201d exhaust the genus to which they belong, it is obvious that the \u201cother causes\u201d referred to in article 127 cannot be restricted to impediments ejusdem generis with consanguinity and affinity. That would be to deny any effect to the words \u201cother causes.\u201d The other causes are therefore necessarily impediments of another kind \u201crecognized according to, the different religious persuasions\u201d\u2014presumably of the parties. Confining the inquiry to the particular subject-matter before us, our attention has been directed to a Decree of the Council of Trent which, subject to a modification to be presently noted, admittedly was in force in, and was recognized as binding by, the Catholic Church in Lower Canada in 1866. That decree contains the following paragraph:\u2014\nQui aliter quam praesente parocho, vel alio sacerdote de ipsius parochi seu ordinarii licentia, et duobus vel (tribus testibus matrimonium contrahere attentabunt, eos sancta Synodus ad sic contrahendum omnino inhabiles reddit, et hujusmodi contractus irritos et nullos esse discernit, prout eos praesenti decreto irritos facit et annullat.\nIn the translation furnished to us in the joint appendix this passage is thus rendered:\u2014\nWith regard to those who marry otherwise than in the presence of the parish priest, or of the priest who has his permission or that of the Ordinary, and in the presence of two or three witnesses; the Holy Council renders such persons wholly incapable of contracting marriage in that way, and declares the marriages thus contracted null and void as, by the present decree, it dissolves and annuls them.\nUnder this decree where it is in force and unmodified it is perfectly clear that according to the law of the Catholic Church the marriage of a Catholic contracted, otherwise than in accordance with its requirements is invalid. The impediment thus created is known as clandestinity. Taken by itself, article 127 would clearly have the effect of giving recognition to this impediment as affecting the civil validity of marriages between Catholics in the province and to do so is, in my opinion, beyond doubt within its purpose.\nApart from the contention that by other facultative statutory provisions every clergyman or minister of religion authorized to keep a marriage register is empowered to solemnize marriage between any man and woman, whatever their religion, with which I shall presently deal, the only objection made at bar to the construction which I have put on article 127 is based upon its collocation. It is asserted that the impediment created by the Tridentine Decree concerns merely the qualification of the person before whom marriage is to be solemnized. Upon that assumption it is argued that this cannot be one of the \u201cother impediments\u201d referred to in an article which is found in a chapter devoted to impediments and conditions that affect the capacity of the parties to the marriage; that the \u201cother impediments\u201d covered by article 127 must, under the rule noscuntur a sociis, be of that character. While this contention would have much force if the assumption on which it is based were unimpeachable, it will be observed that the Tridentine Decree purports not merely to prescribe \u201cthe presence of the parish priest or of the priest who has his permission or that of the Ordinary\u201d as a condition of the validity of the marriage, but that it purports to affect directly the capacity of the parties themselves by declaring them to be \u201comnino inhabiles\u201d\u2014wholly incapable of thus contracting marriage. It professes to create a veritable inhabilitatio personarum. Article 127 C.C. deals with \u201cimpediments recognized according to the different religious persuasions\u201d * * \u201cemp\u00eachements\nadmis d\u2019apr\u00e8s les differentes croyances r\u00e8ligieuses.\u201d In order to give full effect to these words, it seems to me incontrovertible that we must for the purpose of article 127 regard any impediment defined by a religious body as possessing the character which that body declares it to have and as producing the effects which that body ascribes to it.\nWhen it is declared by the Catholic Church that Catholics are incapable of contracting marriage except in the presence of the parish priest, or of the priest who has his permission or that of the ordinary, the expressed intention of the church is to attach a personal incapacity to the parties. If the impediment thus created is to be accepted as it is \u201crecognized by the religious persuasion\u201d and as \u201csubject to the rules of the church\u201d it follows that it is properly included under article 127 CO. as an impediment which affects the capacity of Catholics to contract marriage.\nBy the Benedictine Declaration, originally published in 1741, for. \u201cthose places subject to the sway of the Allied Powers in Belgium\u201d and the Town of Maestricht, and subsequently extended to the Church of Canada and Quebec, as appears by the replies given by the Holy Council of the Propaganda under Clement XIII., in the year 1764, to the vicars of the Diocese of Quebec, and published in 1865 by Mgr. Baillargeon, administrator of that diocese, it is provided that:\u2014\nIn regard to those marriages which * * * are contracted without the form established by the Council of Trent, by Catholics with heretics, wherever a Catholic man marry a heretic woman or a Catholic woman marry a heretic man * * * if perchance a marriage of this kind be actually contracted there wherein the Tridentine form has not been observed, or in the future (which may God avert) should happen to be contracted, His Holiness declares that such a marriage, if no other canonical impediments occur, is to be deemed valid, and that neither one of the persons in any way can, under pretext of the said form not having been observed, enter upon a new marriage while the other person is still alive.\nMarriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic was, therefore, exempted by the Benedictine Declaration from the operation of the decree of the Council of Trent and the impediment which would otherwise have affected at least the Catholic party to such a marriage was thus removed.\nSuch, according to the documents submitted to us, was the law of the Catholic Church on this subject at the time when the Civil Code of Lower Canada was enacted. It was conceded at bar by counsel instructed by the Dominion Government to support an affirmative answer to the second question that the presence of the word \u201chitherto\u201d in article 127 precludes the inclusion within it of impediments created or revived by any subsequent laws or decrees of any religious body and that, in the absence of other recognition by the legislature, the recent papal decree known as \u201cNe Temere\u201d does not affect the civil validity of marriages contracted in that province. Although its meaning would perhaps have been clearer had the word \u201chitherto\u201d preceded the word \u201crecognized\u201d I think that article 127 fairly read may be given the construction which Mr. Mignault put upon it and which he stated has been universally taken to be correct.\nBy article 156 C.C. it is provided that:\u2014\n156. Every marriage which has not been contracted openly, nor solemnized before a competent officer, may be contested by the parties themselves and by all those who have an existing and actual interest, saving the right of the court to decide according to the circumstances.\nHaving regard to the terms of the Act providing for the codification of the laws of Lower Canada, which directs the commissioners in every case to express the existing law and where they should think proper to suggest an amendment to indicate the same as a suggestion, and to the report of the codifiers which, upon a question as to the purpose of such a provision as that contained in article 156, must, in view of their instructions, be entitled to very great weight[103], there can be no doubt that this article was intended to express the existing law as to the consequences of clandestinity in the solemnization of marriage. As a guide to its interpretation, we are referred by the codifiers to Pothier on Marriage, Nos. 361, 362 and 451. The authority of Pothier as an exponent of the Civil Law of France, which prevailed in Lower Canada prior to 1866, as I shall presently have occasion to shew, is so conclusive that other reference seems unnecessary.\nIn No. 361, Pothier declares that the penalty of parties who have had their marriage celebrated by an incompetent priest is the nullity of their marriage. In No. 362, he adds that the nullity of marriages celebrated by an incompetent priest is not merely relative but is absolute and can be cured only by a new celebration of marriage by the cur\u00e9 of the parties or with his permission or that of the Bishop He refers to certain cases in which, after public and long continued cohabitation, the courts have refused to hear parties who sought to have their marriages avoided on the pretext that they had been celebrated by incompetent priests. The explanation of the judgments in these cases is not, he adds, that the marriage celebrated by an incompetent priest can ever be valid, or that the vice which attaches to it can be purged by any lapse of time, but that having regard to the circumstances of the cases the applicants were unworthy of being heard and that it should be presumed that the law had been observed and that the priest who had celebrated the marriage had received the permission of the cur\u00e9. He further says in No. 363 that:\u2014\nThe celebration of marriage in the face of the church by the proper cur\u00e9 is not a matter of pure form; it is an obligation which our laws impose on parties who wish to contract marriage from which the parties subject to it cannot withdraw themselves.\nThe intention having been to reproduce the existing law, we find in this text of Pothier the explanation of the purpose and extent of the discretion which the concluding words of article 156 reserved to the courts. No doubt is thereby cast on the absolute nullity of the marriage not solemnized before a competent officer, which is declared in the same terms and may be asserted by the same class of persons as is provided in the case of the nullity of incestuous marriages. (Vide article 152).\nBut, although the impediment to the marriage of Catholics otherwise than in accordance with its requirements created by the Tridentine Decree should, because that decree so defines its operation be deemed to affect the capacity of Catholics to contract marriage for the purpose of its inclusion within article 127 C.C., it nevertheless has to do directly with the solemnization of marriage, and the right to impose or to remove it as a condition of the civil validity of marriage rests exclusively with the provincial Legislatures for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies in dealing with the first question. To summarize:\u2014 According to the law of the Catholic Church, the marriage of two Catholics solemnized otherwise than as prescribed by the Tridentine Decree is void. That impediment of the church law is recognized and adopted by article 127 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, and provision is expressly made for judicicially establishing such nullity (article 156). By reason of the exempting clauses of the Benedictine Declaration the marriage of a Catholic with a non-Catholic is not subject to this condition under the civil law.\nA careful analysis of other provisions of the Civil Code in the light of the history of the civil law of Lower Canada leads to the same conclusion independently of any recognition or adoption of the law of the Catholic Church in regard to marriage. This aspect of the question is fully considered by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[104] and by Mr. Justice Lemieux, sitting in the Court of Review, in Durocher v. Degr\u00e9[105]. I shall not do more than outline my views upon it.\nBy article 40 of the Ordinance of Blois (1579), provision was made for the publication of banns, the public celebration of marriage in the presence of four witnesses and the registration of the same \u2014 the whole subject to the penalties decreed by the church councils. By article 12 of the Edict of Henry IV., (1606), it was ordained that marriages not entered into and celebrated in the church and With the form and solemnity required by article 40 of the Ordinance of Blois be declared void by the ecclesiastical judges.\nBy the Declaration of Louis XIII. (1639), which directed that the Ordinance of Blois should be strictly observed, and interpreted it, it was ordained that proclamation of banns should be made by the cur\u00e9 of each of the contracting parties and that at the celebration of the marriage four trustworthy witnesses should assist,\nbesides the cur\u00e9, who shall receive the consent of the parties and shall join them in marriage according to the form practised in the church.\nAll priests were expressly forbidden to celebrate any marriage except between their true and ordinary parishioners without the written permission of the cur\u00e9s of the parties or of the diocesan bishop; and it was further ordained that a good and faithful register should be kept of the marriages as well as of the publication of banns, or of dispensations and permissions which should have been granted. Pothier in his Treatise on Marriage, says:\u2014\nIt is necessary for the validity of a marriage not only that it shall be celebrated in the face of the church but also that the priest who has celebrated it shall be competent (No. 354). The priest competent for the celebration of marriages is the cur\u00e9 of the parties. The cur\u00e9 of the parties is the cur\u00e9 of the place where they have their ordinary residence (No. 355). Every other priest who has not the permission either of the bishop or of the cur\u00e9 of the parties is incompetent to celebrate it. This is what results from the declaration of 1639 which, after having ordained that the cur\u00e9 must receive the consent of the parties adds: \u201cAll priests are forbidden to marry other persons than their true parishioners, without the written permission of the cures of the parties or of the bishop. (No. 360.)\u201d The presence of the cur\u00e9 required by our laws for the validity of marriages is not purely a passive presence; it is an act and a ministration of the eur\u00e9, who must receive the consent of the parties and give the nuptial benediction. That results from the terms of the declaration of 1639, where it is said that the cur\u00e9 will receive the consent of the parties, and will join them in marriage, following the form practised in the church. (No. 350).\nSee the opinion of Mr. Justice Willes advising the House of Lords in Beamish v. Beamish[106].\nEnacted before the establishment of the Superior Council in Canada in 1663, the \u201cOrdinance of Blois,\u201d the \u201cEdict of Henry IV.,\u201d and the \u201cDeclaration of Louis XIII\u201d were each proprio vigore in force in Quebec prior to and at the time of the conquest.\nBy subsequent ordinances of the French Kings, notably that of April, 1667, and that of April, 1736, further provision was made for the keeping of registers in all parish churches and for their form and the entries to be made therein.\nWhile there has been some controversy as to the effect upon the foregoing laws of the articles of capitulation of the cities of Quebec and Montreal and of the Treaty of Paris (1763), the great weight of authority supports the view that they remained in force after the cession of Canada to Great Britain. See Stuart v. Bowman[107]; Wilcox v. Wilcox[108].\nThe Anglican Church was not introduced into Canada as an established church. The exclusive authority of Catholic parish priests to celebrate marriage would, however, be held not to extend to the new Protestant inhabitants of Canada and the right of clergymen of the Anglican Church to solemnize marriage between them would be deemed to have been introduced without express legislation as a result of the acquisition of the country by Great Britain. In my opinion, the Anglican clergy after the conquest also shared with the Catholic priests the right under the civil law to solemnize the marriages of Protestants with Catholics, although the validity of such marriages if not solemnized before the Catholic cur\u00e9, under the law of the Catholic Church dates only from 1764. This seems to me to be the necessary result of the situation as recognized by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Brown v. Les Cur\u00e9, etc., de Notre Dame de Montr\u00e9al\u2014(The \u201cGuibord Case\u201d)[109], and of the doctrine enunciated in Long v. The Bishop of Cape Town[110].\nThe Church of England, in places where there is no church established by law, is in the same situation with any other religious body \u2014 in no better, but in no worse, position.\nWhile British settlers in British colonies and in conquered and ceded territory are themselves entitled to the benefit of their own marriage laws, and are unaffected in this respect by the laws of the country (Lautour v. Teesdale[111], the latter, nevertheless, as part of the private law. (Salmond on Jurisprudence, p. 484; Holland on Jurisprudence, p. 168), govern the inhabitants until altered by the competent jurisdiction of the new sovereignty. Halleck on International Law (4th ed.) Vol. 2, p. 516; Blackstone (Lewis ed. 1902) vol. 1, pp. 107-8.\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the instructions given to the Governors between 1763 and 1774 are invoked in support of the contention that during this period the English common law was in force in Canada. I am unable to accept this view. (See Chief Justice Hey\u2019s Report, 1 L.C. Jurist, Appendix.) But whether it be or be not well founded, by the Quebec Act passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1774, it is expressly enacted (s. 4) that the:\u2014\nProclamation (of the 7th October, 1763) so far as the same relates to the said Province of Quebec, and the Commission under the authority whereof the Government of the said province is at present administered and all and every the Ordinance and Ordinances made by the Governor-in-Council of Quebec for the time being relative to the civil government and the administration of justice in the said province * * * be and the same are hereby revoked, annulled and made void from and after the first day of May, 1775.\nSections 5 and 8 of the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d are as follows\u2014\n5. And for the more perfect security and ease of the minds of the inhabitants of the said province, it is hereby declared that His Majesty\u2019s subjects professing the religion of the Church of Rome, of and in the said Province of Quebec, may have and hold the free exercise of the religion of the Church of Rome subject to the King\u2019s supremacy, declared and established by an Act made in the first year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth over all the dominions and countries which then did, or thereafter should, belong to the Imperial Crown of this realm; and that the clergy of the said church may hold, receive, and enjoy their accustomed dues and rights with respect to such persons only as shall profess the said religion.\n8. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all His Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects within the Province of Quebec, the religious orders and communities only excepted, may also hold and enjoy their property and possessions, together with all customs and usages relative thereto, and all others their civil rights, in as large, ample, and beneficial manner as if the said Proclamation, Commissions, Ordinances and other Acts and Instruments had not been made, and as may consist with their allegiance to His Majesty, and subjection to the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain, and that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights, resort shall be had to the laws of Canada as the rule for the decision of the same; and all causes that shall hereafter be instituted in any of the courts of justice to be appointed within and for the said province by His Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall with, respect to such property and rights be determined agreably to the said laws and customs of Canada, until they shall be varied or altered by any Ordinance that shall from time to time be passed in the said province by the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor or Commander-in-Chief for the time being, by and with the advice and consent of the legislative council of the same, to be appointed in manner hereinafter mentioned.\nNo new provisions had been made for the keeping of the registers of baptisms, deaths and marriages in Canada between the date of the cession and the year 1795, when the statute 35 Geo. III., ch. 4 (L.C.) was passed. In section 1 it enacts:\u2014\nThat from and after the first day of January, which will be in the year subsequent to the passing of this Act, in each parish church of the Roman Catholic communion, and also in each of the Protestant churches or congregations within this province, there shall be kept by the rector, curate, vicar, or other priest or minister doing the parochial or clerical duty thereof two registers of the same tenor, each of which shall be reputed authentic, and shall be equally considered as legal evidence in all courts of justice, in each of which the said rector, curate, vicar or other priest or minister, doing the parochial or clerical duty of such parish or such Protestant church or congregation, shall be held to enregister regularly and successively all baptisms, marriages and burials so soon as the same shall have been by them performed.\nSection 10 declares that certain registers of the Protestant congregation of Christ Church, Montreal, shall\nhave the same force and effect to all intents and purposes as if the same had been kept according to the rules and forms prescribed by the law of the province.\nSection 11 contains a similar provision in regard to other defective registers; and section 15 of the same statute is as follows:\u2014\n15. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that so much of the twentieth title of an Ordinance passed by his most Christian Majesty, in the month of April, in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-seven, and of a declaration of his most Christian Majesty of the ninth of April, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-six, which relates to the form and manner in which the registers of baptisms, marriages and burials are to be numbered, authenticated or paraph\u00e9, kept and deposited and the penalties thereby imposed on persons refusing or neglecting to conform to the provisions of said Ordinance and declaration, are hereby repealed, so far as relates to the said registers only.\nIn view of these statutory provisions it would seem incontrovertible that the French law as it existed at the time of the conquest had continued in force in regard to the keeping of marriage registers. Chief Justice Sewell, in Ex parte Spratte[112], decided in 1816, says:\u2014\nThe British statute, 14 Geo. III., ch. 83, commonly called the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d declared the law of Canada, as it stood at the conquest, to be the rule of decision in all matters of controversy and civil rights.\nHe adds, at page 96, that:\u2014\nThe right of keeping a register of baptisms, marriages and sepultures, with the power of rendering the entries thus made actes authentiques, or records, which by the twentieth title of the Edict of 1667 was at the conquest vested in the then parish priests of Canada was, by law, considered to be so vested in them not by reason of their spiritual or ecclesiastical character but because they were by law the acknowledged public officers of the temporal government * * * Under the Ordinance of 1667, which was the law antecedent\u2019 to the statute 35 Geo. III. ch. 4, the keeping of registers was entrusted to the cur\u00e9s of the Catholic Church and to their successors in office and to such only; and the cur\u00e9s were vested with this authority as priests in holy orders recognized to be such by law and as public officers in their respective stations. The late provincial statute (1795) does not change the character or qualifications of the persons to whom the keeping of registers is now to be entrusted. It extends the power of keeping registers to Protestant ministers but still requires that all persons keeping registers, whether Catholics or Protestants, shall be priests in holy orders recognized to be such by law and to be competent officers in their respective stations * * * In conformity to this general declaration and to the Ordinance of 1667, the fourth section of the Statute also especially enacts \u201cthat every marriage shall be signed in both registers by the clergyman celebrating the marriage\u201d who must necessarily be a priest in holy orders recognized to be such by law, since by the law of Canada a marriage can only be celebrated by such a character.\nThe learned Chief Justice, of whom Mr. Justice Lemieux rightly observed that he\nhas left a great name in the jurisprudence contemporaneous with \u201cthe events which followed the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d\nclearly considered that in Canada, from the time of the conquest, Catholic priests and clergymen of the Church of England were recognized by law as equally entitled to solemnize and to keep registers of marriage, the former for Catholics and the latter for Protestants, and that the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d was declaratory of this right, which was further recognized by the provincial Act of 1795.\nWhen we find that down to 1866, when the Civil Code was enacted, there is no trace of any other civil authority for the solemnization of marriage by Catholic priests and that their right to solemnize marriage and to keep registers of civil status prior to that time has never been questioned, and when we find that right recognized in the Civil Code as something unquestionably existing, the conclusion seems to be inevitable that, as a result of the reservation in the articles of capitulation of their rights and privileges, and the free exercise of their religion to the inhabitants of Quebec and Montreal, the assurances in section 5 of the \u201cQuebec Act\u201d to the clergy of the Catholic Church that they should \u201chold, receive and enjoy their accustomed dues and rights with respect to such persons only as shall profess the said (Catholic) religion,\u201d the provision of section 8 that His Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects within the Province of Quebec should hold and enjoy all their civil rights, and the continuation of the laws of Canada as the rule for the decision of all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights \u2014 the respective rights of the Catholic clergy and laity inter se as they existed at the time of the cession in regard to marriage were preserved.\nThe French law, so far as it could be applied, governed the keeping of registers by the Anglican clergymen, as the Act of 1795 establishes.\nThe criminal law of England was, by the Quebec Act, expressly declared to be the law of the province. Commercial and maritime laws of England were subsequently specially introduced. But in all matters of \u201ccivil rights\u201d the law of Canada, as it stood at the conquest, was declared to be and remained \u201cthe rule of decision.\u201d Whether marriage in Quebec should be regarded in the civil courts as a civil contract, or, as would seem to be the better opinion, should be deemed a religious contract producing civil effects, it is for all civil purposes governed by the civil law, and, in view of the foregoing provisions, there can be no reasonable doubt that that law in Lower Canada has been since the conquest, as is declared by Chief Justice Sewell, the civil law which was in force at the time of the conquest. In Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons (1), Sir Montague Smith in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, at pp. 110-111, said:\u2014\nthe law which governs civil rights in Quebec is in the main the French law as it existed at the time of the cession of Canada and not the English law which prevails in the other provinces * * *\nIt is to be observed that the same words \u201ccivil rights\u201d are employed in the Act of 14 Geo. III. ch. 83, which made provision for the government of the Province of Quebec. Section 8 of that Act enacted (1)7 App. Cas. 96. that Mis Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects within the Province of Quebec should enjoy their property, usages, and other civil rights, as they had before done, and that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort should be had to the laws of Canada, and be determined agreeably to the said laws. In this statute the words \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201ccivil rights\u201d are plainly used in their largest sense.\nUnder the civil law of Quebec at and after the conquest the marriage of two Catholics could only take place in the presence of the cur\u00e9 of the contracting parties or of a priest authorized by him or by the bishop, and all priests were forbidden without such permission to celebrate any marriage other than between their true and ordinary parishioners. (Declaration of Louis XIII., 1639.)\nIn 1804 and again in 1821 statutes were passed validating marriages which had been theretofore solemnized before Protestant dissenting ministers and justices of the peace. In each of these Acts it is expressly provided that they shall not extend to any future marriages.\nAs is very clearly pointed out by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[113], the Act of 1827, authorizing clergymen of the Church of Scotland to keep marriage registers and to solemnize marriages, and the subsequent Acts authorizing the ministers of various dissenting bodies to keep registers of baptisms, marriages and burials were all procured, not with a view of affecting the position and rights of the Catholic Church and its clergy and laity, but because of the opinion maintained by Chief Justice Sewell, and generally asserted by the Anglican body that clergymen of that church were alone competent to marry Protestants. The purpose of the legislation would appear to have been to relieve dissenting Protestant bodies from that disability by giving to the ministers of those denominations the legal right to keep registers and to solemnize marriage primarily if not solely for the purposes of their respective congregations.\nIn 1860 these Acts were consolidated in chapter 20 of the Revised Statutes of Lower Canada. Sections 16 and 17 of that Act are as follows:\u2014\n16. The Protestant churches or congregations intended in the first section of this Act, are all churches and congregations in communion with the United Church of England and Ireland or with the Church of Scotland, and all regularly ordained priests and ministers of either of the said churches have had and shall have authority validly to solemnize marriage in Lower Canada, and are and shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act. 35 Geo. III., ch. 4; 7 Geo. IV., ch. 2, sec. 2.\n17. This Act extends also to the several religious communities and denominations in Lower Canada, mentioned in this section, and to the priests or ministers thereof, who may validly solemnize marriage, and may obtain and keep registers under this Act, subject to the provisions of the Acts mentioned with reference to each of them respectively, and to all the requirements, penalties and provisions of this Act, as if the said communities and denominations were named in the first section of this Act.\nThere follows a list of the various dissenting bodies which had obtained special statutes.\nI read these provisions as declaratory of the right of the ministers of the several religious bodies therein named (Anglican, Scotch and Dissenting) to solemnize within the limits of the territory for which they are authorized to keep registers, all marriages (subject to article 63 C.C. and to the special limitation in the case of Quakers imposed by 23 Vict. ch. 11) except those which the law by other provisions renders them incompetent to solemnize. This, in my opinion, meets the objection so much insisted on at bar that, if the argument presented by Mr. Mignault should prevail, there would be no provision in the Quebec law for the solemnization of marriages between dissenting Protestants of different religious beliefs or for the marriage of infidels or pagans, or of persons attached to no particular religious denomination.\nWith matters in this position, the legislature appointed the Commission for the codification of the civil law with instructions to express in the Code the existing law. The report of these commissioners upon the portion of the Civil Code which deals with the subject of marriage contains the following passages:\u2014\nWith the object of preserving to everybody the enjoyment of his own usages and practices according to which the celebration of marriage is entrusted to the ministers of the worship to which he belongs several provisions are inserted in this title which although new in form nevertheless have their source and raison d\u2019\u00eatre in the spirit, if not in the letter, of our legislation. * * * Since a change such as that operated by the Code Napoleon, which has secularized marriage and has entrusted the celebration of it as well as the keeping of the registers to officers of a purely civil character without any intervention being required on the part of religious authorities, seems in no wise desirable in this country it has become necessary to renounce the idea of establishing here in regard to the formalities of marriage uniform and detailed rules.\nThe majority of the Commissioners thus express their opinion:\u2014\nThe publicity required by the first part of article 128 is with the object of preventing clandestine marriages which are with good reason condemned by every system of law. An Act so important which interests many others besides the parties themselves should not be kept secret and the best method of preventing that happening is to render obligatory the publicity of the celebration. The word \u201copenly\u201d (publiquement) has a certain elasticity which makes it preferable to any other; being susceptible of a greater or less extension it has been employed in order that it may lend itself to the different interpretations which the different churches and religious congregations in the province require to give it according to their customs and usages and the rules which are peculiar to them from which it is desired in no way to derogate. All that has been sought is to prevent clandestine marriages. Thus, those marriages which shall have been celebrated in an open manner and in the place where they are ordinarily celebrated according to the usages of the church to which the parties belong are reputed to have taken place openly (publiquement).\nTaking up the Code and reading it, as it must be read, in the light of the foregoing facts, we find the following provisions which call for consideration in dealing with the question submitted:\u2014\n128. Marriages must be solemnized openly, by a competent officer recognized by law.\nThis is the fundamental provision designed to prevent clandestinity.\nOf almost equal importance, having the same object, and being the natural sequence of the provisions enacted for the same purpose, regarding the publication of banns in the church or churches to which the parties belong (articles 130-3 and 57-8 C.C.) is article 63, which says:\u2014\n63. The marriage is solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or other of the parties. If solemnized elsewhere, the person officiating is obliged to verify and ascertain the identity of the parties.\nThe latter sentence obviously provides for such exceptional cases as those of persons having no fixed residence (vagi) or no residence in the province. The form in which the article is expressed would be inexplicable if it were not thereby intended to prescribe that as a general rule marriage must take place at the domicile of one of the parties. I see no reason why this provision should not apply to Protestants as well as Catholics. The policy which underlies it so requires. \u201cDomicile\u201d in this article means place of residence[114], and, in the case of Catholics, and probably of Anglicans, who have parochial organization, it means the parish in which the parties, or one of them resides. In the case of a person belonging to a religious body having neither parochial organization nor its equivalent, or of a person belonging to no church, domicile would probably mean the municipality in which he resides. The Catholic parish in Quebec is legally recognized. See R.S.Q., 1909, arts. 4296 et seq. it is in the parish church, private chapel, or mission, and for the territory attached to it that the registers are kept (article 42 C.C.). It is the proper cur\u00e9 of the parties, i.e., the parish priest, who is authorized to solemnize the marriage. It is at the church and within the territory for which he is authorized to keep registers that he is empowered to officiate. While in country places the parish and the municipality are coterminous, such cities as Montreal and Quebec are divided into many parishes of which the territorial limits are well defined, and only within them is the cur\u00e9 authorized to discharge his functions and to exercise his rights as parish priest. Every consideration points to his parish being for the purpose of article 63 the domicile of the Catholic at all events.\nPublication of banns in the church to which the parties belong, marriage at the domicile and solemnization by a competent officer are the great safeguards provided by the Code against clandestinity. In all countries where the civil law prevails, territorial limitation of the jurisdiction to solemnize marriage appears to have been established for that purpose \u2014 a policy inspired, no doubt, by the Tridentine Decree.\nTo further ensure obedience to the legal prohibitions in respect to consanguinity, pre-contract and minority, the non-observance of which clandestinity too often serves to cloak, the Code has provided (articles 136 et seq.) for formal oppositions being made to marriages by interested persons. The efficacy of these provisions depends upon the restrictions imposed as to the place, time and publicity of solemnization by the articles to which allusion has just been made. Article 1107 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which must be read with the provisions of the Civil Code (article 144 C.C.) requires that the opposition shall be served \u201cupon the functionary called upon to solemnize the marriage,\u2019 and article 61 C.C. directs that the disallowance of an opposition shall be \u201cnotified to the officer charged with, the solemnization of the marriage.\u201d (See also article 1109 C.P.Q.) By article 65 C.C. the \u201cAct of Marriage\u201d which the celebrant is required to prepare and sign, must inter alia state \u201cthat there has been no opposition or that any opposition has been disallowed.\u201d These provisions accord only with the view that in the ordinary case and as a general rule there must be some one, or at most two defined and ascertainable functionaries charged with the celebration of a marriage and that the jurisdiction of the competent officer mentioned in article 128 is necessarily territorially restricted as indicated in article 63; and that is the only logical outcome of the provisions of articles 130 et seq. The purpose of such provisions and their efficacy to attain the object sought by the Legislature \u2014 the prevention of clandestine marriages, incestuous marriages, bigamous marriages and marriages between minors without the consent of parents \u2014 are well stated by Mr. Justice Lemieux in Durocher v. Degr\u00e9[115], at pp. 488 et seq. To hold, as is maintained by those who contend for a negative answer to both branches of the second question, that every officer authorized to keep a marriage register is competent to solemnize the marriage of any two persons who come before him, whatever their residence and whatever their religion, provided only they produce to him a license from the Crown, is to destroy at once and completely all the elaborate safeguards which the Legislature has provided to prevent those manifest evils. As put by Mr. Justice Lemieux:\u2014\nCan it be supposed for an instant that the codifiers, after having ordained the publication of marriage (a) in the church of the parties; (b) before a public officer belonging to the worship of the parties; (c) by their cur\u00e9s; (d) and after having left to the religious authorities to whom the parties are subject the discretion of granting or of refusing the dispensation of such publication would, after providing for all this series of formalities to be carried out by the cur\u00e9 and the religious authorities in the church of the parties, have left persons after all free to contract marriage before no matter what minister and of a different religion. The idea seems to us neither reasonable nor probable.\nArticles 42, 44 and 45 now call for attention:\u2014\n42. Acts of civil status are inscribed in two registers of the same tenor, kept for each Roman Catholic parish church, private chapel or mission, and for each Protestant church or congregation or other religious community, entitled by law to keep such registers, each of which is authentic, and has in law equal authority.\n44. The registers are kept by the rector, curate, priest, or minister having charge of the churches, congregations, or religious communities or by any other officer entitled so to do.\nIn the case of Roman Catholic churches, private chapels or missions, they are kept by any priest authorized by competent ecclesiastical authority to celebrate marriages or administer baptism and perform the rites of burial.\n45. In the case of Roman Catholic churches, private chapels or missions, the register must be granted under the name mentioned in the certificate of authorization by the bishop, the ordinary of the diocese, the vicar general, or the administrator; and the priest on presenting the register for authentication must exhibit the certificate of authorization.\nIn these articles the Code expressly recognizes the power of the Catholic bishop to appoint priests for the solemnization of marriage and to confer upon them the requisite authority. Their right to keep civil registers is made to depend upon this authorization of the bishop and their competence to solemnize marriage for civil purposes is in turn made to depend upon their being so authorized to keep registers. (Article 129.)\nThis latter, article, which reads as follows,\n129. All priests, rectors, ministers and other officers authorized by law to keep registers of acts of civil status, are competent to solemnize marriage.\nBut none of the officers thus authorized can be compelled to solemnize a marriage to which any impediment exists according to the doctrine and belief of his religion and the discipline of the church to which he belongs,\nis the sheet-anchor of those who contend that every officer authorized to keep a marriage register is competent to solemnize any and every marriage. It is, on its face, not a facultative provision. It is declaratory of a legal competence already existing \u2014 which in the case of ministers of dissenting bodies had been conferred by the statutes consolidated in the C.S.L.C., 1860, ch. 20, and by subsequent similar acts. It is necessarily general in its terms. It must, as must\u2019 every provision of the Code, be read with the other articles and be so construed that their efficacy shall not be destroyed. It is consistent with the limitations which the provisions above discussed necessarily entail. Having regard to the facts that solemnization by their proper cur\u00e9 or by a priest acting with his authority or that of the ordinary, was an essential condition of the validity of marriage by the civil law of Canada at the time of the conquest, that this continued to be the law in respect to Catholics after the conquest, that the instructions to the codifiers were to express the existing law, that in their report they say their object has been to preserve to everybody\nthe enjoyment of his customs and practices according to which the celebration of marriage is entrusted to the ministers of the worship to which he belongs,\nand that they inserted numerous provisions in the Code compatible only with that intention, I have not the slightest doubt that, upon a proper construction, article 129 cannot be read as conferring the general and indiscriminate power to solemnize marriage which Mr. Lafleur felt compelled to contend for and which would inevitably entail upon the province the very evils which the whole tenor of its enactments in regard to marriage makes it clear it was the purpose of the Legislature of Quebec to obviate.\nI am of the opinion that under the various provisions of the Civil Code, quite apart from any impediment created by the laws of the Catholic Church, it is essential to the validity of the marriage of two Catholics in the Province of Quebec that the celebrant should be the parish priest of one or other of them or a priest acting with his permission or with that of the bishop. Since the marriage may be solemnized at the domicile of either party (article 63) this requirement of the civil law seems to be inapplicable to the marriage of a Catholic with a non-Catholic. The effect of the other articles of the Civil Code relating to marriage, which reproduced the provisions of the civil law as it stood at the conquest with some subsequent legislative modifications, therefore harmonizes with that of article 127 C.C., which recognizes and adopts for Catholics the law of the Catholic Church as it stood in 1866 in regard to impediments to marriage other than those enumerated in the preceding articles of the first chapter of the title on marriage. On no other construction of the various articles of the Code dealing with marriage can the obvious policy of the legislature be carried out or can due effect be given to them all. This conclusion is in accord with the great weight of the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec. In addition to Laram\u00e9e v. Evans[116], and Durocher v. Degr\u00e9[117], already cited, I may refer to Globenslcy v. Wilson[118]; Vaillancourt v. Lafontaine[119]; and Valade v. Cousineau[120].\nAgainst the view supported by these authorities there are only the decisions of two judges of first instance\u2014one in Delpit v. Cot\u00e9[121], in effect overruled within two months by the Court of Review in Durocher v. Degr\u00e9114, and the other in H\u00e9bert v. Clou\u00e2tre[122].\nThe effect of the provisions of the statutes and of the Code in regard to marriage licenses must still be considered. Although addressed \u201cto any Protestant minister of the Gospel,\u201d the license does not confer upon him the power or authority to solemnize marriage. (Articles 128 and 129.) That is derived from the law in the case of Protestant clergymen and in the case of Catholic priests from the bishop, whose authorization to solemnize marriage carried with it by law the right to keep marriage registers for civil purposes (articles 44 and 45 C.C.), that right in turn involving the civil competence of the priests so authorized to solemnize marriage. (Article 129 C.C.)\nIn the Catholic Church the bishop has the power to dispense with the publication of banns. The. French law in force in Lower Canada recognized that right for civil purposes, and by articles 59, and 134 C.C. it is continued. The license issued by the Crown is nothing more than a substitute or an equivalent in the case of Protestants for the bishop\u2019s dispensation from the publication of banns, which Catholics must obtain if they wish to be married without such publication, and probably also from the obligation of marriage in the church. It is urged that it also does away with the requirement of marriage at the domicile, but I more than doubt that.\nArticle 57 prescribes that:\u2014\nbefore solemnizing a marriage, the officer who is to perform the ceremony must be furnished with a certificate establishing that the publication of banns required by law has been duly made; unless he has published them himself, in which case such certificate is not necessary.\nBy article 59(a) it is provided that:\u2014\nIn so far as regards the solemnization of marriage by Protestant ministers of the Gospel marriage licenses are issued by the department of the provincial secretary under the hand and seal of the Lientenant-Governor, who, for the purposes thereof, is the competent authority under the preceding article. The issue of a license to a minister to solemnize a projected marriage does not confer on him the requisite power to do so. It is an authority to the minister to be chosen, if he be competent by law, to proceed with the marriage without proof of the publication of banns and probably elsewhere than in his church. If the minister be otherwise incompetent to solemnize the marriage, the license has no greater validating effect upon it than it would have if the parties were legally incompetent to contract marriage. The minister is personally protected from any action or liability for damages by reason of any legal impediment of which he was not aware, article 59 (a); but beyond that the license has no saving force.\nThat marriage licenses issued by the Crown are intended solely for Protestants is made clear by a reference to article 59(a) and to the R.S.Q. (1909), arts. 1494, 1495, 1497, 1498 and 2943. The provisions for licenses are confined to the solemnization of marriage by Protestant ministers and the fees derived from them are by law devoted to Protestant superior education.\nThere is nothing, therefore, in the provisions of the law regarding licenses inconsistent with the view that a marriage between Catholics in the Province of Quebec can be validly solemnized only by the cur\u00e9 of one of the parties or by a priest authorized by him or by the bishop.\nI express no opinion as to what persons should, for civil purposes, be deemed subject as Catholics to the impediment which has been under discussion. That question has not been asked.\nBefore concluding this opinion I think it right to direct attention to the important, but too often overlooked, provisions of articles 163 and 164 of the Civil Code, which are as follows:\u2014\n163. A marriage although declared null, produces civil effects, as well with regard to the husband and wife as with regard to the children if contracted in good faith.\n164. If good faith exist on the part of one of the parties only, the marriage produces civil effects in favour of such party alone and in favour of the children issue of the marriage.\nMy conclusions in regard to the second question are that in the Province of Quebec marriages between persons who are both Catholics solemnized before a Protestant clergyman or minister are civilly invalid; marriages between persons one of whom only is a Catholic, commonly called mixed marriages, which would otherwise be legally binding, are civilly valid whether solemnized before a Catholic or a Protestant clergyman or minister. These results flow from the provisions of the civil law of that province taken by themselves; and also from the law of the Catholic Church, so far as it is given civil effect by article 127 of the Civil Code. The recent decree known as \u201cNe Temere\u201d I understand not to be within article 127 C.C. It has not received any other legislative recognition and has, therefore, no civil effect.\nI would answer the second question submitted, as to clause (a) in the affirmative, and as to clause (b) in the negative.\nI answer the third question in the negative for the reasons which Mr. Justice Davies has assigned in support of the negative answer to the first question.\nAs was so aptly pointed out by Mr. Smith, the special and unique provision made by section 93 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d for federal remedial legislation, intended as a protection to religions minorities in educational matters, precludes the idea, that, in regard to other subjects assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial legislatures any general overriding legislative power is vested in the Dominion Parliament.\nI would, in addition, merely direct attention to the omission of the Province of Quebec from the 94th section of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which provides for Dominion legislation for uniformity in the laws of Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick as to property and civil rights, subject to the approval of the provincial legislatures, as affording another argument of some cogency in support of the negative answer to the third question. \u201cThe Province of Quebec is omitted from this section,\u201d says Sir Montague Smith, speaking for the Privy Council in Citizens\u2019 Insurance Co. v. Parsons[123], \u201cfor the obvious reason that the law which governs property and civil rights is in the main the French law as it existed at the time of the cession of Canada and not the English law which prevails in the other provinces.\u201d\nThere cannot be the slightest doubt that the representatives of Lower Canada insisted that, from the subject of \u201cmarriage,\u201d which, in the original draft of the confederation pact, was given in its entirety to the Dominion Parliament, should be taken out and assigned to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the province, \u201cthe solemnization of marriage,\u201d in order that the complete control of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec over all that appertains to that subject should be assured and that there should be a constitutional guarantee against federal interference with the provisions of its civil law, carefully framed to suit local conditions, in a matter so vital to civil rights.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nThe following announcement was made by the Chief Justice with respect to the Reference:\u2014\nTo both branches of the first question, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Davies, Mr. Justice Duff, and Mr. Justice Anglin answer \u201cNo.\u201d\nThe answer of Mr. Justice Idington is:\u2014\n\u201cIt is an impossible bill as it stands. If I must answer categorically, then I say as follows: The retrospective part would be good as part of a scheme for concurrent legislation by Parliament and Legislatures confirming past marriages which probably neither can effectively do. The prospective part so far as possible to make it an effective prohibition of religious tests may be good, but doubtful, and the probable purpose can be reached by a better bill.\u201d\nTo the second question\u2014the Chief Justice asks permission to decline to answer the first branch of this question, for the reasons given in the attached memorandum. (See p. 335 ante.)\nTo the first branch of the question \u2014 Mr. Justice Davies, Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Duff answer \u201cNo.\u201d To that first branch the answer of Mr. Justice Anglin is \u201cYes.\u201d\nTo the second branch of question No. 2 \u2014 the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Davies, Mr. Justice Idington, Mr. Justice Duff and Mr. Justice Anglin, answer \u201cNo.\u201d To the third question\u2014The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Davies, Mr. Justice Duff and Mr. Justice Anglin answer \u201cNo.\u201d\nMr. Justice Idington\u2019s answer is:\u2014\n\u201cAs to the third question, sub-section (a) I answer \u201cyes\u201d to be concurred in by the respective Legislatures of provinces concerned and as to sub-section (b) I answer \u201cyes\u201d if and when a province fails to provide adequate means of solemnization.\u201d\n* * Affirmed by Privy Council, 29 July, 1912.\n* Affirmed by Privy Council, -29 July, 1912.\n[1] In re References by the Governor-General in Council (43 Can.

Dickson and The Eastern Construction Company, Limited (Defendants) Respondents.\n1911: November 13, 14; 1912: March 21.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMining Act\u2014Grant of mining land\u2014Reservation of pine timber\u2014Right of grantee to cut for special purposes\u2014Trespass\u2014Cutting pine\u2014Right of action.\nThe Ontario Mining Act, R.S.O., [1897] ch. 36 as amended by 62 Vict. ch. 10, sec. 10, provides in sec. 39, sub-sec. 1, that \u201cthe patents for all Crown lands sold or granted as mining lands shall contain a reservation of all pine trees standing or being on the lands, which pine trees shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty, and any person holding a license to cut timber or saw logs on such lands may at all times, during the continuance of the license, enter upon the lands and cut and remove such trees and make all necessary roads for that pur- pose.\u201d By the other provisions of the section, the patentee may cut and use pine required for necessary building, fencing and fuel and other mining purposes and remove and dispose of what is required to clear the land for cultivation, but for any cut except for such building, fencing and other mining purposes he shall pay Crown dues.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that a patentee and a lessee of mining lands who had taken possession thereof, but were not at the time of the trespasses complained of in actual physical possession, have, notwithstanding such reservation, or exception, such possession of the pine trees, or such an interest therein, as would entitle them to maintain actions against a trespasser cutting and removing them from the land. Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips ([1904] A.C. 405) followed; Casselman v. Hersey (32 U.C.Q.B. 333) discussed.\nIn this case the defendants cut and removed the pine timber from plaintiffs\u2019 mining lands without license from the Crown, but claimed that they subsequently acquired the Crown\u2019s title to it and should be regarded as licensees from the beginning.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that assuming that the Crown could after the trees had been cut and removed, take away by its act the plaintiffs\u2019 vested right of action the evidence shewed that defendants were cutting on adjoining Crown land as well as on plaintiffs\u2019 locations and did not clearly establish that any title acquired by defendants included what was cut on the latter.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs are patentees of mining locations in the Rainy River District under letters patent from the Ontario Government. By the \u201cOntario Mining Act\u201d the pine timber on the location is excepted from the grant and remains Crown property subject to the right of the patentees to use it for certain specified purposes. Any licensee of the Crown may enter on the land and cut and remove it. The plaintiffs at the time this action was begun had not taken physical possession of the mining land. The defendants, The Eastern Construction Co., had a license from the Crown to cut timber on lands adjacent to the locations and contracted with the defendants Miller and Dickson for a supply of railway ties to be delivered at the right-of-way of The National Transcontinental Railway. In carrying out this contract Miller and Dickson cut the pine and other trees on plaintiffs\u2019 location, had them made into ties and removed same from the land. The action was brought for the value of the trees so cut and damages for injury to the land thereby. The facts are more fully stated in the opinions of the judges on this appeal.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs which was reversed by the Court of Appeal in so far as the pine was concerned. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAnglin K.C. and J.A. McIntosh, for the appellants. The patentees brought the statutory right to use the timber for the purposes specified. Gordon v. Moose Mountain Mining Co.[1], and see McLean v. The King[2], at page 546.\nMiller and Dickson cannot rely on a subsequent license from the Crown which would be to permit a wrongdoer to set up in justification permission to deprive the injured party of his vested rights. See Lamb v. Kincaid[3].\nThe Eastern Construction Co. by accepting and paying for the ties became liable for the trespass.\nJ.H. Moss K.C., for the respondents, referred to Freeman v. Rosher[4]; Lewis v. Read[5]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014On the whole, I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised herein is reduced to the narrow point of whether or not the grantee of lands under the \u201cMines Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1897, has such possession in the pine timber on such lands so granted him by the Crown, that he can recover the value thereof when cut and removed from the lands, not only from the actual trespasser, but from those taking under him the fruits of the trespass after the removal, and without the purchaser having any notice or knowledge of such trespass until after the removal.\nI think the question must be answered by the interpretation of section thirty-nine, sub\u2011section 1, of the said Act, which is as follows:\u2014\n(1) The patents for all Crown lands sold as mining lands shall contain a reservation of all pine trees standing or being on the lands, which pine trees shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty, and any person holding a license to cut timber or saw logs on such land may at all times during the continuance of the license enter upon the lands and cut and remove such trees and make all necessary roads for that purpose.\nThe grant is made expressly subject thereto and then the title declared to be qualified\nin this that it is subject to the conditions imposed by the said Act for the purpose of securing the carrying out of mining operations in and upon the said land.\nWhen we turn to section 34 of the Act, we find the title thus qualified is in truth dependent for seven years from the grant upon certain mining developments taking place at the instance of the grantee from year to year notwithstanding the apparently absolute grant, and that in default of that being done, the title may revert to the Crown. He has no more property in the pine trees, or charge of or over them, than if they were growing upon an adjacent lot under such legal conditions that he might by virtue of a covenant from the owner in fee simple in certain contingencies which might or might never happen, have a license to cut and use same for his use in developing his mining interest in the land granted for such purpose, but for no other purpose.\nThe trees having continued the property of the Crown, how can the grantee in any such case assert the right of property claimed here, when the trees have been cut and removed from the land?\nThe appellants as such grantees had neither a legal nor physical possession of the pine trees and hence no basis on which to rest a claim to the ties into which they were cut.\nThey were under no position of responsibility to the Crown to have them protected from the acts of others than themselves.\nTheir sole relation to the pine trees, or the Crown as owner of them, was that upon certain contingencies happening, if the Crown by its license had not in the meantime taken the trees, then they (the appellants) had a license to use them for specified purposes.\nBut when we find they had been removed from the land, cut into ties and are being delivered to the respondent company, how can it be possible by virtue of such a contingent license, to say the appellants had any property in the ties?\nTheir legal position may have entitled them to bring an action for damages against any one without colour of right so changing the condition of things that they could not enjoy that to which they had a legitimate and reasonable expectation of enjoyment, by virtue of their implied license when it had become operative.\nWhatever the form of action it does not appear to me it could ever be trespass. Nor can it be trover. It has been said a bailor can call on a bailee recovering in trover for an account. What right would the Crown have to call on the appellants for the fruits of such an action? The bailor has that right pro tanto his interest in case the bailee makes recovery. But on what legal ground could the Crown here rest such a claim?\nLikewise in the case of lessor and lessee, the latter being liable for waste is responsible therefor, and being answerable to the lessor is the proper party to sue for trespass and to recover full damages.\nThe Crown might sue the trespassers for and recover the value of these trees taken notwithstanding the appellants\u2019 recovery. But how can the trespasser answer the Crown by any such recovery as sought herein?\nIt seems an extraordinary thing if because the appellants have a grant which may terminate, indeed, be abandoned, by reason of necessity for an expenditure upon it far beyond its commensurate value in order to comply with the terms of the grant, they can thus indirectly strip the land of its pine timber and carry away that which may far exceed the minerals in value.\nThis would be to convert that which was intended to convey minerals and preserve timber into a grant to convey timber.\nThe possession of the appellant was, it is said, found by the learned trial judge. Such possession as he had evidence of must be attributable to the title disclosed.\nWhat rights of recovery the bare possessor owing no duty, in relation to the thing trespassed upon, to any one else may have as against a mere trespasser and the measure of damages in such a case are beyond the present inquiry.\nThis is a case where the actual or physical possession clearly goes no further than the legal, and that does not entitle appellants to claim as alleged in the statement of claim that the trees were their property. Nor does it entitle them to follow the trees when cut and converted into a something else.\nAgain, the right of the appellants was subject to be divested by any licensee of the Crown cutting by virtue of his license.\nHow do we know there has not been outstanding such a license?\nThe parties hereto argued as if none existed, but when a something happened in the Crown Lands Office of which we only know part, the appellants say with force, we do not know it all.\nAssume a renewable license outstanding at the date of the grant, what possible right is left in the appellants to claim those ties or their value?\nThe argument, addressed to us, which maintained it was only licenses existent at the date of the grant that the statute had in view, does not meet the possibility I have adverted to.\nNor do I think it meets the point in any aspect. The mining might fail to be of any value to any one and the last possibility of the miners resorting to the timber might disappear; are we to assume that the Crown could not then issue a license to cut these trees reserved as its property?\nSurely no such absurd result was ever contemplated by any one.\nAnd unless we can maintain it was so, this pine timber was liable to be cut at any time by licensees of the Crown.\nBut why labour with it? How can trespass as to these pine trees ever lie on such a title?\nNo case cited, when examined closely, has in truth any but an illusory resemblance to this case, save the case of Casselman v. Hersey[6], which is distinguishable, but I may add, no more binds us than the finding of the learned trial judge which is sought to be restored by virtue of a finding of possession.\nI think the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nThe appeal in the case of Schmidt against the same parties must also fail.\nThey were argued together, being so much alike. I have not found them identical by any means, but the case of the grant is so much stronger in some aspects needless to dwell upon, that having fully examined it I need not say more than that the weaker one fails also.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of two actions which were tried together, in which the appellants claimed reparation from the respondents for damages alleged to be suffered by them in consequence of the cutting and taking away of timber from certain mineral locations. These locations consisted of two sets (each comprising four) one of which, throughout the proceedings referred to under the head of the \u201cNational,\u201d was held by the plaintiffs in the action of the National Trust Co. against Miller, under Crown grants issued pursuant to the \u201cMines Act\u201d of Ontario, sections 26 to 34. The other set, referred to in the proceedings as the \u201cSchmidt\u201d locations, was held by the plaintiffs in the action of Schmidt against Miller under leases granted under the authority of section 35 of the same Act. Of the timber in question all but a very small percentage (less than eight per cent.) consisted of pine which was the property of the Crown, being expressly excepted from the grants and leases referred to. The learned trial judge held the respondents accountable to the appellants for the full value of the pine timber taken from the locations; but on this point his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The substantial question is whether on this point the judgment of the Court of Appeal is right.\nThe material facts are either undisputed or are decided by the findings of the learned trial judge; but in the view I take of the questions arising on the appeal, more especially of some points not raised by the parties themselves, it is necessary to dwell with a little care upon these facts as well as upon the course of the trial and the nature of the case made by the parties there.\nThe trespasses complained of took place in the month of February, 1909. They were actually committed by the defendants Miller and Dickson, who had entered into a contract with the respondents, the Eastern Construction Co., to cut, from a defined area, timber for railway ties, to manufacture this timber into ties, and to deliver the ties at certain places designated on the line of the Northern Trans- continental Railway, then in course of construction. The Eastern Construction Co. had a permit, issued by the Ontario Government under the authority of the \u201cCrown Timber Act,\u201d to cut timber from Crown lands within an area described in the permit, which will be sufficiently designated for my present purpose by saying that the southern boundary of it was Vermilion River\u2014which it may be mentioned is a short river connecting two lakes north-west of Lake Superior, in Rainy River District, at a distance of about 200 miles from Port Arthur. The Eastern Construction Co. had entered into an arrangement with the firm of O\u2019Brien, Fowler & McDougall (who were engaged in constructing part of the Transcontinental Railway under a contract with the Dominion Government), by which the Eastern Construction Co. (who were not themselves engaged in railway building) were to give to the O\u2019Brien firm the use of their permit for a commission of one cent upon each tie manufactured from timber cut upon the permit; and the method by which the arrangement was carried out was that the Eastern Construction Co. engaged Miller and Dickson as contractors to cut the ties required from the area affected by the permit, and to deliver them at the railway line where they were taken possession of by O\u2019Brien, Fowler & McDougall.\nThe appellants\u2019 locations were all situated south of Vermilion River outside the area affected by the permit.\nIn the beginning of February, Miller and Dickson, in circumstances which it will be necessary to refer to more particularly when considering the responsibility of the Eastern Construction Co., began cutting timber south of Vermilion River from Crown lands as well as from the appellants\u2019 locations. On the 24th February, when nearly the whole of the timber cut in the course of these trespasses had been manufactured into ties and delivered, Mr. Margach, the Crown timber agent for the district of Rainy River, then on one of his tours of inspection with Inspector Smith, observed that Miller & Dickson were exceeding the limits of the Eastern Construction Co.\u2019s permit, and ordered them to stop. A few days afterwards Mr. Margach notified Miller & Dickson that they might remove any timber that had been cut. When this permission was given, Mr. Margach was aware of the fact that Miller & Dickson had been cutting on the mineral locations in question, and the permission was intended to apply, and was understood to apply to the Crown timber cut there.\nOn the 26th February Mr. Margach reported Miller & Dickson\u2019s trespasses to the Department of Crown Lands, informing the Department at the same time that the area trespassed upon included the appellants\u2019 locations. On the 6th March he formally notified the Eastern Construction Co. that Miller & Dickson had been trespassing south and east of Vermilion River, that he had ordered them to stop trespassing, but had authorized them to remove what they had cut and to make a separate return of it.\nSome time in April or May, Mr. Alexander McDougall, the managing director of the Eastern Construction Co., interviewed the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Crown Lands, on the subject of the dues to be charged in respect of the government timber affected by these trespasses. According to the government regulations, the government is entitled to charge double dues for timber cut in tres- Pass. In September, Inspector Smith, of the Department, was directed by the Crown timber agent to make an examination and return of the extent of Miller & Dickson\u2019s trespasses, including the trespasses on the mineral locations. Smith\u2019s report was made in September, 1909, and that report was put in at the trial by the appellants, and upon it the learned trial judge based his estimate of the damages to which he found the appellants entitled. In November of the same year the Crown timber agent, by direction of the department, delivered an account to the Eastern Construction Co. for Crown dues on timber cut under the company\u2019s permit, including the Crown timber cut upon the mining locations. The dues so charged for the timber cut in trespass were the ordinary dues payable to the Crown for timber cut under license, in other words, the department treated timber taken by Miller & Dickson from the mining locations as timber lawfully cut under the authority of the department.\nThese facts, as I have already said, are either found by the learned trial judge, or not seriously open to dispute: and on these facts the respondents were held by the learned trial judge to be accountable to the appellants for the full value of the timber taken from the mining locations. The Court of Appeal held on the contrary that as respects the pine timber which was vested in the Crown, the appellants were not entitled to recover.\nBefore examining the respective grounds of these conflicting views, it will be convenient to state what are the rights of the Crown and the appellants respectively in the timber standing on the mining locations. With regard to the granted locations, those rights are defined in section 39 of the \u201cMines Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1897), ch. 360, which is as follows:\u2014 39. (1) The patents for all Crown lands sold as mining lands shall contain a reservation of all pine trees standing or being on the lands, which pine trees shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty, and any person holding a license to cut timber or saw logs on such lands may at all times during the continuance of the license enter upon the lands and cut and remove such trees and make all necessary roads for that purpose.\n(2) The patentees or those claiming under them (except patentees of mining rights hereinafter mentioned) may cut and use such trees as may be necessary for the purpose of building, fencing and fuel on the land so patented, or for any other purpose essential to the working of the mines thereon, and may also cut and dispose of all trees required to be removed in actually clearing the land for cultivation.\n(3) No pine trees, except for the said necessary building, fencing and fuel, or other purpose essential to the working of the mine, shall be cut beyond the limit of such actual clearing; and all pine trees so cut and disposed of, except for the said necessary building, fencing and fuel, or other purpose aforesaid, shall be subject to the payment of the same dues as are at the time payable by the holders of licenses to cut timber or saw logs.\nBy section 40, section 39 is made applicable, with some modification, to locations held under lease. For the purposes of this case the rights of the lessees in respect of timber upon leased locations may be treated as if they rested upon section 39. The effect of the first sub-section is apparently to leave the property in the pine trees in the Crown entirely unaffected by the grant. \u201cThe pine trees shall,\u201d the Act says, \u201ccontinue to be the property of Her Majesty.\u201d The effect of such a provision seems to be that the ownership of the trees is severed from the ownership of the soil, but the quality of the ownership of the trees is not in any degree altered by the grant of the soil. The timber remains vested in the Crown as a corporeal hereditament. A standing tree, (as Chitty L.J. said in Lavery v. Purssell)\nis just as much a hereditament in point of law as a house which is standing on the land and just as much so as the mines which are underneath. I only speak now as a real property lawyer. I am bound of course by English law to say that a tree is not a chattel. There is\nno distinction in point of law between the timber on the land and the mines.\nI am dwelling on this because it appears to me to have an important bearing upon the principal argument addressed to us by Mr. Anglin on behalf of the appellants.\nThe principle (as applicable to the case where the grantor is a subject) seems to be stated by Mr. Leake with his usual accuracy in his book on the Uses and Profits of Land, at p. 30:\u2014\nA grant, or an exception from a grant, of the trees growing in certain land, creates a property in the trees, separate from the property in the soil; but with the right of having them grow and subsist upon it. An estate of inheritance in a tree may thus be created; which would be technically described as a fee conditional upon the life of the tree.\nThe authorities cited by Mr. Challis, at p. 256 of his book on the Law of Real Property, establish beyond question that a determinable fee may be validly limited to a man and his heirs \u201cas long as such a tree shall grow,\u201d or \u201cas long as such a tree stands;\u201d and the reason why such limitations are good is given in Liford\u2019s Case[7], at p. 49(a), and is there said to be\nbecause a man may have an inheritance in the tree itself.\nIt is perfectly true there is authority that where trees are sold under a contract that they shall be removed, the trees may, for certain purposes, be held to be chattels, the land being regarded simply as a warehouse for the timber; and, of course, a grant or reservation of timber may be so framed as to grant or reserve, as the case may be, only a chattel interest in the trees. We are not concerned with such cases. The language of section 39 to which I have adverted makes it impossible, in my judgment, to give any other effect to that section than this, that the property in all pine trees standing on a Crown location granted under the provisions of the \u201cMines Act,\u201d is to remain in the Crown unaffected entirely by the grant of the location, with all the incidents normally attaching by law to such property. It would follow, of course, that, notwithstanding the grant of the location, the Crown would retain all its powers of dealing with the reserved timber and all such powers are exercisable lawfully with respect to such timber as may be exercised in respect of Crown timber growing upon any part of the Crown domain. It is material to add that, in view of the contentions which have been made in this case, in my judgment this timber falls within the scope of section 3 of the \u201cPublic Lands Act\u201d which vests in the Crown Lands Department the\nmanagement and sale of the public lands and forests;\nthat such timber, moreover, is\ntimber on the ungranted lands of the Crown,\nwithin the meaning of sub-section 1, of section 2, of the \u201cCrown Timber Act\u201d; and that consequently, it may be made the subject of licenses granted under that section. It would, I think, be an unwarranted restriction upon these words to confine their application to lands the soil of which remained ungranted. The contention that they ought to be so restricted was made by Mr. Anglin, not with much confidence, I thought, but a moment\u2019s consideration shews that the difficulties in the way of that construction are insuperable. It is obvious that the Legislature is addressing itself, in this phrase, to the question of the Crown\u2019s power of disposition over the timber which is to be the subject of a license granted under these sections. Nobody would argue, for example, that a grant of the minerals would take the land which was the subject of the grant out of the category of \u201cungranted lands\u201d within the meaning of this section, nor do I suppose anybody would argue that lands sold under the provisions of sections 13 and 14 of the \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act\u201d are not, with respect to minerals and timber, \u201cungranted lands\u201d within the terms of the Act. With respect to the minerals reserved as well as with respect to the pine trees re-reserved, such lands are correctly described as ungranted lands. So it seems clear that the lands comprised within a mineral location to which section 39 applies are, with respect to the pine timber \u201cungranted lands.\u201d The grantee of the location holds his location, therefore, subject, as regards the pine timber, to the right of the Department of Crown Lands to deal with that timber in every respect as if it were timber standing upon soil still vested in the Crown. That being so, the provision in the first sub-section of section 39, authorizing the holders of licenses to enter upon locations for the purpose of cutting Crown timber thereon, obviously cannot be restricted to licenses in existence at the time of the grant of the location. Sub-sections 2 and 3, however, confer upon the grantees of locations certain rights in respect of this timber. These rights become exercisable only upon the happening of the statutory conditions, namely, that the timber is required for the purpose of working the mines on the location, or that there has been an actual clearing of the land for the purposes of cultivation, and that it has been necessary to remove the pine trees in the course of such clearing. It is important to observe that there is here no grant of the timber necessary for mining purposes. The right of the mine owner is to take such pine timber as may be necessary for mining purposes, provided that, when it becomes necessary to take it, it is there to be had. The grantee of the location acquires no property in the pine trees in sit\u00fb, no assurance that they will not be removed, no right to object to the removal of them under the authority of the Crown. Until they are appropriated by him, or at all events until the necessity for taking them has arisen, they are absolutely subject to the authority and disposition of the department having the management of the Crown forests. Licenses may be granted in respect of them under the \u201cCrown Timber Act.\u201d If required for a public work, the construction of a government railway, for example, the Crown Lands Department would unquestionably have the power to devote them to such purposes. If they are cut and taken away by a trespasser, the Department has precisely the same discretionary powers of dealing with the trespass as it would have in the case of timber cut from any other part of the Crown domain.\nIt is necessary in order to make my view of the case clearly understood, to observe, before proceeding to examine the validity of the grounds upon which the learned trial judge proceeded, that the appellants did not at the trial rest their claim upon any contention that there had been any interruption of, or interference with, the exercise of their rights to take pine timber for mining purposes.\nIt was not alleged that the appellants were engaged in any mining operations upon any of the locations which required the use of the timber, or that they had any intention of undertaking such operations. As to the locations held in fee, the evidence is perfectly clear; it is admitted by Mr. Shilton himself explicitly that at the time of the trial there never had been \u201cany actual sinking of the shaft or penetration to the rock\u201d; nor any \u201cstraight attempt to develop them and find out what quantity of ore can be found in place.\u201d It is also admitted that there was no intention of working or developing these locations within the near future.\nWith regard to the locations held under lease, it appears that some work was at one time done upon one of them; a cross cut had been made 20 or 30 feet long, 15 deep at one end, and about 8 feet wide at the top. But at the time of the trial no mining operations were in progress or in contemplation. No timber had ever been cut on any of the eight locations for mining purposes.\nThere is another ground upon which one might have expected the appellants to attempt to base their claim to relief if the facts had justified it. The appellants\u2019 right to take the pine timber for mining purposes is a right annexed by the statute to the ownership or other interest held by them in the locations. The acts of the respondents Miller & Dickson have, of course, deprived them of all possibility of exercising this right in respect of the timber which has been removed; and if, as the appellants contend, this was done without lawful justification or excuse, by means of and in course of trespass upon the land, for the benefit of which the right of exercisable, then I should have thought the appellants entitled to reparation to the extent of the loss suffered by them by reason of these wrongful acts. But the measure of that loss is not the value of the trees; obviously it is the value of the contingent right to take the trees. In estimating the value of that right two elements must, of course, be taken into account, first, the probability of the timber ever being required for the purposes for which the statute permits it to be taken, and, secondly, the probability of the timber being permitted by the Department of Crown lands to remain until it should be so required. In estimating the amount of the loss to the appellants which can fairly be said to have been the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of the acts complained of, these two elements must necessarily be considered. We are not at liberty, however, to consider the appellants\u2019 case from this point of view. The appellants in the most explicit way refused to put their claim as a claim to the value of a contingent right; and the learned trial judge refused to consider the points I have just indicated as in any way affecting either the appellants\u2019 right to recover or the extent of the damages to which they should be entitled. Evidence was tendered by the respondents of the practice of the Department in granting licenses to cut timber on locations such as the appellants\u2019 with a view to shewing the precariousness of the appellants\u2019 rights. This evidence was, on the objection of the appellants, rejected as irrelevant. It was, I think, irrelevant in view of the proposition of law on which the appellants based their case. The learned trial judge also treated the probability of the locations being developed to such an extent as to require the use of the timber taken, as irrelevant. I repeat, the appellants\u2019 claim is not, and has not at any stage of the proceedings, been based upon an allegation that they have been interrupted in the exercise of their timber rights, nor have they asked to be compensated for the actual loss they have suffered by reason of being deprived of the possibility of exercising those rights in future in respect of the timber removed.\nThe mode in which the appellants put their case at the trial as well as in the Court of Appeal and in this court was this. They were, they said, in possession of the soil on which the pine timber stood, and consequently in possession of the timber; and notwithstanding the fact that the timber was owned by the Crown and delivered by the Crown officers into the possession of the respondents after it was cut, the respondents are, under the authority of The Winkfield[8], responsible for the full value of what they took away by the trespass. As the learned trial judge puts it at page 201:\u2014\nNevertheless, it seems to me to be clear that there were interests and rights given with the lands to the patentee and to the lessee for mining purposes, and that they were in fact in possession of the whole lands including the timber, and, whatever rights the Crown may have, a mere trespasser has no right to avail himself of the rights of the Crown, that in short, a trespasser is responsible for the whole value of that which he takes away by his trespass, and the damages arising from the injury done to the property by reason of the trespass, and that in this case, the fact of the trespass not being in dispute, the fact of the timber being actually taken away and sold and converted by the defendants not being in dispute, the fact that the plaintiffs were in possession, that they had put improvements upon the lands, that there was a bon\u00e2 fide development of the prospect upon the lands, that they were in possession lawfully and legally, and have the right to be protected from the acts of any trespassers; and the trespassers cannot, I say, rely upon any rights of the Crown in reducing the amount of damages caused by reason of the trespasses which they have committed.\nAs I understand the view of the majority of the court, each step in this course of reasoning is assented to in the judgment of this court, and out of deference to that view, it is I think my duty to examine the two principal propositions upon which it is based.\n1. Were the appellants in possession of the timber in sit\u00fb? It may be noted that there is no suggestion of a possession of the timber de facto. Mr. Shilton candidly admits that the appellants had never cut any pine timber. As to possession (he is a member of the Ontario Bar and solicitor on record for the plaintiffs in the Schmidt case), he said that it was \u201cprobably a question of law\u201d depending upon the statute and the instruments in evidence. As to possession in law then, let us look at the case of the leased locations first; in respect of which the point has been explicitly decided more than once. Where trees are excepted, they are, in the words of Herlakenden\u2019s Case[9],\nsevered from the possession of land during the term.\nIn Liford\u2019s Case[10], it was held that the lessor in such a case \u201chas the young of all birds that breed in the trees.\u201d And in Raymond v. Fitch[11], it was held by the Court of Exchequer that a covenant by the lessee not to cut trees excepted from the demise was purely collateral to the land demised for the reason that\nthe trees being excepted from the demise, the covenant not to fell them is the same as if there had been a covenant not to cut down trees upon an adjoining estate of the lessor (p. 598).\nThe effect of the decisions is stated by Mr. Leake in the work already referred to, at p. 31:\u2014\nA lease of land for life or for years, excepting the trees growing upon the land, leaves the trees in the possession of the lessor, with the right of having them grow in the soil; the trees then are no part of the demised premises, and the fruit or product of the trees presumptively goes with the trees. Consequently the wrongful cutting of the excepted trees by the lessee is technically an act of trespass, being committed upon property which is in the possession of another. But if the lessee wrongfully cut trees included in the lease, it is an act of waste and not a trespass, and the distinction is to be observed in the remedy.\nI am unable to understand for what reason not applicable to the case of the leased locations, the timber on the granted locations could be held to have passed into the possession of the grantees. The possession of the timber I should have thought was just as distinct as that of a seam of coal excepted out of a grant. Indeed, it was frankly admitted by Mr. Anglin, who argued the case on behalf of the appellants, that his contention on the subject of possession would logically result in this, that the grantee in fee of land, under a grant containing an exception of the coal, would acquire by virtue of his grant alone, such a possession of any seams of coal as would entitle him to maintain an action against the under-ground trespasser for the full value of the coal taken, even in a case in which the trespass should be literally confined to the coal bed itself. That I should have thought, with great respect to the majority of the court, who, I understand, accept the contention so advanced, distinctly contrary to all principle. I do not know why the usual rule should not be followed and the scope of the grantee\u2019s possession determined by his right of possession. Low Moor Co. v. Stanley Coal Co.[12] I do not know why an underground trespasser should, in such a case, be held to be a trespasser as against the owner of the surface, any more than a trespasser on the surface should be held to be a tres- passer as against the owner of the coal. Nor, indeed, why in this case a trespasser on the timber should in respect of his acts of trespass on the timber be held to be a trespasser as against the owner of the soil, any more than the trespasser on the soil should be held to be ipso facto a wrongdoer against the owner of the timber. In the case of timber the proprietor of the timber as having the right to some extent to exclude the owner of the soil from the occupation of it, in virtue of his right to have the trees grow upon the soil, would seem rather to be in possession of the soil to the extent of the occupation thus involved. Mr. Anglin relied upon two cases; the case of the Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[13], and that of Casselman v. Hersey[14]. The first case involved no question of the possession of a corporeal hereditament and I cannot understand its application to such a case.\nAs to the second decision. With all respect to the court that decided it, I am unable to follow the view there expressed and acted upon. It is now, however, suggested, and I understand the majority of the court to agree, although the view was not presented on the argument, that a rule was laid down in Casselman v. Hersey13, which, even if erroneous, has, on the principle of stare decisis, become a part of the law of Ontario because that decision has stood unreversed and so far as the reports of decided cases are concerned at all events, unquestioned for a great number of years. I think it is impossible to invoke with any propriety the doctrine of stare decisis in connection with this decision. It is a very wholesome rule where a decision of a superior court has been acted upon for a great many years so that the rule established by it has regulated the transactions of business men or the practice of conveyancers, or the proceedings of courts, that the decision, or rather the rule which has been drawn from it, may properly be treated as constituting a part of the law applicable to such things independently altogether of the question whether or not the decision was originally founded upon satisfactory grounds. That is because in such cases as stated by Thessiger L.J. in Pugh v. Golden Valley Railway Co.[15], at p. 334, the rule may\nfairly be treated as having passed into the category of established and recognized law.\nBut this is a principle which has no possible application to the point now said to have been established by the case in question. There was no dispute in that case, as there is no dispute here, as to the meaning of the exception in the patent. At page 340, Mr. Justice Wilson says:\u2014\nThe trees remained, therefore, notwithstanding the grant, the property of the Crown, and they were so at the time of the cutting and removing of them by the defendant.\nThe right of the Crown to the soil itself on which the trees grew was not excepted; but by reason of the exception, the Crown had the right to the nutriment of the soil sufficient for the growth and preservation of the trees which were excepted.\nSo far as the reciprocal rights of the Crown and the patentee were concerned, the decision is unquestioned, and is obviously right; nobody on this appeal raises any question with regard to that point. The proposition for which it is now sought to invoke the decision as an authority is that possession of the soil carries with it, ipso jure, the possession of the trees, notwithstanding such an exception, to such an extent as to entitle the grantee to sue in trespass for the value of such trees when cut and carried away by a trespasser. That is a point which never could arise except in some litigation between the grantee and a trespasser. I see no ground whatever for holding that, on that point, the decision has become part of the Ontario law. It would be really most extravagant to suppose that the fact of such a point having been determined in favour of the grantee could ever have entered into the calculations of anybody when dealing with lands to which the decision could apply. There is not the slightest evidence that the decision has ever, on this point, been accepted in Ontario. It is not to be found referred to in any text-book. On the point in question, it is not to be found referred to in any reported case, and to me at all events, there is sufficiently convincing evidence of the fact that it has never regulated or affected transactions generally, from the circumstance that neither the Chief Justice of Ontario, nor my brother Idington, nor Mr. Justice Meredith, appears to have been aware that it has ever had any such operation. Then it is said that the decision involved the construction of the \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act\u201d of that time; that that Act has been re-enacted since with no material variation, and that consequently the Legislature must be taken, under a well-known rule of construction, to have adopted and sanctioned the decision. I repeat that the decision in so far as it involved the construction of the exception in the patent and of the statute upon which the exception was based, has no bearing upon any controversy in this appeal. The construction of the statute here is not in dispute. If it be assumed that the construction given to the Act in question in that court has been adopted (which, as I say, is not disputed), the appellants have still to make good the contention on the point of possession. It would be stretching the rule relied upon to an extent not, I think, justified by any decision or by any principle, to hold that the adoption of the views expressed in Casselman v. Hersey[16] as to the meaning of the exception involved the adoption of the views there expressed on the subject of possession. But the truth is that the rule referred to is one which must always be applied in this country with a great deal of caution. Every one knows that statutes are often consolidated and re-enacted without careful reference by the legislature, or by the draughtsman of the statutes, to decisions which the courts may have given upon the construction of the words employed. It was for this reason that, in 1891, the Dominion Parliament passed an Act excluding the rule of construction referred to in the interpretation of Dominion statutes and that enactment was adopted in 1897 in the Province of Ontario, as one of the provisions in the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d included in the Revised Statutes of that year. These are the relevant sections. Section 7, sub-section 1, is as follows:\u2014\n7(1). This section and sections 8 to 12 of this Act and each provision thereof, shall extend and apply to these Revised Statutes of Ontario and to every Act of the Legislature of Ontario, passed after the said Revised Statutes take effect * * *. And section 8, sub-section 57, is in these words:\u2014\n57. The Legislature shall not, by re-enacting an Act or part of an Act, or by revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction which has by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act or upon similar language.\nThese provisions obviously govern the construction of the statute in question, which is chapter 36 of the Revised Statutes of 1897, at all events in respect of grants and leases issued under it subsequent to the year 1897.\nFor these reasons it seems to me to be clear that in felling and carrying away the trees, the respondents Miller & Dickson were not, except as to trespasses upon the soil which was vested in the appellants, committing any trespass of which the appellants have any title to complain.\n2. But apart from this, is it really the law of England, as Mr. Anglin contended, and as I understand the majority of the court to hold, that the doctrine of The Winkfield[17] and of Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[18], has any application to trespasses in respect of corporeal hereditaments? The rule as I understand it is correctly stated in Mayne on Damages, at p. 513:\u2014\nIn actions for injury to land, the measure of damages is the diminished value of the property, or of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in it, and not the sum which it would take to restore it to its original state.\n* * * *\nThe damages will vary considerably, according to the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the land. This is obviously just, both to prevent the plaintiff getting extravagant recompense when his interest is on the point of expiring, or very remote, and to prevent the defendant being forced to pay for the same damage several times over. The same act may give rise to different injuries; the tenant may sue for the injury to his possession, and the landlord for the injury to his reversion. And so where several are entitled to succession as tenants for life, in tail, in fee, each can only recover damages commensurate to the injury done to their respective estates. Hence where a stranger cuts down trees, the tenant can only recover in respect of the shade, shelter, and fruit, for he was entitled to no more; and so it is where the occupant is tenant in tail after possibility of issue extinct; but the reversioner or remainderman will recover the value of the timber itself.\nThe appellants in this case, as I have pointed out, have deliberately elected not to put forward any claim based upon the extent of the injury to their contingent interest caused by the acts complained of. The claim is based, and the loss has been appraised upon the assumption that they were entitled to the full value of the timber.\nThe appellants\u2019 contention must be rejected for another reason. Both Miller & Dickson and the Eastern Construction Co. became lawfully entitled to deal with the pine timber which had been felled on the locations by reason of the direction given to them by the Crown timber agent at the end of February. The evidence of the Crown timber agent himself is precise upon the point that his direction to Miller & Dickson to remove what had already been cut referred to the timber cut upon the locations as well as to timber cut upon the Crown lands. The pine was the property of the Crown, and there can be no possible question that the Crown Lands Department would, in the circumstances existing, be acting entirely within its authority as having the management of the Crown forests, in disposing of the timber so felled, after the manner which it deemed to be best in the public interest. The Crown timber agent says, moreover, that he acted in accordance with a settled rule; that he gave the direction with the object of having the ties reach their intended destination. It might, he says, have been a very serious thing to prevent the delivery of the ties. He professed to act with the authority of the Crown Lands Department in what he did; and what he did was afterwards ratified by them. The evidence on this point is undisputed and it is conclusive. The agent reported stating that pine had been cut from the mining locations as well as from Crown lands outside the limits of the Eastern Construction Co.\u2019s permit. The Department of Crown Lands afterwards directed the inspector to ascertain the quantity of pine timber cut from the locations, and, as I have already mentioned, the Eastern Construction Co. was billed for dues for this timber in accordance with the scale in use in respect of timber cut under the authority of a permit, thus treating the timber as timber cut under such authority. It is, therefore, incontestable that from the end of February onward the possession of this timber and of the ties manufactured from it, whether in the Eastern Construction Co., or in the O\u2019Brien firm, or in the Dominion Government, was a perfectly lawful possession, and that from that time onward, the persons in possession had full authority to deal with it.\nSome stress was laid upon the letter of the Deputy Commissioner of the 18th March, but reading that letter in connection with the acts of the departmental officials, it is quite clear that the Deputy Commissioner could have intended only to refer to timber to which the appellants were entitled. The letter of Mr. Margach advising the Department of the trespasses upon the locations was produced at the trial, although not actually put in evidence, and the letter written in November is explicit to the effect that the bill for dues covers the Crown timber taken from the mining loca- tions as well as that taken from lands still vested in the Crown. No other conclusion seems to be possible from the undisputed facts than that at which the Court of Appeal arrived, namely, that from the date of Mr. Margach\u2019s instructions to Miller & Dickson to remove the timber cut, the respondents were dealing with all the Crown timber in question under the authority of the Crown Lands Department. To rely on this is not, as Mr. Justice Meredith points out, to set up a jus tertii. The respondents are setting up their own rights. It is to be noted, moreover, in this connection, that the facts were brought out in the plaintiffs\u2019 own case. Inspector Smith called by the appellants, at page 64 of the appeal case, says that it was by the instructions of the Government that in September he made the count of ties from the mining locations, and at page 73, that instructions were given to Miller & Dickson to remove the ties taken from the mining locations, and on the same page, that the purpose of the count of ties made by him in September, 1909, was to enable the Government dues to be collected. It would be impossible, I should have thought, to sustain in these circumstances the claim for the full value of the timber, even if in a general way the decisions referred to could be held to have any application.\nLet us take the case of the finder, for example. Is it really the law that a trespasser having taken an article from a finder is liable to pay the full value of it to the finder, notwithstanding the fact that before action the owner has come into the matter and has authorized the trespasser to keep the article which is the subject of the trespass? Is it conceivable that in such circumstances, unless special damages could be proved as attaching to the trespass itself as distinguished from the detention of the article, that the finder could recover more than nominal damages for the wrong done to his possession? I should have thought it was plain he could not.\nAnother ground is now suggested which was not suggested at the trial or in the Court of Appeal, or on the argument before us, for sustaining the judgment of the learned trial judge. It is said that, assuming the appellants had not possession of the trees in sit\u00fb, they came into their possession when they were felled to the ground and that the possession so acquired was sufficient to entitle them to maintain detinue and to recover the full value of the timber as it lay there. To this ground of recovery the objection to which I have just adverted, namely, that by reason of the act of the Crown officials the respondents became, before the action was brought, entitled as against the appellants to the possession of the timber, seems equally applicable. But it appears to me to involve a very considerable strain upon the principles of English law relating to the subject of possession to hold that the timber in question ever came into the possession of the appellants as chattels. Consider the facts. The trespasses in question began about the first of February. The contractors, Miller & Dickson, proceeded in this way. They cut roads into territory south of Vermilion River entering the sites of the locations as well as the adjoining Crown lands\u2014and at various places in the vicinity of these roads they started concurrently the felling of timber. As the timber was felled it was manufactured into ties on the spot, and these ties were hauled to the piling stations. In this way they proceeded until the end of February with- out any interference. There was nobody in the locality, or within hundreds of miles of the locality having any authority on behalf of the appellants to interfere with them. The only person in the district having authority to take possession of the timber, the Crown timber agent, confirmed the possession of the contractors when the cutting came to his notice. Throughout the course of the whole proceedings, it has never been suggested on behalf of any of the parties that the respondents had not de facto possession of the timber from the time it was felled until it was delivered at the piling stations. It is perfectly obvious from the evidence that they had and must have had as much physical control over the timber as in the circumstances would be necessary to constitute possession in fact. So far from disputing this, counsel for the appellants more than once during the trial emphasized the circumstance that the manufacturing and the hauling of the ties for delivery proceeded contemporaneously with the cutting. (See, for example, p. 158.) And I have already referred to the observation of Mr. Shilton that the possession upon which the appellants relied was a possession implied by law. The possession relied upon by Mr. Anglin in his argument before us was the possession upon which the learned judge based his judgment, and upon which the claim was based at the trial, namely, the possession of the trees as they stood upon the soil. It was not suggested that the respondents had not de facto possession from the time the trees were felled. It would be necessary, therefore, in order to make good this position, to rest upon some rule of law vesting possession of the felled timber in the holders of the locations solely by reason of their possession, that is to say, their legal possession of the soil upon which the timber fell, as against the de facto possession of Miller & Dickson. I do not think there is any such rule of law, and if authority were needed for the purpose of negativing such a rule, it may be found in the case of Bridges v. Hawkesworth[19], in which it was held that a purse found lying on a shop floor in the day time while the shop was open for business, by a customer, was not, while lying there, in the possession of the owner of the shop.\nIt is suggested, however, that some such rule is deducible from the language of Lord Davey in Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[20]. The circumstances with which Lord Davey was there dealing were these: timber had been cut by a trespasser upon Crown lands. Subsequent to this cutting a lease was granted. After the granting of the lease and occupation under it by the lessee, the timber which had been so cut was removed by the trespassers. It was held that the lessee, as lessee and occupier, had a sufficient possession of the timber to entitle him to maintain detinue for the value of it. Of course, in its broad features, the case is immediately differentiated from the present case by the intervention of the Crown Lands Department, and the authority given by the Crown officers to the respondents in this case to deal with the timber before the action was brought. In the Glenwood Case20 the granting of the lease and the occupation by the lessee under it, had the effect of vesting in the lessee the possession of the lands and a right to the possession, at least, for the benefit of the Crown of all chattels on the lands to which the Crown had a right of possession at the time of the granting of the lease, and which were not intended to be excepted from the lessee\u2019s possession. Such chattels came under (to use the phrase of Patteson J., in Bridges v. Hawkesworth[21]), the \u201cprotection of\u201d the lessee\u2019s occupation. The lessee, therefore, clearly acquired a right to the possession of the timber which was felled and was lying within the limits of the demised property. This right of possession alone would be sufficient to entitle the lessee to maintain detinue even against the de facto possession of the trespassers, and there is no suggestion in the report of the case that the trespassers had de facto possession. In the case before us the trees in question had been expressly excepted from the possession of the appellants, and stood exactly in the same position as, for example, timber felled without authority upon adjoining Crown lands and piled upon ground within the limits of one of the appellants\u2019 locations. The argument under consideration logically applied would give a right to the holders of the locations to recover the full value of such timber, notwithstanding subsequent permission from the Crown Lands Department given to the trespasser to appropriate the timber. That is a result which cannot, I think, be fairly deduced from the Glenwood Case[22].\nThus far I have dealt only with the pine timber, and I have proceeded upon the assumption that the Eastern Construction Co. stand in the same case with Miller & Dickson. As to the tamarac, there is no ground, so far as I can see, upon which Miller & Dickson can be excused. I am inclined to think that they are not responsible for damages arising from the trespass to the soil so far as such trespass may have been merely incidental to the cutting and carrying away of the pine trees. There is certainly much to be said for the proposition that as an incident of the property in the trees the Crown would have the right to deal with a trespasser in all respects as if the trespass had been committed on Crown lands, and consequently to waive all wrongful acts incidental to the trespass, in order to claim either the value of the timber cut or compensation for it on the footing of the trespasser having acted under a permit, if the circumstances were such as to entitle the Crown to make the latter claim. In this case the Crown was clearly, I think, entitled to take that position. See the judgment of Bowen L.J. in Phillips v. Homfray[23]. The amount affected by this point is, however, trifling.\nThe Eastern Construction Co., however, with regard to the whole case, stand in a totally different position from that of Miller & Dickson. The learned trial judge has found that they did not authorize the trespasses, that is to say, that the trespasses were not authorized by anybody who was in a position to bind them. They were held liable on the ground, as he puts it, that they took the ties with a full knowledge of the circumstances in which they had been obtained by Miller & Dickson; that they paid for them in part, and that they sold them. He concludes that by these acts they adopted what Miller & Dickson did and made themselves responsible for it. On this branch of the case I think the learned judge has fallen into some error in failing to appreciate, in its bearing upon the conduct of the Eastern Construction Co., the fact that all parties from the time Miller & Dickson were stopped cutting by the orders of the Crown timber agent, dealt with the Crown timber and the ties which had been manufactured from Crown timber with the authority of the Crown Lands Department. There is no evidence that before that time the Eastern Construction Co. had done any act which could be construed as an adoption of the wrongful acts of Miller & Dickson. Samuel McDougall, Sr., who, as I have pointed out, was authorized only to count the ties, to classify them, and to submit them for inspection to the Government inspector, was aware of the fact that some of these ties had been cut from the appellants\u2019 locations. But it is not disputed that the ties from the appellants\u2019 locations were mixed up by Miller & Dickson with ties taken from the Crown lands in such a way as to make identification impossible: see appellants\u2019 factum, p. 2; and as I have pointed out, it is not suggested that Samuel McDougall, Sr., had any knowledge of the cutting of tamarac from the mining locations, that is to say, of the cutting of any timber which was the property of the owners of those locations. McDougall had no authority to do anything on behalf of the Eastern Construction Co. amounting to an adoption of the trespass, any more than he had power to authorize a trespass antecedently. When the responsible officials of the Eastern Construction Co. became aware of the trespass Miller & Dickson had already received authority from the Crown Lands Department to deal with the Crown timber as if it had from the beginning been rightfully in their possession. What was afterwards done in dealing with the timber can fairly be attributed to this authority. It is perfectly true that during the month of April, after the Eastern Construction Co. had become aware of the trespasses, they paid considerable sums of money to Miller & Dickson, but it should be remembered that the timber taken from the locations constituted only about one\u2011sixth of the timber cut by Miller & Dickson. The ties, as I have said, were inextricably mixed and until Inspector Smith made his report nobody was in a position to know the exact extent of the trespass upon the locations. That was not until September. The evidence is perfectly clear that Miller & Dickson at first represented to Mr. Alexander McDougall that the trespass upon the locations was very slight. The appellants themselves were unable to give any sort of accurate information, and it was not until the end of June that they assumed the utterly unreasonable position that none of the ties cut by Miller & Dickson south of Vermilion River should be used in railway construction. It is perfectly clear that when this position was taken by the appellants the Eastern Construction Co. were absolutely entitled under the authority of the permission given by the Crown timber agent, to make use of all ties cut from timber owned by the Crown, whether on the locations or off the locations. As to the timber not the property of the Crown, it consisted exclusively of tamarac, and there is no reason for supposing that at this time at all events any of the officers of the Eastern Construction Co. knew that any tamarac had been taken from the locations; and of the tamarac ties cut from the locations, there were fewer than 900 altogether. Notwithstanding all these circumstances, the Eastern Construction Co. did retain a sum almost sufficient to pay Miller & Dickson all that Miller & Dickson would have been entitled to receive from them for the cutting and manufacturing of ties to the number of those manufactured from timber cut from the mining locations.\nSome stress was laid upon the circumstance that the Eastern Construction Co. paid the wages bill of Miller & Dickson for work done in trespass on the locations. In paying the wages bill they simply honoured the cheques issued by Miller & Dickson as they were bound to do under their contract. It is an impossible suggestion that in doing that they were making themselves responsible for everything done by the workmen who were so paid.\nThe Eastern Construction Co. are responsible for the value of the tamarac ties cut from the appellants\u2019 location which were received by them. That is more than covered by the amount paid into court.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellants in the first action are owners of certain mining locations in the District of Rainy River in the Province of Ontario and the appellants in the second action are lessees of other mining locations in the same district. They seek damages for alleged wrongful cutting upon and removal from their respective locations of pine and tamarac timber and for incidental injuries due to negligence in the cutting and removal.\nThe defendants, Miller & Dickson, cut and removed the timber under contract for their co\u2011defendants, the Eastern Construction Company, who obtained the lumber and ties so produced. For the cutting and removal of the pine the Court of Appeal, reversing Clute J., has held that the appellants cannot recover from either of the defendants. Under its judgment the Eastern Construction Company is also relieved of liability in respect of the other items of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\nMiller & Dickson are, however, held liable for the tamarac, its ownership by the plaintiffs not being questioned, and for such damages, if any, as the plaintiffs sustained owing to negligence in cutting and removing both pine and tamarac. From this part of the judgment no appeal has been taken.\nThe appellants seek to restore the judgment of the trial judge awarding them damages against all the defendants for the cutting and removal of the pine and to have the Eastern Construction Company, as well as Miller & Dickson, declared liable to them in respect of the other items of claim.\nThe fact of the cutting and removal of the timber from the plaintiffs\u2019 locations is not in question. No justification is advanced for the cutting of the tamarac. Neither is it contended by the respondents that when the pine was cut and removed they had a license from the Government to cut or take it, although some subsequent ratification or approval by the Department of Crown Lands of their having done so is now set up. The Eastern Construction Company claims that it is not responsible for the tortious acts of its co-defendants, Miller & Dickson, who, though made respondents, were not represented at bar in this court.\nThe principal question is as to the right of the appellants to recover against any of the defendants in respect of the cutting and removal of the pine. The Crown grant and Crown lease under which the appellants respectively claim are subject to the provisions of the \u201cMines Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 36), and contain the reservation prescribed by section 39 of that statute, which, as amended by 62 Vict. ch. 10, sec. 10, reads as follows:\u2014\n39 (1) The patents for all Crown lands sold or granted as mining lands shall contain a reservation of all pine trees standing or being on the lands, which pine trees shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty, and any person holding a license to cut timber or saw logs on such lands, may at all times, during the continuance of the license, enter upon the lands, and cut and remove such trees and make all necessary roads for that purpose.\n(2) The patentees or those claiming under them (except patentees of mining rights hereinafter mentioned) may cut and use such trees as may be necessary for the purpose of building, fencing and fuel, on the land so patented, or for any other purpose essential to the working of the mines thereon, and may also cut and dispose of all trees required to be removed in actually clearing the land for cultivation.\n(3) No pine trees except for the said necessary building, fencing and fuel or other purposes essential to the working of the mine, shall be cut beyond the limit of such actual clearing; and all pine trees so cut and disposed of, except for the said necessary building, fencing and fuel, or other purpose aforesaid, shall be subject to the payment of the same dues as are at the time payable by the holders of licenses to cut timber or saw logs.\nFor the plaintiffs it is contended that notwithstanding the exceptions thus made, they had such possession of what was so excepted, or such an interest in it, as sufficed to give them a status to maintain an action in trespass or in trover against the defendants as strangers and trespassers.\nThat such an exception of standing trees (it appears to be an exception though called a reservation, Douglas v. Lock[24], at pp. 743 et seq.), has the effect of \u201cdividing the trees in property from the land, al- though in facto they remain annexed to the land,\u201d[25], and \u201cparcel of the inheritance\u201d[26], is old and undisputed law. It is argued that of the part of the inheritance so excepted from a grant the grantee has no possession in law, although the land on which the trees stand is his, the right to nutriment out of it for the trees being the only interest in it of the grantor. Legh v. Heald[27], at page 626. It may be that the rule of English law which ascribes to the person in possession of land the possession of chattels upon it and, as against a trespasser, title to them by reason of such possession, thus enabling him to maintain an action for the wrongful taking away of them by a stranger and to recover as damages their full value, although they are the property of another[28], does not apply to trees reserved out of a grant or lease while standing, and that, apart from any proprietary or licensees\u2019 interest in the pine trees which the statute gave them, the plaintiffs could recover in respect of the mere felling of such trees only damages for the wrongful entry on their lands. But that possession such as the plaintiffs had of their mining lands would, notwithstanding an unqualified reservation in the Crown patent and Crown lease of the pine trees, entitle them to maintain an action in detinue against a stranger wrongfully cutting and removing such trees and to recover as damages the value of the timber taken was held by the Upper Canada Court of King\u2019s Bench in Casselman v. Hersey[29], decided in 1872. The possession which the plaintiffs in that case had of the lands from which the timber was removed was much the same as that which the present plaintiffs had of their mining locations. Upon the sufficiency of such possession that decision has since been approved in Kay v. Wilson[30], at page 143, and in Mann v. English[31], at page 249; (see Lightwood on Possession of Land, p. 60); and I do not understand it to be questioned in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case. What was decided by the other branch of the judgment in Casselman v. Hersey[32] has never been challenged in Ontario, so far as I am aware, until the decision of the Court of Appeal now before us, in which, it is noteworthy, no allusion is made to that case. It is cited with approval on the question of damages by Osler J. in Johnston v. Christie[33]. It is probably now too late to question its correctness, Trust and Loan Co. of Upper Canada v. Ruttan[34].\nSince Casselman v. Hersey32 was decided the statutes of Ontario have been thrice revised and consolidated. On each occasion the legislature re-enacted the provision of section 39 of the \u201cMines Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 36), for the reservation of pine substantially in the form in which it is now found. (Vide R.S.O. 1877, ch. 29, sec. 12; and R.S.O. 1887, ch. 31, sec. 12.) The same course has been followed in regard to sections 13 and 14 of the \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 29), which make similar provisions. (Vide R.S.O. 1877, ch. 24, sec. 10; 43 Vict. ch. 4, secs. 2, 3, and 4; R.S.O. 1887, ch. 25, secs. 10 and 11.) Both the \u201cMines Act\u201d and the \u201cFree Grants Act\u201d contain reservations of pine timber in terms substantially the same as those which were passed upon in Casselman v. Hersey[35]. In re-enacting them without making any attempt to change the effect which such a reservation was held to have, or to alter or restrict the rights which the grantee, notwithstanding it, was held to enjoy, the legislature must be understood to have done so in the light of the interpretation put by the court upon the language which it used. Clark v. Wallond[36]. The following provision of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d of the R.S.O. 1897 (chapter 1, section 8, clause 57), first became law in Ontario in 1897:\u2014\nThe legislature shall not, by re-enacting an Act or part of an Act, or by revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction which has by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act or upon similar language.\nThere is no similar clause in the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d in the consolidation of 1877, nor in that of 1887. Whatever may be said, therefore, of the effect of the re-enactment of these statutes in the revision of 1897 in view of sub-section 57 of section 8 of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d of that year, it cannot be assumed that the legislature re-enacted the sections of the \u201cMining Act\u201d and of the \u201cFree Grants Act\u201d in 1877 and again in 1887 in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which had been put upon such a reservation of pine timber as they provided for. When re\u2011enacted in 1897 not only had the language of these statutory provisions received judicial construction, but that construction must be deemed to have already had legislative recognition and acceptance. Thousands of grants and leases of mining and homestead lands have been taken and paid for under this legislation in the interval of forty years since the decision in Casselman v. Hersey[37]. In these circumstances, even if we entertained doubts as to the effect of the reservation of pine timber under section 39 of the \u201cMines Act,\u201d we should, in my opinion, if necessary, apply the doctrine of stare decisis and decline to disturb the legal rights which Crown patentees were declared to possess under language substantially the same by a judicial decision rendered so long ago and which has been since acquiesced in and never questioned until the present time. Casgrain v. Atlantic and North-West Railway Co.[38]; Ex parte Campbell[39]; Corporation of Whitby v. Liscombe[40]; Macdonell v. Purcell[41].\nBut in the case at bar the reservation to the Crown was not unqualified, as it appears to have been in the Casselman Case37. The present plaintiffs had attached to their mining lands a right not merely to enjoy, until they should be cut down by some duly authorized licensee of the Crown, the shade of the pine trees and any other advantage to be derived from their standing on the lands, but they also had the very substantial right of themselves cutting down and using these trees for\nbuilding, fencing and fuel on the land so obtained or for any other purpose essential to the working of the mines thereon.\nand, subject to payment of Crown dues, also the right to\ncut and dispose of all trees required to be removed in actually clearing the land for cultivation. Of this substantial interest in the pine trees the plaintiffs were deprived by their being cut down by the defendants, because, upon their severance from the land, whether effected by a duly authorized Crown licensee or by a trespasser, their special interest ceased just as the special interest or property in timber trees of a lessee holding under a lease without reservation of timber ceases upon severance of the trees from the soil however effected. Herlakenden\u2019s Case[42]. The plaintiffs\u2019 statutory rights were confined to cutting for certain purposes and to taking and using what they themselves so cut. They had no statutory right to take or use what the defendants cut, although such cutting was done in trespass. For the wrongful destruction by mere trespassers of their right to cut and use the pine trees so annexed to their property they had, in my opinion, a right of action. Nuttall v. Bracewell[43]; Jeffries v. Williams[44]; Bibby v. Carter[45]; Smith\u2019s L.C. (11 ed.), vol. 1, pp. 358-60. The evidence shews and the learned trial judge has found that there was not enough timber on the lands for the mining purposes of the plaintiffs. As wrongdoers and trespassers the defendants cannot be heard to say that the plaintiffs might never have used this timber for such purposes. As against them in assessing damages it must be assumed in the plaintiffs\u2019 favour that, but for the wrongful interference of the defendants, they would have had the full benefit of the rights conferred upon them. If entitled to any damages in respect of the destruction of their interest in the pine trees, whether it be regarded as proprietary in its character or as merely an interest of licensees, the plaintiffs in this aspect of the case would seem to be entitled to recover the full value of what was wrongfully cut. But I do not rest my judgment on this ground.\nOn another ground the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the persons responsible for the wrongful removal of the pine trees seems to me unanswerable. When those trees were felled the plaintiffs\u2019 special interest or property in them ceased. But it did not vest in the wrongdoers. Neither did they acquire by their trespass the rights of the Crown. As the pine trees lay upon the ground they were the property of the Crown. But for the reservation they would have been the plaintiffs\u2019 property. The cutting, however, though wrongful, converted that which had been a part of the inheritance into chattel property. McLaren v. Ryan[46]. Lying on the plaintiffs\u2019 lands, those chattels, though belonging to the Crown, were legally in their possession because of their possession of the land.\nEven if continuous physical possession of the pine trees by Miller & Dickson, from the moment when they were cut until they were removed from the plaintiffs\u2019 lands, would have precluded legal possession of them as chattels being ascribed at any time to the plaintiffs as owners and lessees respectively of such lands, there is no proof of such continuous physical possession in the record and in the absence of proof it will not be presumed in favour of trespassers. \u201cDelivery is favourably construed; taking is put to strict proof.\u201d The evidence of continuous physical possession, if they had in fact kept such possession, lay peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendants and the burden was certainly upon them to produce it. Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), p. 376(a). As trespassers Miller & Dickson could have no constructive possession of anything of which they had not actual possession. While, if a person enter under title, his possession of part of a tract of land will generally be regarded as giving him constructive possession of the entire property, where the entry is without title, the legal possession of the trespasser, at all events as against the person lawfully entitled to possession, is limited to the area of his effective occupation. So in the case of movables,\na man who is not entitled to take possession can obtain possession only of that which he actually lays hold of.\nEx parte Fletcher[47]. The same rule applying to land and to chattels in regard to the extent of wrongful possession there is no reason why they should be subject to different rules as to the duration of such possession. In the case of land the possession of the trespasser ceases as soon as his actual occupation comes to an end: Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. v. Short[48]. By an application of the same principle, on the cesser of the physical possession of movables held by wrong, the law will not attribute to the wrongdoer continued constructive possession of them, but the right to possession will draw after it the constructive possession and the person having such right will be deemed to have the legal possession. \u201cPossession acquired by trespass is a continuing trespass from moment to moment so long as the possession lasts.\u201d There is no presumption of the continuance of illegality: at all events, its continuance will not be presumed in aid of a guilty person seeking thus to improve his legal position. Moreover, \u201cin the case of goods legal possession is recognized more readily than in the case of land and mere right to possession is sometimes described as \u2018constructive possession\u2019 and is allowed the advantages of legal possession.\u201d Encyc. Laws of England (2 ed.), vol. XI., p. 327. The removal of the pine trees from the plaintiffs\u2019 lands by Miller & Dickson should, in my opinion, be regarded as a taking of them from the possession of the plaintiffs. Either on this ground, or because their right to possession gave them, as against the trespassing defendants, \u201cthe advantages of legal possession,\u201d they had a status to maintain this action.\nLord Davey, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in a case in which unsuccessful applicants for a lease of timber lands (the appellants) had cut timber on the lands in anticipation of obtaining such lands and had removed it after the lease had been granted to the respondent, said:\u2014\nThe action was in substance for trespassing on the respondent\u2019s lands and for detinue of the logs removed from his lands. * * The action was in fact so treated by the learned judge at the trial. It was then said that at any rate the logs were, as between the respondent and the Crown, the property of the Crown.\nThe answer to this argument is that the appellants were wrong-doers in every step of their proceedings. There is not a hint in either the pleadings or the evidence of any title in the appellants to cut the trees. * * * The appellants were wrong-doers in entering on the lands of the respondent for the purpose of removing the logs, and also in removing the logs, which were certainly not their property.\nThe respondent, on the other hand, was, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, lessee and occupier of the lands, and, as such, had lawful possession of the logs which were on the land. It is a well-established principle in English law that possession is good against a wrong\u2011doer, and the latter cannot set up a jus tertii unless he claims under it. This question has been exhaustively discussed by the present Master of the Rolls in the recent case of The Winkfield[49]. In Jeffries v. Great Western Rly. Co.[50], Lord Campbell is reported to have said: \u201cI am of opinion that the law is that a person possessed of goods as his property has a good title as against every stranger, and that one who takes them from him having no title in himself is a wrong-doer, and cannot defend himself by shewing that there was title in some third person, for against a wrong-doer possession is title.\u201d The Master of the Rolls, after quoting this passage, continues: \u201cTherefore, it is not open to the defendant, being a wrong-doer, to inquire into the nature or limitation of the possessor\u2019s right, and unless it is competent for him to do so the question of his relation to, or liability towards, the true owner cannot come into the discussion at all, and therefore, as between those two parties, full damages have to be paid without any further inquiry.\u201d Their Lordships do not consider it necessary to refer at any greater length to the reasoning and authorities by which the Master of the Rolls supports this conclusion, and are content to express their entire concurrence in it. Glenwood Lumber Co. v. Phillips[51].\nI am unable to distinguish between the act of the defendants in removing the pine logs from the plaintiffs\u2019 lands (the cutting of them is not material to this aspect of the case) and the act of the appellants in removing the logs in the Glenwood Case51, which was held to entitle the respondent (plaintiff) to recover as against the trespassers the full value of the logs removed on the ground that when removed they were in the possession of the respondent as lessee of the land upon which they lay and that, as against the trespasser, such possession was equivalent to title.\nAlthough it does not appear in the reports of this case either before the Judicial Committee or in the colonial courts (N.F. Reps. 1897-1903, 390, 454) that the appellants had at any time relinquished or that the respondent had acquired physical possession of the lumber after it was cut and prior to its removal, their Lordships seem to have found no difficulty in ascribing legal possession of it to the latter as lessee of the land and in treating the removal of it as a wrongful taking out of his possession.\nThe decision in Casselman v. Hersey[52], may be upheld on the ground that after they were cut and lay as chattels on the plaintiffs\u2019 land the defendant in that case wrongfully took away the logs, although Wilson J., no doubt, held the view\nthat the lessee or grantor when the trees are excepted is in possession of them as against a stranger and wrong-doer, (p. 341).\nSee, too, McLaren v. Ryan[53].\nBut it is urged that, although the respondents admittedly had no right or title when they cut and removed the pine timber from the plaintiff\u2019s lands, they subsequently acquired the Crown title to it and must now be treated as if they had been Crown licensees ab initio. This defence was not pleaded and it appears not to have been set up at the trial. It is given effect to, however, in the judgment delivered for the Court of Appeal by Meredith J.A., who says:\u2014\nIt is not a case of setting up the jus tertii; the defendants have acquired the rights of the Crown and are setting up their own rights so acquired.\nThe evidence of Alex. McDougall is relied upon to support this finding of the learned appellate judge. I have seldom perused testimony more unsatisfactory. Had the defence now relied upon been pleaded this evidence would not support it. A fortiori it does not justify an appellate court giving effect to a contention not presented on the pleadings and not raised at the trial and which the plaintiffs had no opportunity to meet. Assuming that it was competent for the Crown Lands Department, after the pine had been all cut and removed from the plaintiffs\u2019 lands and delivered to the Eastern Construction Company, to make an agreement in respect of it which would have the effect of destroying the plaintiffs\u2019 vested right of action, the evidence in the record falls far short of establishing such an agreement.\nMiller & Dickson had cut in trespass upon Crown property as well as upon the locations of the plaintiffs. Apparently in respect of the former, Mr. Margach, a Crown lands official, notified the Eastern Construction Company, by letter of the 6th March, that:\u2014\nThe department has refused the permit. You will please see that they do no more cutting. They are at liberty to remove what they have cut and make a separate return of it.\nThere is no allusion in this letter to the cutting on the plaintiffs\u2019 locations, and in view of the attitude of the department in regard to the rights of the plaintiffs as mining locatees as against the trespassing lumbermen, disclosed by a letter of Mr. White, the Deputy Minister, to which I am about to refer, it would seem reasonably certain that the permission for removal given by Margach was intended to cover only timber cut on the Crown lands. The cutting on the plaintiffs\u2019 locations appears to have been brought to the attention of the department later in the same month. On the 18th March Mr. White writes to the plaintiffs:\u2014\nToronto, March 18th, 1909.\nGentlemen:\u2014\nReferring to your letter of the 15th inst. with regard to the cutting of Messrs. Miller & Dickson on territory south and east of Vermilion River outside of area covered by permit granted to the Eastern Construction Company, I beg to say that the Department has been in communication with Mr. Crown Timber Agent Margach, in relation to this cutting, and he has been fully instructed in the matter so far as relates to lands of the Crown, but if these parties are removing illegally timber from locations to which you may be legally entitled, it would seem to be a matter between you and the parties cutting and taking the timber.\nYour obedient servant,\nAUBREY WHITE,\nDeputy Minister.\nThere is nothing to shew that the department ever changed its attitude as expressed in this letter in regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 rights, or undertook in any way to interfere with or derogate from them, or to give to the defendants a status which would enable them to do so. The timber in question was not cut for the purpose of\nbuilding, fencing or fuel on the mining lands or for any purpose essential to the working of the mines.\nIf cut by the appellants in the course of clearing for cultivation it would have been subject to payment of Crown dues. The defendants having cut in trespass were, no doubt, liable to the Crown for penalties. If the Minister of Crown Lands saw fit to waive the Crown\u2019s right to exact penalties and, as a matter of grace, in lieu thereof to accept from the defendants merely ordinary dues in respect of the timber of which they had possession, it by no means follows that he put, or intended to put them for all purposes in the same position as if they had cut under license. The acceptance by the Crown of dues in such circumstances is at the most an equivocal act. It is entirely consistent with an intention on the part of the department to treat the defendants as persons who had acquired from the plaintiffs timber cut for the purpose of clearing the land for cultivation, which the plaintiffs would have the right to dispose of subject to payment of Crown dues. These dues the Crown claimed from the defendants as the persons in possession of the timber subject to them. It would require something much more conclusive, especially in the face of Mr. White\u2019s letter, to establish that the Crown intended to confer on the defendants the rights of licensees nunc pro tunc and to deprive the plaintiffs of their vested right of action, or that what took place had that effect. There is no evidence on this point from the Department of Crown Lands, and the testimony of Alex. McDougall is quite inconclusive. It is sufficiently surprising that the defendants should have been permitted to take for the first time in the Court of Appeal the position that they should be treated as having cut and removed the timber in question under Crown license. But I find it still more extraordinary that effect should have been given to such a contention upon the evidence before the court. There is, in my opinion, nothing to sustain it.\nFor these reasons I would hold the defendants, Miller & Dickson, liable as claimed by the plaintiffs, and, as to them, would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe liability of the defendants, the Eastern Construction Company, however, does not necessarily follow. Miller & Dickson were not their servants or agents, but independent contractors.\nBut the timber and ties cut on the plaintiffs\u2019 lands were all delivered either to the Construction Company or to its nominees. The company received property, or the proceeds of property, title to which, because it was wrongfully taken from the plaintiffs\u2019 possession, must, in the circumstances of this case, as against all the defendants, be deemed to have been in the plaintiffs. The trial judge has expressed the view that, in crossing the line of their license limits and in entering upon the plaintiffs\u2019 mining locations, Miller & Dickson acted with the concurrence, if not under the direction of Mr. Samuel McDougall, Sr., who represented the Eastern Construction Company. Although I have no doubt that his powers and authority were much wider than either he or his nephew Alex. McDougall, will admit, whether it was within the scope of his agency for the company to give such a direction so as to bind his principals and to render it in law their direction is possibly doubtful on the evidence. But there is in the testimony of Dickson, Miller, Smith, McLean and Proud, abundant evidence to warrant a finding that Samuel McDougall, Sr., knew from the first that Miller & Dickson were cutting for his company on the plaintiffs\u2019 lands. The learned trial judge says:\u2014\nI think Miller & Dickson crossed the line and cut those ties, and that the cutting was afterwards brought to the attention of the Eastern Construction Company, and that they deliberately received and accepted those ties from their contractors, and paid part upon them, and sold them and received the payment therefor.\nAlthough its formal judgment relieves the Construction Company from liability in respect of the tamarac as well as the pine, in delivering the opinion of the Court of Appeal Meredith J.A. said:\u2014\nUpon the finding of the trial judge that the Eastern Construction Company took the goods with knowledge of the circumstances, the holding that they are answerable for the value is right.\nI entirely agree with that statement of the law\u2014and, as I have already said, the finding upon which it is based is fully supported by the evidence. Why the Court of Appeal, while accepting this finding, by its formal judgment relieved the Construction Company from liability for the tamarac which they got, it is difficult to understand. The discrepancy has not been explained.\nWhatever may have been the extent of Samuel McDougall\u2019s authority, his position at the Miller & Dickson camp and his relations to the Construction Company were such that I have no difficulty in imputing to that company the knowledge which he had of the fact of the wrongful cutting on the plaintiffs\u2019 locations. Commercial Bank of Windsor v. Morrison[54]. That knowledge was material to the business in which he was employed; it came to him in the course of his employment; and it was undoubtedly of such a nature that it was his duty to communicate it to his principal. Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 1, pp. 215-6; Bowstead on Agency, 4th ed., 346.\nThe Eastern Construction Company having taken the timber and ties with notice that they were wrongfully cut and removed from the plaintiff\u2019s lands, is, in my opinion, equally liable with Miller & Dickson to the plaintiffs in detinue in respect of both the pine and the tamarac so removed. (See Pollock and Wright on Possession, p. 151, note.)\nBut for such damages as may have been caused by mere negligence or by cutting in an improper and improvident manner, Miller & Dickson are alone responsible. Such misconduct of independent contractors is not imputable to the persons by whom they are engaged.\nFor these reasons to the extent indicated I would allow the appeal of the plaintiffs and would restore the judgment of Clute J. against the Eastern Construction Company.\nThe respondents should pay to the appellants their costs in this court and in the provincial Court of Appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants, Eastern Construction Co. and others: Macdonald & McIntosh.\nSolicitors for the appellants Schmidt and Shilton: Shilton, Wallbridge & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dowler & Dowler.\n[1] 22 Ont.

There is a presumption, in such cases, against the municipal corporation and upon it lies the onus of adducing positive evidence in rebuttal; it is not sufficient to show that the existence of the defects were not known by the corporation officials. Mersey Docks and Harbour Trustees v. Gibbs (L.R. 1 H.L. 93), applied; City of Vancouver v. McPhalen (45 Can. S.C.R. 194) and McClelland v. Manchester Corporation ((1912) 1 K.B. 118) referred to. Davies and Anglin, JJ., contra.\nAn unprotected opening in the sidewalk of one of the principal streets of the city, having the appearance of being recently made for some purposes in connection with the laying of gas-pipes, was permitted to remain without proper repair during most of the day, and, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, the plaintiff's injuries were sustained by stepping into the hole while making use of the sidewalk.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (1 West. Weekly Rep. 31; 19 W.L.R. 322), Davies and Anglin JJ., dissenting, that evidence of these facts made out a proper case for submission to the jury, and upon which they could return findings of breach of statutory duty and misfeasance on the part of the municipal corporation. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Murphy, J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nIn the circumstances stated in the head-note and more fully referred to in the judgment new reported, the plaintiff, on the findings of the jury, recovered a judgment for $6,000 damages, and this judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from. The principal contentions on behalf of the appellant were that there was no evidence to go to the jury in respect of the opening in the sidewalk having been made by or with the consent of the municipal authorities or as to the time it had been there, and that, during the course of the trial, some of the jurymen improperly took a view of the locus and, no doubt, treated what they saw there as evidence.\nC. W. Craig, for the appellant.\nJ. Edward Bird, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington. The highway was under the control of the appellant corporation subject to a statutory duty to keep it in repair. City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[2]. It was for the jury to say whether that highway was out of repair by reason of some positive act done by the corporation, its officers, servants and others acting under its authority and whether or not the corporation was negligent. There was evidence upon which the case could be left to the jury upon both points. Assuming, as argued here, that the hole which caused the accident might have been made without the knowledge or consent of the city in view of the duty to repair which is imposed in absolute terms by the statute, the burden of explanation was on the appellants and they have not in any way attempted to meet it. I cannot think, in any event, that any authority given by the legislature to a gas or water company to break up the streets was intended to relieve the municipality from the obligation to maintain them in a safe condition. The right of the company to open the streets was subject to the consent of the corporation and the latter was responsible for any act of the company which might cause the streets to be out of repair.\nIt is not necessary to say whether the company might not also be made liable. But there is nothing in the acts to which my attention has been drawn which relieves the municipality from the obligation to fulfil its duty with respect to the maintenance of the highways in a proper state of repair.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting) agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Each of the parties hereto seems to have been desirous of trying how little evidence may consistently, with success, on either side, be given in an accident case founded on the liability of the appellant, as a municipal corporation, for the repair of its streets.\nIt is beyond dispute that the accident in question took place in clear sunlight, at four o'clock in the afternoon, on the cement sidewalk in a very busy part of the busiest street in the city, by reason of the respondent's foot getting caught in a hole in the side-walk and that as the result thereof the respondent has been rendered a cripple.\nIt is quite clear that, at a point two feet four inches from the curb, the hole had been cut of fourteen inches square to enable someone to set in place therein a metal fixture of some kind, probably to connect with some gas or water system as a means of shutting off or letting on the gas or water to an adjacent building.\nThis fixture as described was of that nature, and not big enough to fill the hole as cut, but, when set therein, left a space large enough to so receive respondent's foot, that he got caught, tripped up, and had some bones broken.\nThis space, it can clearly be inferred from the evidence, had been partly refilled with clay and odd bits of broken cement by the party who had done the job. The packing had (as we learn because res ipse loquitur, and we can well believe it) never been properly done and the street restored by re-cementing it to a safe condition for travelling thereon. Indeed it was palpably an \"unfenced trap.\"\nThere is no direct evidence when or by whom or by whose direction or authorization it was done.\nIt is urged for appellant that it is not shown to have had notice or knowledge of what had been done.\nIt may, however, be fairly inferred, from what we are told, that it would have been quite impossible to have done the job during that day without attracting the attention of those entrusted, or who should have been entrusted, by the appellant, with the police and other official oversight guarding that street, in the way that must, in such regards, be established in such communities to enforce the law and protect the public and the municipality's own property.\nIn a less degree it may also be a fair inference to draw that these officials, or some of them, could not have discharged their duty without observing and calling attention to the matter if the job had been done the night before and so left unguarded all the day of the accident up to four o'clock in the afternoon.\nThis statute (the City Charter), as it stood when the accident occurred which gave rise to the case of McPhalen v. City of Vancouver[3], has been amended since the decision in that case, and now reads so that no doubt can exist of the intention of the legislature to give a right of action to those suffering from the municipality's default respecting its duty to repair.\nI need not repeat here all I said in that case relative to the liability of a party neglecting an imperative duty imposed upon him by any statute intended to protect and give cause of action to any one suffering by reason of such default. I may refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice Lush in McClelland v. Manchester Corporation[4], of which report has reached here since, as to a large extent bearing out the view we had taken.\nReferring to the views I and others expressed in the McPhalen Case[5], and applying the principles set forth therein, and the amendment to the statute, is it not clear that, on such a statute as amended, when the facts demonstrate an actual want of repair, causing damage, an action is prim\u00e2 facie of necessity shown to be well founded, because the statute has not been duly observed or complied with, and hence the party in default called upon to offer some excuse?\nPrim\u00e2 facie the duty is imperatively obligatory and its consequences can only be got rid of by some valid excuse for a failure to discharge the duty so imposed.\nThis statute is just the same as any other in that regard. The obligation is not qualified by the statute itself in any way. The same principles of law must be adhered to in applying it as in applying other statutes imposing any like duty to repair.\nNotice to, or knowledge on the part of, the authorities of a want of repair never formed part of the statute.\nAmerican and Ontario cases are cited to show that some such notice or knowledge of non-repair must be proven by a plaintiff claiming to recover by virtue of the statute. I do not say that no such cases exist as would carry the doctrine of notice or knowledge thus far, for there has been a good deal of confusion of thought in that regard, but no case cited to us from the Ontario authorities carries it so far. Numerous dicta can be found apparently doing so. I think we must discard them and also such cases, if any, as carry the doctrine so far.\nI will presently consider the question where I think notice or knowledge may become an operative factor in these accident cases. Beyond the line I will indicate I think the doctrine questionable, and, as the late Mr. Beven pointed out, had not found a place in English decisions. Its history helps to show how it came about in the United States and Ontario so far as really existent.\nWhen the road-making and the road-repairing duties in America were imposed on municipalities the very conditions of the country required that, in measuring the extent of that duty, due regard should be had thereto, and the variations, especially as to the kind of road, the state of repair, and the superintendence which might be necessary in one place and could not be expected or exacted in another under entirely different conditions.\nI suspect the element of notice came to be introduced in connection therewith. Indeed we find the statutes of Maine and Massachusetts, and possibly others states expressly required that municipalities so charged with the duty, should, as a condition of liability, have had reasonable notice of the condition complained of, and that notice was by the courts imputed to them occasionally from very slight circumstances.\nIn Old Canada (as to that part known then as Upper Canada, now Ontario) the first step taken to render municipalities therein responsible, was by 12 Vict. ch. 81, sec. 190, transferring the powers and duties of justices in sessions, with respect to highways, to the municipal councils of the county.\nThe next session 13 & 14 Vict. ch. 15, sec. 1, cities and towns were expressly charged with the duty to repair and rendered liable criminally as well as civilly for default.\nThe later enactment (in one section, indeed in one sentence, which applied to all municipalities) that the non-observance of the duty of repair legislatively cre- ated thereby, should be held to be a misdemeanour punishable by fine and further render the municipality responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default, tended to make courts look at the criminal law liability as the boundary of the civil liability.\nThough this was not uniformly agreed to, and the statute later on modified, I suspect the idea of notice or knowledge as part of what might reasonably be required to found a criminal prosecution, became the more readily importable into cases involving only civil liability, than it would have been had the statute been originally framed as the one in question here without expressly giving any remedy.\nFor a long time the Ontario courts had thus a statute to interpret which is capable of being looked at from a point of view that does not need to be taken relative to this one.\nThen again the question constantly arose as to whether or not there was a common law liability independently of the statute, and in seeking for such principles of common law as might create a liability on the part of the municipality as the owner of the road or having jurisdiction over it, in settling the relations thereby created between the municipality and persons it had invited, as it were, to use the road, the questions of notice and knowledge became more closely relevant to the consideration of what should determine the question of liability, than in relation to the simpler question of whether or not a plain statute had been violated and its duties neglected.\nSo far as the Ontario cases have any bearing on the question, I think this history and these several considerations must be borne in mind in using such cases. It has been usual also for the purpose of emphasizing the claim and possibly affecting damages to show gross negligence by giving evidence of long existence of the non-repair. Such prudence, however, is not to be confounded with the question of notice. I may say, however, that the Ontario cases cited to us do not go the length which is contended for herein.\nThe case of Castor v. Township of Uxbridge[6], relied on is no authority for the proposition. It was disposed of on the ground of contributory negligence of the plaintiff. No case is an authority binding any one but for, or in respect of, the point of law necessarily decided for the determination of the case.\nTrue, the late Chief Justice Harrison, who was a great authority on municipal law, made, as was his wont, in his opinion in that case, an exhaustive collection of all the cases bearing upon every possible view that the case suggested. In this examination relying upon American authorities alone, he seems to lay down, at foot of page 127, that there is no presumption.\nIt is to be observed that the case was one arising out of the clear wrongdoing of someone who had no official relation with the municipality or colour of right to do what he had done. It was because the case was of that class and had never, till then, arisen for decision in a superior court that the Chief Justice took such pains.\nIt is, if I may be permitted to say so, that kind of case alone which can properly give rise to the question of notice. When it is sought to apply the doc- trine to the cases where the road had merely worn out of repair, I think it is entirely misplaced.\nNo one would think of saying that when the forces of nature have suddenly destroyed or put out of repair a road, or someone has maliciously or negligently wrought the same result, and an accident has taken place as a result thereof, that the municipality must be held as insurers and so, regardless of all opportunity to have repaired the road so destroyed, be cast in damages.\nIt generally happens in the stating of such a case to any court, that this is its nature and the question of notice or knowledge or opportunity thereof incidentally arises.\nI am, despite dicta to the contrary, prepared to hold that, unless in some such case as I have suggested, the question of notice or knowledge does not arise, and that in all cases where the accident has arisen from the mere wearing out, or apparent wearing out, or imperfect repair of the road, there arises upon evidence of accident caused thereby, a presumption without evidence of notice that the duty relative to repair has been neglected.\nThe municipality is bound to take every reasonable means through its overseeing officers and otherwise, to become acquainted with such possible occurrences, and if it has done so can possibly answer the presumption.\nIt is beyond my province here to further define the limits of that presumption; I am only concerned with giving due consideration to arguments pressed upon us and rested upon the authorities which I have referred to. In the case of Kearney v. London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co.[7], where a railway company was in duty bound to keep in repair a bridge over a highway, a brick fell from it on a passenger below just after a train had passed, and he was held entitled to damages and had no need to show more than these facts. The decision was upheld in the Exchequer Chamber. The duty was merely to keep in repair. Res ipsa loquitur was applied. Why should there be one rule of law as to the evidence needed or presumption arising from evidence in one class of cases involving a breach of duty to repair and another rule for other classes? One would suppose it would if anything be more stringently applied in the case of a breach of a plain statutory duty than in the other. I see no difference. I do, however, see how as a case develops and becomes complicated, other considerations may arise.\nIn this case the sidewalk was found in the condition described. It clearly was not the result of malice but of work, for a useful purpose, presumably, done by the appellant or someone acting under its express authority.\nThe charter of appellant contains the following clause:\u2014\n218. Every public street, road, square, lane, bridge or other highway in the city shall be vested in the city (subject to any right in the soil which the individuals who laid out such road, street, bridge or highway may have reserved), and such public street, road, square, lane or highway shall not be interfered with in any way or manner whatsoever, by excavation or otherwise, by any street railway, gas or waterworks company, or any companies or by any company or companies that may hereafter be incorporated, or any other person or persons whomsoever, except having first made application and received the permission of the city engineer in writing. Let it be observed that there is not a word of evidence showing either gas or waterworks to exist in or be operated in the city. All the reference to such works is that the fixture set in the walk had the appearance of being something put there \"for waterworks or gas or whatever it is.\"\nFor aught we know the city may own and have in operation both classes of such works.\nWe are referred to an Act incorporating a gas company many years before but whether it ever got organized or did anything or appeared any place but upon paper we are not told in evidence. What right could the court have before submitting the case to the jury to presume such existed?\nIn the face of the above quoted stringent provisions of section 218, is it not asking too much to permit the imagination such free scope as to allow it to construct some basis for the theories as to others being liable for damages?\nSweep aside these products of the imagination and there is nothing to be fairly inferred from the facts save that the city may have placed the fixture where placed.\nEven if there had been evidence of some such gas works, as provided in the charter got to establish such, I do not see how it could operate without the co-operation of the city authorities. And when so subject to the control of the city as above section 218 implies it must be, it became the duty of the city to protect its walks and those travelling thereon just as much and as efficiently in that regard as if it possessed the works. If it failed to make such stringent regulations and provide for such supervision by its own officers thereof, so as to protect the public and keep itself well in- formed of all that was being done, then it was, and on this evidence may well be inferred to have been, negligent. It was for the jury to say.\nIn this connection regard may be had to the rule to be applied herein, laid down in the judgment of Blackburn J. in delivering the opinion of the judges in Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[8]. In one of the cases and issues raised for consideration therein the contest was relative to the charge delivered to the jury which, according to the bill of exceptions tendered, raised this very issue of non-liability in the absence of knowledge on the part of the defendants there.\nThe Lord Chief Baron had charged the jury in effect that it was not necessary to prove knowledge on the part of the defendants or their servants of the unfit state of the docks and that proof that the defendants by their servants had the means of knowledge and were negligently ignorant of it, would entitle the plaintiffs to the verdict.\nDo we need, even if knowledge or notice is to be an element, anything more in disposing of this case?\nIndeed, when the duty to know is considered and what the Lord Chancellor said, at page 122 of that case, holding that\nthey must be held equally responsible if it was only through their culpable negligence that its existence was not known to them.\nis fully appreciated, then the field for notice and knowledge to become an operative factor in these cases is an exceedingly narrow one. In any way I can look at this case I see no ground to support the appeal. I think the court below right in finding a case to submit to the jury that there had arisen a presumption on the evidence and inferences fairly deducible therefrom, which entitle the respondent to recover upon the statute if the jury chose to draw such inferences.\nThe appeal, I think, should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) was injured as the result of stepping into a hole in a concrete sidewalk in Hastings Street, which is said to be a principal thoroughfare in the City of Vancouver. The hole, which was of such a character that it is clear that it had been purposely cut in the concrete, was about 12 by 14 inches in size and of a depth of two or three feet. In it, extending from the bottom to the surface, was an iron pipe covered by a steel plate apparently about seven or eight inches square and level with the surface of the sidewalk. This steel plate appears not to have been in the centre of the hole. The plaintiff in testifying says that the space left on one side was greater than on the other. He adds that after the accident he noticed that the hole was filled up around the iron pipe with rough broken concrete and clay to within from five to seven inches of the sidewalk. There are also the following questions and answers in his evidence:\u2014\nQ. Now around this aperture or hole which was covered by this steel plate, there had been earth and rough pieces of concrete as you said thrown in there, tramped? A. Yes.\nQ. Now what did you see within the next\u2014a short time after this accident? A. I saw a gang of men working there across, taking up the pavement on the street going across to that iron structure they were building alongside the Woods Hotel.\nQ. What were they doing with relation to this hole, what con- nection had it with the hole? A. It was running from whatever this plate was for, gas or water, they were running from this plate across the street, had the blocks of cement up and digging down somewhere about two weeks later.\nThat its charter imposes upon the City of Vancouver a duty to maintain its streets in repair, a breach of which renders the city civilly liable to persons injured as a result thereof while lawfully using such streets has been settled by this court in City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[9]. We are now called upon to determine whether evidence of the facts above stated made a case sufficient to submit to a jury upon issues whether there was (a) misfeasance on the part of the city rendering it civilly liable to the plaintiff, or (b) a breach of the city's duty to repair which entailed such liability.\nThe only reasonable inference upon the facts in evidence is that the hole in question was cut for the purpose of placing in it the iron pipe which was there at the time the plaintiff was injured. Upon the plaintiff's own evidence this pipe may have been either a gas pipe or a water pipe. The Vancouver Gas Company, incorporated in 1886, has a statutory right to open up the streets of a city for the purpose of placing its pipes in and under them. While wrong-doing is never to be assumed, and, therefore, the cutting of the hole in question should not, in the absence of any evidence warranting such a conclusion, be ascribed to the act of a wrong-doer, there is no sound basis on which a jury could say that it was cut by the municipal corporation or its servants and not by the gas company or its employees. It seems to me impossible to say that a case was made for submission to a jury on the ground of misfeasance.\nIf then, in order to succeed, the plaintiff must make out such a case as would render the City of Vancouver liable although the hole had been cut by the gas company\u2014and that, I think, is his situation\u2014he must prove facts which, at least, prim\u00e2 facie warrant an inference that the city neglected its duty to maintain the sidewalk in question in repair. The duty of repair is imposed by the statute in absolute terms. But, as is pointed out by Irving J.A., citing from Comyn's Digest, vol. 1, p. 405(b),\nAn action upon the case does not lie where a man has not sufficient notice of his duty.\nThe duty to repair comes into existence only when a state of disrepair exists, and I find it very difficult, without holding the municipal corporation subject to the liability of an insurer, which the statute, in my opinion, was not intended to impose, Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[10], at pages 123-4, to reach the conclusion that, in the absence of proof of notice or of circumstances such that notice to the municipal corporation should be imputed[11], there has been neglect or breach of its duty to repair. There being no evidence of actual notice, the point for consideration seems to be whether such facts are disclosed as would warrant the trial judge in leaving it to a jury to say whether notice of the existence of the hole in question should be imputed to the defendants. From the fact that shortly afterwards the sidewalk was opened up for the purpose of making a connection with the pipe placed in the hole at which the plaintiff was injured, the reasonable inference would seem to be that the hole itself had been recently made rather than that it had existed for some time. From the evidence that \"there had been earth and rough pieces of concrete thrown in there, tramped,\" it would also appear to be a reasonable inference that after the hole had been cut and the pipe placed in position, it had been filled up with this material to the surface, because otherwise it could scarcely have been \"tramped.\" This would appear to have been a temporary filling, inasmuch as the street was shortly afterwards again opened up for the purpose of making the connection to which the plaintiff refers. It is a well-known fact that, when a hole has been cut and filled up in this manner, the filling may appear to be, when first put in position, perfectly firm and solid; and yet, unless it has been exceedingly well packed or tamped, action of water will soon cause a sinking of the material below the surface. The surface itself may remain intact for a time, but eventually the arch which it forms will give way and the surface itself cave in. That this may have happened, and in all probability did happen in the present case, seems to me to be a fair conclusion from the evidence before us. There is nothing to show that the filling in was negligently done; still less that any municipal inspector looking at the hole after it had been filled in would or should know that the surface would collapse before the work of connection should be proceeded with. While, therefore, it is true that under the amended charter of the city the gas company could probably open up the streets only with the permission of the city engineer, so that the latter would have notice of any such opening to be made, and assuming that it would be his duty, or that of civic officials under him, to see that any opening so made was properly closed up, I find nothing in the evidence which would warrant a finding of neglect of that duty. It is entirely consistent with the evidence that the filling of the hole may have fallen in only immediately before the plaintiff was injured, or it may be that it gave way under the pressure of his foot step and that up to that moment there was nothing to indicate that the hole as filled in constituted a source of danger to pedestrians. Neither is it possible to say that the temporary filling in of such a hole (pending the connection within a few days of the pipe which it contained with the other works contemplated and which would necessitate the re-opening of the hole) with rough concrete and clay properly packed and tamped, would be a negligent or improper thing. The duty of the municipality to maintain its streets in repair must receive a reasonable construction. It does not subject the city to the liabilities of an insurer. The duty of the city engineer who has notice of an opening being made by the gas company must also be dealt with reasonably. It does not, in my opinion, require him to keep an inspector constantly on watch while such an opening is being made and filled in. Upon the evidence, it is a fair inference that this hole was filled in, as would be the duty of the gas company if it had cut the hole, and that the filling had been carried to the surface and had been \"tramped.\" There is no evidence which would warrant an inference that upon a proper inspection an official of the City Engineer's Department would have discovered that the filling was insufficient and that the hole as kept constituted a menace to pedestrians. Sanitary Commissioners of Gibralter v. Orfila[12], at pages 411, 413.\nWe were much pressed by counsel for the respondents with the argument that, inasmuch as it was peculiarly within the knowledge of the municipality whether the hole in the sidewalk had or had not been cut by its officials or contractors, and how long it had existed as a source of danger to pedestrians, upon the plaintiff showing that he had been injured by stepping into the hole the burden was shifted to the defendant to prove facts and circumstances which would exonerate it from responsibility, and that, in default of its producing such evidence, it should be presumed that facts and circumstances existed which rendered it liable. This argument simply means that proof of the existence of a hole establishes a case of prim\u00e2 facie liability without any proof of neglect of duty, or of facts from which an inference might fairly be drawn of neglect of duty on the part of the municipal corporation. I am unable to accede to that contention. This is not a case of res ipsa loquitur. Moreover, the plaintiff could readily have shown the character of the pipe in question and have thus cleared up the issue as to misfeasance. He was, in my opinion, bound to do so. Assuming that, in the absence of such evidence, the case must be dealt with on the basis that the hole was not cut by the municipality, the plaintiff would probably have experienced no serious difficulty in adducing some evidence\u2014very little would have sufficed in view of the situation of the hole\u2014to show that it had been in a dangerous condition long enough, if that were the fact, to warrant a jury imputing notice to the defendant. At all events ei quiaffirmat, non ei qui negat, incumbit probatio. In the absence of any evidence of the existence of facts or circumstances warranting an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant, it should not be called upon to prove the negative, viz., the non-existence of such facts or circumstances.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am, with great respect for the views of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and of those of my learned brothers who have reached the contrary conclusion, of the opinion that a case had not been made proper for submission to a jury and that the plaintiff's action should have been dismissed. I would allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the action with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and I concur with the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.G.

The lands being still unsold about three months later, the broker, in consideration of a payment of $50, obtained an exclusive option from the owners for the sale or purchase by himself, within 30 days, of the lands at a price named, which was to include his commission in the event of his effecting a sale, but without disclosing information of which he was then possessed that there was a probability of the lands selling within a short time at an increased price. Within a few days after the date of the option he effected a sale, in his own name, of the lands for double the price named therein, notified the owners that he exercised his option to purchase and demanded a conveyance. In an action for specific performance, brought by the broker on refusal of such conveyance,\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014That by the terms of the written agreement the broker became an agent for the sale of the lands with the option of purchasing them for himself; that he could not become purchaser until he had divested himself of his character as agent; that he was, as agent, bound to disclose to his principals the knowledge he had acquired respecting the improved prospects of a sale at enhanced value, and his exercise of the option to purchase did not relieve him of this obligation. He was, therefore, not entitled to a decree for specific performance.\nPer Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014That the broker was an agent for the sale of the lands at the time he procured the option and, having failed in his duty to disclose to his principals all material information he had as to the probability of the lands selling at a higher price than that mentioned, specific performance of the agreement to sell to him should be refused.\nThe judgment appealed from (16 B.C.

C. Bird, for the appellants.\nE. A. Lucas, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts are fully set out in the notes of the other judges. By the memorandum of 21st November, the appellants gave to the respondent \"the exclusive right to purchase or sell for the term of one month\" the property in question in these proceedings. This memorandum of itself undoubtedly established a very peculiar relation between the parties. In my opinion, Nasmith became thereunder an agent for sale and he also had an option to purchase. He could have sold the property as agent, or, finding himself unable to sell, he could have purchased it for himself. The dual relation should have been severed, however, before the option to purchase was exercised; otherwise, Nasmith continued to be an agent obliged, as such, to make full disclosure up to the very moment that he exercised his option to purchase. The confusion in the legal relations between the parties resulting from such conditions is quite sufficient to shew how necessary it was to regularize his position towards the appellants. Not having done so, Nasmith was bound to them by the rule of law which regulates the relations of principal and agent as to disclosure, etc., and the exercise of his option to purchase did not relieve him of that obligation. In the peculiar circumstances of this case it would require but very slight evidence to justify the conclusion that the respondent was dealing as agent.\nIn answer to a question from me during the argument, Mr. Lucas admitted that the entry on the regular listing card made as the result of the first interview was just such as would have been made by Nasmith, he being a real-estate agent, if he had taken the property to sell as the agent of the appellants. In case of doubt it might fairly be assumed from the way the respondent treated the transaction at the time that he considered himself an agent for sale. That he did not, as he says, make any effort to sell the property cannot in any way effect the character of the relations established previously with the appellants. On the other hand, if he did not try to sell, what is the meaning of his reference to a prospective buyer; and why did he mutilate the listing card by taking off the owner's name?\nFinally, in the agreement of 25th November, there is quite sufficient to satisfy me that the relations of principal and agent still existed at that time between the parties and that the vendees might, on discovery of that agency have their recourse against the appellants on the ground that the sale was made under the terms and authority of the memorandum.

La Banque du Peuple[2], at page 180.\nI would allow this appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This action was one brought to enforce specific performance of an agreement for the sale to plaintiffs by the defendants of certain lands.\nThe main questions debated on the argument in the appeal to this court were whether at the time the plaintiff's obtained the option for the purchase of the land they were the agents of the defendants for the sale of such land and bound to disclose to them before obtaining the option all material facts which had come to them or were within their knowledge respecting the selling value of such lands.\nI have no difficulty on the facts in reaching the conclusion that at the time the plaintiff obtained the option for the purchase which he afterwards sought to have enforced he was the defendants' agent for the sale of the same land. It seems to me equally plain that being such agent and having become possessed of material information affecting the selling value of the lands it became his duty to disclose such information to his principals before attempting to purchase for himself. This disclosure he did not make. He deliberately concealed the facts within his knowledge; facts which largely affected the selling value of the land in his opinion and would in all probability have affected the judgment of the owners of the land in giving him the option.\nHaving reached these conclusions as to the agency of the plaintiff and his neglect to disclose material facts affecting the selling value of the land before obtaining an option to purchase for himself, it seems to me to follow as of course that a court of equity would not lend its aid to enforce at his instance such an agreement for the purchase of the land by himself obtained under such circumstances.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs in all courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent, as a real estate agent, had in August agreed with appellants to list their property consisting of forty-six acres of land for sale at a price of $210 an acre. On the 19th November following he induced them to sign, in consideration of $50 then paid, an agreement giving him the exclusive right for thirty days to sell or purchase said lands at $200 an acre. This was done so late in the afternoon of that day that the agreement was dated as of the 21st, being the Monday following. On the 23rd or 24th of November he had the assurance to ask the first man inquiring $500 and then $400 an acre. On the 25th he sold to another at the latter price. He admits that he made no disclosure of anything he knew relative to the material circumstances which, if known to appellants, might have changed their minds and led to their refusing him this option.\nHe says, or rather tries to lead the court to believe, in the first place that he did not know anything material, and in the next place that what he did know was of the nature of suspicion, or mere rumours which were common property. He has not given anything in evidence to explain why, in two or three days, he had the assurance to demand $400 or $500 an acre from the first man he met likely to become a purchaser.\nIf he could have satisfied the court by reference to some sudden discovery after making the bargain, that would have removed the suspicion of unfair dealing, I have no doubt he would have given it.\nThe evening newspaper announcements may account for much, but I do not think the whole.\nIt is clear to my mind that if the appellants had known all respondent knew, or had reason to know to excite his expectation, he never would have secured the option.\nIt is also pretty clear that there was a something that induced the respondent suddenly to change his attitude of apathy taken relative to this property, from August, to that taken on the 19th of November as one of zealous anxiety.\nHe swears he did not know of the Canadian Pacific Railway developments. He may not actually have known, but I have not the slightest doubt he had good reason to suspect important developments. And especially so as he has failed to contradict or explain the evidence of Williams, who tells of the respondent saying some one had given a tip or hint. Indeed, he himself tells much that shews he had some reason to suspect things were moving, as it were.\nThe appellants were entitled to have these reasons that moved him disclosed to them. In saying so I have not overlooked the remark of Dart, \"Vendors and Purchasers,\" at page 39 of the 5th edition, that an agent\nneed not have pointed out a merely speculative advantage (such as the possibility of an unplanned though contemplated railroad running near the property) which might be reasonably supposed to be equally in the knowledge of both parties. This is, in substance, a quotation from the judgment of Vice-Chancellor Wigram in the case of Edwards v. Meyrick[3], and is, therefore, as well as from its adoption by the author, entitled to great respect in every case involving similar conditions of fact.\nThis case has only a very slight sort of resemblance in its facts to that, but, nevertheless, the dictum has given me such concern as to lead me to seek for authorities wherein it may have been applied in cases exhibiting facts more closely resembling those here in question. I have failed to find any. It is, of course, desirable that the doctrine of fiduciary relationship binding an agent for sale should not be stretched to cover cases where disclosure has taken place and through honest oversight an incidental circumstance presumably known to both parties has been overlooked in the disclosure made.\nIn this case there was no attempt at disclosure or recognition of the duty requiring it and the respondent frankly says he would not have told appellants if they had asked him.\nIndeed, the case, at the trial and throughout, has been treated as if the disclosure had not been made. But it seems to have been held that the mere listing of property with an agent for sale created no fiduciary relation.\nWith respect I cannot accept this latter view of the matter. The business of the respondent was to procure for those (listing property or in other words) entrusting him with the sale of property, purchasers thereof.\nThe naming of the rate of commission to be paid or terms upon which it is to be paid has nothing to do with the legal question as to what will constitute the relationship of principal and agent between the parties.\nThe sole question in such cases must always be whether or not the alleged agent has by his language or conduct, or both, constituted himself the agent of a principal assenting thereto and has undertaken the duty flowing therefrom.\nIn McPherson v. Watt[4], the Lord Chancellor points out in effect that it mattered not whether Watt was a gratuitous adviser or paid adviser; the sole question being whether or not in fact he had become the adviser.\nIn the case before us I have no doubt the question of commission was as well understood by both parties as it was by the respondent when the entry was made by him on his listing card shewing what is admitted to have been prim\u00e2 facie the usual rate.\nThere are some curious features in the case. Amongst others one is tempted to doubt whether or not the respondent did not in truth hesitate to take the position he now does.\nThe receipt given the sub-purchaser for the deposit got on the resale contains the following:\u2014\nThis receipt is given by the undersigned as agent and subject to the owner's confirmation.\nThe respondent himself signed his firm's name to this with a doubtful \"pro S. J. Nasmith.\" What owner did he mean? Or was it that the printed form merely said what he ought to have thought?\nWhen one looks at it thus and considers the facts and that the respondent seems to have been far from clear in his own mind when speaking to appellants later on the point of whether or not he should set up a claim to the commission, some curious speculations flit across one's mind.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs here and in the courts below and the action be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff, a real estate agent, sues for the specific performance of an agreement for the sale to him of certain lands of the defendants which he says resulted from his exercise or acceptance of an option to purchase such lands procured from the defendants on the 19th of November, 1910, in consideration of a cash payment of $50 which he then made to them. The document, under which the plaintiff claims, gave him for one month an exclusive agency to sell as well as an option to purchase the property in question at a stipulated price, $200 per acre, and upon terms specified. He effected a sale of it on the 25th November, he alleges on his own behalf, at $400 per acre.\nIn answer to the action, the defendants plead that the plaintiff did not in fact exercise his option to purchase and that the sale of the property at $400 per acre was effected by him on their behalf and as their agent. They also assert that in August, 1910, the plaintiff became their agent for the sale of the property in the ordinary way, that he was still such agent when he procured the option in November, and that, when seeking the option, he concealed from them certain material information which it was his duty to disclose. They maintain that the option which he ob- tained was thus vitiated and was voidable at their election.\nIt appears that the plaintiff sought the option to purchase in November because, as he himself says, he had reason to expect and did expect \"a sharp rise in real estate values there.\" He had heard rumours of prospective industrial developments in the neighbourhood, the announcement of which he believed would precipitate a marked increase in the market price of this property. He knew that an adjacent property which had been in his hands for sale, had been \"taken off the market for some good reason.\" These were circumstances which admittedly influenced his judgment as to the probable market value of the property in question. He must have known that they would be likely to influence the judgment of the defendants in deciding whether they should accede to his request for an option to purchase. \"This excitement that was on,\" he says, \"was the prime cause for my going there,\" i.e., to the defendants, to secure the option.\nInstead of imparting this information to the defendants (he says he would not have given it had they asked for it), the plaintiff apparently sought to mislead them. Although he had in view no purchaser other than himself or his partner, he talked to them as if he had a prospective purchaser and discussed the agricultural possibilities of the land. He practically admits that he did this in order \"to throw the defendants off the track.\"\nIf, when he went to them on the 19th November, the plaintiff was the defendants' agent to procure offers for the purchase of the property in question, he was, in my opinion, bound to disclose to them all material information which he had before taking from them for his own benefit an option to purchase it, and his deliberate concealment of such information\u2014if not active misrepresentation of the situation\u2014rendered the option which he secured voidable at their election. The materiality of that which he admits influenced his own judgment and action in the matter he cannot very well dispute.\nBut he insists that prior to the 19th November he was not the defendants' agent in any such sense as would impose upon him this duty of disclosure. The plaintiff first saw the defendants in August, 1910, with a view to purchasing another property from them. In the course of the negotiations about this other property, which came to naught, the defendants informed him that they owned the property now in question and wished to sell it. He admits that he told them that he handled \"outside properties\" and will not deny that he stated that his business was that of a real-estate broker. The defendant Wear says that he made this statement and that he then understood from him that he \"sold on commission.\" The defendant Bentley also says that he knew the plaintiff was a real-estate agent. I have no doubt that this was the fact, and the evidence makes it abundantly clear to me not only that the character of the plaintiff's business was known to the defendants, but that, to the knowledge of all parties, it was in his character as a real-estate agent that the defendants offered to place with him the sale of their property and that he took the \"listing\" of it. His own story is that, when the defendants told him he might sell it if he could, he took a memorandum of the description of the land and of the price and terms of sale on the spot. When he returned to his office he immediately \"listed\" the property on a card in the following form:\u2014\nDIST LOT.\nBLOCK.\nLOT.\nSTREET\nAND No.\nPRICE,\nINCLUDING\n5 PER CENT\nCOMMISSION\nTERMS\nWesterly\nSection\nLine\n46 Acres\nof\n7 Tp.\nAbove Govt.\n46 Acres\nS \u00bd of\n40 Dyke\nCleared\nS.E. \u00bc of\nGp. 2N.\nW.D.\nSoil A1\n$210\nDitched all\naround\n\u00bc cash\nBalance\nIn\n4 \u00bd years\nRemarks: Give as full particulars as possible on the other side. I HEREBY GIVE you the exclusive sale of the above property for. . . .\nThis, he admits, is precisely the course he always takes with properties placed in his hands as an agent for sale. He also says he thought later of offering the property under the authority thus given him to a prospective buyer.\nUpon these facts I have no doubt that the plaintiff took the listing of the property in the ordinary course of his business as a real-estate agent, intending the defendants to understand, as they did, that he was assuming towards them the duties and obligations which such an agent undertakes when an owner of property places it in his hands to secure a purchaser. While such an agent has no implied authority to enter into binding contracts on his principal's behalf\u2014while he may not be entitled to his commission, although he submits an offer in the terms stated by his employer, unless he procures the latter to accept it, it is his duty to exercise all reasonable diligence in procuring offers for the purchase of the property and to submit them to his principal. He is in his principal's employment from the moment of his retainer to procure offers. The consideration for the promise of the contingent remuneration or commission, which is implied, if not expressed, in the placing of the property in his hands, or the listing of it with him, is his undertaking not that he will merely sit idle and bring to his principal such offers as may come his way, but that he will exert his skill and energies to procure such offers, and that he will in every respect conduct the business entrusted to him to the best advantage and in the best interests of his employer, giving to the latter the benefit of all information which he has or may obtain that might influence his judgment in regard to the price or terms at or upon which the property should be sold. These, in my opinion, were the obligations which the plaintiff assumed towards the defendants as a result of their August interview, and the defendants had the right to rely upon his discharging them. That whatever relationship was then constituted between the parties continued until the 19th of November the plaintiff himself admits. He says that nothing had occurred to change it. In fact by the very document which he then procured he continued his agency on somewhat different terms. It follows, I think, that without disregarding a duty of his employment as a real estate agent the plaintiff could not procure a binding contract for the purchase of his employers' property for his own benefit unless he first placed them in as good position as he himself occupied to form a sound judgment as to the present and prospective value of such property.\nThis is an action for specific performance. In order to succeed in obtaining that equitable relief the conduct of the plaintiff in bringing about the contract upon which he claims it must have been irreproachable from the point of view of a court of equity. The court will refuse this relief if it appears that there is in the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract anything which renders it not fair and honest to call for its execution. This is so in the case of unintentional unfairness. A fortiori, will this course be followed when the unfairness results from the plaintiff having intentionally failed to discharge a duty which he owed to the defendant. Even if the facts established should be deemed insufficient as a defence to a common law action for damages for breach by the defendants of their agreement to sell, or to support an action by them for rescission (questions upon which I refrain from expressing an opinion), they are, in my opinion, clearly sufficient to require the court, in the exercise of its ample discretion in regard to granting or withholding the relief of specific performance, to dismiss this action.\nIn the view which I have taken it is unnecessary to determine the question whether, if he had an enforceable option to purchase, the plaintiff exercised it in such a manner that he would be entitled to assert the rights of a purchaser from the defendants.\nWith respect, I would, for the foregoing reasons, allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the provincial Court of Appeal, and would dismiss the action with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The first question that we have to consider is whether the respondent was the agent of the appellants when they gave him an option on their property. It appears by the evidence that a few months before the respondent, who is a real-estate agent, met the appellants and, as a result of that interview, the property in question was listed with him.\nIt was entered on a card which he was using in his office for the lands he had for sale and the price was entered on that card under the heading \"Price, including 5 per cent. commission, $210.\" That sum represented the price of $200 asked for by the proprietors and the $10 were for the commission. It was impossible for me to come to any other conclusion than that the respondent was the agent of the appellants.\nOnce that relation established, it became the duty of the respondent to acquaint his principals with all the information he had as to the value of the land. An agent is bound to disclose to his mandator all the circumstances that might alter his views.\nThe vital principle of all agencies is good faith, for without loyalty the relation of principal and agent could not well exist.\nThe agent must make a full and fair disclosure of all the facts and circumstances within his knowledge in any way calculated to enable the principal to base his opinion.\nIn this case, Nasmith, when he approached the appellants to have an option on their property, should have disclosed the knowledge he had of a rise in the value of that land and, not having done so, he will be responsible to the appellants for the sum obtained.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacNeill, Bird, Macdonald & Bayfield.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lucas & Lucas.\n[1] 16 B.C.

The will then provided \u201cthat should my said wife die leaving any of my said property or rights, in her possession or not disposed of,\u201d upon her said decease the same should be divided \u201camong our said children\u201d in the manner specified.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Review (Q.R. 40 S.C. 139, sub nom. Shearer v. Forman), that this provision did not empower the wife to dispose of the residue at the time of her death by will but had the effect of creating a substitution de residuo in favour of the children.\nAPPEAL from the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal[1], affirming the judgment of Lafontaine J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was originally instituted by Addie M. Shearer, one of the children of the testator, against her sister, the present appellant, and John Forman, her husband. The original plaintiff died and the present respondent, by reprise d'instance, became plaintiffs as the executor of the last will and testament. The action was dismissed in so far as it affected John Forman and was maintained in respect of the present appellant; no appeal having been taken in regard to the decision in favour of Forman, the judgment of the Court of Review merely affirmed the judgment of Mr. Justice Lafontaine against the appellant, Carrie Shearer. The clauses of the will of the late Andrew Shearer, in respect of which the dispute arises on the present appeal are quoted in the judgments now reported.\nLeo H. Davidson K.C. for the appellant.\nW. D. Lighthall K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The circumstances under which this will was made may help us materially to ascertain by interpretation of the language used what the intention of the testator was. Married under conditions which established community of property between himself and his wife, the testator wished evidently to provide for her and her four young daughters, two of whom were for some reason the object of his special solicitude. He had managed to accumulate a modest fortune barely sufficient, as he foresaw, to provide for the maintenance of those dependent on him in a very humble way. His estate at his death was valued at $7,000. Having confidence in his wife's prudence and capacity, which confidence has been fully justified, and to avoid, no doubt, the partition of the community, a costly and cumbersome proceeding, he gave her his estate burdened, however, with these obligations: 1st. That she should, during her lifetime, keep her children with her and provide for their education and maintenance according to their station in life; 2ndly. That such portion of the estate as might remain undisposed of or in her possession at her death should go to their four children in certain proportions which he fixes.\nThe words used in the will, and the interpretation of which has resulted in this litigation, are:\nAnd finally it is my desire, will and wish that should my said wife die leaving any of my said property or rights in her possession or not disposed of, the same should be divided among our said children as follows,\u201d etc.\nThe words which have created the embarrassment are, \u201cor not disposed of.\u201d Are those words mere surplusage in the sense that they add nothing to those that precede, as for instance, the words \u201cher heirs and assigns\u201d in the disposing clause; or are they words of amplification conferring power upon the widow to dispose of the estate by will, as they would if they were construed without reference to the context?\nTaken literally, I would be disposed to say that these words might be construed, in view of the context, to convey the right to dispose of the residue of the estate in her possession at death by will. In that way effect is given to each word; property which is the object of a testamentary disposition remains until death in the possession of the testator. \u201cLe mort saisit le vif.\u201d It is also possible to say that these words are mere surplusage, that is, the testator meant that property in possession of his wife in the sense that it was not disposed of by her by deed inter vivos would go to their children. That being a possible construction should, in my opinion, prevail as being most consistent with the clear intention of the testator whose chief desire evidently was to provide for the support and maintenance of those dependent upon him as far as his modest estate would permit. To hold that the widow had an absolute power of disposition by will would be to defeat the clearly-expressed object of the testator. Nothing is more apparent than his solicitude for the care and maintenance of his young and helpless family, and if he gave his widow the power free from any limitation of making a will she might in the event of her death following close upon his dispose of the estate for the benefit of absolute strangers. Nothing could be further from the thought of the testator. Any possible construction of the terms used by him which would prevent the happening of such a contingency should be adopted.\nI would dismiss this appeal and confirm the judgment below.\nDavies J.\u2014The controversy between the parties to this appeal depends for its solution entirely upon the construction given to the will of the late Andrew Shearer of Montreal.\nThe respondent claims that there was a substitution created by the will on the death of Mrs. Shearer and that he was the heir of one of the substitutes. The appellant's contention is that the will did not create a substitution, that the devise to the wife was absolute and that the power of disposition given to her of the property extended as well to a testamentary disposition as to one made in her lifetime.\nThe whole question is one of the testator's intention which is to be gathered not from any one phrase or sentence, but from the instrument read as a whole. The rules with respect to the construction of wills in the Province of Quebec are not different from those which prevail in all the other provinces of Canada. Articles 872 and 928 C.C. In all cases the intention of the testator, to be gathered from the whole instrument, is to govern.\nBy his will, executed in 1867, Andrew Shearer devised and bequeathed all the property, estates and rights, without exception, of which he should die possessed or entitled to unto his wife Elizabeth Crowe and her heirs and assigns for ever.\nFollowing this absolute devise of his property are the two paragraphs in question which read as follows:\nAnd, it is further my will and wish, that my said beloved wife keep with her our daughters as long as any of them may wish to remain, and especially that our daughters Addie and Edith, have such education and upbringing as she will be able to afford them according to their station in life, and that inasmuch as our second daughter, Tina, is afflicted with sickness that she should be her mother's special care, during her said mother's lifetime with such necessaries as she may be able to provide her with.\nAnd finally, it is my desire, will and wish, that should my said wife die leaving any of my said property or rights in her possession or not disposed of that upon her said decease, the same should be divided among our said children as follows:\u2014One-half thereof to our said daughter Tina, and the other half to our children, or those then living, in equal shares, one share to each of them, and their heirs and assigns forever.\nI do not think any reasonable doubt can exist as to the testator's intention as expressed in and gathered from the entire will.\nHe first gives the property to his wife absolutely and then he impresses upon his gift a trust during her lifetime for the maintenance, support and education of his daughters. The power of the wife to dispose of the property or any part of it for the purposes specified in the will during her life was unquestionable. The will then provided that if at her death any of the property remained \u201cin her possession or not disposed of\u201d upon her decease the same should be divided among their children in the manner he then proceeds to specify.\nThe whole question before us resolves itself into this:\u2014Do the words \u201cshould my wife die leaving any of my said property or rights in her possession or not disposed of\u201d give the wife the power of testamentary disposition over the property; or is the disposition referred to one to be made by her during her life?\nI think the latter expresses the true intention of the testator. There seemed to be much difficulty in giving a meaning to the words \u201cin her possession\u201d preceding those \u201cor not disposed of.\u201d I am inclined to think they were inserted to cover the possible case of proceeds of property disposed of by the wife and which were at her death in her possession and held by her to be applied as the will prescribed for her own maintenance and that of her children. At any rate they are applicable to such a condition and to such process. The remainder of the property not sold would be embraced by the words \u201cor not disposed of.\u201d General words giving a power of disposition unless controlled by their context may well be held to embrace testamentary disposition. I cannot think they do so as they stand in this will. Such a construction would seem to me to be opposed to the testator's entire plan as to the disposition of his property. His wife gets the absolute power of disposition over it during her life for her own and her children's maintenance and the latter's education, and all the property not, in the wife's judgment, disposed of by her in her lifetime, for the persons and purpose he specially indicates, is to be divided among his children in the proportions he specifies. To construe the words \u201cor not disposed of\u201d as giving the wife a testamentary power of disposition which might be used to give the property to strangers or, as in fact the widow attempted to use it, to give the undisposed of property to one child to the exclusion of the others would be to defeat the testator's intention and the plan and object he evidently had in mind when framing his will.\nI conclude, therefore, that the respondent's construction of the will is the correct one and that it created a substitution, on the death of Mrs. Shearer, with respect to the then undisposed of property in favour of the testator's children.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014As I interpret the language of the will in question, it cannot be construed otherwise than as creating the substitution found therein by the courts below and, therefore, would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014It is conceded by counsel on both sides that if the words \u201cdesire, will and wish,\u201d in the fifth paragraph of the will, are properly construed as words of disposition and not of recommendation merely then the disposition effected by that paragraph is in law incompatible with the vesting in the widow of powers of disposition by will. I have no doubt that the words in question must be construed as words of disposition; and it follows, consequently, that the widow had no power of disposition by will and that a substitution de residuo was created.\nAnglin J.\u2014Notwithstanding the absolute terms in which the testator has couched the legacy to his wife, observing the fundamental rule of construction which prescribes that testamentary intention should be gathered from the entire will (arts. 928 and 872 C.C.), this bequest must be held to be subject to such qualifications and restrictions as will give due effect to the provisions which follow it. By the first of these the widow's power of disposition of the property during her life is made subject to the rights of her daughters Addie, Edith and Tina to maintenance, care and education. It is the manifest intention of the testator that the property bequeathed to his wife shall be used by her for these purposes and for her own support. Actuated by the same wish he proceeds to state that it is his \u201cdesire, will and wish,\u201d not that his wife shall by her will make a designated disposition of so much of his property as shall at her death be left \u201cin her possession or not disposed of,\u201d but that such property shall under the operation of his own will pass to his children in defined shares. While this is clearly intended as a dispositive provision, its effect is perhaps not so obvious.\nThe subject of the gift over to the children is such of the property bequeathed to her as the widow dies \u201cpossessed of\u201d and such of it as she leaves \u201cnot disposed of.\u201d It is a little difficult, at first blush, to appreciate what the testator had in mind which might be property not disposed of and yet not in possession of his widow at her death. But, although at first inclined to read \u201cor\u201d as \u201cand,\u201d since it is conceivable that some of the property though not disposed of might, nevertheless, be out of the widow's actual possession at the time of her death, I do not think we would be justified in substituting \u201cand\u201d for \u201cor.\u201d It is not clear that it is necessary to do so in order to carry out the testator's intention. What is the restriction imposed upon the widow's power of disposition? On a literal reading of the will she is first denied the power to alienate any of the testator's property of which she dies possessed. This prima facie excludes the power of disposition by will because, ordinarily, she would die possessed of property which she might thus dispose of. Confining the application of the words \u201cor not disposed of\u201d to such property (if any) as though not in her physical possession yet belonged to her at her death (i.e., had not been alienated) as must be done to give to them any effect, when read in conjunction with the other words \u201cin her possession,\u201d do they import a power of disposition by will? I think not. Although, if they stood alone, the words \u201cnot disposed of\u201d might well mean \u201cnot disposed of by act inter vivos or by will\u201d (Pothier, \u0152uvres, vol. 8, \u201cDes Substitutions,\u201d s. 4, No. 149), when taken in conjunction with the words \u201cin her possession\u201d and treating these latter words as not being mere surplusage, but as intended to impose some real restraint on the widow's power of alienation, I think the words \u201cnot disposed of\u201d should be read as \u201cnot disposed of by act inter vivos\u201d and, therefore, as not implying a right in the widow to make a disposition by will. On this question of construction, Stevenson v. Glover[2], referred to by Mr. Justice Lafontaine, is in point.\nThe words \u201cnot disposed of\u201d are satisfied by a construction which restricts them to disposal by acts inter vivos, and that construction seems to me to best accord, not only with the words immediately preceding, but also with what appears to be the governing intention of the testator, namely, that, while giving his wife the control, management and disposition of his entire estate during her life in order to provide for her own needs and for the education, maintenance and care of his children, he wishes by the dispositions of his own will to secure to the children what should remain of his estate upon his wife's decease.\nIn view of the form of the bequests to the wife (art. 944 C.C.), the powers of disposition given her (arts. 952, 975, 976 C.C.), and the dispositive provision by which the daughters take the property undisposed of or in the widow's possession at her death not from her, but directly from the testator (art. 962 C.C.), and having regard to article 928 C.C., I respectively concur in the conclusion of the learned judges of the Superior Court and Court of Review that we have here a case of substitution of residue. Its scope and extent I have indicated above.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and the conclusions of the judgments of the Superior Court should be confirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davidson & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lighthall & Harwood.\n[1] Q.R. 40 S.C. 139, sub nom.

VII. c. 42, amended by 9 Edw. VII. c. 51\u2014Prohibition of theatrical performances\u2014Local, municipal and police regulations\u2014Criminal law\u2014Legislative jurisdiction\u2014Validation by federal legislation\u2014\u201cLord\u2019s Day Act\u201d R.S.C., 1906, c. 153.\nIn the \u201cAct respecting the observance of Sunday,\u201d 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42 (Que.), as amended by 9 Edw. VII. ch. 51 (Que.), the provisions prohibiting theatrical performances on Sunday are not of the character of local, municipal or police regulations. On the proper construction of the legislation, treated as a whole, they purport to create offences against criminal law and, consequently, are not within the legislative competence of a provisional legislature under the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d The Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Hamilton Street Railway Co. ([1903] A.C. 524) followed. The legislation in question derives no validity from the provisions of the \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 27. Judgment appealed from (Q.R. 20 K.B. 416) reversed, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nPer Idington J., dissenting.\u2014The provisions of section 2 of the statute 7 Edw. VII., ch. 42 (Que.), are severable from one another as well as from the other provisions of the statute, and, consequently, although other provisions may be ultra vires, the prohibition in respect of theatrical performances on Sunday is a police regulation which is within the competence of the provincial legislature.\nPer Brodeur J., dissenting.\u2014The legislation in question deals merely with local matters affecting police regulations and civil rights within the province and, consequently, is intra vires of the Legislature of Quebec.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], affirming, but for different reasons, the judgment of Pagnuelo J., in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal.\nInformations were laid in the Police Court for the City of Montreal against the appellant charging him with having carried on a business and given theatrical performances and representations, in the City of Montreal, on Sunday, on certain dates mentioned in the month of August, 1910, for profit and without necessity or urgency, in contravention of the Quebec statutes respecting the observance of Sunday, 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42, amended by 9 Edw. VII. ch. 51. In consequence, the appellant sued out a writ of prohibition to prohibit the police magistrates of the City of Montreal (the respondents), from taking cognizance of the complaints.\nThe appellant was proprietor of a theatre, in the City of Montreal, in which he exhibited \u201cmoving pictures\u201d and which he kept open to the public on Sundays. The principal grounds invoked by him in support of the writ of prohibition were that the police magistrates had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints in the informations and that the statutes under which he was charged with the offences were ultra vires of the Legislature of Quebec. The Attorney- General for the Province of Quebec was made a party to the proceedings and, with the respondents, contested the action.\nIn the Superior Court, Mr. Justice Pagnuelo quashed the writ and his decision was affirmed by the judgment appealed from[2], but for different reasons. In the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Trenholme and Cross JJ. differed in opinion with the majority of the judges of that court (Jett\u00e9 C.J. and Archambault and Carroll JJ.), but concurred in the result on the ground that the informations had been validly preferred in virtue of the provisions of the \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act,\u201d R.S.C. 1906, ch. 153.\nThe questions in issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Lacroix K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Donat Brodeur K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The object of this appeal is not to ascertain whether, on some technical ground, the information, which is the basis of these proceedings, can be sustained; but to test the constitutional validity of section 2 of the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42, as amended by 9 Edw. VII. ch. 51. That section is in these words:\u2014\nNo person shall, on Sunday, for gain, except in cases of necessity or urgency, do or cause to he done any industrial work, or pursue any business or calling, or give or organize theatrical performances, or excursions where intoxicating liquors are sold, or take part in or be present at such theatrical performances, or excursions. The contention of the respondent is that it was competent to the Quebec Legislature to enact that section on the ground that it is in the nature of a municipal or police regulation of a purely local character. It is also argued that an act or default may be forbidden by statute in such a way that the person guilty may be liable to a pecuniary penalty which is recoverable as a debt by civil process by a private person, or, in some cases, only by an officer of the Crown. In which case such an act or default may be an offence against the statute, but is not a crime. Halsbury, vol. 9, p. 233, note.\nI most regretfully have come to the conclusion that the section in question is not a local, municipal or police regulation, for the breach of which a pecuniary penalty is imposed, but legislation designed to promote public order, safety and morals.\nThe section purports to deal with a subject, \u201cthe observance of Sunday,\u201d which is not within the legislative jurisdiction of a provincial legislature and is already the subject of criminal legislation, as appears upon reference to the statute 29 Car. II. ch. 7, part of the criminal law of England declared to be in force by the \u201cQuebec Act,\u201d 14 Geo. III. ch. 83.\nIt must be accepted as settled that \u201ccriminal law,\u201d in the widest and fullest sense, is reserved for the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament, subject to an exception of the legislation which is necessary for the purpose of enforcing, whether by fine, penalty or imprisonment, any of the laws validly made under the \u201cenumerative heads\u201d of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867.\u201d In Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[3], their Lordships, it is quite true, gave no opinion with respect to the validity of the section of the Act they were considering (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 246) by which tramway companies were, subject to certain exceptions, prohibited from working their trains on Sunday; but they held the phrase \u201cCriminal Law,\u201d in section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d free from ambiguity and that, construed by its plain and ordinary meaning, it would include every such law as purports to deal with public wrongs, that is to say with offences against society rather than against the private citizen. Apply this test to the section we are now considering, assuming a breach of the prohibition, what private right could possibly be affected and for what conceivable violation of the section would a private citizen have recourse? In Russell v. The Queen[4], at page 838, their Lordships says:\u2014\nLaws of this nature (\u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d) designed for the promotion of public order, safety and morals, and which subject those who contravene them to criminal procedure and punishment belong to the subject of public wrongs rather than to that of civil rights\nAustin tells us, Jurisprudence, Lect. XXVII.:\u2014\nIn short, the distinction between private and public wrongs or civil injuries and crimes would seem to consist in this:\u2014\nWhere the wrong is a civil injury, the sanction is enforced at the discretion of the party whose right has been violated.\nWhere the wrong is a crime, the sanction is enforced at the discretion of the Sovereign.\nIn what respect can it be said that working on Sunday, or attendance at theatrical performances or excursions on that day, the things that are forbidden, constitute a civil injury against a private individual for which he has a remedy? The penalty, in case of breach, belongs to the Crown and can only be recovered under the summary conviction sections of the Criminal Code. It would appear also as if section 7 of the provincial Act was intended to prevent the enforcement of the penalty, except at the discretion of the Sovereign acting through the Attorney-General. It appears to me on the whole abundantly clear that the intention of the legislature was to forbid certain things which, in its opinion, are calculated to interfere with the proper observance of Sunday. In the Hamilton Street Railway Case[5] their Lordships hold, impliedly at least, that Christianity is part of the common law of the realm; that the observance of the Sabbath is a religious duty; and that a law which forbids any interference with that observance is, in its nature, criminal. See also Pringle v. Town of Napanee[6]; Cowan v. Milbourn[7]; Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors[8], at page 198.\nIt is impossible for me to believe that the legislature intended, by the enactment in question, to regulate civil rights. On the contrary, the evident object was to conserve public morality and to provide for the peace and order of the public on the Lord\u2019s Day. I am confirmed in this belief by the title of the Act which is described as \u201cA law concerning the observance of Sunday\u201d; and, as Sedgewick J., speaking for the majority of this court, said in O\u2019Connor v. Nova Scotia Telephone Co.[9], at page 293; \u201cWe cannot with propriety shut our eyes to the words of the title.\u201d Vide also Fielding v. Morley Corporation[10], where it was held that\nthe title of an Act of Parliament is to be read as part of the enactments.\nThe profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day was an indictable offence at common law; 2 Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law (2 ed.), p. 20; 13 Encyclop\u00e6dia of the Laws of England, vo., \u201cSunday.\u201d Blackstone classifies those laws under the criminal law (offences against religion, morals and public convenience) and says:\u2014\nProfanation of the Lord\u2019s Day, vulgarly but improperly called Sabbath breaking, is another offence of the class now in question. 4 Stephens Com. Bk. VI. ch. 9.\nIn the enumeration of offences which may be tried summarily, Halsbury (vol. 9, No. 161), includes, at page 80, those arising out of breaches of the Sunday observance law (29 Car. II., ch. 7). See also Rawlins v. Ellis[11]. In the report of the Commissioners on Criminal Law, vol. 2, at page 81, under the general heading of \u201cOffences against religion,\u201d the Commissioners says:\u2014\nCertain religious observances, such for instance as that of the Sabbath, may properly be conceived as exercising so important and beneficial an influence on moral conduct, that the wanton violation of them ought to be prevented by penal laws. The other general principle which we have above referred to as furnishing a legitimate foundation for all laws of the class we are now considering may also, to a certain extent, be applicable, namely, that with respect to institutions and observances which carry strongly with them the opinions and feelings of the community, and open defiance of them may justly be the subject of punishment. In the absence of provincial enactments which make sections 889 to 1124 and 1125 of the Criminal Code applicable to prosecutions under the Quebec Laws \u2014 and we have not been referred to any \u2014 I would hesitate to hold with Mr. Justice Cross that the charge\nalthough set out and made as for offences against the ineffective provincial Acts * * * should not fail merely because of its having been laid as a violation of a wrongly cited statute, if it were in other respects a charge of an offence known to the law and triable by a magistrate.\nI have always understood the rule to be that a prosecutor could not ground the one charge in his information upon two Acts, passed one by Parliament and the other by a provincial legislature, which contain separate and distinct provisions, no more than a statutory offence could be blended in the same count with one at common law.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the Province of Quebec quashing a writ of prohibition issued against the police magistrates of the City of Montreal prohibiting them from proceeding further in certain prosecutions against the appellant, Ouimet, for having had on the first and eighth days of August\nfor profit without necessity and urgency carried on a business and given theatrical representations on Sunday.\nThe complaint was made and the prosecutions instituted under the Quebec Acts. 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42, and 9 Edw. VII. ch. 51. The former is intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the Observance of the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d The principal sections are as follows:\u2014\n1. The laws of this legislature, whether general or special, respecting the observance of Sunday and in force on the twenty-eighth day of February, 1907, shall continue in force until amended, replaced or repealed: and every person shall be and remain entitled to do on Sunday any act not forbidden by the Acts of legislature, in force on the said date, or subject to the restrictions contained in this Act, to enjoy on Sunday all such liberties as are recognized by the customs of this province.\n2. No person shall, on Sunday, for gain, except in cases of necessity or urgency, do or cause to be done any industrial work, or pursue any business or calling, or give or organize theatrical performances, or excursions where intoxicating liquors are sold, or take part in or be present at such theatrical performances, or excursions.\nSections 3 and 4 provide for punishment for offences against the Act by fine and imprisonment.\nSec. 5.\u2014Nothing in the present Act shall repeal the Acts of this legislature now in force concerning the observance of Sunday, nor any by-laws passed thereunder, which laws and by-laws shall continue in full force and effect until amended, replaced or repealed according to law.\nThe amendment of 1909 increases the fines and imprisonment for subsequent offences.\nThe question raised for our consideration is as to the constitutionality of these Acts; that is, whether they were, as a whole, ultra vires of the Legislature of Quebec.\nI was one of the judges of this court who, on a reference from the Governor-General in Council \u201cIn the matter of the jurisdiction of a province to legislate respecting abstention from labour on Sunday\u201d[12], advised him, in answer to a question submitted to us whether the legislature of a province had authority to enact a statute in the terms of a draft bill annexed to the question\nthat we were unable to distinguish the draft bill then submitted for our opinion from the Act pronounced as ultra vires of the provincial legislature by the Judicial Committee in the reference made by the Government of Ontario to the Court of Appeal of that province in the matter of the Hamilton Street Railway Company reported in appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[13]\nThe judges of this court who joined in giving that answer were of opinion that\nthe day commonly called Sunday or the Sabbath or the Lord\u2019s Day is recognized in all Christian countries as an existing institution and that legislation having for its object the compulsory observance of such day or the fixing of rules of conduct (with the usual sanctions) to be followed on that day is legislation properly falling within the views expressed by the Judicial Committee in the Hamilton Street Railway reference before referred to and is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nTurning for a moment to this decision of the Judicial Committee in which it was held that the Act there in question (R.S.O., 1897, ch. 246), intituled \u201cAn Act to Prevent the Profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day,\u201d treated as a whole, was beyond the competency of the Ontario Legislature to enact, it will be seen that this Act was originally enacted by the late Province of Upper Canada, before 1867, the legislature of which was competent for the purpose, but was consolidated and amended by extending and enlarging its provisions by the Act of the Province of Ontario passed in 1897. It was the validity or constitutionality of the consolidated Act that their Lordships were called upon to determine. Had the Legislature of Ontario the power to re-enact the original Act in its original form or to re-enact it enlarging its scope and extending its provisions prohibiting work on Sunday? The answer of their Lordships, shortly, was that the legislature had no such power because the Act, treated as a whole, was beyond its competency to enact. The reasons for their conclusion given by the Lord Chancellor are short and to the point. He says:\u2014\nThe question turns upon a very simple consideration. The reservation of the criminal law for the Dominion of Canada is given in clear and intelligible words which must be construed according to their natural and ordinary signification. Those words seem to their Lordships to require, and indeed to admit, of no plainer exposition than the language itself affords. Section 91, sub-section 27, of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d reserves for the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d It is, therefore, the criminal law in its widest sense that is reserved, and it is impossible, notwithstanding the very protracted argument to which their Lordships have listened, to doubt that an infraction of the Act, which in its original form, without the amendment afterwards introduced, was in operation at the time of Confederation, is an offence against the criminal law. The fact that from the criminal law generally there is one exception, namely, \u201cthe constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction,\u201d renders it more clear, if anything were necessary to render it more clear, that with that exception (which obviously does not include what has been contended for in this case) the criminal law in its widest sense, is reserved for the exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe pith of this judgment lies in the meaning they gave to section 91, sub-section 27, of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867, reserving for the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada \u201cthe criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction\u201d and in their judgment the words \u201ccriminal law,\u201d as used in section 91 of our \u201cConstitutional Act,\u201d mean criminal law in its widest sense.\nI have heard nothing to induce me to change the opinion in which I joined with my brother judges, in giving advice to the Governor-General in Council on the draft bill for prohibiting, on Sunday, the performance of work and labour, transaction of business, engaging in sport for gain, and keeping open places of entertainment. Nor am I able to discover any substantial distinction between the Act of the Legislature of Quebec we are now considering and the draft bill upon which this court, in 1905, gave its opinion.\nThe object and purpose of each was to prohibit, on Sunday, the performance of work and labour, transaction of business or giving or taking part in theatrical performances, etc.\nI do not mean to say that the Quebec legislation now in question and the draft bill with respect to which the opinion I have referred to was given cover the same ground. The prohibitions in one differ somewhat from those in the other and those in the draft bill are doubtless broader and more extensive than in the Quebec Act.\nThat, however, cannot affect the right to legislate on the subject-matter dealt with which is the same in both cases. I am of opinion that they are both beyond the competence of the provincial legislature as being within the exclusive right of the Parliament of Canada under sub-section 27 of section 91 of our \u201cConstitutional Act\u201d\u2014\u201cthe criminal law except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction.\u201d\nI add this qualification, that the first and sixth sections of the Quebec Act now before us, 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42, may be said to permit certain things or acts to be done on Sunday prohibited by the federal Act of 1906 and, in so far as it does so permit, these sections may be intra vires the Quebec Legislature under the powers delegated and conceded to it by the Dominion legislation.\nBut it is contended that the Quebec Legislature derived, from the above federal Act, power to legislate on the subject of Sunday observance and that such federal legislation \u201cvalidated\u201d and gave life to provincial legislation which might otherwise be ultra vires. My construction of the federal Act is that it was an attempt to enact generally prohibitive legislation with regard to the proper observance of Sunday or the Lord\u2019s Day for the whole of Canada. But that, recognizing the different circumstances, habits, customs and religious beliefs which prevailed in the several provinces of the Dominion, Parliament determined to delegate to each provincial legislature the power to declare that any act or thing prohibited by the Dominion Act might be exempted from the operation of such act and permitted to be done by provincial legislation existing at the time the federal Act came into force or subsequently enacted.\nAs to the power of the Parliament of Canada so to delegate its powers I have no doubt whatever. Our statutes are full of legislation of a similar kind and, holding the Parliament of Canada to be a Sovereign Parliament within its powers as defined by our \u201cConstitutional Act,\u201d I cannot doubt that, legislating within these powers, it can delegate to another person, body or authority the power to make a law as binding and effective as if embodied in one of its own statutes.\nIf I have properly construed the power of the Parliament of Canada to legislate exclusively on this subject, the observance of Sunday or the Lord\u2019s Day, and have also properly construed the federal Act of 1906 on that subject, the only question to be answered respecting the validity of the provincial legislation on the subject now before us is whether it is legislation permitting something to be done on Sunday which has been prohibited by the Dominion Act. If it is, such legislation is valid because power so to legislate is given by the federal Act. If, on the contrary, the provincial legislation is in itself prohibitive and not permissive, and just so far as it is of that character, it is ultra vires.\nApplying this rule to the second section of the Act now before us and under which the prosecutions were brought, and limiting my opinion to the one point desired by counsel to be determined, I conclude that the legislation of the province now in question is beyond the competence of the legislature and that, therefore, this appeal must be allowed and the judgment quashing the writ of prohibition vacated with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant seeks to have respondents prohibited from proceeding with the trial of charges laid before the police magistrate of Montreal alleging an infringement of 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42, as amended by chapter 51 of 9 Edw. VII., passed by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec.\nThe second section of the latter Act is as follows:\u2014\n2. No person shall, on Sunday, for gain, except in cases of necessity or urgency, do or cause to be done any industrial work, or pursue any business or calling, or give or organize theatrical performances, or excursions where intoxicating liquors are sold, or take part in or be present at such theatrical performances, or excursions.\nThe question raised is as to the power of the legislature to so enact.\nIt is claimed this is criminal legislation within the meaning of section 91, sub-section 27, of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which assigns the exclusive power of legislation on the subject of\nthe criminal law, except the constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters\nto the Parliament of Canada.\nThere are two summonses in the appeal case presented; one of the 14th of August, and the other of the 21st of August. The former makes the charge without specifying the statute it infringes. The latter specifically assigns a contravention of the statutes above referred to. Singularly enough both allege as if a single offence what, to my mind, clearly covers two offences against the Act.\nThe above quoted statute clearly constitutes a distinctly independent offence, or perhaps two, in prohibiting the doing of \u201cany industrial work or business\u201d and by the following words other independent offences. Each is thus described and separated by the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d\nBut in the summons they are coupled together by the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d which is not the language of the Act.\nThe parties desire to have the constitutional question determined and raise no point regarding this objectionable misjoinder of offences which, in itself, is possibly amendable by the magistrate if objected to.\nIt is, therefore, not in that sense I refer to this minor matter, but to bring out in relief or so far as I can the real meaning of the statute as I read it.\nIf objection had been taken to this misjoinder and the magistrate had refused to amend and convicted and made his conviction follow the exact language of the summons, or of the statute, his conviction would have been bad in form and liable to be quashed for thus embracing two offences in one conviction, or bad from uncertainty arising from its alternative form which would, therefore, cover neither offence.\nTested thus we have in the same section a number of new offences created of which one is doing or causing \u201cto be done any industrial work,\u201d and another is pursuing \u201cany business or calling.\u201d This latter is said to be, and I assume it to be a bad translation of the French version \u201cun * * n\u00e9goce.\u201d\nThat being assumed does not mend matters much for the present argument. It still leaves an enactment of a very wide comprehensive meaning and I venture to think almost, if not altogether as much so as the Ontario enactment, E.S.O. [1897] ch. 246, sec. 1, which was before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of The Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Hamilton Street Railway Co.[14], and which reads as follows:\u2014\n1. It is not lawful for any merchant, tradesman, farmer, artificer, mechanic, workman, labourer or other person whatsoever on the Lord\u2019s Day, to sell or publicly shew forth, or expose, or offer for sale, or to purchase, any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate whatsoever, or to do or exercise any worldly labour, business or work, of his ordinary calling (conveying travellers or Her Majesty\u2019s mail, by land or by water, selling drugs and medicines, and other works of necessity and works of charity only excepted).\nThe first question in said case submitted to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and brought by way of appeal therefrom under the consideration of the Judicial Committee was as follows:\u2014\n1. Had the Legislature of Ontario jurisdiction to enact chapter 246 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, intituled \u201cAn Act to prevent the Profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day,\u201d and in particular sections 1, 7 and 8 thereof?\nThe Judicial Committee, speaking through the Lord Chancellor, disposed of it as follows:\u2014\nThe Lord Chancellor.\u2014Their Lordships are of opinion that the Act in question, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, chapter 246, intituled \u201cAn Act to prevent the Profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day,\u201d treated as a whole, was beyond the competency of the Ontario Legislature to enact, and they are accordingly of opinion that the first question which was referred to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the Lieutenant-Governor, pursuant to chapter 84 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, ought to be answered in the negative.\nThen the court intimates the opinion so expressed rendered it unnecessary to answer the second question which rather looked to future legislation, and declined to answer further the remaining hypothetical questions submitted.\nIn order to estimate properly the effect of the expression \u201ctreated as a whole\u201d in the above opinion we must look at the remaining sections of the said Ontario Act.\nSection 2 deals with political meetings, tippling, brawling, etc.; section 3 with games and amusements; section 4 with hunting; section 5 with fishing; section 6 with bathing in exposed situations, and each of these things if done on Sunday is declared to be unlawful.\nSections 7 and 8 prohibit steamboat and railway excursions for hire, and the running of street cars on Sunday.\nCondensing them thus each offence may not be accurately described, but I think they are sufficiently so to shew the nature of the Act when I add that there were penal clauses and prosecutions therefor provided in the Act.\nThe recovery of these penalties before a justice of the peace was provided for and he so far as the Act could was enabled thereby to direct a warrant to levy on the goods of the offender and in default of realizing the penalty and costs to imprison for a term not exceeding three months.\nWhen we compare the sweepingly comprehensive language, first quoted, of the Quebec statute with this wherein lies the difference?\nThere is a greater multiplicity of words in the Ontario Act than in the other. But, when condensed, each reaches to almost every activity of mankind in their daily avocations. The specific things in the Ontario Act, not embraced in this comprehensive language used by the Quebec Act, are comparatively unimportant as a test relative to criminal legislation by which to distinguish the one Act from the other.\nSo comprehensive is the language in question here that it runs athwart the courses of business and transactions of men which they are only enabled to do by virtue of Dominion legislation. Counsel for respondent says that is not intended. But the Act discriminates not and covers the case of the banker and the railway manager or superintendent and all under him or them, as well as the case of the corner grocer or village blacksmith.\nThe Quebec farmer or professional man might work and possibly escape the operation of the Quebec Act whilst the Ontario Act leaves less chance of such escape from its drag-net.\nBut is that what can enable us to distinguish between them? And so distinguish as to say the ruling does not bind us? I confess I cannot see my way clear to do so.\nThe argument for a power of delegation from the Dominion Parliament may be good or bad. I need express ho opinion for I fail to see the existence of any delegation in regard to this legislation now in question. Nor do I find anything by way of reference that can constitute its adoption by Parliament directly or indirectly. All I do find is that exceptions to be presumed by us here as quite proper exceptions are made in the \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 153, by sections 5, 7 and 8, which cannot help here where that Act, by consent of the parties, is in its direct operative effect excluded from our consideration. Admittedly there exists no consent of the Attorney-General to this prosecution, which is needed to render the \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act,\u201d in such a case, operative in Quebec.\nIn section 16 of that Act there is said to be something to get round all this.\nThat section in its first part guards against being held to repeal provincial legislation then existing. It is said that this proper exception in order to prevent vexatious meddling is a something that creates. I cannot think so. Nor do I think the second part of the section, declaring that an offender against the Act who is on the facts violating \u201cany other Act or law\u201d may be prosecuted under either, helps.\nIt is to be observed that this obviously pre-supposes \u201cthe Act or law\u201d to be a law and not a nullity.\nEach act is intended by this section to be independent of any other.\nIn touching such a complex subject as this has become by the mass of legislation and judicial decision bearing upon it, this section is eminently proper for the purpose it was framed. That was to avoid friction and confusion.\nI would not hold any man liable to prosecution on any provincial legislation resting solely upon this language of said section 16 to give it a vitality it did not carry in its own language when resting on the powers of the legislature of the province enacting it.\nSo far as these prosecutions rest on the comprehensive legislation in the first part of the section consisting of the two members thereof covering trade or business, and which I have dealt with, I think they should be prohibited. But is there not presented in same section another offence of giving or organizing theatrical performances for gain which is something severable as the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d indicates, and entirely different on its face and gives rise to entirely different considerations from those applicable to the preceding parts I have just disposed of?\nI do not know what conceivable cases of necessity or urgency can exist in relation to running a theatre on Sunday. I will assume that exception relates only to the cases falling under the part of the section with which I have dealt. But I cannot help remarking that the existence of this exception so looked at debars us from being able to make of the whole section only one enactment prohibiting work or business when so considered relative to giving on Sunday theatrical performances or excursions where intoxicating liquors are sold helps to sever these two prohibitions from the rest of the Act and permit of them being considered on their several legal merits.\nWhether this severance is quite satisfactory or not, it is desirable, having regard to the main object of the parties, to treat the case as if it were clearly so.\nI think the giving on Sunday of theatrical performances or excursions of the kind described may well be prohibited by provincial legislation. The prohibition of such a specific act as either might well find a precedent in the many cases recognizing the right of a province to make such mere police regulations as the social habits and conditions existing in that province may require.\nIt is said by counsel for appellant that these precedents rest upon the licensing power, but I do not think the principles observed in reaching the conclusion rested there in all of them.\nI do not propose analyzing the cases in detail, but select as utterly free from this suggestion of dependence on the licensing power the case of Reg. v. Wason [15], and vol. 4, Cartwright\u2019s Cases on the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d page 578, when the Court of Appeal for Ontario, then composed of Chief Justice Hagarty, Mr. Justice Burton, late Chief Justice of the same court, Mr. Justice Osier, and Mr. Justice Maclennan, later and till recently a member of this court, upheld legislation prohibiting the knowingly and wilfully selling to a cheese or butter manufactory milk diluted with water, or adulterated, or from which the cream had been taken, without notifying the owner or manager of the factory, and subjecting the offender to a penalty.\nI had previously to the legislation thus enacted and passed upon, formed the opinion it was competent for a provincial legislature to pass it. I see no reasons to change the opinion I then formed.\nThe decision is, of course, not binding upon us, but the principles upon which that court proceeded seem to me sound and the relation of the subject to then existing federal legislation gives it a peculiar aptness to be considered in this case.\nThe reported argument of Mr. Blake in appeal as well as the reasons of the several judges in giving judgment are certainly instructive if not binding.\nThe case of Hodge v. The Queen[16] shews the regulation there in question dealt with a prohibition against playing billiards in a licensed hotel on Sunday. But though as suggested by appellant\u2019s counsel that arose out of the licensing power or regulation we are only carried back a step further for the licensing power itself was, by sub-section 9, of section 92, only for the raising of revenue.\nAnother and a broader reason lies at the foundation of this and all the other decisions upholding the power of regulation and prohibition of the liquor selling business.\nThe powers assigned by sections 8, 13 and 16, as well as sub-section 9, have in turn had to be relied upon.\nThe preventing of playing billiards in a licensed hotel on Sunday, does not seem very closely related to the licensing power. The decision in that regard rather shews that circumstances or conditions may arise which render it a proper thing for the consideration by a local legislature and foundation for doing something to eradicate an evil which is not likely to be dealt with by Parliament.\nI should pause before saying it was powerless to do so for I can conceive a legislature of a province being confronted with conditions which it alone would be likely to deal with and which the ordinary scope of the criminal law would not reach.\nA great deal of our municipal legislation is and must as our cities grow be still more of this character.\nTrue this is not a municipal regulation, but suppose the legislature chose to assign the power to city municipalities to make such regulation respecting theatrical exhibitions as that here in question, can it be said it would then be legislating ultra vires? We, at least, in City of Montreal v. Beauvais[17], have gone quite as far in upholding a by-law enabled by the legislature for closing shops after certain hours. That was for a closing of shops and rested upon the powers given by the sub-sections to which I have referred, and this is for a closing of a house of another kind for a whole day. I may add that leave to appeal from our decision in that case was refused by the Judicial Committee.\nEach was, no doubt, intended to promote by such police regulations the health and moral well-being of the people.\nNeither is necessarily within the criminal law.\nThe remarks of Lord Davey in City of Toronto v. Virgo[18], at page 93, point in the direction of what I am trying to reach in that regard.\nAnd this now in question being of the character I have referred to as being within the power of the legislature I do not think it should be held null because of the constitutionally evil company it is found in.\nThe latter circumstance, of course, makes its maintenance more difficult. And though I am unable to see how any of the Act can rest directly upon the federal legislation pointed to, it is clear that the circumstance of Parliament desiring to maintain local legislation of such a character is not an argument against the maintenance of its validity.\nIn the view I have taken it is almost needless to add it is not a well-drawn Act, or at least not as effective as one might now be made if the draughtsmen were set to work with the present state of the federal legislation. Or the licensing power and its consequent power of regulation might be resorted to.\nWhat can be done thus indirectly, I submit, may be upheld when done directly.\nI think the prohibition should not extend to a charge properly confined to the prohibition of any theatrical representation on Sunday for gain. It seems severable from the ultra vires part of the Act.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed in part and that being a divided success should carry no costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The Quebec statute which is impeached on this appeal professes to create offences which, in my opinion, if validly created would be offences against the criminal law within the meaning of section 91, sub-section 27, of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d The enactment appears to me, in effect, to treat the acts prohibited as constituting a profanation of the Christian institution of the Lord\u2019s Day and to declare them punishable as such. Such an enactment we are, in my opinion, bound to hold, on the authority of The Attorney-General v. Hamilton Street Railway Co. [19], to be an enactment dealing with the subject of the criminal law.\nIt is perhaps needless to say that it does not follow from this that the whole subject of the regulation of the conduct of people on the first day of the week is exclusively committed to the Dominion Parliament. It is not at all necessary in this case to express any opinion upon the question, and I wish to reserve the question in the fullest degree of how far regulations enacted by a provincial legislature affecting the conduct of people on Sunday, but enacted solely with a view to promote some object having no relation to the religious character of the day would constitute an invasion of the jurisdiction reserved to the Dominion Parliament. But it may be noted that since the decision of the Judicial Committe in Hodge v. The Queen[20], it has never been doubted that the Sunday-closing provisions in force in most of the provinces affecting what is commonly called the \u201cliquor trade\u201d were entirely within the competence of the provinces to enact; and it is, of course, undisputed that for the purpose of making such enactments effective when within their competence the legislatures may exercise all the powers conferred by sub-section 15 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nIt is impossible, I think, consistently with the view above expressed, to hold that the statute in question can derive any efficacy from the \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act,\u201d ch. 153, R.S.C. 1906. This latter enactment appears to be framed upon the theory that the provinces may pass laws governing the conduct of people on Sunday; and by the express provisions of the Act such laws, if in force when the Act became law, are not to be affected by it. That is a very different thing from saying that in this Act the Dominion Parliament has manifested an intention to give the force of law to legislation passed by a provincial legislature professing to do what a province under its own powers of legislation cannot do, viz., to create an offence against the criminal law within the meaning of the enactment of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d already referred to. We should, I think, be going beyond what is justified by the guarded language of the Dominion statute if we were to construe it as giving validity to such legislation.\nAnglin J.\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal is the constitutionality of the prohibitive provisions of the Quebec statute, 7 Edw. VII. ch. 42, as amended by the statute 9 Edw. VII. ch. 51.\nThe validity of this legislation is supported by the respondents on two distinct grounds: (a) that it is within the legislative jurisdiction conferred upon the provinces of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d; (b) that, if otherwise unconstitutional, it has been validated by certain provisions of the federal \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act\u201d \u2014 chapter 27 of the Dominion Revised Statutes of 1906.\n(a) I am unable to find any real distinction between the Quebec legislation now under consideration and that of the Province of Ontario held to be ultra vires by the Judicial Committee in the Hamilton Street Railway Case[21].\nThe history of the Quebec legislation is, no doubt, different from that of the Ontario Act. The pre-confederation legislation of Quebec (Con. Stat. L.O., 1860, ch. 23) was much narrower in its scope than the ante-confederation statute in force in Ontario (Con. Stat. U.C., 1859, ch. 104). But, whatever might be said of an Act of a provincial legislature similar to the earlier Lower Canada legislation, the Quebec statute now before us, because indistinguishable in substance and principle from the Ontario legislation condemned by the Privy Council, must be held by us to be ultra vires as an invasion of the domain of criminal law assigned by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nAlthough enacted by a provincial legislature not empowered to deal with criminal law, the Ontario legislation was, in the view of the Privy Council, so distinctly criminal in its character that it could not be upheld as an exercise of provincial jurisdiction under any of the powers conferred by section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d notwithstanding the cogency of the presumption that a legislature always means to act within its jurisdiction. I do not regard the decision of the Judicial Committee as depending on the fact that the Upper Canada \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act\u201d (Con. Stat. U.C., 1859, ch. 104) had been originally enacted by a legislature clothed with authority to pass criminal laws. Neither can I accede to an argument which involves the view that legislation held to be criminal in one province of Canada may be regarded as something different in another province, or that the phrase \u201cthe criminal law\u201d used in section 91, sub-section 27, of the Imperial \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d may have a meaning different from that which would be attached to it in other legislation of the Imperial Parliament. Lord Chancellor Halsbury says that it is \u201cthe criminal law in its widest sense that is reserved\u201d to the Dominion Parliament.\nIn the criminal law of England, in 1867, was embraced the \u201cSunday Observance Act,\u201d 29 Car. II., ch. 7, and other restrictive legislation. 13 Encyc. Laws of Eng., p. 707. Indeed, a person who kept open shop on Sunday would appear to have been indictable at common law as\na common Sabbath-breaker and prophaner of the Lord\u2019s Day commonly called Sunday. 2 Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law (2 ed.), p. 20.\nLegislation of a prohibitive character, to infractions of which punitive sanctions are attached, passed for the purpose of preventing profanation of the Sabbath would, therefore, appear to be within the purview of sub-section 27 of section 91, of the Imperial \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d conferring on the Dominion Parliament exclusive jurisdiction to legislate in respect to \u201cthe criminal law.\u201d\nI abstain, however, from attempting to enunciate a criterion for the determination of the broader question \u2014 when a prohibitive enactment, carrying penal sanctions for its infraction, should be regarded as so for partaking of the nature of criminal law that it is within the exclusive legislative power of the Federal Parliament. I rest my opinion in the present case chiefly upon the judgment of the Judicial Committee already adverted to.\nIt was suggested at bar that the Quebec statute might be defended as legislation merely affecting civil rights, or as legislation in the nature of a local or municipal police regulation, with sanctions, authorized by clause 15 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d appropriate to ensure obedience to its prohibitions. But the very first section indicates unmistakably that the purpose of the legislation is to make what the legislature deemed suitable provision \u201crespecting the observance of Sunday\u201d in the province. To carry out this purpose we find in the second section a prohibition couched in wide and sweeping terms. Section 6 further confirms this view of the character of the statute, making it still more appparent that to prevent profanation of the Sabbath is its object. It is such legislation that their Lordships of the Judicial Committee, as I understand their judgment, have held to be criminal law and as such beyond the competency of a provincial legislature.\nI do not refer to the fact that the informations in this case each charge more than one offence further than to say that any objection on that ground was waived. Counsel for both parties asked our decision upon the validity of section 2 of the Quebec statute, as a whole, and of the subsequent sections providing sanctions for infractions of section 2. I do not attempt to distinguish between the several matters and things forbidden by section 2. Forming part of an Act of which the purpose was to prevent profanation of the Sunday each of the prohibitions must, I think, under the decision in the Hamilton Street Railway Case[22], be regarded as criminal legislation.\n(b) The Dominion \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act\u201d excepts from the operation of its prohibitive clauses everything which is, by provincial legislation, past or future, declared to be lawful. While reserving to, or conferring upon, provincial legislatures the power to make exceptions from the operation of the Dominion statute \u2014 and thus in effect pro tanto to amend it \u2014 and recognizing and maintaining in force, if not validating, provincial legislation already passed declaring certain acts to be lawful on Sunday (provisions made, no doubt, to enable local bodies to deal with the peculiar requirements of localities with which they would presumably be more familiar and perhaps more in sympathy), there is not a word in the federal statute confirming or authorizing anything in the nature of provincial prohibitive legislation past or future. On the contrary section 14 declares that\nnothing in this Act shall be construed to * * * in any way affect any provisions of any Act or law relating in any way to the observance of the Lord\u2019s Day in force in any province of Canada when the Act comes into force.\nThe provincial legislation in so far as it is prohibitive must, therefore, depend for its force and efficacy upon the powers of the legislature which enacted it. In so far as it provides for the exception of acts and things which would otherwise fall under the prohibitions of sections 2, 5 and 6 of the federal Act (sections 5, 7 and 8, R.S.C. 1906, ch. 153), Parliament has made that Act inoperative. But beyond these saving exceptions the Dominion statute does not \u201cin any way affect\u201d provincial legislation.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to consider the question debated at bar as to the power of the Dominion Parliament to delegate its legislative functions to a provincial legislature.\nThe latter part of section 1 of the Quebec statute may be within the saving provisions of the federal Act; but the prohibitive clauses of the Quebec statute are, I think, ultra vires of a provincial legislature.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed.\nBrodeur J. (dissident).\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019acte de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec sur l\u2019observance du dimanche, qui est le chap\u00eetre 42 des statuts 7 Edouard VII. est constitutionnel.\nLa pr\u00e9sente cause avait trait d\u2019abord \u00e0 le fermeture des th\u00e9\u00e2tres le dimanche; mais un consentement, qui est au dossier, d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u201ctest case\u201d et que d\u2019un commun accord on soumet \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision des tribunaux la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de tout le statut lui-m\u00eame. Voici les propres terms de ce consentaient:\u2014\nLes parties en cette cause consentent \u00e0 limiter leur argumentation et leurs pr\u00e9tentions \u00e0 la seule question de savoir si la loi sur l\u2019observance du dimanche pass\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec en vertu du statut 7 Edouard VII., ch. 42 de 1907 est constitutionnelle, ultra vires ou intra vires, les moyens de prohibition ne devant pas \u00eatre discut\u00e9s, le tout pour \u00e9viter des frais et des pertes de temps.\nLa m\u00eame entente est convenue pour les autres causes de Sharpe, Richardson et Applegath.\nPour bien comprendre la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cette l\u00e9gislation il est important, je crois, de conna\u00eetre les circonstances qui y ont donn\u00e9 lieu.\nLa province d\u2019Ontario avait dans ses statuts une loi dominicale bas\u00e9e sur le statut de Charles II. Elle \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9e \u201cAn Act to prevent the profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d Pass\u00e9e sous l\u2019Union du Haut et du Bas Canada elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite dans les statuts refondus d\u2019Ontario et plus tard on jug\u00e9a \u00e0 propos d\u2019en \u00e9tendre les dispositions en prohibitant la circulation des tramways le dimanche. Les tribunaux furent saisis de la question et le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans la cause de Attorney-General for Ontario, v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[23], d\u00e9cida en substance que cette l\u00e9gislation provinciale \u00e9tait de sa nature criminelle et \u00e9tait dans son ensemble (as a whole) inconstitutionnelle. On a alors demand\u00e9 au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la mati\u00e8re. Le gouvernement crut, avant d\u2019adopter une l\u00e9gislation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, devoir en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 cette cour et soumit \u00e0 cette fin certaines questions auxquelles des r\u00e9ponses furent donn\u00e9es.\nIl \u00e9tait bien \u00e9vident par la nature des r\u00e9ponses que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne pouvait se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019agir. Mais il lui restait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider quelle forme il allait donner a sa l\u00e9gislation. Il pouvait bien proc\u00e9der sous les dispositions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord (sous-sec. 27 de l\u2019article 91), \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer criminelle toute \u0153uvre servile ou tout acte de commerce fait le dimanche et son autorit\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre contest\u00e9e. Mais il se trouvait en pr\u00e9sence de lois existant depuis des si\u00e8cles dans certaines provinces; il avait \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 des coutumes s\u00e9culaires qui par leur caract\u00e8re contribuaient \u00e0 la sanctification du dimanche ou au d\u00e9veloppement de la religiosit\u00e9 de la population, ou qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessit\u00e9es par des \u00e9tablissements par trop dispers\u00e9s. Je pourrais citer, entr\u2019autres coutumes, les p\u00e8lerinages qui ont lieu le dimanche depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl en est de m\u00eame de cette coutume pour le paysan d\u2019apporter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9glise les pr\u00e9misses de ses produits et de les faire vendre \u00e0 ench\u00e8res publiques apr\u00e8s le service divin pour en consacrer le produit au soutien des \u0153uvres religieuses.\nUne loi qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et qui aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 criminelle toute excursion le dimanche ou qui aurait prohib\u00e9 la vente de denr\u00e9es ce jour-l\u00e0 aurait naturellement frapp\u00e9 ces coutumes si recommendables.\nEn pr\u00e9sence de ces difficult\u00e9s, le Parlement n\u2019a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 amender le code criminel mais il a pass\u00e9 une loi qui par son titre, \u201cActe concernant l\u2019observance du dimanche,\u201d et par ses dispositions en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral doit \u00eatre class\u00e9e parmi celles adopt\u00e9es pour la paix, l\u2019ordre et le bon gouvernement du pays sous les dispositions du premier paragraphe de la section 91 qui se lit comme suit:\u2014 It shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the provinces.\nCette loi du dimanche adopt\u00e9e par le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est le ch. 153 des status refondus du Canada, 1906.\nOn trouve que le Parlement, bien loin de vouloir empi\u00e9ter sur les droits des provinces les a, au contraire, formellement reconnus en d\u00e9clarant dans les sections 5, 7, 8 et 16 que ses dispositions n\u2019auaient d\u2019effet que si les provinces n\u2019ont pas de loi couvrant le cas.\nLa l\u00e9gislation dominicale frappe les droits civils qui, comme on le sait, sont du ressort des provinces et il n\u2019y a pas lieu alors de s\u2019\u00e9tonner de voir le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral respecter l\u2019autonomie des Provinces sous ce rapport.\nNous avons dans nos lois et dans notre jurisprudence la question de la temp\u00e9rance qui peut nous servir de guide dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de la loi provinciale du dimanche. Le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a, comme on le sait, le \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d qui pourvoit \u00e0 la prohibition des liqueurs dans certains districts. Cette loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9e et le Conseil Priv\u00e9, en 1882, dans la cause de Russell v. The Queen [24], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en vertu de ses pouvoirs de faire des lois pour la paix et le bon ordre du Canada, pouvait passer cet acte.\nC\u2019est une loi tendant \u00e0 restreindre l\u2019abus des liqueurs enivrantes.\nLes provinces \u00e9galement avaient l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 sur la mati\u00e8re et avaient ordonn\u00e9, par exemple, la fermeture des d\u00e9bits de liqueurs le dimanche ou pendant certaines heures les jours de semaine. Ces lois provinciales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement attaqu\u00e9es comme inconstitutionnelles et le Conseil Priv\u00e9 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes reprises en a maintenu la validit\u00e9. Hodge v.

Township of South Nowich[29].\nDans la seconde de ces causes, Leurs Seigneuries disent, \u00e0 la p. 365:\u2014\nIn section 92, No. 16 appears to them (their Lordships) to have the same office which the general enactment with respect to matters concerning the peace, order and good government of Canada so far as supplementary of the enumerated subjects fulfils in section 91.\nDans la cause de Russell v. The Queen[30], le Conseil Priv\u00e9 avait \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans ses attributions de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer pour la paix et le bon ordre le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait le droit de passer une loi prohibitant l\u2019usage des liqueurs. Les provinces ont \u00e9galement le pouvoir d\u2019exercer la m\u00eame autorit\u00e9.\nSi les provinces peuvent fermer les buvettes le dimanche, je ne pourrais pas m\u2019expliquer pourquoi dans l\u2019exercice de leurs pouvoirs de faire des lois de police elles n\u2019auraient pas le droit de fermer les th\u00e9\u00e2tres le dimanche.\nLa l\u00e9gislation provinciale en question dans cette cause-ci n\u2019a fait, apr\u00e8s tout, qu\u2019une r\u00e9glementation de police. Cette prohibition des repr\u00e9sentations th\u00e9\u00e2trales le dimanche d\u2019ailleurs n\u2019arrive qu\u2019incidemment dans le statut. Ce dernier a pour but principal de rev\u00eatir de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la loi les us et coutumes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Voici la section 1\u00e8re de ce statut:\u2014\nLes lois de cette l\u00e9gislature, soit g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, soit sp\u00e9ciales, relatives \u00e0 l\u2019observance du dimanche en vigueur le 28 de f\u00e9vrier, 1907, continueront \u00e0 \u00eatre en vigueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles soient modifi\u00e9es, remplac\u00e9es ou abrog\u00e9es; et il est et continue d\u2019\u00eatre permis \u00e0 toute personne de faire le dimanche tout acte qui n\u2019est pas prohib\u00e9 par loi de cette l\u00e9gislature en vigueur \u00e0 la dite date, ou d\u2019user le dimanche de toutes les libert\u00e9s que lui reconnaissent les usages de cette province sous les restrictions contenues en la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nElle \u00e9nonce parmi ces restrictions les \u0153uvres serviles inutiles, les repr\u00e9sentations th\u00e9\u00e2trales et les excursions o\u00f9 l\u2019on d\u00e9bite des liqueurs en \u00e9dictant l\u2019article 2 que se lit comme suit:\u2014\nSect. 2.\u2014Il est d\u00e9fendu le dimanche dans un but de lucre, sauf n\u00e9anmoins le cas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ou d\u2019urgence, d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ou de faire ex\u00e9cuter aucune \u0153uvre industrielle, ainsi que d\u2019exercer aucun n\u00e9goce ou m\u00e9tier, ou de donner ou d\u2019organiser des repr\u00e9sentations th\u00e9\u00e2trales ou des excursions accompagn\u00e9es de vente de liqueurs enivrantes ou de prendre part ou d\u2019assister \u00e0 ces repr\u00e9sentations th\u00e9\u00e2trales ou \u00e0 ces excursions.\nOn ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre que ces derni\u00e8rers dispositions devraient rendre toute la loi nulle et inconstitutionelle; et, comme je l\u2019ai dit au commencement, nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 nous prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 de toute l\u2019acte lui-m\u00eame, vu le consentement sign\u00e9 par les parties au proc\u00e8s.\nNous devons donc rechercher quelle est l\u2019id\u00e9e dominante de cette loi. Pour moi, je la trouve dans la section 1\u00e8re; et la derni\u00e8re section n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e que dans le but d\u2019emp\u00eacher les propri\u00e9taires de th\u00e9\u00e2tres, les organisateurs d\u2019excursions et les commer\u00e7ants ou industriels d\u2019invoquer des usages qui auraient pu exister et qui seraient devenus l\u00e9galis\u00e9s par la premi\u00e8re section. D\u2019ailleurs, en supposant que ces prohibitions seraient seules, je dis qu\u2019on devrait les consid\u00e9rer comme r\u00e8glements de police tombant sous la juridiction provinciale.\nLe travail le dimanche a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans Qu\u00e9bec, d\u00e8s les premiers temps de la colonie, comme devant \u00eatre r\u00e9glement\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res. Comme on le sait, l\u2019Intendant sous la domination fran\u00e7aise avait le droit de faire des r\u00e8glements de police. La l\u00e9gislation criminelle, au contraire, appartenait au Conseil Souverain ou au Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur. Or suivant cette distribution des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs, l\u2019intendant Baudot prohibait le 25 mai, 1709, toute \u0153uvre servile les dimanches et les jours de f\u00eate. Nous pouvons trouver le texte de cette ordonnance, ainsi que de certaines autres qu\u2019il a faites pour emp\u00eacher qu\u2019on fasse du bruit pr\u00e8s des \u00e9glises aux pages 421 et 426 des \u201cOrdonnances des Gouverneurs et des Intendants sur la voirie et la police\u201d compli\u00e9es en 1856, 3\u00e8me vol.\nLe parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, par sa loi de 1906, n\u2019a pas voulu faire une l\u00e9gislation criminelle. S\u2019il avait voulu lui donner ce caract\u00e8re, il ne l\u2019aurait pas appel\u00e9 simplement \u201cAn Act respecting the Lord\u2019s Day\u201d; mais, adoptant les termes du statut d\u2019Ontario qui venait d\u2019\u00eatre examin\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9, il l\u2019aurait intitul\u00e9 \u201cAn Act to prevent the profanation of the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d Il aurait amend\u00e9 son Code criminel. Il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans ce code la partie 22 qui traite des offenses contre la religion.\nMais dans la loi il n\u2019est nullement question du Code criminel.\nUne action qui est signal\u00e9e criminelle par le l\u00e9gislateur doit frapper tous les citoyens d\u2019un m\u00eame pays. Il para\u00eetrait \u00e9trange qu\u2019un acte pourrait \u00eatre un crime dans un certain endroit du pays et ne le serait pas ailleurs. Ce serait cependant la port\u00e9e du statut f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que nous examinons. En effet, dans les sections 5, 7, 8 et 16 on y d\u00e9fend certaines choses pourvu qu\u2019une loi provinciale n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet.\nAinsi dans une province un travail quelconque par l\u2019op\u00e9ration de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale y serait d\u00e9fendu, tandis que par l\u2019effet d\u2019une loi provinciale il serait permis dans une autre province.\nSi nous consultons la section 6 du statut f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au sujet des t\u00e9l\u00e9graphistes, nous voyons \u00e9galement que ce statut ne saurait \u00eatre une l\u00e9gislation criminelle vu que cette l\u00e9gislation a en vue la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un jour de repos.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident pour moi que ce statut f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un statut criminel, mais comme une loi concernant la paix et le bon ordre du pays.\nAlors toute l\u00e9gislation provinciale qui n\u2019est pas incompatible avec les dispositions de ce statut est valide parce qu\u2019elle a trait \u00e0 des droits civils, \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat local et que sa r\u00e8glementation du sujet participe des lois de police sous les dispositions des sous-sections 13 et 16 de l\u2019article 92 de l\u2019acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord.\nL\u2019appellant a invoqu\u00e9 en sa faveur l\u2019opinion donn\u00e9e par la cour supr\u00e8me sur la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le Gouveurneur-en-Conseil.\nLa l\u00e9gislation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e subs\u00e9quemment par le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et par la l\u00e9gislature provinciale de Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9montre, comme je viens de le dire, que ni dans un Parlement ni dans l\u2019autre on a voulu l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer criminellement. On para\u00eet au contraire s\u2019\u00eatre entendu, et le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces, pour \u00e9viter l\u2019\u00e9cueil qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9 par la cour supr\u00eame.\nPour toutes ces raisons je serais d\u2019avis de renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The bank also held as further security an assignment of the company\u2019s book debts. The company gave to A., a brother of J., a chattel mortgage of all its personal property and agreed to assign to him the book debts. A. then gave to the company an amount sufficient to pay the bank\u2019s claim, J. having supplied him with funds for the purpose, and the company gave its own cheque to the bank with a direction to assign the book debts to A., which was done.\nHeld, that the evidence justified the finding at the trial that the chattel mortgage was given for the benefit of J., who was aware at the time it was given that the company was insolvent, and that it was void under the provisions of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act\u201d and should be set aside.\nAfter the assignment of the book debts to A. the company was allowed to go on collecting them.\nHeld, that such assignment was valid, but that the assignee could not retain the value of what had been collected out of the proceeds of the property covered by the chattel mortgage.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (24 Ont. L.R. 503) reversed and that of the Divisional Court (22 Ont. L.R. 577) restored. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nOn 12th August, 1909, the Ontario Seed Company, Limited, a company incorporated under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d executed a chattel mortgage covering all its goods and chattels in favour of the respondent as security for an advance alleged to have been made by the respondent to the company of the amount of $8,300. This chattel mortgage also assigned to the respondent all the book debts of the Ontario Seed Company, a partnership formerly carried on by Christian H. Kustermann and Otto Herold. All the assets of the Ontario Seed Company were taken over and all its liabilities assumed by the Ontario Seed Company, which was its successor. The Ontario Seed Company, Limited, on 13th August, 1909, was indebted to the Merchants Bank of Canada in the sum of $8,254.52, for which the Merchants Bank held as security a bond for $5,000, executed by one Jacob Uffelman, a brother of the respondent, and an assignment of the book debts of the Ontario Seed Company, the partnership concern. On 13th August, 1909, the respondent issued a cheque in favour of the Ontario Seed Company, Limited, for $8,300, representing the amount of the chattel mortgage. This cheque was deposited in the Merchants Bank of Canada to the credit of the Ontario Seed Company, Limited. The Ontario Seed Company, Limited, on 13th August, 1909, issued a cheque in favour of the Merchants Bank of Canada for $8,254.52, thus paying off all its indebtedness to the bank, relieving Jacob Uffelmann from his liability on his bond to the bank and releasing the claim of the bank to the book debts that it also held as security for the indebtedness of the company. On the 12th of August, 1909, the Ontario Seed Company and the Ontario Seed Company, Limited, executed a direction to the Merchants Bank of Canada, requesting the bank to assign the book debts held by it to the respondent. This direction states that the transfer of the book debts is to be made to the respondent, on payment by him to the bank of $8,254.52. The transaction as appears by the documentary evidence, shews that the respondent made no payment to the bank; that the bank was paid by cheque of the company. In pursuance of such direction the bank on the 7th day of September, 1909, executed an assignment of the book debts in favour of the respondent.\nThe appellant is a creditor of the Ontario Seed Company, Limited, and brought this action on behalf of all creditors of the Ontario Seed Company, Limited, for a declaration that the said chattel mortgage is fraudulent and void as against the creditors of the Ontario Seed Company, Limited.\nThe trial judge declared the chattel mortgage void to the extent of the difference between the actual value of the book debts of the Ontario Seed Company on the 13th of August, 1909, and the sum of $8,300.\nThe Divisional Court made an order declaring the chattel mortgage to be void in its entirety. The Court of Appeal for Ontario restored the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe appellant, who is the plaintiff in the action, now appeals and asks to have the chattel mortgage set aside in its entirety. Secord R.C. for the appellants. The chattel mortgage is clearly void under the Statute of Elizabeth and it cannot be void in part and valid in part. Commercial Bank v. Wilson[3]; Mader v. McKinnon[4]; Totten v. Douglas[5].\nThe mortgage was particeps criminis in procuring the mortgage and cannot obtain relief in equity. Kerr on Frauds, 4 ed., pp. 365 et seq.; Cameron v. Perrin[6].\nSir George Gibbons K.C. and Sims for the respondents. There was a bon\u00e2 fide advance by the mortgagee which prevents the mortgage being held void under the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act.\u201d Mulcahy v. Archibald[7]; Middleton v. Pollock[8].\nEven if the advance was made with intent to give a preference it was still bon\u00e2 fide. Ex parte Games[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014This appeal should be allowed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I recognize to the full extent that, as has been so often been said, a preferential assignment is not by reason of its preferential character obnoxious to the Statute of Elizabeth, said to be declaratory of the common law, against schemes for defeating, hindering or delaying creditors. I must also recognize as possible that a scheme may be formed having in it the elements which may render it obnoxious to both that law and the provision of R.S.O. 1897, ch. 147 (now ch. 64, Ont. Stat., 1910), aimed at preferential assignments.\nIn this case I think the chief purpose of the parties to the chattel mortgage in question was clearly to prefer the claim of the surety and relieve him from the situation in which he had as such become involved. There is evidence, however, of its being only part of a wider scheme which involved at least the hindering and delaying of the creditors.\nAll the courts below have found the chattel mortgage in question was the result of both designs to defeat, hinder or delay, and to prefer one creditor of an insolvent over another. I cannot say they are wrong in taking that view of the facts. But even if I could and I find that the sole purpose of the parties was the alleged preference and nothing else, how would that help the respondent, Adam Uffelmann?\nWhen the immediate object of an agreement is unlawful the agreement is void. Therefore, the object and, if you will, the sole object of the chattel mortgage having been to withdraw certain assets of the insolvent debtor from the reach of other creditors in order to enable the surety to pay the debt he was surety for, and thus prefer one creditor over others, surely the entire object was unlawful.\nPrim\u00e2 facie the whole is tainted with illegality for such is the presumption the statute has declared and created against such transactions when concluded within sixty days prior to attack thereon.\nI am, therefore, with all due respect, unable to understand how the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal have been able to draw a line where the parties did not, if we have any regard to their language in expressing in this mortgage their intentions, and thereby sever the legal from the illegal.\nI concede it was quite possible to have produced whether lawfully or not such an agreement as the learned trial judge finds the parties had intended relative to their purpose. It was not, however, in the minds of the parties to create a security of which the parts and purpose could be severed in the way the judgment appealed from implies; and without doing violence to the language of the instrument and the manifest purpose of the parties thereto, we cannot find anything therein to justify such a severance or drawing of such a line between the legal and illegal as is attempted below.\nNor do we find anything in the language of section 10 (now section 13) of the statute upon which this action is founded to warrant the giving only such conditional relief as given.\nThat section, sub-section 1, is as follows:\u2014\n13. (1) In the case of a gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer of any property, real or personal, which is invalid against creditors, if the person to whom the gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer was made shall have sold or disposed of, realized or collected the property or any part thereof, the money or other proceeds may he seized or recovered in any action by a person who would be entitled to seize and recover the property if it had remained in the possession or control of the debtor or of the person to whom the gift, conveyance, transfer, delivery or payment was made, and such right to seize and recover shall belong, not only to an assignee for the general benefit of the creditors of the debtor, but where there is no such assignment, to all creditors of the debtor.\nI quote this just to point out that it does not countenance any such thing as has been done, and next to shew its limitations in relation to another point I am about to refer to in connection with the book debts. I submit that the language, \u201cassignment or transfer of any property * * * which in law is invalid,\u201d lends no countenance to what has been done.\nAre there, however, two or more agreements or assignments in this chattel mortgage? I think there are, for we have the assignment of the stock in trade and then a distinctly separate assignment by way of additional security of all book debts, etc., due the old company, and we have also another relative to the unpaid capital. It is conceivable in many ways that an instrument might well contain in this way a series of assignments of which some might be legal and others illegal, but in the language used relative to the stock in trade part of the mortgage, there is no room left for any such severance or suggestion as made, of the good from the bad. To do so on the lines laid down is, I respectfully submit, to construct a theory of what the parties might fairly have so designed as to bring them within one or more of the saving clauses of the statute; and constitute thereby a bargain they never dreamed of.\nI incline to think the vicious purpose tainted each of the whole of these assignments in this instrument. But as to the collaterals, held by the bank, and called book debts, I think they were on his payment to the bank the property, or at all events the potential property of Jacob Uffelmann, for whom the respondent was acting and on behalf of whom he was entitled to receive said securities by virtue of his (Jacob\u2019s) right as a surety paying off the creditor holding same.\nThe same day as the mortgage was given, the company gave a direction to the bank to transfer these book debts to respondent Adam Uffelmann, but as he clearly was but the substitute of Jacob, no violence is done to the actual intention or even the language used in attributing what was done to an assertion of Jacob\u2019s rights as the surety who had in fact raised money and in a needlessly roundabout way, paid off the bank.\nHis right need not be rested upon the clauses in the mortgage and cannot be injured by any clause therein referring to the same subject.\nWhen these securities were transferred thus, they formed an asset distinctly severed from the rest of the estate, and if Jacob took no care to collect them, but let the company do so, he lost his security to that extent and has no one but himself to blame.\nIndeed, he may truly blame the illegal purpose of hindering and delaying the creditors for the year that was needed to enable them to pay, as evidently was the intention of those who concocted the circular issued four days later over Jacob\u2019s own hand as secretary of the company.\nIf he permitted the collection and appropriation thereof by the company pursuant to such a scheme, how can any equity rest thereon to make good his consequent loss out of other property to which he was not at all entitled as against the other creditors to resort? If he permitted it through sheer neglect, how again can he resort for indemnity to a mortgage that the statute presumes, under the circumstances, void?\nAgain let us look at the above quoted sub-section of section 10, read it closely and we see that the right of appellant is bounded by and is limited to an account of the proceeds of that which would have been exigible had it \u201cremained in the possession or control of the debtor,\u201d etc.\nOn the one hand the respondent has no right to claim any part of that which he has taken possession of by virtue of an instrument presumed to be illegal and void. And on the other, the appellant has no right to claim an account of those securities which clearly, under the circumstances, never could have become exigible to answer the claims of other creditors.\nAs to the argument rested on sub-section 5 of section 3, relative\nto the substitution in good faith of one security for another security for the same debt so far as the debtor\u2019s estate is not thereby lessened in value to the other creditors\nwhere is the evidence of any such substitution in good faith or bad faith?\nThere never existed a foundation on the facts for alleging substitution of one or part of one for another.\nThe mortgage treated in express words the one as being in addition to the other.\nAnd when we depart from it to the other basis of right to the book debts as security, the two subjects as security are entirely independent of each other, and the book debts free from any such pretension.\nNo one ever thought of any substitution in regard to either or any part thereof.\nAnd as clearly as can be the debtor\u2019s estate has been, by what has taken place relative to book debts, lessened in value, if affect be given the judgment appealed from, to the other creditors.\nI repeatedly pressed counsel to see if the proceeds could be traced to anything specific which now formed part of the estate, but was told it could not be done.\nNow, as I take this saving clause, if the money had been found invested in some specific thing that has remained to answer for the condition I have quoted relative to lessening of the estate \u201cin value to the other creditors,\u201d principles of equity would require, as well as the statute, relief to be given to that extent.\nOr if some privileged claim over the whole estate, the payment of which would enhance the value of the whole estate to the creditors, had been paid off thereby, the same should be done in regard thereto.\nAs it is, there is nothing either in shape of agreement or actual results to lay a foundation on which to apply such principles.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the Divisional Court judgment be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014A study of the evidence has satisfied me that it fully supports the findings of the learned trial judge that the impeached chattel mortgage, nominally given to Adam Uffelmann, was in fact the security of Jacob Uffelmann; and that it was given and taken with knowledge of the mortgagors\u2019 insolvency and with the intent and purpose that it should serve to \u201chinder\u201d and \u201cdelay,\u201d though, perhaps, not to \u201cdefeat\u201d or \u201cprejudice,\u201d the creditors of the mortgagors, other than the bank and Jacob Uffelmann. Unless, therefore, it comes within some one of the saving exceptions of sub-section 1 and sub-section 5 of section 3, of the R.S.O. 1897, ch. 147, I am convinced that, as against such creditors, it is void under sub-section 1 of section 2 of that statute.\nJacob Uffelmann, as surety to the bank for the mortgagors, was already their creditor for all of the $8,300 which the mortgage purports to secure, except about $500. The evidence makes it reasonably clear that the real object of the parties was not to secure this $500, but to secure Jacob Uffelmann in respect of his existing liability of upwards of $7,700 as surety, which he was by payment converting into a direct claim against the company. The additional $500 he had to assume in order to clear off the bank\u2019s claim and to obtain an assignment of the $6,000 worth of book debts held by it as collateral. The last of the exceptions made by sub-section 1 and the last under sub-section 5 of section 3, therefore, do not apply to the transaction.\nThe other exceptions under sub-section 1 and the first exception of sub-section 5 clearly have no application.\nThe bank is not a party to this action. The payment to it is not now in question. The second exception under sub-section 5 does not apply to the case as between the plaintiffs and the chattel mortgagee.\nI shall presently give my reasons for thinking that the respondent has not brought himself within the only remaining exception made by sub-section 5, namely,\nthe substitution in good faith of one security for another security for the same debt.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the validity of the impeached instrument is not saved by anything in sub-section 1 or sub-section 5 of section 3.\nI agree, however, with Meredith, J.A., that, although\nthe plaintiffs are entitled to have the transaction in question set aside * * * it does not follow from that that Jacob Uffelman is also to lose the rights which he had against the company at the time of the carrying into effect of the impeached transaction.\nI also agree that the plaintiffs have no right \u201cbeyond the removal of the fraudulent security out of their way.\u201d In his factum counsel for the appellants expressly disclaims any intention to attack in this action the assignment by the bank to the defendant Adam Uffelmann of the book debts held by it as collateral. As surety for the debtors, Jacob Uffelmann was entitled on paying the guaranteed debt to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor. I agree with the learned trial judge that\nit was part of the transaction that the bank should transfer to Adam Uffelman the book accounts which they held under assignment from the company and which they subsequently assigned to him.\nIn taking this assignment, Jacob Uffelmann did nothing fraudulent. He merely exercised a clear equitable right. It is not material to this part of the case that he took it in the name of his brother Adam.\nBut I am, with respect, unable to concur in the conclusion of the learned trial judge and of the Court of Appeal, as expressed by Meredith, J.A., that, in the result, the defendant Uffelmann is entitled to retain, on account of his claim against the insolvent company, out of the proceeds of the property covered by the chattel mortgage, a sum equal to the value, at the time they were assigned to him, of the book debts formerly held by the bank as collateral. The statute provides that nothing contained in it shall affect\nthe substitution in good faith of one security for another security for the same debt so far as the debtor\u2019s estate is not thereby lessened in value to the other creditors.\nBut there is no evidence in the record that a substitution of chattel property for book debts as security was ever agreed upon or intended. Moreover, the finding of intent to hinder and delay creditors in the giving and taking of the chattel mortgage is incompatible with that good faith which would be essential to its validity had a substitution been contemplated. What the parties had in view was not the substitution of a new security for the same debt; it was rather to obtain security upon the chattel property in addition to the book debts, so that all would be out of the reach of other creditors, and also to secure the whole claim of $8,300 instead of the $6,000 already secured by the book debts. The debtor\u2019s estate was lessened in value to the other creditors.\nThe right of the defendant Uffelmann must, in my opinion, be restricted to such of the book debts transferred to him by the bank as still remain outstanding. His title to these is distinctly severable from the claim which he asserts to the proceeds of the chattel property. It in nowise rests or depends upon the impeached chattel mortgage transaction. But for such of the book debts as he has allowed the debtor to collect, or to discharge by a set-off of contra-accounts, he cannot be allowed to have indemnity out of the proceeds of the chattels, to which his only claim is under an instrument found to be fraudulent. To give him the benefit of security upon this property, without any agreement or understanding that it was to be substituted for the released book debts and notwithstanding the finding of mala fides, would be to give efficacy to a transaction which the legislature has declared to be invalid.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed, both with costs. The appellant is also entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal. The judgment of the Divisional Court should be restored.\nThere may be some hardship in this result. Jacob Uffelmann appears to have been persuaded by Kus- termann to lend himself to his schemes. He undoubtedly advanced substantial sums of money. He may even have thought that in taking the chattel mortgage in question he was giving the Seed Company a chance to retrieve itself and was thus, while temporarily helping it to stave off its other creditors, taking a step which would ultimately benefit them. He nevertheless contravened the statute when he took as security for his own claim a conveyance of his debtors\u2019 property with intent to hinder and delay other creditors; and that he knew he was entering into a transaction of very doubtful legality is manifest from the efforts he made to conceal the fact that the chattel mortgage was really taken for his benefit.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014It has been found by the trial judge that the chattel mortgage in question was made with intent to defeat, hinder and delay creditors and that view has been confirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nIt is perhaps unfortunate for Uffelmann that he might lose as a result of this judgment the greater part of the value of the book debts that had been transferred to the bank as a security for the debt for which he was also responsible. But instead of paying purely and simply that debt and becoming thereby possessed of the security he tried through the respondent, his brother, to make a fraudulent transaction and take a chattel mortgage which the company in view of its insolvent situation could not legally grant and have a larger security that would cover the whole indebtedness of the company to him.\nI am of opinion that the chattel mortgage to Adam Uffelmann is illegal and should be set aside. As to the book debts I concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Anglin.\nThe appeal is allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: M.A. Secord.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Millar & Sims.\n[1] 24 Ont.

Knight (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1912: May 8; 1912: June 4.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Sale of mortgaged lands\u2014Agreement\u2014Condition precedent\u2014Cash payment\u2014Default\u2014Objection to title\u2014Repudiation\u2014Specific performance. An agreement for the sale of land provided that the purchase-money was to be paid by instalments \"$10,000 cash on the signing of this agreement, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,\" the remaining instalments to be paid in one, two and four years, with interest from the date of the agreement, and there was a proviso making time of the essence of the contract and, on default in performance of conditions and payment of instalments, for the cancellation of the agreement by the vendors on giving written notice to the purchaser. The land in question formed part of a larger area and there was an undischarged mortgage upon the whole property of which both parties had knowledge at the time of the agreement. The cash payment was not made, the purchaser refusing to pay this amount until the mortgage was severed and apportioned so that the land mentioned in the agreement should bear only a determinate share thereof, and the agreement amended to this effect. The vendors then withdrew from the agreement by a letter addressed to the purchaser's solicitor. In an action against the vendors for specific performance,\nHeld, per Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014The execution of the agreement constituting the relationship of vendors and purchaser was the consideration for the cash payment then to be made and, in default of such payment, the obligation to sell and convey the lands with a good title did not become binding upon the vendors. Per Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Payment of the ten thousand dollars in cash was a condition precedent to the constitution of any obligation by the vendors to sell or convey the lands and, consequently, to shew good title.\nPer Idington J.\u2014In the circumstances the purchaser's refusal to make the cash payment was a repudiation of the agreement which deprived him of the right to a decree for specific performance.\nJudgment appealed from (1 D.L;R. 331, 1 West. W.R. 563) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], by which the judgment of Simmons J., in favour of the defendants, was reversed, Harvey J. dissenting, and the action of the plaintiff was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nEwart K.C. and C. F. Adams for the appellants.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., C. C. McGaul K.C. and J. E. Wallbridge for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is allowed with costs in this court and in the Supreme Court of Alberta, in banco, and the action is dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the opinion of Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014These parties executed an agreement for the sale and purchase of half of two lots in Edmonton for the sum of $33,750, of which the sum of $10,000 was to be paid, by the express terms of said agreement, \"on the signing of this agreement, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.\" This provision for payment proceeded to provide also that $10,750 should be paid in a year, $8,000 in two years and $5,000 in four years. A mortgage existed for $15,000 and interest at seven per cent. per annum in favour of a third party and covering the whole of said lots, but did not fall due till a few months after the last of said payments of purchase-money.\nThe respondent refused to pay the $10,000 payable on the execution of the agreement he had signed unless specific provision was made therein for the early severance of the mortgage so that each half would bear a determinate share in case it became desirable for him later on to have paid off what was to be borne by the half he was buying.\nHe had signed with full knowledge of the existence of this mortgage and as a man of education and ordinary sense must have been alive to these possible complications before he signed the agreement; especially so as that had been preceded by a payment of $100 and a receipt therefor given him setting forth above terms of payment upon which the completed agreement was to be framed.\nI pass by a mass of evidence in regard to an alleged verbal understanding providing for this outstanding mortgage as at best only confusing the questions to be solved. It is admitted as fact that respondent knew of this mortgage when he signed the agreement.\nThe plain language of the agreement required payment of $10,000 cotemporaneously with the execution of the document. And when respondent refused to comply, with such express language binding him, he gave appellants the right to treat such explicit refusal as an abandonment or at all events repudiation of the agreement entitling them to rescind. They rescinded accordingly after having given four days to respondent to consider his position.\nThe latter chose, at the end of four days, to insist on their amending the agreement before paying over the $10,000. How could he more clearly repudiate that agreement ? His hope of getting a new agreement to suit him is no answer.\nThe demand made, if complied with, might have turned out an impossibility for appellants to have fulfilled.\nIf the agreement had not by its terms impliedly excluded, as the judgment appealed from maintains, in acceding to respondent's claims all right to interest in this $10,000 it might have been urged with greater fairness that it was only to be considered as an instalment to be postponed till title passed.\nMoreover, by paying the $10,000 at the time of signing the respondent risked nothing. The balance of the purchase-money after such payment exceeded by over $7,000 the total mortgage. The respondent had a right under the agreement to proceed, after paying the $10,000 deposit, to insist on the title being made out before going further, and, before next payment, being made good on due protection being given him against the complications he professes to have dreaded.\nAnd in case of his electing the right given in the agreement to pay up the entire purchase-money he could have forced the appellant to redeem the mortgage no matter how unexpectedly onerous that might have proved to appellants. Of course the collateral verbal agreement might have modified this. I am passing no opinion upon that, but upon the agreement which is sued upon and must be construed as it reads.\nThis agreement was the outcome which the parties to the previous receipt anticipated.\nIf the agreement could be treated as not executed at all then there was nothing but that receipt to be considered; imperfect by reason of the mutual intention that it should be followed by and be only the foundation for such agreement.\nAnd if such a receipt so given is to alone constitute the foundation for this action there seem to be many difficulties in respondent's way.\nThe Statute of Frauds, the verbal understanding and what seems, in light thereof, very like equivocal conduct on part of respondent in claiming something unprovided for therein as a sine qua non of his proceeding to close up the transaction, furnish, I incline to think, impassable barriers to his resting an action of specific performance on the receipt alone.\nHe knew about the mortgage before writing his solicitor and when he instructed him to look at the title and if that found right to hand over the cheque, he ought at least to have told him that he knew of this mortgage and perhaps have told him his understanding as to that.\nAs I read his letter it shews he thought the agreement completely executed and ready for the investigation of title and if that satisfactory then to hand over the cheque.\nHe has seen fit to sue upon it and surely he cannot be heard to say now it was not executed. If so, then all else merged therein save possibly the collateral verbal agreement if evidence can warrant it being held such. In my view his action fails and this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think the appeal should succeed on the ground that the cash payment of ten thousand dollars not having been made the appellants' obligation to sell (and, consequently, their obligation to shew a good title) did not become absolute.\nFrom the first the parties contemplated the execution of a formal contract of purchase. The evidence of the agent is precise that, according to his understanding with the respondent, the sum mentioned was to be payable upon the execution of that contract; and it is clear enough that the appellant Alfred B. Cushing, who acted for his brother as well as for himself, always had the same view of the arrangement.\nThe fact that such a formal agreement was contemplated is, as Lord Cranworth said in Ridgway v. Wharton2, strong evidence that the parties did not intend finally to bind themselves until that agreement should be completely constituted and there is a great deal to be said for the view that, according to the evidence, read as a whole, the legal position of the parties up to the time of the execution of the agreement of the 12th September was that the appellants had made an offer of sale in terms of the receipt which they had precluded themselves from revoking until a reasonable time had elapsed to enable the parties to prepare and execute a formal instrument. It is, however, not necessary to consider what the legal position of the parties might have been if the document of the 12th of September had never been executed. That instrument was prepared in accordance with the original intention of both parties and with the object of setting forth the terms of their agreement in final and binding form. It was executed by the appellants first and afterwards by the respondent; upon it the respondent sues; and it evinces, in my judgment, in the clearest way the intention of both parties that a condition precedent to the constitution of any obligation to sell on the part of the appellants was the payment of ten thousand dollars down. The parties do not, it is true, in formal terms provide that the payment of that sum is to be a condition; but the intention that it should be so is manifested by the frame of the agreement as a whole, the stipulations of which pre-suppose that this payment has already been made and shew unmistakeably that it is upon the basis of this assumed state of facts that the parties are contracting.\nIn this view it is, perhaps, unnecessary to notice the point made upon the last paragraph of the agreement. This paragraph applies, of course, only to default in respect of payments to be made in future.\nI cannot understand, I may add, the contention that the respondents after refusing to comply with this condition, can (after the time fixed for payment has long passed and the property has greatly increased in value) fasten a contract to sell upon the appellants by offering now to make the cash payment stipulated for. With great respect, to give effect to that contention would seem to be constituting a fresh contract.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In my opinion, on a proper interpretation of the contract for the specific performance of which the plaintiff sues, the consideration for the payment by him of the sum of $10,000 \"cash on the signing of this agreement\" was the execution of the agreement itself \u2014 the constitution of the relationship of vendors and purchaser between the parties \u2014 the promise or undertaking of the vendors to sell and convey. The plaintiff was not entitled to require the vendors to shew their title to the land in question before payment of this sum of money: the agreement specially provides otherwise.\nIf the parol evidence may be looked at for this purpose (which, I think, more than doubtful), it seems to me to make it reasonably clear that it was well understood that the $15,000 mortgage (the existence of which, as a single charge on the land in question and other property for the whole amount secured, the plaintiff relies on as a justification for his refusal to pay the $10,000 until this incumbrance had been removed or had been so apportioned that the land which he was purchasing would stand as security to the mortgagee for only $5,000) would remain unchanged until the transaction should be closed by the purchaser paying the entire purchase money, either at the time stipulated, or in advance under the provision for that purpose.\nThe property in question was of a speculative character to the knowledge of both parties. Time was of the essence of the agreement. The defendants' notice giving the plaintiff four days within which to pay the $10,000, with cancellation as an alternative, was, in the circumstances, reasonable, and on his default they were entitled to treat the agreement as cancelled unless they had bound themselves not to do so. I find nothing which so binds them. The express provision in the agreement for rescission by notice in the event of default in payments refers, in my opinion, not to the $10,000 cash payment, but to the subsequent payments which the purchaser covenanted to make. That provision the defendants do not invoke and it does not affect whatever rights accrued to them on the plaintiff's refusal to pay the $10,000. As already stated, his default, in my opinion, gave them the right to withdraw and cancel. That right they have exercised \u2014 I think legally and efficaciously.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the court en banc, and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Duff. This appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court en banc, and I would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 1. D.L.R. 331, 1 West.

Finch (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce (Defendant) Respondent.\n1912: May 10; 1912: June 4.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nBanking\u2014Promissory note\u2014Special indorsement\u2014Condition\u2014Pledge \u2014Collateral security\u2014Holder in due course\u2014Payment and satisfaction\u2014Liability on current account.\nThe bank having refused further loans to a trading company until its current liability to the bank was reduced, a note by the company in favour of its directors was specially indorsed to the bank by them and handed to the company\u2019s manager, who had charge of its financial affairs, with instructions to have the note discounted, but without authority to pledge it. Without informing the bank of his restricted power to deal with this note, the manager deposited it with the bank as collateral security for the company\u2019s current liability and, in consideration of the deposit, obtained fresh advances from the bank by discounts of the company\u2019s trade paper. At maturity of the note the trade paper had been retired and an overdraft on the company\u2019s account had been covered, but the general indebtedness of the company; for former loans still subsisted. In a suit by the directors for the return of the note the bank counterclaimed for the amount thereof.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (21 Man. R. 1), that, so far as the bank was aware, the company\u2019s manager had ostensible authority to pledge the note as collateral security for the general indebtedness of the company on its current account, that re-payment of the fresh advances by retirement of the trade paper so discounted was not satisfaction of the debt for which the note was pledged, and that the bank was entitled to enforce payment of the note as holder in due course for valuable consideration within the meaning of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d and to recover thereon the amount of the company\u2019s general indebtedness remaining unsatisfied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Mathers C.J., at the trial, in favour of the plaintiffs, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs and maintaining the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.\nThe plaintiffs were directors of the Finch Company, Limited, which was a trading company carrying on business in the City of Winnipeg and was a customer of the bank at its branch there. In the circumstances stated in the head-note, they brought the action to have an order against the bank directing it to return the promissory note in question to them and for a declaration that the bank was not entitled to enforce payment thereof. The bank counterclaimed for the recovery of the amount of the note from the plaintiffs as indorsers.\nAt the trial His Lordship Chief Justice Mathers rendered judgment declaring that the plaintiffs were not liable to the bank as indorsers, ordering that the note should be returned to the plaintiffs, and dismissing the bank\u2019s counterclaim with costs. This judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nJ. B. Coyne for the appellants.\nR. M. Dennistoun K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Idington J.\u2014Finch, one of the appellants, was the managing director of a mercantile corporation, and the others were fellow-directors thereof. Respondent was their banker.\nBy resolutions of the board the manager or a director appointed, with the accountant of the company, were authorized amongst other things to borrow money from respondent\non behalf of the company either by overdrawing the account of the company with the said bank or otherwise * * * and to negotiate with, deposit with, or transfer to the said bank (but for credit of the company\u2019s account only) all or any bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques, etc., etc., * * * also to arrange, settle, balance and certify all books and accounts between the company and the bank,\nI may incidentally remark that the ingenious suggestion that these powers, though given by the company do not cover the case of the personal authority to use these indorsers\u2019 signatures for another than the specific purpose they gave them for, hardly comes with a good grace from the very men who framed and passed these resolutions intending the bank to rely on them.\nA copy of this series of resolutions was on file with the bank for its guidance as to the limit of authority of these officials, who, in turn, signed a general letter of hypothecation which, of course, could not enlarge the powers given by these resolutions, but was an authority within them as ample as possible thereunder to enable the bank to hold securities given\nas a general and continuing collateral security for payment of the present and future indebtedness and liability of the undersigned (i.e., the company), and any ultimate unpaid balance thereof, etc.\nSuch were the relations between the corporate bodies when the company, in the end of August, 1907, owed the bank and was so pressed by it that the latter desired the personal guarantee of the company\u2019s directors for the payment of the latter\u2019s indebtedness when called for.\nThis was refused. Then the notes or acceptances of shareholders for unpaid calls on their stock was suggested. Many drafts were made on them, but few, if any, accepted before matters became so urgent that at a meeting of the board the appellants agreed to indorse the note of the company for two thousand dollars if the latter would assign them the sum so due for unpaid calls to indemnify them against such indorsements, and the board accordingly passed a by-law to carry this out.\nIt is clear that the purpose was that such note should, when so indorsed, be discounted by respondent.\nIt is equally clear that the bank-agent thereafter refused to discount it, but offered Finch, duly authorized as above, to deal with securities he had in his hands for purposes of his company in such a way as would enable him best to finance the company, to accept it as collateral for the company\u2019s account as a means of strengthening it. He says Finch assented thereto, and the banker accepted it as collateral.\nPrim\u00e2 facie the result of so dealing with the note in question would be to render it a security to which the bank could look for payment of any ultimate balance due by the company. And in default of any restriction as to such general application there is no answer to the bank\u2019s claim to hold it and enforce its payment.\nIt was, so soon as in possession of the bank, placed in the register of collaterals held against this account.\nThe company\u2019s accountant understood from Finch it was used as collateral.\nThe ledger-keeper, who was also acting accountant in the bank, and the person to ask for its return, if returnable, never heard during its currency of any claim to have it returned, though meeting Finch almost daily.\nThe manager in effect swears it was properly so treated in accordance with his suggestion and the assent of Finch thereto and that the business done thereafter between the company and the bank proceeded on the faith thereof.\nFinch denies his assent thereto, but in that is discredited by the learned trial judge.\nThe learned trial judge, however, not resting upon any express agreement restricting its application to overdrafts and discounts of trade notes, but, by a process of reasoning which I cannot accept, indeed hardly follow, as to the consideration for its deposit having been the granting overdrafts and discounting such trade notes, saw his way to finding such a restricted application of it as a collateral.\nThese might, as he suggests, be valuable considerations given by the bank and entitling it to hold the security. But, unfortunately for the appellants and the reasoning I refer to, there was no such consideration expressly agreed on as the consideration, much less as being the entire consideration.\nThe manager in his way of illustrating his meaning does, in a loose sort of way, in one place, refer to such subjects as being motives of action.\nBut, with respect, I think no banker or competent business man would be likely to attach a restriction as claimed to what he says transpired relative to and as governing the purpose of giving this collateral.\nThe consideration clearly was the undertaking to carry the account as a whole, and the deposit was made a general collateral to the whole as a basis of credit for such dealings.\nNow, was there anything in the way of notice to the bank of the terms upon which the appellants indorsed?\nThe learned trial judge expressly finds the bank took it in good faith and without notice thereof.\nThe only vestige of foundation for believing other wise was the learned trial judge\u2019s own finding that the bank-agent asked or induced Finch to believe that if he got a note so indorsed for two thousand dollars it would be discounted.\nA step further in the same direction, making it clear that the bank-agent had expressly agreed to such a thing, and as Finch says, had followed it up by accepting the note as if discounting it, but later repudiating that under instructions from head-office, would possibly have made an arguable case implying knowledge in the bank that the note was got and produced pursuant to such an express agreement for its discount.\nSuch is not found to be the fact. What is found to be the fact falls far short thereof. In either case it is only by a train of reasoning that knowledge of what the indorsers intended to be done with their indorsement could be imputed to the bank.\nShort of such express knowledge or notice, or facts upon which either could be fairly imputed to the bank, it seems to me there could not be rested any such contention as set up here.\nThe distinction between the indorsing for purposes of discount and collateral security is at best rather fine and, perhaps, not worth much except in exceptional circumstances. If the appellant had made as suggested, but not proven, a case that the securities furnished the indorsers had been abandoned as result of what the bank did, something more tangible would have had to be dealt with.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Finch had no authority in fact to deal with the note as he did. Had he ostensible authority? I think he had. I think his possession, in the circumstances, would naturally, in the view of the bank-manager, imply authority to use it on behalf of the company for the purpose of improving the status of the company\u2019s account with the bank in order to procure the advances then urgently needed. Ex facie, the transaction (as between the directors and the company), was simply an indorsement by the directors of the company\u2019s note for the company\u2019s accommodation. I cannot see anything in it importing any limitation as to the terms under which the bank was to hold the paper. The natural inference of third parties would be, I think, that such arrangements were left to the discretion of the company as represented by the manager.\nThe only other point is whether there was any restriction upon the classes of advances in respect of which the note was pledged. The learned trial judge held it was to be applied only to secure the overdrafts and certain other specified advances. There is some difficulty in taking that view on the evidence as it stands; and, while I should desire to give the greatest possible weight to the finding of the trial judge, I am disposed to think the better view is that which prevailed in the Court of Appeal. I do not, of course, in the least accede to the contention that the trial judge, because he rejected the evidence of Finch on this point, was bound to accept, in its entirety, that of the bank manager; a variety of circumstances open to the observation of a trial judge, but excluded from that of a court of appeal might very properly determine his judgment in the rejection of one part while accepting another part of the testimony of a witness. I think, however, that the learned judge has fallen into some error in not giving sufficient weight to the course of business and to the probability that if there was a departure from it there would have been some record of that either in the bank or by Finch himself. Finch\u2019s remark to his accountant seems to give support to the view that the note was to be pledged as collateral security for the indebtedness of the company generally. On the whole I am not satisfied that on this point the Court of Appeal was wrong.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendant Finch, in my opinion, held the note in question and took it to the defendant bank not as the agent or emissary of the indorsers, but as the president and accredited business representative of the Finch Company, Limited, with ostensible authority to use it as he might deem best in the interests of that company. Of whatever actual limitation there may have been upon his authority the bank had no notice. The trial judge has so found.\nThe learned judge says that\nFinch deposited it (the note) as collateral security on the bank\u2019s promise that such a deposit would ease up the account and that advances would be allowed as an overdraft and upon trade paper.\nThe company had the benefit of this consideration. Again the learned judge says it (the note) was pledged as collateral security only for the company\u2019s account.\nThe evidence warrants these findings and they have been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. A perusal of Finch\u2019s evidence has satisfied me that his statements to the contrary are wholly unworthy of belief.\nBecause, when the note in question in this case matured, the advances allowed on overdraft had been repaid and the trade paper discounted had been taken up (one note of $529, however, appears to be still outstanding), the learned trial judge concluded that all the liability of the defendants had ceased, although the Finch company still owed the bank some $1,900 on the general account to which the note indorsed by them had been pledged as collateral. With great respect, it would seem to me that the learned judge confused the consideration for which the note was given to the bank by Finch with the indebtedness for which it was pledged as security.\nI agree with the majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal that the plaintiffs have failed to establish any ground for relief from their liability as indorsers and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Coyne & Hamilton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Machray, Sharpe & Dennistoun.\n[1] 21 Man.

Coventry (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1912: May 13; 1912: June 4.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nTitle to land\u2014\u201cLand Titles Act,\u201d R.S. Sask., 1909, c. 41\u2014Fraud\u2014Cancellation of certificate of title\u2014Appeal\u2014Findings of fact\u2014Review by appellate court.\nThe appellant obtained a transfer of lands which had been executed by the registered owner to him through some mistake or inadvertence, and, although he was aware that these lands had been previously transferred by the beneficial owner to the respondent, be registered the transfer and thereby secured a certificate of title therefor in his own name as the owner.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (1 West. W.R. 148), that the certificate of title issued to the appellant should be cancelled, under the provisions of the \u201cLand Titles Act\u2019 (R.S. Sask., 1909, ch. 41), as having been fraudulently obtained.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Where error in the findings of the trial judge can be demonstrated wholly by argument it is the duty of an appellate court to review questions of fact even where those findings have been against fraud, and upon oral testimony.

Lim, Thean Tong ([1912] A.C. 323), followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], which varied the judgment of Newlands J., at the trial, and maintained the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs, but for reasons different from those given by the trial judge. The circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. E. Taylor for the appellant.\nW. B. Willoughby for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I am not able to reach the charitable conclusion of the trial judge that there was no fraud on the part of Annable in taking from the vault of the solicitor Grayson and from that solicitor\u2019s clerk in his master\u2019s absence the transfer of the south-west quarter of section 36, township 15, range 24 west of the second meridian, and in causing the same to be registered and a certificate of title taken out to himself.\nThe learned trial judge, however, finds that under the circumstances the onus of proof lay upon him to prove that he paid value for the land and that he failed to discharge that onus.\nI have gone carefully through the evidence and, while I fully agree in the finding that Annable did not prove that he gave any value for the land, I think also that he must have known when he obtained from the vault of the solicitor, Grayson, the transfer found by the latter\u2019s clerk in a private bundle of his employers from Kitty Ann White to Annable of this quarter section that it had been executed in mistake for the north-west quarter section of the same section which he had actually purchased from William J. White. He must have known of the mistake when he registered the transfer and took out the certificate of title in his own name.\nThe positive evidence of William J. White that he never sold this south-west quarter section to Annable, but did sell him the north-west quarter section; the failure of Annable to remember how much he paid for this south-west quarter section, which he alleged he bought, or the amount of any of the instalments he paid, or when he paid any of them; the absence of any receipt, agreement or scrap of writing evidencing a sale to Annable by White or a payment of any part of the purchase-money to White; the absence of any entry in any book shewing any such payment, together with other facts proved, convince me that White never did sell and Annable never did buy this south-west quarter section.\nWilliam J. White was the beneficial owner of the land, it having been willed to him by his father. In April, 1902, he sold and transferred the quarter section to the respondent, Coventry, and was paid by him the purchase-price. Coventry went into possession at or immediately after his purchase and has remained in possession, farming the land and otherwise dealing with it as owner ever since, without any claim ever having been made by Annable that the land was his until after he found the assignment in Grayson\u2019s vault to himself and registered it in 1909.\nKitty White was the executrix of the will of her late husband, Charles B. White. The latter\u2019s son, William J. White, was the beneficial owner and devisee under his father\u2019s will. The consideration stated in the transfer found in the vault from Kitty White, executrix, to Annable was one dollar. Whatever may have been the belief or intention of Annable when he induced Grayson\u2019s clerk to give him this transfer we do not know, but, looking at all the facts proved, I fully agree with Chief Justice Wetmore that with full knowledge of the facts that W. J. White had sold this quarter section to Coventry, the respondent, and that he was the owner of the land the appellant fraudulently caused the transfer to himself from Kitty White to be registered and so obtained the certificate of title.\nI think we are fully justified in reversing the inference of the absence of fraud drawn from the facts by the trial judge.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The father of William J. White homesteaded the south-west quarter of section. 36, township 15, range 24, west of the second meridian and in the Province of Saskatchewan and had the right of pre-emption to the north-west quarter of said section.\nHe died on the 7th of March, 1891, at his original home in Ontario, after having by his will devised said lands to his son. By the same will he devised to his wife his homestead in Ontario and bequeathed to her his chattels there, during widowhood, and appointed her his executrix of the said will, which she proved.\nWilliam J. White lived on and completed the homestead duties in respect of said south-west quarter section and got a certificate recommending him to the grant thereof.\nAs there were no unpaid debts she was, in effect, a bare trustee for her son William J. White. He, being the actual beneficial owner of the said half-section, resided on and farmed the said south-west quarter section for some years, if not till he sold it for a valuable consideration to the respondent, and, on the 26th of April, 1902, made an assignment to him pursuant to said sale. Unfortunately this could not by law be registered until the Crown patent issued, and even then was not tendered for registration, or the need for a transfer from the executrix would have been discovered and, no doubt, got.\nIn conformity with the \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d she was, on the 11th of May, 1903, granted said lands as personal representative, and this was registered on the 31st of March, 1904.\nBut it seems undisputed that respondent, who resided near it, had ever since his said purchase possessed and cultivated the land till these proceedings and, meantime, had made an abortive sale of it.\nWilliam J. White had, as appears from the abstract of registrations, previously mortgaged the property to local bankers for a small sum. And on the said 29th of April, 1902, that was discharged. A small seed-wheat-loan bond, as I take it, was made by William J. White in favour of the Minister of the Interior on the 12th of June, 1903. I see no explanation of why he should have signed for that after his sale to the respondent. As he stood in the Department of the Interior certified, as stated, for the patent, I infer he was merely carrying out his agreement of the previous year. Curiously enough the patent to his mother as personal representative and this bond bear the same number on the abstract. However, as no point is made of the execution of this bond save the unimportant one to shew that William J. White was not correct in saying he had left and never come back to Moose Jaw after January, 1903, it does not concern us much.\nThe appellant says he bought the north-west or preemption quarter-section and this south-west quarter-section from William J. White as one entire purchase, for the same consideration covering both. This single transaction becomes, as will presently appear, in carrying it out, if the story is true, strangely and in an unaccountable manner divided into two.\nThe said north-west quarter section was transferred to him by William J. White for the alleged consideration of $800 by a transfer, dated the 10th of March, 1903, drawn by one Fish, a local conveyancer.\nThere is produced and proved an assignment of this north-west quarter of said section from Kitty Ann White to William J. White, dated 14th September, 1904, for the consideration of one dollar.\nSeeing the patent only got registered in the previous month of March this transaction just now referred to clearly is attributable to the completion of the title William J. White had bargained with the appellant to give him and pursuant to which he had made said transfer of the 10th of March, 1903, referred to.\nThe appellant had lived in Moose Jaw twenty-eight years before the trial and had been rancher, real estate agent and real estate speculator, and knew the district where the south-west quarter section now in question is situate, about twenty miles from Moose Jaw. On the 18th of March, 1909, he registered a transfer from Kitty Ann White, described as widow and personal representative of her late husband, purporting to transfer to him said south-west quarter section for the consideration of one dollar, and bearing date the 20th of July, 1903, and got, thereupon, a certificate of title which he contends is conclusive against the world.\nAt the foot of this certificate is noted, by the assistant deputy-registrar, the fact that the title of the owner is subject to the above-mentioned bond to the Minister of the Interior.\nThe attesting witness to said transfer was on said date serving as a clerk in the office of a solicitor where the respondent\u2019s above-mentioned transfer from White had been drawn, executed and still remained awaiting registration, which could not take place till registration of the patent. He made at the time the usual affidavit of execution from which it appears that this assignment was executed at Moose Jaw on the day it bears date. This witness was called but can give no information beyond verifying the fact of his being attesting witness and that the document seemed to have been written by a typewriting machine he had operated, but whether on this occasion he or some one else used it he could not say.\nThe solicitor\u2019s mind is equally a blank on the subject, save that he knew this south-west quarter section had been previously to that date conveyed by William J. White to the respondent and that he must have overlooked the misdescription.\nIt had remained in the solicitor\u2019s office, I imagine, evidently untouched, for nearly six years after this appellant had got Fysh to draw the transfer from William J. White to him of the north-west quarter section, and four or five years after he had carried it to the solicitor to get the said transfer by Mrs. White, of September following, to complete the business. The appellant, on the 25th of February, 1909, having sold the north-west quarter section to Wilson and Schrader, they retained said solicitor to pass the title. He (the appellant) accompanied the solicitor\u2019s clerk, who had then waited on him for his title papers, to the solicitor\u2019s office to search for them. Whilst engaged in such search the appellant, for the first time, saw the above-mentioned assignment of the south-west quarter section from Kitty Ann White to him and induced the clerk thoughtlessly to give it up to him. He took it away without asking the solicitor and registered it as already stated on the 18th of March, 1909.\nIf he had, as was his duty, asked the solicitor he never would have got it, for the solicitor tells us he knew Coventry, the respondent, had bought the southwest quarter section from William J. White.\nThough he says he had bought both quarter sections at the time from William J. White as parts of the same transaction for one and the same consideration he cannot tell what that was. He pretends White owed him something, which the latter denies. He says the son directed the balance, which he cannot name except what had to be paid to the Government for the north-west quarter, to be paid to his mother, and it was paid accordingly by monthly instalments, but of which he can name no amount nor specify any of the times of payment.\nShe was dead before he ventured, without asking the solicitor, and hence improperly, to take possession of the document he founds his title upon, and was thereby led to invent this story he now tells. He cannot remember that he ever told any one till then that he owned or had bought the south-west quarter. It is shewn Mrs. White was well acquainted and on friendly terms with Coventry, who on coming to town usually made a friendly call on her. She had bought a house in Moose Jaw after coming to town to live, and lived in it there with her son. There is not a shadow of foundation for supposing she was likely to be a party to a fraud on respondent, as she must have been if knowingly signing a transfer thereof to another and in monthly receipt of instalments on account of the price thereof.\nThe solicitor out of whose office the assignment was improperly taken acted for respondent and had, as he supposed, passed the title by procuring the discharge of the mortgage to the local bankers, but never saw the will and, I infer, waited the issue of the patent for which William J. White had a certificate apparently entitling him thereto. I infer that, as the transfer could not be registered before patent, whoever got it, the solicitor awaiting it lost sight of the transaction and the registration of the assignment to respondent was thus overlooked. The solicitor, I may repeat, has no doubt of the fact that respondent was the purchaser of the south-west quarter section and entitled to it.\nAnd although the appellant swears the transaction between him and White was a single one embracing the purchase of a half section, he has utterly failed to suggest how or for what reason the assignments he got from William J. White, and his mother, and which he knew of all along, and had ultimately registered, one or both contained only the conveyance of a quarter section instead of the half section he was entitled to if his story is true. He listed the north-west quarter for sale, but refrained from listing the south-west quarter. He never paid taxes on the latter. He does not venture to say he omitted to do so as to the north-west quarter. He, I think, must have known in many ways that respondent was in possession of and claiming the south-west quarter section as the vendee of William J. White. The latter swears he had told him so. I see no reason to discredit him. Appellant undoubtedly knew it was a homestead quarter section, with such improvements as that implies, yet never concerned himself to know anything of the utility of these improvements with a view to benefiting therefrom as entitled on his story.\nHe seems to admit driving past it, yet never noticed or troubled to notice their state or other state of his acquisition which he never had seen except in this way.\nHe told respondent he had bought the north-west quarter from William J. White, but never set up any claim to the south-west quarter. The respondent also swears to the appellant telling him of having sold his quarter and having previously wanted one Smiley to put respondent\u2019s quarter along with his and sell both as a half section.\nThe appellant denies remembering. His explanation admits that he knew respondent had a quarter of that section, but imagined it was another. For a real estate speculator conversant with the district all this seems lame. And his story as to the alleged payments without receipts or other corroboration of any kind seems to me untrustworthy. The alleged loss of account books might, one would have supposed, be capable of corroboration, especially for one having a bookkeeper. It would have been interesting to have had the bookkeeper produce and verify the earliest cash-book and other books still on hand. And when we find the bookkeeper writing a letter clearly disclosing knowledge of the respondent\u2019s claim and that man not called one is apt to become suspicious.\nThe question of notice may, in itself, be covered by the \u201cLand Titles Act,\u201d but that does not dispense with its use as a valuable part of the evidence in a case of fraud. He swears he was to pay $800 to the Government for the north-west quarter. It is admitted the Government price actually was only $400 and, with interest, which from the date of the home-steading would, be about $260, could not be the sum he names. There would be thus left a small balance. White swears he was to have got a hundred dollars, but never got it.\nWhen we find $800 put in the assignment as the consideration, and that both almost agree, the one positive and the other suggesting that the bargain was made on the street, and it was found later that Mrs. White had to sign a transfer, I see nothing improbable in the surmise that I am tempted to make of something being said now forgotten by White relative to paying this balance to her.\nIt is not the version of either, yet they were speaking so long after the transaction was closed they may have forgotten such details. I need not dwell on, and do not rest on this surmise. If it comes to a question of veracity between them I have no hesitation in accepting White\u2019s statement as against that of appellant. The former coincides with honest dealing and a straight method of business. The latter is the converse and implies by its methods most improbable things.\nNo one has accepted the latter\u2019s story. Nor do I see how any one accustomed to such work can peruse his evidence and trust it.\nThe claims he sets up must rest on a bargain with William J. White, and the assignment put forward as executed by his mother must be taken if anything, as a mere mode of carrying that out.\nWhen I come to the conclusion, as I do unhesitatingly, that there never was a bargain with him that embraced this south-west quarter, then his act of inducing a clerk, without authority and behind his master\u2019s back, to deliver over such a document under all the circumstances I have related and of having it taken to the registry and put on record there, constitutes such a gross fraud that there should, I respectfully submit, never have been any hesitation in so declaring.\nIf White ever thought of selling and defeating respondent\u2019s rights he clearly must have contemplated fraud, and it would require but little evidence to make the appellant a party who had participated therein with him under section 65 of the Act. If a personal representative, shewn to be such, on the face of the certificate and registry, as here, should for his or her own purposes, intending to apply the purchase money to his or her own use, so receive it for such purpose to the knowledge of the purchaser, how can he not be held participating or colluding?\nIf White\u2019s story be accepted, how could the payments to the trustee be properly made?\nClear as noonday, either White or appellant intended deliberately to cheat somebody out of their rights in the south-west quarter, for I am quite sure that the late Mrs. White never so intended. And there is nothing but appellant\u2019s word for it that White did. As between the two I have no doubt in concluding it was appellant who committed fraud, and all that has followed, placing him in the light of either knave or fool, as his own story does, is result thereof.\nWe have no explanation of how the transfer of the north-west quarter from White to appellant got from Fysh\u2019s office to that of the solicitor, or for what purpose. Possibly the appellant might have helped by searches most men would have made in an effort to discover this and other details of a story involving their honour, especially knowing or having means of knowing William J. White\u2019s version given in Moose Jaw six weeks before the trial. No one else seems to know the how or why of this and many other strange things his story suggests.\nI think, however, a careful consideration of the evidence as he chooses to leave it as it stands almost demonstrates that the instrument he used was simply the product of a typewriter\u2019s mistake of \u201csouth-west\u201d for \u201cnorth-west,\u201d and its destruction was quite overlooked when about a year and three months later the late Mrs. White rectified the error by executing a new transfer.\nHaving reached such conclusions I need not enter at length, if at all, upon the questions raised by the learned trial judge\u2019s view of the Act, and the possibility of his judgment being maintained on the ground and in the way he dealt with the case. I do not dissent therefrom but express no definite opinion in that regard.\nI may call attention to the following section of the \u201cLand Titles Act\u201d:\u2014\nSection 4.\u2014Nothing contained in this Act shall take away or affect the jurisdiction of any competent court on the ground of 38 actual fraud or over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land for which a certificate of title has been granted.\nThis does not seem to me so clearly limited to the construction contended for by appellant\u2019s counsel as he seemed to urge. To restrict it to the cases of fraud only would eliminate part of the section. To apply that part of the section \u201cor over contracts for the sale or other disposition of land\u201d to such contracts as made after every certificate of title would be needless. Such a jurisdiction is nowhere in the Act taken away, and must, unless expressly taken away, be presumed to continue.\nIf, on the proper construction, it is applicable to a case such as this, for example, where the contract has not been fulfilled and yet the certificate of title which the parties might intend to become effective when once due fulfilment of contract for sale had taken place, had been improvidently issued, then the form of relief the learned trial judge gave might be appropriate so long as no right of third parties had intervened. There are many considerations relative thereto suggested by other sections of the Act.\nThe question was argued somewhat, but I have formed, I repeat, no final opinion in regard thereto.\nThe question is raised of the land not having been brought under the Act by registration of the Crown grant at the time when these competing transfers were made, but I doubt the point being well taken if nothing else had co-operated therewith. I need not form an opinion on it.\nDuff J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014We are asked to reverse the finding of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, sitting en banc, that the defendant in taking and having registered a transfer from Mrs. K. A. White to himself of a quarter section of homestead land committed a fraud, and to restore that of Newlands J., that he merely made an innocent mistake, and that, in giving his testimony at the trial that he had bought and paid for this quarter section, he was also honestly mistaken\u2014the fact being as found by the learned trial judge, that he had given no consideration for the transfer in question, but had bought an adjacent quarter section which had been conveyed to him and subsequently sold by him.\nI agree with Wetmore C.J., who says:\u2014\nLooking at the general character of Annable\u2019s testimony and his conduct * * * and the testimony of William J. White, I cannot bring my mind to look upon his action with the same, degree of charity that the trial judge did.\nI concur in the view of the evidence taken by Brown J. and in his conclusion that\nwhen the appellant got the transfer of this land from Mr. Grayson\u2019s office he had no right whatever to it, and he must have taken it and had it registered knowing that he had no right to it and in fraud of the plaintiff.\nIt is within the province of an appellate court and it is its duty,\neven where, as in this case, the appeal turns upon a question of fact * * * to re-hear the case * * * not shrinking from overruling it if, on full consideration, the court comes to the conclusion that the judgment is wrong. Coghlan v. Cumberland[2]; The \u201cGairloch\u201d[3].\nThis rule was acted upon by the Judicial Committee in the recent case of Gordon v. Horne[4], (29th July, 1910). It is, in my opinion, not possible to say that the full court erred in taking a view of the evidence different from that of the learned trial judge and in affirming his judgment on the ground of fraud which he had failed to find. His error was susceptible of demonstration wholly by argument. Khoo Sit Hoh v. Lim Thean Tong(1).\nIn dismissing the appeal, however, I do not wish to be understood as dissenting from the view of the law expressed by Newlands J. I find it unnecessary to consider that aspect of the case.\nBrodetur J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Chisholm & Regan.\nSolicitors for respondent: Willoughby, Craig & McWilliams.\n[1] 1 West.

Brosseau K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I agree entirely with the judgment of the court of appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised here is whether or not the respondents have so used the wall erected by appellants as entitles the latter to call upon them for payment of half the costs of construction.\nThe line between these adjacent properties has never been finally determined and seems so doubtful that their respective surveyors employed to try and determine it, found the appellants\u2019 wall in part might be upon the ground of the respondents and recommended making a party-wall of it.\nBut the respondents instead of agreeing to that conceived the idea that they might so construct their building as to avoid perceptibly pressing upon or enjoying support from this wall yet enjoy every other benefit that an external or end wall could give it and be free from being called on to contribute to the cost of its erection.\nRespondents\u2019 architect ingeniously contrived, by means of an iron structure rested on the front and rear walls or foundations and on pillars in the basement at a distance of a few feet from the wall in question, to avoid putting any beams into the wall as in old days was the common method of support to carry the upper part of a building.\nThe iron beams reached up to the edge of the wall in question and, so as to enable respondents to say it did not touch the wall, a sheet of paper was put between the end of each of these beams and the wall. It was thought this was not enough, but a pretence of an end wall was made by building one of eight inches consisting of terra-cotta brick which, I suppose, could be a furring to receive the plastering on the inside.\nCovered over the roof by usual material the job looked well done and all the protection of any party-wall was got without the expense of paying for half of it.\nThere were weak spots in the scheme. In the cellar the wall in question was white-washed by respondents, no doubt for purposes of light and cleanliness. The terra-cotta brick only began with the ground floor and was carried on the iron frame structure I have referred to. And when it became necessary to make the roof complete the respondents used metal flashing, which they found necessary to tie to the appellants\u2019 wall by nails driven into that. The respondents, therefore, had all the benefits (save the usual extent of support) a party-wall ever gives by sheltering the occupants of its building from the inclemencies of the weather.\nThe terra-cotta unless covered by metal or cement was worthless as an external wall. This was not so covered.\nThe question is raised whether or not this use of a party-wall is a usage of it that entitles the appellants to compensation.\nIt is said that so long as the party-wall is not used for support of the building put up against it the appellants have no right to complain.\nIt is by no means clear that the respondents\u2019 structure does not derive very substantial support from the stone wall in question. If the foundations of respondents are, as few are, absolutely solid, and can never settle and their structure has been built absolutely plumb, the structure undoubtedly can never rest for support on the party-wall. But if, as shewn, it rests on a blue clay, liable to give way and produce a settlement, then assuredly the party-wall of stone may become not only a great support and stay, but also a perpetual safe-guard that the settlement will, on that side, be kept nearly plumb. I hardly think the sheet of paper, now most likely ground to powder by the pressure, will help much.\nIt seems asking rather too much, indeed, to require a good deal of assurance, to obtain such an assurance against the possibilities of the consequences of such settling tendencies and yet to say that this party-wall is of no use to respondents and hence that it does not use it.\nBut there is more than that; they made, as bound by law, an application to the civic authorities for a permit to build and, in that, represented their proposed building to be of four stories in height and the thickness of its external party-wall as follows:\u2014\nThickness of external walls, 1st, 20, 2nd, 16, 4th, 16, 5th * * 6th * * 7th * * 8th * * 9th * * 10th * *. Thickness of party-walls, 1st, 24, 2nd 20, 3rd, 16, 4th * * 5th * * 6th * * 7th * * 8th * * 9th * * 10th * * . Are the party walls solid or vaulted: solid. External walls * * .\nEither it was intended to use this wall now in question or it was not.\nCertainly if it was intended to use this appellants\u2019 wall as a shield against prosecution the respondents ought not to be heard to say they did not use it.\nAnd if it was not intended to use it, but to rely on the terra-cotta structure as an external wall, then that was something like fraud upon the authorities. I prefer believing respondents\u2019 application and intention were honest. Indeed, I hardly think they should be allowed to say otherwise.\nThe inspector says:\u2014\nQ.\u2014In other words, they used Morgan\u2019s wall as their outside wall, is that the ease?\nA.\u2014Well, I do not know if I can answer that way. But what I know is that there was a wall there, and they came to my office to ask me if I would accept a terra-cotta wall hanging on steel joists and beams, I told them it was unnecessary as there was a strong wall there. They said that they did not want to use this strong wall, but wanted a terra-cotta wall independent of Morgan\u2019s wall, I said if Morgan\u2019s wall was not there you would have to build according to your application, because it would not answer the purpose of the by-law.\nQ.\u2014You could not have a terra-cotta wall without anything outside?\nA.\u2014No, you cannot have an exterior wall built of terra-cotta, only eight inches.\nQ.\u2014That would not have been a wall?\nA.\u2014No, not an external party-wall.\nQ.\u2014As a matter of fact there was no wall built by them at all that would be allowed as an exterior wall?\nA.\u2014No, there was none.\nEven without more than using the wall to nail the roof to and finish the protection against the weather which this wall in question gave respondents, I incline to think they made that use of the wall that requires they should pay for it.\nThe mere accidental shelter a Avail gives, say to a tent, though beneficial as sheltering from the wind, can give no right of compensation. But this design shews a great deal more. It is a use of a wall for all the purposes for which an external or party-wall is needed and the very effort put forth to avoid, by the design adopted, giving compensation, shews a desire to use the wall in the common acceptation of the term.\nIt is not the mere support involved and usually referred to that determines the limit of the law in this regard. The law gives the right to use such a wall and implies the corresponding obligation to pay for it. It saves wasting money, and those thus saved (as the respondents were), must pay for the use they have made of the privileges the law gives.\nModern ingenuity and skill may enable a dispensation of the use of the old devices as to support, but does not avoid the application of the principle the law always carried in it and which, when applied here, seems to me to bind the respondents to pay for the benefits they enjoy thereunder. Without this wall they would have had to build another, such as specified, by itself for external walls.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court of appeal, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The evidence is sufficient to establish the conclusion that the appellants\u2019 wall serves the purpose of an exterior wall in the protection of the respondents\u2019 building. The respondents\u2019 architect admits as much: and the municipal inspector makes it clear that it was because of the juxtaposition of the appellants\u2019 building that the respondents were allowed to proceed with the erection of their building without constructing an exterior wall on the south side. It is really not disputed that the respondents have intentionally and deliberately availed themselves of the appellants\u2019 wall for all the purposes of an exterior wall except support; and there can be little doubt that they constructed the building in the full expectation that, when it had settled into its permanent position, it should receive support also from the appellants\u2019 wall. The respondents have, no doubt, struggled hard to avoid the burden while enjoying the benefit but, I think, they have not succeeded. I agree with reasons given by Mr. Justice Trenholme and by the trial judge.\nAnglin J.\u2014Although the evidence is probably insufficient to establish that it was the intention of the defendant company that their building should receive lateral support on its southern side from the north wall of the plaintiffs\u2019 building, or that it in fact receives such support, the use made by the defendants of the plaintiffs\u2019 wall, in my opinion, constituted it a party-wall. By an ingenious method of construction the defendants have, perhaps sufficiently, provided for the support of the eight-inch terra-cotta structure, which they call the south wall of their building, without its receiving actual support from the plaintiffs\u2019 north wall. But the latter wall is none the less made use of by the defendants in many respects as an external wall of their building.\nBut for its contiguity the by-laws of the City of Montreal, if enforced as we must assume they would have been, would have prevented the erection of the defendants\u2019 building having for its south wall merely an eight-inch terra-cotta structure. The evidence indicates that the civic authorities permitted the building to be constructed as it was solely because it was represented to them that the plaintiffs\u2019 north wall would be used as a party-wall. The defendants have in fact no other south wall of any kind in their basement. They have whitened the face of the plaintiffs\u2019 wall which serves as the south side of their cellar rooms. They have actually connected the top of their terra-cotta structure with the north wall of the plaintiffs\u2019 building by the use of metal flashing. Without the covering afforded by the plaintiffs\u2019 wall, the defendants\u2019 terra-cotta structure would not at all have answered the purpose of an external wall. It is in fact the plaintiffs\u2019 wall which, partially at least, serves that purpose. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the defendants have taken such possession and have made such use of the plaintiffs\u2019 wall that they should not be allowed to escape liability to pay one-half the cost of so much of it as they have thus taken advantage of.\nIn an attempt to evade this liability \u2014 noteworthy for its cunning rather than for its honesty \u2014 they have, no doubt, not made the full use of the plaintiffs\u2019 wall which they might have made of it as a party-wall. But they have made and are making a use of it which they cannot honestly enjoy without assuming the obligations incident to its existence as a party-wall. It is gratifying to me that the law, as I understand it, does not require us to reach a conclusion not consonant with common honesty, which would be the result of upholding the respondents\u2019 contention.\nFor these reasons and those stated in the opinions of the learned trial judge and of Mr. Justice Trenholme, who dissented in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, I would respectfully allow this appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of King\u2019s Bench and would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La question est de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait usage du mur \u00e9rig\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant dans la ligne de s\u00e9paration entre leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, et si elle est tenue de lui en payer la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur. Il est bien \u00e9vident que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8glements municipaux, la b\u00e2tisse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e serait ill\u00e9galement construite si elle n\u2019utilisait pas le mur en question.\nLes autorit\u00e9s municipales, quand elles ont accord\u00e9 le permis de b\u00e2tir, ont compris que ce mur serait utilis\u00e9 et l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est exempt\u00e9e par l\u00e0 m\u00eame d\u2019en construire un tel que requis par les ordonnances de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Mais quand elle fut mise en demeure par l\u2019appelant de payer la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur de ce mur, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle n\u2019en avait pas besoin.\nLes ing\u00e9nieux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s auxquels l\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu recours violent les principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la justice et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et il ne peut lui \u00eatre permis de s\u2019enrichir ainsi aux d\u00e9pens d\u2019autrui.\nElle a mis dans les \u00e9tages sup\u00e9rieurs de sa b\u00e2tisse un mur en brique poreuse (terra-cotta) qui, comme il est en preuve, ne peut servir que dans l\u2019int\u00e9rieur et ne pourrait jamais \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme mur ext\u00e9rieur \u00e0 moins d\u2019\u00eatre recouvert de m\u00e9tal ou d\u2019une couche de ciment.\nDans le soubassement elle n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de continuer son mur de brique poreuse et le mur du demandeur, appelant, fait la division des deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e avait laiss\u00e9 entre son mur de terra-cotta et le mur du demandeur un espace \u00e0 peine suffisant pour y mettre une feuille de papier. Comme le terrain est peu solide \u00e0 cet endroit il est arriv\u00e9 ce qui devait in\u00e9vitablement se produire: les deux b\u00e2tisses se sont rejointes et elles se trouvent l\u2019une sur l\u2019autre.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, cependant, n\u2019aurait pas pu se contenter d\u2019en rester l\u00e0 car la pluie se serait in\u00e9vitablement introduite entre les deux murs et aurait desagr\u00e9g\u00e9 sa brique poreuse et rendu sa maison inhabitable. Alors elle a r\u00e9uni la partie sup\u00e9rieure de sa brique poreuse au mur du demandeur par une bande de m\u00e9tal qu\u2019elle y a clou\u00e9e solidement.\nElle a donc fait acte de propri\u00e9taire sur ce mur en y introduisant ces clous et cette bande de m\u00e9tal.\nLa loi d\u00e9clare que les murs sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s mitoyens (art. 510 C.C.).\nIl me para\u00eet bien \u00e9vident que si, plus tard, les tribunaux avaient \u00e0 se prononcer sur la nature du mur en question qu\u2019ils le consid\u00e8reraient comme mitoyen. L\u2019usage que l\u2019intim\u00e9e en fait dans le soubassement, la bande de m\u00e9tal qui y a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite et clou\u00e9e dans le haut feraient considerer le mur \u00e9rig\u00e9 par le demandeur comme \u00e9tant le mur mitoyen servant aux deux maisons, vu que le mur en brique poreuse qui s\u2019y trouverait ne pourrait pas plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le mur ext\u00e9rieur de la maison de l\u2019intim\u00e9e que les enduits faits par le demandeur-appelant, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait bien acqu\u00e9rir la mitoyennet\u00e9 apr\u00e8s entente avec l\u2019appelant. C\u2019est une facult\u00e9 que la loi lui accorde (art. 518 C.C.). Mais si, au lieu de proc\u00e9der de cette mani\u00e8re, elle s\u2019est servie du mur construit exclusivement par son voisin, il est clair qu\u2019en pareil cas ce dernier pouvait la poursuivre en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et pouvait demander la destruction m\u00eame de la besogne mal plant\u00e9e, pour me servir de l\u2019expression de Fuzier-Hermann, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. \u201cMitoyennet\u00e9,\u201d No. 222.\nMais ne pouvait-il pas \u00e9galement, s\u2019il le pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait, consid\u00e9rer l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme ayant tacitement manifest\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir la mitoyennet\u00e9 et r\u00e9clamer d\u2019elle le paiement de la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur de son mur? La jurisprudence et la doctrine n\u2019ont pas craint d\u2019aller jusque l\u00e0. (Fuzier-Herman, vo. \u201cMitoyennet\u00e9,\u201d No. 223.). Le propri\u00e9taire voisin peut donc devenir acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019un mur mitoyen soit en donnant, formellement son intention, soit en faisant des actes qui constituent de sa part la volont\u00e9 de se servir du mur.\nLes auteurs appellent ce dernier cas \u201cl\u2019usurpation de la mitoyennet\u00e9 et la personne qui y a recours engage aussi bien sa responsabilit\u00e9 que si elle avait formellement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la cession forc\u00e9e du mur.\nLa voie de fait est \u00e9quivalente au contrat m\u00eame de cession. Dijon, 21 janv., 1880, Recueil, arr\u00eats de Dijon 1880, 151.\nQuand y a-t-il usurpation d\u2019un mur? C\u2019est l\u00e0 une question de fait dont le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance devrait \u00eatre le juge souverain, surtout si, comme dans le cas actuel, la preuve est quelque peu contradictoire.\nLe savant juge qui a entendu la cause en cour sup\u00e9rieure a trouv\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e se servait du mur du demandeur, appelant. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019un mur soit mitoyen qu\u2019on y introduise des poutres: mais on peut en faire usage et, en consequence, engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 quand, en ayant recours \u00e0 des moyens plus ing\u00e9nieux qu\u2019honn\u00eates, le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un lot voisin d\u2019un mur en retire tous les avantages qu\u2019il peut procurer et qu\u2019il se dispense, \u00e0 raison de \u00e7ela, d\u2019en construire un lui-m\u00eame.\nLa jurisprudence Canadienne ne nous donne qu\u2019une cause o\u00f9 cette question se soit soulev\u00e9e: c\u2019est celle de Boyer v. Marson[2], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le d\u00e9fendeur qui avait b\u00e2ti pr\u00e8s de la maison de la demanderesse sans faire de mur, mais qui avait rempli de mortier les interstices entre le toit et le mur voisin a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 le payer la moiti\u00e9 du mur. Il y avait en plus le fait que les locataires du d\u00e9fendeur avaient pos\u00e9 de la tapisserie sur le mur. La situation \u00e9tait passablement identique \u00e0 cette cause-ci. En effet la partie sup\u00e9rieure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie de mortier, tandis que dans notre cas une bande de m\u00e9tal a \u00e9t\u00e9 clou\u00e9e dans le mur du demandeur.\nLe mur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tapiss\u00e9. Dans notre cas, la partie du mur dans le soubassement a \u00e9t\u00e9 blanchie \u00e0 la chaux.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a cit\u00e9 devant cette cour deux d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues devant les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais et qui sont rapport\u00e9es dans Dalloz 1859-1-277; Sirey, 1898-1-503.\nLa premi\u00e8re de ces d\u00e9cisions est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les constructions n\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9es qu\u2019\u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du mur du voisin et qu\u2019elles n\u2019y p\u00e9n\u00e9traient pas et ne s\u2019y appuyaient pas et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas lieu de maintenir l\u2019action possessoire qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e par ce voisin, vu que les constructions ne constituaient pas un trouble \u00e0 sa possession.\nLa deuxi\u00e8me de ces d\u00e9cisions a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sous les dispositions de l\u2019article 656 du Code Napol\u00e9on qui diff\u00e8re sensiblement de notre article correspondant (art. 513 C.C.). Ce jugement porte d\u2019ailleurs non pas sur l\u2019obligation du propri\u00e9taire voisin de contribuer au mur dont il s\u2019est servi par usurpation, mais sur le droit que le propri\u00e9taire poss\u00e8de de renoncer \u00e0 la mitoyennet\u00e9 ou de l\u2019abandonner.\nCe n\u2019est donc pas le cas tel que pos\u00e9 dans la cause actuelle que ces d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux fran\u00e7ais d\u00e9cident.\nD\u2019ailleurs les deux articles, ainsi qu\u2019on le voit, ne sont pas du tout r\u00e9dig\u00e9s de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re. Voici, en effet, l\u2019article 656 du Code Napol\u00e9on ainsi que l\u2019article 513 de notre code:\u2014\nArt. 656 C.N.\nArt. 513 C.C.\nCependant tout co-propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un mur mitoyen peut se dispenser de contribuer aux r\u00e9parations et reconstructions en abandonnant le droit de mitoyennet\u00e9, pourvu que le mur mitoyen ne soutienne pas un b\u00e2timent qui lui appartient.\nCependant tout co-propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un mur mitoyen peut se dispenser de contribuer aux r\u00e9parations et reconstructions en abandonnant le droit de mitoyennet\u00e9 et en renon\u00e7ant \u00e0 faire usage de ce mur.\nCes jugements reconnaissent le droit au propri\u00e9taire voisin d\u2019abandonner la mitoyennet\u00e9 lorsque le mur ne soutient pas sa maison. Dans notre code, au contraire, il est dit que la facult\u00e9 d\u2019abandonner ne peut pas s\u2019exercer si le voisin fait usage du mur.\nOn ensigne \u00e9galement en France que le propri\u00e9taire voisin engage sa responsibilit\u00e9 s\u2019il fait usage du mur, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il le fait pas servir a, supporter ses b\u00e2timents.

Je reconnais que la diff\u00e9rence n\u2019est\u2019 pas tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rable: mais elle d\u00e9montre que notre loi engage plus facilement la responsabilit\u00e9 du co-propri\u00e9taire que la loi fran\u00e7aise. Sous le Code Napol\u00e9on le droit d\u2019abandon ne peut s\u2019exercer que dans le cas o\u00f9 le mur ne supporte pas la b\u00e2tisse voisine: tandis que sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de notre code la simple utilisation du mur emp\u00eache l\u2019exercice de cette facult\u00e9.\nPour ces raisons j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019action du demandeur doit \u00eatre maintenue et que la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e, doit lui payer la moite du mur en question. L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens tant de cette cour que de la cour d\u2019appel et le jugement de la cour-sup\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: T.

At the close of the evidence the respondents (plaintiffs) made a motion for the appointment of experts to examine the ship in order to ascertain what works were necessary to put it in condition for navigation, and the cost of such works. The motion for the proposed expertise was granted forthwith, notwithstanding objections raised on behalf of the appellants, and, without the consent of the parties as to the appointment and choice of an expert or experts, nor allowing an opportunity for recusation, the trial judge sua sponte, named one expert for the purpose of ascertaining the matters mentioned. The appellants took exception to the judge\u2019s order. The single expert, named, made some investigations, but did not hear evidence of witnesses, and made a report recommending that certain alterations should be made to the ship at a cost of about $5,800. The trial judge received this report, and, without any further proceedings, maintained the respondents\u2019 action in respect of several items of damages claimed by the principal demand and, in addition, for the sum of $5,800 mentioned in the report of the expert. From the total amount, so found, the trial judge deducted the amount claimed by the appellants\u2019 cross-demand, and condemned them to pay the remainder to the respondents. On an appeal to the Court of Review, this judgment was affirmed as to the principal demand and the cross-demand, and, as to the incidental demand the Superior Court judgment was reversed and the said demand was dismissed.\nThe appellants, on their appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, contended that, on the evidence, the principal demand should have been dismissed and the cross-demand maintained, and complained that the appointment of the expert had been irregularly made, without compliance with the requirements of articles 392 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure and, further, that the trial judge had no authority, on the pleadings, to submit the questions referred to a single expert and that the report should have been disregarded as the expert had not based it upon evidence regularly adduced before him.\nAfter hearing the arguments of counsel the court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day the appeal was allowed with costs in the Supreme Court of Canada and in the Court of Review, costs in the Superior Court to abide the issue of a partial new trial; it was ordered that the cause should be remitted to the Superior Court to be re-inscribed for hearing on the roll at the stage it had reached when the motion for expertise was made; and it was declared that the appointment of the expert was irregularly made and the questions submitted to him by the trial judge were not relevant in the existing state of the pleadings.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nT.

About ten months before the policy expired he wrote to the company asking for the amount payable on surrender which was promptly furnished, and, more than a year later, he brought action for a larger cash payment and in the alternative for rescission of the contract for insurance and return of the premium paid with interest alleging that when he applied for the insurance he was informed by the agent of the company that the cash value of the (policies surrendered would be the larger amount claimed. The trial judge directed rescission and return of the premiums as prayed. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (23 Ont. L.R. 559) that as S. did not swear nor the evidence he adduced establish that he was induced to enter into the contract by the representations of the agent as to the sum payable on surrender, and it might fairly be inferred that had he been given the true figures he would still have taken the policy, his action must fail.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. Hellmuth K.C. for the appellant. The misrepresentation of the agent entitled plaintiff to rescind. Smith v. Chadwick[2] shews that the difference in the amount of surrender value was a material inducement to plaintiff to accept the policy. See also Smith v. Kay[3], at page 759; Gordon v. Street[4].\nNesbitt K.C. and Arnoldi K.C. for the respondents. The alleged misrepresentation was inconsistent with the terms of the policy and evidence of it inadmissible. Horncastle v. Equitable Life Assurance Society[5].\nHellmuth K.C. for the appellant.\nNesbitt K.C. and Arnoldi K.C. for the respondents.\nThe contract having been executed it could only be rescinded for fraud.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action was brought originally to enforce the contracts of insurance evidenced by the two policies; but at the trial, by an amendment, resiliation of the contracts and return of the payments for premiums was asked for. There is no allegation of fraud; the ground or cause of resiliation relied upon is the alleged representation made by the special agent of the company with respect to the surrender value of the policy at the expiration of the 20 year period, when the insured had, besides the protection of the policy in case of death in the interval, three options open to him:\u2014\n(\u0430) The right to require paid up policy at end of term.\n(b) The right to surrender at end of term of twenty years.\n(c) The right to continue the policy as insurance with annuity after twenty years. He chose to exercise his right to surrender. The surrender clause is in these terms:\u2014\nThis policy may be surrendered to the company at the end of the said first period of twenty years and the full reserve computed by the American Table of Mortality and four per cent. interest and the surplus as defined above will be paid therefor in cash.\nThis clause does not attempt to fix the surrender value or the amount of the reserve; but postpones the ascertaining of those amounts till the end of the first period of 20 years; it is, in effect, a promise to pay 20 years after the date of the policy, an amount to be ascertained then by a fixed method and on a fixed basis. The misrepresentation alleged consists in a statement made by the agent of the company at the time the policy was taken out to the effect that, calculated according to the terms of the surrender clause, the insured would be entitled to a money payment of $1,013, whereas it is now ascertained that the clause and the other provisions of the policy give the insured a lesser sum of $678.82.\nThe question is: Does the calculation made, at the time the policy issued, at the request of the insured, by the agent, although admitted now to have been made in error, render the policy voidable?\nI hold not. There is nothing in the evidence to satisfy me, and the plaintiff has not said so when examined as a witness, that he was induced to enter into the contract by the error made by the agent in his calculation of the surrender value of the policy at the end of the term of twenty years. On the contrary, I think the fair inference, on all the evidence, is that, if the true surrender value had then been ascertained and given to the insured, he would still have taken the policy. This is not a case of fraud practised by or on behalf of the company, but an error in calculation made with respect to the benefit to be derived by the insured, assuming the contract to be carried out honestly and in the best of good faith. The company is careful not only to fix the basis upon which the benefit is to be obtained, but also to stipulate against the binding effect of any promise made by the agent such as is now relied upon. The policy has this provision:\u2014\nNotice to the holder of this policy.\u2014No agent has power on behalf of the company to make or modify this or any Contract of Insurance, to extend the time for paying the premium, to bind the company by making any promises, or by receiving any representation or information not contained in the Application for this Policy.\nI cannot see how, even assuming it to have been satisfactorily proved, which it is not, that the calculation made by the agent was a promissory representation to the insured, the company can be bound, in view of all the provisions of the policy.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. concurred with Anglin J.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant made an application to respondent on the 27th September, 1889, for $2,000 insurance on his life upon the 20 Payment Life Ret. Prem. Plan 20 Year Distribution; gave his promissory note at one month for the first premium of thirty-three dollars and paid that and nineteen succeeding premiums. He got, two months later, as requested, two policies each for $1,000. He brought thereon this action on the 22nd February, 1910, to recover the sum of $2,026, and by his declaration of the 2nd April, 1910, alleged the issue of said policies, and further, that the agent of the respondent had induced him to apply for said policies on the distinct representation and assurance that the reserve on each of the said policies computed by the American Table of Mortality and four per cent. interest was a fixed sum, and that said sum on the expiration of the twenty years during which the premiums were payable would amount to $527 on each of the said policies.\nAnd further:\u2014\n8. The said agent as a further inducement represented to the plaintiff that the surplus on each of the said policies at the expiration of twenty years from the date of issue of the said policies would amount to the sum of $486 on each of the said policies.\nHe alleged also that relying upon the truth of said representations he had paid the premiums for the full period of twenty years which had expired on the second of November, 1909.\nAt the trial on the 18th May, 1910, he was allowed to amend this declaration by adding a prayer for rescission of the said contracts and a repayment of the premiums so paid and interest from dates of payment.\nThe learned trial judge gave this latter form of relief, and allowed the recovery of $1,354.64, but was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nAppellant\u2019s contention was that the agent had represented that upon the expiry of the twenty years he would be entitled, as one of four options given, to receive on each policy the sum of $527 out of a reserve fund and $486 out of a surplus fund.\nThe policies each expressly provided as follows:\u2014\nSurrender.\u2014This policy may be surrendered to the company at the end of the first period of twenty years, and the full reserve computed by the American Table of Mortality, and four per cent. interest, and the surplus as defined above, will be paid therefor in cash.\nThe alleged representations as to the amount to be expected out of the surplus fund could not be enforced because any verbal representation such as alleged could not legally vary the written policy, and could not in any case be held to have been misrepresentations of fact upon which fraud could be assigned and recovery thereon be based. This claim, therefore, was disallowed by the learned trial judge and no further contention has been made as to it.\nThe questions raised are thus reduced to the sole question of whether or not there was such a fraudulent representation by the agent as to entitle the appellant to claim rescission of the contract and a return of the premiums paid with interest.\nThe case is peculiar in this that the alleged representations were oral and the appellant does not pretend he can remember and give literally all that was said to him by the agent or agents twenty years ago, but depends on a memorandum in writing made later and speaks by that.\nThere were two agents concerned in the application. One Belfry first came to canvass appellant, saw him several times at his office and on the street, and later one McNeil representing himself as a special agent came, and then both interviewd him. This resulted, as stated above, in his signing an application, being examined, and giving his note.\nOn the 6th November following he seems to have written McNeil for some explanation.\nWe have no copy of this letter and, properly speaking, no secondary evidence of its contents. He produced and proved a letter in reply from McNeil dated the 11th November, 1889, which refers to this letter of the 6th. The greater part of this reply consists of an explanation of delays, and assuring him that the policy had been issued and gone to Mr. Belfry, to whom he had wired to deliver the policy if that had not already been done. The reply then continues as follows:\u2014 You seem to be in doubt as to the kind of a policy you applied for. In order to make it clear to you I send a slip to shew your plan.\nYou will observe that the cash value in 20 years is composed of two elements, i.e., the reserve and the surplus.\nFor particulars see plan.\nThis plan was a sheet of printed paper in which evidently there had been filled in a number of the masses of figures it contains. A good deal has been said as to its being a thing given the agents to use and as to its want of heading indicating its non-authoritative issue, but in the view I take this is of little consequence.\nThe appellant says he got this in the same envelope as the letter and that he read it and being satisfied with it placed it for safe keeping with the policies.\nHe does not pretend to remember more than that he is sure it bore out the representations made him verbally. His evidence is as follows in his examination:\u2014\nI do not pretend now to say that I remember them, but they said there would be a cash surrender value, or an annuity, or other benefits of the policy, that is from memory. I signed an application for $2,000. * * * I was satisfied when I received this slip of paper, because it sets forth the representations made to me verbally by McNeil and Belfry, and I attached it to my policy, kept it with the policy, and have had it for twenty years. At the expiry of that time I expected the representations made in that paper to be made good. Instead of that I have been deceived. * * *\nQ. You can\u2019t recollect what was said to you before you received that letter?\nA. No, I do not pretend to recollect the conversation. * * *\nQ. And are you prepared to swear here now what the figures were they gave you?\nA. Yes.\nI may observe that the letter of McNeil by no means clearly indicates that the exact amounts involved were what had concerned appellant. On the contrary it is information regarding the nature of the plan of insurance and not the accuracy of any figures involved that would seem to have been desired.\nThe learned trial judge believed him and no attempt is made to discredit him. I assume, therefore, he is a truthful witness and the inferences I draw must not be taken as indicating the contrary.\nBut I must bear in mind that the charge now made is one of fraud, and the nature of the alleged fraud, and ask myself if I can properly say such a charge so founded on that sort of recollection of a conversation, indeed of many conversations, made twenty years ago, is sustained.\nIt seems to me, as Mr. Justice Magee has observed in the Court of Appeal, that it was quite possible that the item of reserve payable might have been correctly stated by McNeil or Belfry in their conversations, and that when the appellant saw the amount in question stated therein even slightly better than Belfry or McNeil had stated, he put it away as he says satisfied. I do not take it he is swearing to an identification of each line, letter and figure as the exact verification of what he could recall.\nTherein are set forth the figures for each year of twenty years that would be payable at death, and the figures for each result according to the four options he was entitled to select from in case of surviving the twenty years.\nTo be quite sure that all or any one of these numerous figures were identical with what he had been told in the conversations that had taken place six weeks or more before, is a feat of memory that would be unusual.\nIndeed, the most any man can say in such a case is just what the appellant does say and that is liable to the honest mistake Mr. Justice Magee suggests as possible, and I think in this case, quite probable.\nIt is hardly likely that an insurance agent intending to defraud would have selected an item which was based on tables of mortality accessible to any one choosing to inquire and make the requisite calculation his policy on its face rested on.\nThe risk of doing it with a gentleman of education and especially of the legal profession liable to have the subject brought to his mind at any moment, and of a young man likely to be canvassed again by others for additional insurance, seems altogether too great to permit of one readily assuming there was fraud involved in the evident mistake.\nIt evidently was a mistake, I think. In this appellant\u2019s own case we have furnished an apt illustration of how mistakes will occur.\nHe seems, in January, 1909, to have anticipated the falling due of these policies. He wrote on the 28th of that month to respondents in Toronto a letter of inquiry setting forth in blank the several options. The figures were filled in on this letter at the Toronto office; is the note made in the case and is confirmed by appellant\u2019s evidence, I thinks, as a fact. And a letter is written on the 1st February, 1909, from that office repeating same information. In reply to this, appellant on the fifth of the same month writes as follows:\nDear Sir:\nRe Policies Nos. 378136 and 378138.\nWhen I took out these policies with your company over 20 years ago I was supplied with a guarantee shewing what the result would be to me if I survived the period. The following are the figures. In view of the figures submitted in yours on the 1st inst. would be glad to know before I take whatever action I deem advisable, whether the options submitted in yours of the 1st inst. are final.\n[Page 615\nFigures submitted and guaranteed when insurance was effected. 20 year Investment Policy $1,000, age 27, rate, $33 per $1,000.\n1. Surrender Policy for Cash, Reserve..........$527.00\nSurplus.......... 486.00\n$1,013.00\n2. Paid up Policy for $1,825.00.\n3. Paid up Policy for $1,000.00 and Cash $486.00.\n4. Annuity for Life, $81.50.\nYours truly,\nJ. R. Shaw.\nNow it so happens that the very memorandum on which he relies in writing this letter, and in this case, makes it plain that as to the surrender policy for cash the reserve item was guaranteed, but the surplus item was only estimated and based on past experience. I am quite sure no one would be justified in suggesting fraud in this mistaken representation by appellant of what he was guaranteed. But this is more than mere illustration, it is an apt test of the appellant\u2019s powers of accurate observation as well as recollection. I do not think it would be safe, resting entirely thereon as we must, to maintain this appeal.\nI may observe that the sum of $93 is but a fractional part of the entire obligation the respondents by this form of policy undertook with and towards the appellant. His life was insured for twenty years, and then after the respondent had carried that, he had the option of selecting and calling upon it for further benefits. It is not a correct appreciation of the bargain and benefits to be had thereunder to compare the $93 with what he was entitled to on the basis of one of two items of a single option to be made after he had meantime enjoyed twenty years insurance of $1,000 and various sums increasing yearly up to $1,627. And when he selected this first option of surrender to say it was the proportion of that sum of $93 to a total of $434, is surely delusive. To appreciate accurately the materiality of this $93 in its relation to the whole contract we ought at least to know what it would have cost to carry such an insurance on such a life for twenty years.\nThis question only becomes material when we come to consider the question of whether or not the appellant was in fact induced by this mistake to do anything; and if found a fraudulent mistake to enable, or see if it would enable, the court to indemnify him without robbing the respondent of the value of the contract so far as executed.\nHe does not venture to swear that he was induced thereby to enter into this contract. Nor do I wish to lay down as law that in a case of fraud it is always necessary to swear to the inducement. It may be inferred from the nature of the transaction and the substantial materiality of what has been misrepresented when regard is had to the entire contract and the relative value of the part or thing so misrepresented bears to the whole transaction.\nCan any one safely infer, in this case at this distance of time and on such defective evidence of the material facts which should be known, as a fact that, if the appellant had seen in this memorandum the true figures $434, instead of $535, he would have withdrawn from the contract.\nI cannot so infer. To do so would imply on his part an accuracy of observation and of calculation and taste for making same, he evidently had not, or he would have seen and tested the tables of mortality for himself, or in this case have seen to it that he had duly estimated the value of twenty years insurance and deducted that service value from the sum he alternatively claimed in the event of rescission. Assuming, as I do not, that under such circumstances he was entitled to rescission, I need not discuss or pass an opinion either on that or the question of whether or not his true remedy was not an action on the warranty that misrepresentation generally carries in it.\nWhatever rescission means it does not mean that he rescinding is entitled to retain any, much less large, part of what he bargained for, and to get back all he paid with interest as awarded appellant at trial hereof.\nAnother thing I cannot understand is how the appellant, who came to realize on the 5th of February, 1909, this mistake, and to sue on the policies a year later, could be permitted to rescind his contract in May, 1910.\nIf it was a fraud that had, as now is of necessity urged, been committed upon him, he was bound, if electing to rescind on such ground, to have repudiated the contract at once on its discovery, and rescind, or claim rescission then. He should not, and in law I submit could not, take full advantage of being insured for the rest of that year and then later on attempt repudiation.\nEvery hour of this he was putting respondent, who could not rescind, at a disadvantage. He was not entitled to have attempted such a thing. I tried on the argument to get his counsel to explain how the last paragraph of the statement of claim was at all consistent with this requirement of the law. I am yet without a satisfactory reply.\nI assume counsel must have read the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith who deals with this from the pleading point of view, and had found that the least said the better.\nI am unable to understand how the real question of proper repudiation was not raised and argued out on facts so patent as here. Fortunately the other grounds I rest on suffice.\nIt is usual to claim rescission by the writ in cases of fraud if it be the purpose to repudiate the contract.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAnglin J.\u2014After a careful study of the evidence, oral and documentary, I find myself unable to say that it has been satisfactorily established that the appellant was induced upwards of twenty years ago by a material misrepresentation to enter into the contract of insurance of which he now claims rescission on that ground. My brother Idington has indicated reasons why the appellant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to sustain his claim and to justify a reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Apart from the difficulty created by his failure to bring action promptly on discovering the alleged misrepresentation and his omission to pledge his oath that that misrepresentation actually induced him to enter into the contract (which I regard as most important), for lack of satisfactory evidence of the misrepresentation itself, which, in the circumstances of this case, would require to be even more than usually clear and convincing, this action fails.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Brodeur J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kilmer, McAndrew & Irving.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Arnoldi & Grierson.\n[1] 23 Ont.

A certain portion of the hay delivered was rejected by the officials of the Department as not up to the standard required by the contract, some of which was restored to the suppliant and some stored subject to his order. No order having been received in respect to the latter, and the storage space being required, the hay was sold by the Department and the proceeds paid to the suppliant, who filed a petition of right claiming the price of hay received by the Department and not paid for and damages for the sale of the stored hay without authority, which was alleged to be a conversion. He was given judgment for the hay delivered and accepted, but his claim for damages was dismissed, the court holding that the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d did not make the Crown liable for a tort committed by an official.\nThe contract provided that hay occupying a space of more than 70 cubic feet per ton, if accepted, should be subject to a reduction of $1.50 per ton from the contract price, and the Crown by counterclaim demanded payment of an amount representing the aggregate of the deductions for excess of space. The court dismissed the counterclaim for want of evidence.\nOn an appeal by the suppliant to the Supreme Court of Canada the court, after hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, reserved judgment, and, on a subsequent day, there being an equal division of opinion among the judges, the judgment of the Exchequer Court stood affirmed.\nThe Crown took no cross-appeal on the counterclaim.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nAuguste Lemieux E.G. for the appellant.\nR.

The rock came through a man-hole above the shaft where men were engaged in stoking and there was a trap-door over the mouth of the shaft which was open at the time. Before proceeding with the stoking the workman in charge sent a helper to see if this trap-door was shut and when the latter called out \u201ceverything is all right\u201d went on with the work. If the trap-door had not been open the plaintiff could not have been injured.\nThe plaintiff brought an action at common law and under the \u201cMining Act\u201d for damages in which the jury found that the defendants were guilty of negligence for not providing a suitable pentice for the protection of workmen in the shaft (as required by sub-sec. 17 of sec. 164 of the \u201cMining Act\u201d of Ontario); they negatived contributory negligence by the plaintiff and assessed the damages at $2,500, for which judgment was entered for the plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeal maintained this verdict and held that the defendants could not rely on the doctrine of common employment as the accident was caused by breach of a statutory duty to which that doctrine does not apply.\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which, without reserving judgment, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nH.E.

The main defence was that the subscription for the shares was procured by fraudulent misrepresentations upon discovery of which appellant had repudiated it. The jury found that he was not misled by any statements made to him and that he had delayed his repudiation for an unreasonable time after becoming dissatisfied. Judgment was entered for the plaintiffs at the trial and defendant appealed directly to the Court of Appeal, where he complained of misdirection and non-direction to the jury. His objections on these grounds were overruled for the reason that they were not taken at the trial and the jury were properly instructed as to the subject-matter. Another objection was that a question, \u201cDo you find in favour of the plaintiffs or the defendant?\u201d should not have been submitted, as to which the Court of Appeal held that it was taken too late, and, even if it had been raised at the trial, it could not prevail, as the judge had a right to put the general question if he thought fit, if his charge was such as to enable the jury to deal with the issues by a general verdict.\nA third objection that there was no proof of a by-law authorizing the sale of shares at a discount was disposed of on the ground that, as such a by-law existed, proof could have been easily made and the plaintiffs would be allowed to put in a copy before the Court of Appeal.\nThe court also held that an allotment made without compliance with the provisions of sec. 106 of the \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d was voidable only and could not be avoided except upon a record properly framed for the purpose.\nOn appeal by the defendant to the Supreme Court of Canada the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed for the reasons given therein:\nAppeal dismissed with costs.[2]\nJohn W.

There was some delay in the completion of the buildings and the respondents, after taking possession of the buildings, refused to make the final payment provided under the contract on the ground of faulty execution of the works, deviation from specifications and negligence. In an action to recover the balance of $8,800 remaining unpaid the respondents filed a defence and instituted a cross-action against the appellants for rescission of the contract, reimbursement of $5,200 paid on account, and for $9,300 damages for breach of contract, asking also for the demolition of the buildings on account of defective construction. The cases were tried together in the Superior Court and the judgment by Lafontaine J. dismissed the appellants\u2019 action, awarded the respondents $513 for damages, and ordered the return of the money paid on account. By the judgment of the Court of Review this judgment was varied by increasing the damages to $5,800 and allowing the appellants $2,930 for balance due them on the contract price. By the judgment appealed from the Court of King\u2019s Bench restored the judgment at the trial in so far as it dismissed the action of the appellants and awarded $513 to the present respondents.\nOn the appeal, by the contractors, to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for both parties, the court reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, the judges being equally divided in opinion (the Chief Justice and Duff and Anglin JJ. considering that the appeal should be dismissed; Davies, Idington and Brodeur JJ. considering that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Review restored), the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench stood affirmed, no costs being allowed.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nR.

Under powers of sale contained in his mortgages Zuber took proceedings to sell the property and the plaintiffs brought action to restrain the sale, and obtained an interim injunction which was afterwards discharged. The property was then put up for sale at auction. One Boehmer, acting for the appellants, instructed a man named Fish to bid and he ran the price up to $43,500, the respondent Roos having bid $43,000. At request of Zuber's solicitor the auctioneer inquired of Fish if he was prepared to pay the money if the property was knocked down to him and he requested and was given half an hour to satisfy the mortgagee of his ability to do so. He did not return at the expiration of that time and Roos withdrew his last bid. The property was offered for sale again and knocked down to Roos at $39,500, and was conveyed to him a few days later by Zuber.\nThe appellants then proceeded with their action to restrain the sale, adding Roos as a party, and alleged that it was not conducted in a fair, open and proper manner; that Roos, was not the highest bidder; that the conditions of sale were unduly onerous; that there was collusion between Zuber and Roos to enable the latter to obtain the property for less than its value; and that Roos was acting as agent for Zuber and the sale was not bon\u00e2 fide.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the grounds that the conditions of sale did not furnish full information as to the first mortgage and as to existing leases and liens; that the deposit to be made by the purchaser was fixed at twenty per cent.; and that only seven days were given for the purchaser to make objections to the title. This judgment was reversed by a Divisional Court, which held that no one was deterred from bidding by reason of the conditions and that there was no omission or misstatement of any fact material to be known; that the price obtained for the property was a fair one; and that Roos had a right to withdraw his bid when Fish failed to put up the deposit. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAfter hearing counsel for both parties the Supreme Court reserved judgment, and at a subsequent date dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSecord K.C. for the appellants.\nWatson K.C. for the respondents.\n[1] 25 Ont.

They contended that, as the River Gatineau was not navigable nor floatable, but merely flotable a b\u00fbtches perdues, they were, as riparian proprietors, owners of the bed of the river between the lots in question, each title carrying with it ownership ad medium filum aqu\u0153. The lots were granted in fee simple by the Crown in the years 1860 and 1891, respectively, and the grants contained no special reservations in regard to the bed of the river. At the locus in dispute the course of the river is interrupted by \u201cPaugan Falls,\u201d a natural water-power capable of development for commercial purposes. The Township of Low was erected, by proclamation, in 1859, out of the wild lands of the Crown, and its eastern limit was bounded by the waters of the river; in a similar manner the Township of Denholm was erected, in 1860, with its western limit bounded by the waters of the river; the description of the lots stated they were, respectively, situated within Low and Denholm.\nIn 1899, the defendants, Hanson Brothers, purchased from the Government of Quebec that part of the bed of the river lying between the lots in question, and received a Crown grant therefor. Upon the institution of the action against them, the Attorney-General for Quebec intervened to protect the rights of the defendants in virtue of the grant to them, alleging that the river was navigable and floatable; that its bed was a portion of the Crown domain, and that it had never become the property of the plaintiffs. It was also contended by the defendants that, as the lots were described in the plaintiffs\u2019 title as bounded by the river and situate within the area of the respective townships, no property in the bed passed to them in any event.\nThe trial judge, in maintaining the plaintiffs\u2019 action, held that the river was not a navigable river, and that, by the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in Tangway v. Canadian Electric Light Go.[2] it was also non-floatable. As to the other point he held that a grant giving a non-navigable and non-floatable river as the boundary of the land sold could not be read as implying a reservation of its bed or as excluding rights in it from the grant. The Court of King\u2019s Bench reversed this judgment on both grounds, holding the river to be floatable and that the plaintiffs\u2019 grant conveyed no title to the bed of the river.\nOn appeal by the plaintiffs to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel on behalf of both parties, judgment was reserved, and, on a subsequent day, the judges being equally divided in opinion, the appeal stood dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nAylen E.G. for the appellants.\nR.

The defence was rested entirely upon alibi and the accused testified on his own behalf stating that he had been at home during the whole of the night in question, but making no mention of any facts concerning the shooting. In his charge the trial judge reviewed the evidence, in a general way, and told the jury that, upon the evidence adduced, they must either convict or acquit of the crime of murder, that they could not return a verdict of manslaughter, that if they believed J.'s account of what happened to be substantially true they should convict of murder.; and he did not instruct the jury as to what, in law, constituted manslaughter nor as to circumstances on which the verdict might be reduced to manslaughter. E. was convicted of murder.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that, on the evidence, the charge of the trial judge was right, and that the omission to instruct the jury in respect to manslaughter did not occasion any substantial wrong or miscarriage which could justify the setting aside of the conviction nor a direction for a new trial.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington J.\u2014In a criminal appeal, it is doubtful whether any question except that upon which there was a dissent in the court below could be reviewed on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPer Duff J., dissenting.\u2014In the circumstances of the case, the effect of the charge was to withdraw from the jury some evidence which ought to have been considered by them and which, if considered (by them, might have influenced them favourably towards the accused in arriving at their verdict; consequently, some substantial wrong was thereby occasioned on the trial and the conviction should not be permitted to stand.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court for the Province of Alberta[1], which affirmed the conviction of the appellant of the crime of murder, Beck J. dissenting.\nAt the trial, in April, 1912, before Mr. Justice Simmons and a jury, the appellant was convicted of the murder of a Royal North-West Mounted police constable, at Frank, in Alberta, on the night of the 12th of April, 1908, and was sentenced to death. An application for a reserved case was refused by the trial judge. Upon application to the court in banco, an appeal was heard, the notice of appeal raising the following questions:\u2014\n\"(1) As to whether the said learned judge erred in directing the jury that there were only two possible conclusions they could come to, a verdict of guilty of murder or a verdict of not guilty and that they could not consider the question of manslaughter at all.\n\"(2) As to whether the said learned judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury that if they found that the crime was committed by the accused without malice, they were entitled to bring in a verdict of manslaughter.\n\"(3) As to whether the said learned judge erred in not instructing the jury as to what elements constituted the crime of murder and what that of manslaughter and the difference between said two offences.\n\"(4) As to whether the said learned judge erred in not instructing the jury that they might, and under what circumstances they might, on a charge of murder bring in a verdict of manslaughter.\n\"(5) As to whether the said learned judge erred in instructing the jury that the evidence of witnesses as to seeing a flash and hearing a noise at a certain hour was corroborative of the evidence of the witness Jasbec.\n\"(6) As to whether the said learned judge erred in instructing the jury that the evidence of the wife of the witness Jasbec was corroborative of the evidence of said Jasbec.\n\"(7) As to whether the said learned judge erred in not instructing the jury that if they believed the evidence of the witness Jasbec they must believe it wholly.\"\nThe Supreme Court for Alberta having dismissed this appeal, Mr. Justice Beck dissenting, on the ground that there had been misdirection at the trial which occasioned substantial wrong or miscarriage and that there should be a new trial, the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe charge to the jury, by Mr. Justice Simmons, was as follows:\u2014\n\"Gentlemen of the jury:\u2014It is my duty to explain to you the law concerning the offence which is charged against the defendant here, and to explain to you the application of the law governing this offence in relation to the offence which is before you in so far as it may affect the guilt or innocence of the defendant Fritz Eberts. It is not necessary for me to define to you what murder is. You know pretty well what that means. But there are some specific definitions given which may possibly widen the meaning of the term murder from its common interpretation, and they are to this effect, that when a person goes out to commit some indictable offence, such as burglary or robbery, and if he means to inflict grievous bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any such offence, such as burglary or robbery, or to facilitate the flight of an offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury, that would be murder. So that you see a person might be guilty of murder in that sense, although he may not have a murderous intention in the common ordinary conception of that term. He may have started out to commit a common indictable offence and may have armed himself for that purpose, in order to assist in committing the offence or to assist in his escape.\n\"Now, in the present case the evidence on one branch of this is quite clear \u2014 that is, as to the death of the unfortunate young man. That is well localized as to the place and the time. There is the evidence of Kroning, the brakeman, as to seeing the flash and hearing the report of a gun, and the evidence of two other witnesses who heard the noise sometime during the night \u2014 at least after twelve or one o'clock, and Pietro Amicarello being another; all identifying the time as being after twelve or one o'clock, and in the vicinity, according to Pietro Amicarello and Kroning, of between two o'clock and half past two. Kroning says it must have been about that time. The train was due to leave at 2.25 and it took a little time to pull up the slack, they just got under way when he heard the report and saw the flash, and the Italian says it was about twenty minutes after two when he looked at the time in the station. So that part of it seems to be pretty well localized as to the actual time, and that seems to be very important, and I may call your attention to it later on.\n\"Now, the next circumstances coming to light were the finding of the body by the Chinaman, and by Mr. Steeves and Mr. Haslett, and there was the examination of the body by the sergeant and by Dr. McKenzie and by Mr. Addison. I would like to call your attention particularly to the evidence of Mr. Addison, the undertaker. He described to you very minutely the condition of the body in relation to the wounds that had been received, all corroborative of the evidence of the other witnesses that they were fired at close range, burning the face and around the neck and shoulders and tearing the vital parts around the lungs and heart. Then Mr. Addison also gave evidence that there were bruises \u2014 a bruise on the shoulder and one on the fore-arm. Then he took out most of the shot, and one of the witnesses * * * took out the collar button. It is important for you to remember the condition of that collar button in regard to the suggestion that this was not ordinary shot. You may, if you wish, look at that collar button again, and that shot, and you may draw any inference therefrom as to the impact of the shot against any solid substance, having in view what happened to that collar button.\n\"Then the Royal North-West Mounted Police began an investigation around Frank with regard to guns, and apparently made a very full investigation of all the houses and the foreigners there, and visited the house of the accused and found the accused and his wife there and Jasbec and his wife there, and, in response to their request, the two guns are produced \u2014 a single barrelled gun produced by the defendant, which Sergeant Piper says was broken, and a Mauser rifle produced by Jasbec \u2014 the one which he says he brought up from Taber. Nothing referring particularly to this case seems to happen for some time after that, further than the inquest and the inquiries that may have been made in an attempt to ascertain who the parties were and who were responsible for it., Those seem to be the chief features of the case as regards the happenings with which the defendant here was not closely related.\n\"And, as you will have to determine upon the truthfulness or untruthfulness of the story told by the Jasbecs, to some extent in the way of corroboration, it is important to observe to what extent the story he tells may correspond with the facts as they 'have been related by these witnesses, especially in regard to the time of the injury or murder, and as to the manner in which it was inflicted.\n\"Then we have the evidence of Superintendent Primrose as to the size of the wads, associating them with the 12-bore gun \u2014 and remember, in regard to that, it does not seem that the witness Jasbec had any particular opportunity of knowing that these particular facts would come to light \u2014 namely, that Kroning would see a flash at that particular time, or that a 12-bore wad would be found, or that the evidence in regard to the nature of the wound would be given in detail as it has been given by those who examined the bodies, that is, Mr. Addison, Mr. Primrose and the doctor.\n\"Now, then, the story told by Jasbec has to be examined very closely by you because it implicates himself in the doings of that night, and the Crown have charged him with this crime, and, therefore, I propose, for the purpose of this trial, to treat him as an accomplice. The result of that is, that you will apply a rule of evidence which I have mentioned before and will expect to have this evidence corroborated in material parts, for the very prudent safeguard that he may have an object in view, namely, self-interest, in telling a story that might be very beneficial to himself. The same might very well be applied to his wife's story. Although she is not a party to the unlawful acts of that evening she is Jasbec's wife, and the affection between husband and wife might make, or lead her to make, her evidence as favourable as possible to her husband, and, with that safeguard I have just mentioned, you will apply the rule as ordinarily applied, that there should be corroboration with regard to the death of the man and to the circumstances of the death. You have already had your attention called by me as to corroboration as to the time, which fairly well fits in with the time, if Jasbec's story is true. It was getting on to that time in the morning \u2014 somewhere around two o'clock. One witness described fairly well where the moon was when he came home about midnight, and the large mountain lies, according to the evidence, to the south and west of Frank, which must necessarily cause the moon to set earlier than it would do on the prairie, for instance.\n\"Now, another reason for scrutinizing the evidence of Jasbec carefully is that he admits he has been a criminal, and that he has helped to kill cattle, and he admits he was associated with people in Frank who were committing theft. He has told a story here, and has consistently adhered to it, which, if true, would put upon the defendant the onus of at least satisfying you that the story told by Jasbec was not a reliable one. He has been corroborated by his wife, and you may use that evidence for what it is worth, using the rule I have given you. His story is corroborated by Sergeant Piper as to the circumstances under which Piper visited the shacks on the Monday morning. Both families left Frank some, time after that, and it would appear that certain things happened, in the meantime which caused them some uneasiness, and they have been related to you, and you can draw whatever inference you think proper in that regard.\n\"I might call your attention to one fact that was referred to by Detective Egan as to the finding of a spot of blood on the window close to the place where the dead man was lying, and a pool of blood, all of which seems to lead to the inference that he must have died almost in his tracks.\n\"Now, you have those facts, and I propose now to examine them more particularly in relation to the story told by the defendant himself. It has been pointed out to you in the address by counsel for the Crown, and quite properly, that while there is always under our administration of justice a presumption that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, that is modified by another rule of evidence:\u2014that there may come a time when the inculpatory facts may be so numerous and so strong in their bearing that the onus shifts on to him, then. That was really the form which this trial took. You had the evidence of a confessed accomplice in the burglary, and who was with him at the time of the shooting, if true, and you have a complete history given of their proceedings that night at the time they left the shack, and the defendant has recognized that, and he has gone into the witness-box and has told a story, and I must caution you, as to that, that you will apply the rule to his evidence, that it must be carefully scrutinized because of the self-interest he has \u2014 he is upon trial for his life \u2014 and he has recognized that he should give an explanation of what took place, and he has done so. He has said that, on the night in question, he was drunk; he does not remember when he went to bed. He corroborates Jasbec in the fact that he, Jasbec, and his wife were at his house that night. He does not say that he slept with Jasbec in the kitchen, but he says that in the morning he was in his bedroom with his wife; and his wife says the same thing, but she does not seem to be very clear as to how many nights she and Mrs. Jasbec slept in the bedroom. She said they did sleep there sometimes, and that Jasbec, and her husband slept in the kitchen sometimes. So there seems to be very little clashing in their evidence, except as to the place of sleeping, up to the time that Jasbec says they set out. Jasbec and his wife do not deny that there was some drinking going on on Saturday, but they do not give any details about it, and they do not pretend to remember anything about it. Now, then, the story told by the defendant would require close scrutiny in regard to his actions in the meantime, in so far as the evidence divulges what they are. The evidence shews that when he was at Trail Creek, Montana, he became quite disturbed because his partner came and brought him news that a man resembling Jasbec had come there, and then he told him of the murder of the policeman \u2014 he told Kane \u2014 and also that he was afraid that this man purporting to be Jasbec might talk too much; that is Kane's version of it. Eberts gives as a reason for being worried about the big man, purporting to be Jasbec, that he would have a fight with him. You should examine that very closely. You may draw what inference you think fit as to whether he would be worried about Jasbec \u2014 the big man coming to Trail Creek \u2014 if the story that Eberts has told in the witness box is the true one; namely, that he was at home and asleep and had no knowledge of the murder other than what he might have heard afterwards. Then there is his statement when the policeman Collins and the policeman Gorman went to arrest him. He denies that in toto, and also the statement of Sergeant Piper as to what he said to him after Piper cautioned him. So you see that the defendant has put himself into this position \u2014 that he has placed his word against that of Constable Collins, and he has placed his word against that of Sergeant Piper, and he has given an explanation as to his uneasiness about Jasbec coming to Trail Creek, which you may draw an inference from such as you think proper. You have heard the whole of the evidence, and if you come to the conclusion he did go out, as Jasbec says, that night and that that 12-bore double-barrelled shot gun of Jasbec's was taken with them, and that that was the instrument which caused the death of the policeman, Willmett, then you will consider that in relation to the explanation I have given you as to the law which applies to people who go out to commit an indictable offence and take firearms with them, and kill a man either in effecting the purpose of committing that offence, or in trying to escape.\n\"I am bound to say to you, and instruct you, that there seem to be only two conclusions you can come to, that is, a verdict of guilty of murder or a verdict of not guilty. I cannot see where you could consider the question of manslaughter at all, in view of the statement of Eberts himself. There is this to say also, that Jasbec after his arrest, at least very soon after, made up his mind to tell his story, which is practically the one which he has told to you. In regard to Eberts's wife, there does not seem to be very much in her evidence that contradicts the story of Jasbec and the story of Jasbec's wife, other than the question of where they slept and the question as to whether Eberts spoke to Mrs. Jasbec on the Sunday or not. In other respects, what she has said would largely coincide with the happenings that occurred around the house of Eberts, and around the shack of Jasbec on the Saturday and Sunday in question. It will be your duty, then, having regard to the explanation I have given of the law and the way in which you will proceed to treat the evidence, to come to a conclusion as to whether Jasbec's story of the happenings of that night, from the time they left the shack until the time they got back is substantially the true story, because, if it is, there is then no explanation from the defendant that would enable me to give you any other instructions than what I have given you; namely, to find a verdict of guilty against him, that is, if Jasbec's story \u2014 that they started out and went to the Canadian Pacific Railway freight sheds first, and then went around by P. Burns's store, and then around behind the Imperial Hotel, and that they had a gun with them, and that the accused asked for the gun and got it at the time they saw the shadow, or what they thought was the shadow, of a man and Jasbec heard the shot, and the other evidence given by these other people, that they heard a shot then \u2014 leaves it in the position that, if Jasbec's story is substantially true in regard to these important features of the happenings that night, then there is no alternative for you but to bring in a verdict of guilty.\n\"If there is a reasonable doubt in your mind \u2014 and the meaning to be attributed to that term 'reasonable doubt' was very well explained by counsel for the Crown, and the reference he gave of a very learned judge \u2014 I do not think I can improve on that \u2014 if you have a reasonable doubt you are entitled to give Fritz Eberts the benefit of that doubt.\n\"If there is anything you wish instructions on during your consideration of the matter you are to let me know and you will obtain it. You will also have access to the exhibits, if you wish them, during your consideration. You will now retire to consider your verdict.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"Before the jury retires I wish you to instruct them on two or three matters. I wish your Lordship to instruct the jury that if they believe the story of Jasbec or any part of it they must believe it wholly.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"No.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"I wish to read to your Lordship from Wills on Evidence[2] (reading): 'It is essential to justice that a confessional statement, if it be consistent, probable and uncontradicted should be taken together, and not distorted, or but partially adopted.' 'It is a rule of law,' said Lord Ellenborough, that when evidence is given of what a party has said or sworn, all of it is evidence (subject to the consideration of the jury, however, as to its truth), coming, as it does, in one entire form before them; but you may still judge as to what parts of the whole you can give credit; and also whether that part which appears to confirm and fix the charge does not outweight that which contains the exculpation. On the trial of a man for murder committed 24 years before, the principal inculpatory evidence consisted of his confession, which stated in substance that he was present at the murder, but went to the spot without any previous knowledge that a murder was intended and took no part in it. It was urged that the prisoner's concurrence must be presumed from his presence at the murder, but Mr. Justice Littledale held that the statement must be taken as a whole; and that so qualified it did not in fairness amount to an admission of the guilt of murder; and where the prisoner's declaration in which she asserted her innocence, was given in evidence, and there was evidence of other statements confessing guilt, the judge left the whole of the conflicting statements to the jury for their consideration.'\" \"The point is this, if they believe the statement of Jasbec they must accept his whole statement.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"With the qualifications, which I have warned them about which applies always to an accomplice, and that is the reason of the rule of evidence requiring corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice, because of the probability of the accomplice making the story favourable to himself.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"Your Lordship has the whole statement of Jasbec before you, and I would ask you to address the jury that if they believe the whole statement of Jasbec then they must bring in a verdict of manslaughter.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"If you wish to argue that after the jury retire you may do so. I have instructed the jury as to the rule of evidence applying as to an accomplice.\"\nMR. NOLAN:\u2014\"And in the meantime I wish the jury to retire.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"Your Lordship will not instruct the jury on that point?\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"No.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"I will ask you to instruct them, with' regard to April 11th, 1908, that the jury must conclusively find that there were four persons in the Eberts house on that afternoon.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"I have referred to that in my address to them.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"Notwithstanding the evidence of Jasbec and the wife they must conclusively find under the evidence that there were four persons there in the afternoon.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"And what bearing has that upon the case ?\" MR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"It affects the credibility of the evidence.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"That is a question within the competence of the jury.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"There is a rule of law.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"It is a question of fact.\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"But where two persons swear to a negative and two persons swear to a positive the positive must prevail.\"\nMR. NOLAN:\u2014\"But I would ask that the jury retire now.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"Any other application ?\"\nMR. MACLEOD:\u2014\"I would like you to direct the jury that the rule may also be considered that, to justify conviction in a criminal case, the evidence of guilt must not only be a balance of probability, but it must also satisfy the jury that the accused is guilty. They cannot balance probabilities. I would ask you to instruct the jury that the evidence must be such as to exclude the hypothesis of innocence; the evidence to convict must be such as to exclude the presumption of innocence or hypothesis of innocence.\"\nTHE COURT:\u2014\"The rule was well known, and has been explained by me to the jury, that if they believe beyond a reasonable doubt, as reasonable men, using the common sense and intellect that reasonable men use in the affairs of life, especially in relation to serious matters \u2014 using that common sense \u2014 if they as reasonable men believe that the story told by Jasbec is the true one, there is no alternative for them but to bring in the verdict I have indicated \u2014 the verdict of guilty; if they have a reasonable doubt as to the truth of that story, so far as it implicates Eberts, they will give Eberts the benefit of that reasonable doubt.\" J. W. McDonald and Colin MacLeod, for the appellant. It should have been left to the jury to decide as between manslaughter and murder; these should have been distinguished. Reg. v. Brennari[3]; Rex v. Wong On[4]; Rex v: Scherf[5]; Rex v. Daley[6]. In Gilbert v. The King[7], there was no evidence whatever to support a verdict of manslaughter; the evidence was that the shooting was an accident. In the present case there is evidence upon which the jury might reasonably have found manslaughter; the circumstances which might have justified a verdict of manslaughter and which are detailed in the' judgment of Mr. Justice Beck[8]. The trial judge, in his charge, passes over these points, and dismisses the question of manslaughter. It was the right and privilege of the jury to be instructed and directed by the learned trial judge, and it was their duty to follow the explicit instructions which he gave. These instructions made it impossible for them to find a verdict of manslaughter.\nThe learned judge directs the jury that the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter is wholly excluded by the statement of Eberts himself that he was not present at the killing of Willmett, but in fact that he was at his home on the night in question. He does not say that there is not evidence upon which they could reasonably find Eberts guilty of the reduced crime if they should find him guilty 'at all, but merely that his own story excluded such finding. The effect of the direction is that though there may be, in the evidence given toy other persons, reason to believe the ex Istence of circumstances justifying a verdict of manslaughter, yet as Eberts said he was at his home that night, these circumstances could not exist. In other words, in this respect he said that the evidence of Eberts must prevail against all other evidence, and for the purpose of excluding the possibility of manslaughter they must give full credence to the story of Eberts in his attempt to prove an alibi. The learned Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment of the court en banc, apparently does not agree with this view. Whether Eberts swore falsely or not is immaterial on the point of manslaughter. If he were guilty of perjury, he was not, therefore, necessarily, guilty of murder. Rex v. Carr[9]. By modern authority all questions as to motive, intent, heat of blood, etc., must be left to the jury and should not be dealt with as propositions of law. The Queen v. McDowell[10], at page 115. All such questions were excluded entirely from the consideration of the jury. Reg. v. Brennan[11], at page 674; Reg. v. Kirkham[12]; Reg. v. Sherwood[13]; Reg. v. Smith[14].\nThe learned trial judge directed the jury: \"When a person goes out to commit some indictable offence such as burglary or robbery and if he mean to inflict grievous bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any such offence such as burglary or robbery or to facilitate the flight of an offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury, that would be murder.\" This is doubtless a correct statement of law as laid down in section 260 of the Criminal Code, but it could not but have misled the jury. The learned judge evidently meant the jury to believe that the accused had been attempting to commit burglary, whereas the only evidence is that the accused and Jasbec attempted to gain an entrance to the Canadian Pacific Railway freight shed and the meatshop of P. Burns. This is shop breaking and not burglary, and the accused cannot be brought under section 260, though the judge so directed the jury, and that that section applied. Even if the section did apply, the judge should have asked the jury to find whether or not the shot was fired with a view to facilitate flight.\nThere were other circumstances which might have reduced the crime to manslaughter that were not referred to by the judge and which the jury were not asked to pass upon. If the accused had abandoned his criminal intent and was on the way home, and Willmett, who was not in uniform, attempted to arrest him, the arrest was unlawful and accused would not be guilty of murder. Rex v. Addis[15]; Reg. v. Carey[16]; Reg, v. Chapman[17].\nThe judge was in error in instructing the jury as to corroboration: in instructing them that Jasbec was corroborated by his wife: Rex v. Neal[18]; and in instructing them that the evidence of Kroning and Amicarello was corroborative: Taylor on Evidence (10 ed.), secs. 969-970. It is immaterial that there may have been other evidence of corroboration. It is impossible to say what effect such a direction may have had in bringing the jury to their conclusion: Rex v. Everest[19].; Allen v. The King[20]. We also refer to Rex v. Blythe[21]; Rex v. Ellson[22]; Rex v. Stoddart[23].\nE. F. B. Johnston K.C. and W. M. Campbell for the respondent, argued that the objections now urged had not been taken in the courts below; that the only questions open on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada were such as related to the dissent in the provincial court of appeal, and that, on a defence rested entirely on alibi at the trial, the appellant could not assume the position that there ought to have been a conviction for manslaughter only.\nThe following authorities were cited on behalf of the respondent: Criminal Code, secs. 53, 261, 1019; Rex v. Philpot[24]; Rex v. Barrett[25]; Reg. v. Fitzgibbon[26]; Gilbert v. The King[27]; Rex v. Scholey[28].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Idington.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, sitting en banc, refusing, Mr. Justice Beck dissenting, to grant a new trial to the prisoner who had been tried and convicted of murder.\nThe application for a new trial was based upon the contention that the trial judge -should have instructed the jury that if they believed Jasbec's account of the shooting as detailed to him by the prisoner immediately after it took place, it was open to them to find the prisoner guilty of manslaughter only, and that the trial judge had charged the jury they were bound either to acquit the prisoner altogether or find him guilty of murder.\nSection 261 of the Code reads as follows:\u2014\nCulpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\nThe question argued before us and which we are asked by the prisoner's counsel to decide in the affirmative, is whether or not, under the evidence given by Jasbec of the conversation he had with the prisoner immediately after the latter shot the deceased, it was open to the jury to reduce the crime with which the prisoner was charged from murder to manslaughter.\nNo such contention was made with respect to the conversation given in evidence by Jasbec's wife. From her version one of two conclusions would have to be drawn, either that in shooting the deceased as and when he did the prisoner was guilty of murder, or that he shot deceased in self-defence and should be acquitted. It would not be possible for counsel successfully to contend, under Mrs. Jasbec's version of the prisoner's statement of the shooting, that a verdict of manslaughter could be rendered.\nBut counsel did contend that, on Jasbec's version of prisoner's statement, the jury might have found him guilty of manslaughter only. I do not think so. I do not think, in the first place, that it was open to the jury, on the evidence, to find that the prisoner had abandoned the criminal intent to steal with which he started out that night. It might be possible for some such finding to be made with regard to Jasbec himself. Both during the unsuccessful attempt to break into Burns's store, and afterwards while they were standing in the street in the rear of the bank, Jasbec suggested to the prisoner the abandonment of the criminal enterprise which they had jointly entered upon and a return home. He further said that when the prisoner took the gun from him and went away with it, with the object of meeting the man whose shadow they had seen, he, Jasbec, had made up his mind to return home. But there was no evidence justifying any such finding as regards the prisoner.\nThen as to the fact of the deceased who was shot being a secret-police officer, and believed by the prisoner to have been such when he shot him, I cannot see where there can be any doubt. The prisoner said to Jasbec just after the shooting, and while they were returning to their shack, that he guessed the man he shot was one of the secret-police, but was not sure of it. Probably not; absolute, certain knowledge he (hardly could have had; but he believed the man was a secret-police officer.\nThe only \"provocation\" suggested was that stated by the prisoner to Jasbec that the man who, he guessed, was one of the secret-police, having found him at the time of night and in the place he did, pointed a pistol towards him told him to \"go to hell.\" Nothing at all is said about the prisoner being aroused to a \"heat of passion\" by the action of the police officer. Not a word from which any such state of mind could be inferred. On the contrary, the prisoner told Jasbec that he raised the gun he carried and shot the man dead. Looking at all the circumstances and facts surrounding the unfortunate shooting of the officer, as detailed in the evidence, I am not able to bring myself to the conclusion that any jury of reasonable men could fairly find that the prisoner shot the deceased while \"in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\"\nI think, reading the charge of the trial judge as a whole and in the light of all the facts given in evidence, it cannot be said that his direction to the jury that they must either acquit the prisoner or find him guilty of murder, occasioned such a substantial wrong or miscarriage on the trial as would give us jurisdiction to set aside the conviction or direct a new trial.\nI think the judgment of the court below was right and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant and one Jasbec being engaged about one or two o'clock a.m., in a joint expedition for purposes of stealing in Frank, in Alberta, at a time when the miners there were on strike, carried with them a gun, and having tried several places unsuccessfully, saw a man, or shadow of one, at some distance. The appellant got the gun from Jasbec and started with it to find out who the man was, suggesting it was possibly an acquaintance come to scare them. He went one route or direction and Jasbec another, as agreed between them. Jasbec tells this story and proceeds to say he concluded to go home and had gone some short distance when he heard a shot fired, and in a few minutes heard running behind him the appellant with the gun. Then both ran till near appellant's shack.\nThe following evidence of Jasbec contains the story as there and then recited by appellant:\u2014\nQ. Did you have any talk with him ? A. And then I asked him: \"What is the matter ?\" And he said: \"When I came around that corner first I saw nothing; all at once a fellow standing in front of me and he pointed a revolver at me and said, 'What are you doing here, go to hell,' and I thought he drawed his gun and fired at him.\"\nQ. Who did ?\nA. Eberts took his gun up and fired at the fellow who pointed the revolver at him.\nQ. Did you say anything more to him about it ? What was next said by either of you after that ? What was next said ? Did you ask him anything then ? He said he drew his gun and fired at him ? He said he drew his gun up and fired at the man ?\nA. And I said: \"What became of him ?\" and he said he shot him \u2014 he shot the fellow and he must be dead because he sank down as soon as the shot was fired, without a sound.\nQ. Did he say anything else about that man to you at that time ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did he say ?\nA. He said: \"I guess it is one of the secret-police, but I am not sure about it.\" That is what he said.\nThe appellant gave evidence on his own behalf and denied this whole story of Jasbec and declared he had never been out of his house on the night in question.\nThe story of Jasbec so fitted into the surrounding facts and circumstances as to corroborate it and was so supported by evidence of others that there could be no doubt of appellant having shot one of the secret-police found dead next morning with a pistol near his dead hand.\nThe contention set up is that it might have been the result of a quarrel or such other facts and circumstances as would in law have reduced the culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter.\nThe learned trial judge refused to countenance this claim when counsel for the accused asked him to direct the jury that under such facts as in evidence the offence must, if committed, be taken to be manslaughter. He directed the jury that there did not seem to be any ground for a verdict of manslaughter and it seemed as if there must be a verdict of guilty of murder, or not guilty.\nThe court of appeal dismissed an application made to it on this and other grounds. Mr. Justice Beck dissented, holding that the jury ought to have been directed as to what would constitute manslaughter, and to consider whether or not, if the accused were guilty of anything, a verdict of manslaughter might not be the proper verdict.\nIt seems to me the learned trial judge and the majority of the court were right in the view taken by them.\nTo reduce culpable homicide to manslaughter requires, in the class of manslaughter cases suggested herein, evidence of roused passions.\nThe man, whose passions we are asked to find might have been so aroused, has by his own oath denied the fact and left in his unsworn story nothing to rest such a finding upon. Moreover, his remarkable career as told by himself seemed to demonstrate that he was hardly the sort of man to be roused to passion by the sight of a revolver or the sound of rough language. Indeed, the language he used in relating this incident now in question to Mrs. Jasbec slightly varies from above and indicates he felt bound to shoot or was proud of having shot first.\nThere is nothing but mere surmise or conjecture on which to rest such a finding as is claimed to have been legally possible.\nThe discarding or overlooking such a defence to a charge of killing a man he knew or believed to be a policeman, properly armed to deal with midnight prowlers carrying guns, is hardly a case where we can, in the language of section 1019, of the Criminal Code, find that \"substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice\" entitling us to interfere.\nA verdict of that kind in such a case would have been a travesty of justice and made of the administration of the law a farce.\nNo jury could properly return such a verdict. It would, therefore, have been idle or worse for the learned trial judge to have entered upon an exposition of the law bearing on manslaughter and thus needlessly perplexed the jury.\nIt might have been argued in such a case, but it was not in this, that a man faced with a revolver was put in fear of his life, and, therefore, shooting first, was entitled to an acquittal. But where a case of manslaughter, which is supposed to fall within what section 261 of the Criminal Code defines, can find place under the very peculiar circumstances of this case, I am at a loss to understand.\nIf the learned trial judge had been asked to direct an acquittal on the ground that the man, having reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, had taken the life of another, he should have explained the law bearing on the subject and left that to the jury.\nTrue, the circumstances would not have seemed a very promising foundation to dwell upon such an issue, but it was the only possible issue that could have been raised on such facts as put in evidence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAs a matter of courtesy due to a man on an appeal for his life we heard argument about want of corroboration, which, I submit, needs no further observation than this: The gun found with the pri- soner, the wad fitted for it found in and with the body of the deceased and a mass of evidence that connected appellant therewith (quite independent of Jasbec and his story), if well marshalled and fitted together and carefully considered might have spared us that argument.\nBut I may add that it is doubtful if anything except the only point upon which a judicial dissent in the court below appeared in judgment can be brought here.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I think there should be a new trial. It appears to me that the effect of the learned trial judge's charge was to withdraw from the jury evidence which ought to have been considered by them and which if considered by them might not improperly have given rise to real doubts as to whether the prisoner was guilty of the offence of which he was convicted in arriving at their verdict.\nThe main facts are stated in the judgments in the court below and I shall refer to them only in so far as is necessary to a clear statement of the ground upon which I think the verdict should not be permitted to stand. The prisoner was convicted of murder. The homicide occurred at Frank, Alberta, on the 12th April, 1908. The trial took place four years afterwards, in April, 1912. The chief witnesses as against the accused were one Jasbec and Jasbec's wife. Jasbec says that, on the night in question, he and Eberts set out from a shack on the outskirts of Frank intending to get food by stealing; and that, abandoning a projected attempt on the Canadian Pacific Railway freight sheds and a partly executed plan of entering Burns's butcher shop, they gave up the expe- dition and started for home. On the way home noticing the outlines of a man near the Imperial Hotel who seemed to disappear \"behind the buildings\" Eberts (so Jasbec's story runs) said, \"that I bet you is Jan\" (meaning a common companion Jabusick with whom they had been abroad before on similar expeditions), \"give me the gun and I will go and see who it is;\" and they separated, Eberts taking Jasbec's shot-gun and setting out towards the figure they had observed, while Jasbec proceeded on his way homewards. Shortly afterwards Jasbec says he heard a shot fired, the sound appearing to come from the direction in which Eberts had gone. Later Eberts joined him and they reached their shack together. The next day the unfortunate deceased, a constable of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, was found in the vicinity indicated by this evidence obviously killed by a discharge from a shot-gun. These facts and the evidence given by Jasbec and Jasbec's wife of statements made by Eberts constitute the substance of the case made by the Crown against the accused. The accused gave evidence in his own behalf and his defence was an alibi. The learned trial judge in effect instructed the jury that if they believed Jasbec's story (in certain features of it which he specified), then they had no alternative but to convict him of murder.\nThe following passages give the substance of the charge so far as material:\u2014\nBut there are some specific definitions given which may possibly widen the meaning of the term murder from its common interpretation, and they are to this effect, that when a person goes out to commit some indictable offences, such as burglary or robbery, and if he means to inflict grievous bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any such offence, such as burglary or robbery, or to facilitate the flight of an offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof and death ensues from such injury, that would be murder. So that you see a person might be guilty of murder in that sense, although he may not have had a murderous intention in the common ordinary conception of that term. He may have started out to commit a common indictable offence and may have armed himself for that purpose, in order to assist in committing the offence or to assist in his escape.\n* * * * *\nIt has been pointed out to you in the address by counsel for the Crown, and quite properly, that while there is always under our administration of justice a presumption that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, that is modified by another rule of evidence \u2014 that there may corns a time when the inculpatory facts, may be so numerous and so strong in their hearing that the onus shifts on to him, then. That was really the form which this trial took. You had the evidence of a confessed accomplice in the burglary and who was with him at the time of the shooting, if true, and you have a complete history given of their proceedings that night at the time they left the shack, and the defendant has recognized that, and he has gone into the witness box and has told a story.\n* * * * *\nHe has said that on the night in question he was drunk; he does not remember when he went to bed. He corroborates Jasbec in the fact that he, Jasbec, and his wife were at his house that night. He does not say that he slept with Jasbec in the kitchen, but he says that in the morning he was in his bedroom with his wife, and his wife says the same thing.\n* * * * *\nYou have heard the whole of the evidence, and if you come to the conclusion he did go out, as Jasbec says, that night and that that 12-bore double-barrelled shotgun of Jasbec's was taken with them and that that was the instrument which caused the death of the policeman, Willmett, then you will consider that, in relation to the explanation I have given you as to the law which applies to people who go out and commit an indictable offence and take firearms with them and kill a man either in effecting the purpose of committing that offence, or in trying to escape.\nI am bound to say to you and instruct you that there seem to be only two conclusions you can come to, that is, a verdict of guilty of murder or a verdict of not guilty. I cannot see where you could consider the question of manslaughter at all in view of the statement of Eberts himself.\n* * * * *\nIt will be your duty then, having regard to the explanation I have given of the law and the way in which you will proceed to treat the evidence, to come to a conclusion as to whether Jasbec's story of the happenings of that night, from the time they left the shack until the time they got back is substantially the true story, because if it is there is then.no explanation from the defendant that would enable me to give you any other instructions than what I have given you, namely, to find a verdict of guilty against him, that is, if Jasbec's story, that they started out and went to the Canadian Pacific Railway freight sheds first and then went around by P. Burns's store, and then around behind the Imperial Hotel, and that they had a gun with them and that the accused asked for the gun and got it at the time they saw the shadow, or what they thought was the shadow of a man, and Jasbec heard the shot, and the other evidence given by these other people, that they heard a shot then \u2014 leaves it in the position that, if Jasbec's story is substantially true in regard to these important features of the happenings that night \u2014 then there is no alternative for you but to bring in a verdict of guilty.\n* * * * *\nTHE COURT:\u2014The rule was well known, and has been explained by me to the jury that if they believe beyond a reasonable doubt, as reasonable men using the common sense and intellect that reasonable men use in the affairs of life, especially in relation to serious matters \u2014 using that common sense, \u2014 if they, as reasonable men, believe that the story told by Jasbec is the true one, there is no alternative for them but to bring in the verdict I have indicated \u2014 the verdict of guilty: if they have a reasonable doubt as to the truth of that story, so far as it implicates Eberts, they will give Eberts the benefit of that reasonable doubt.\nIt cannot be doubted that, from these passages, the jury would take the view that their sole task was to decide whether they should believe Jasbec's story in respect of the incidents specified by the learned judge himself, and, if they did so, it was their duty to find a verdict of guilty.\nI shall presently call attention to the passages in the evidence of Jasbec and his wife which I think the jury ought to have been asked to consider but, in the meantime, it is convenient to observe that the charge of the learned trial judge seems calculated to mislead the jury in the important point of the burden of proof. The onus was on the Crown to establish the guilt of the prisoner, to produce evidence, that is to say, which should satisfy the jury beyond any real doubt that the prisoner was guilty of murder. It is quite true that the proof of homicide alone by the prisoner might constitute a prim\u00e2 facie case, and a very strong prim\u00e2 facie case against him. But if, in proving the homicide, evidence of its circumstances and incidents was given of such a character as properly to raise in the minds of the jury a real doubt as to the prisoner's guilt, it would then be their duty to acquit. In criminal cases (it is needless to observe) the degree of certitude at which a jury ought to arrive before finding the issue of guilty or not guilty against the accused is higher than that which is measured by the criterion of the preponderance of evidence or balance of probability applied in civil cases. In Rex v. Stoddart[29], at pages 243 and 244, the principles governing the incidence of the burden of proof in criminal trials are stated in these words:\u2014\nIt seems to the court that the jury ought to have been told that the prosecution having given prim\u00e2 facie evidence from which the guilt of the defendant might be presumed, and which, therefore, called for explanation by the defendant, the jury ought to consider the evidence upon both sides, and if, upon a review of the whole of the evidence, they were satisfied that the prosecution had made out the case that the defendant Stoddart was a party to the conspiracy, they should convict him, but that, if their minds were left in a state of doubt, they ought to acquit him, as the burden of proving the defendant's guilt was still upon the prosecution. The passages which have been cited at length are the only passages in the summing up which bear directly upon the question of the onus of proof. The concluding words of caution at the end of the summing up cannot be said to qualify the specific direction to which attention has been called. In the opinion of the court the jury may have thought that if Stoddart had not proved that he had supplied moneys in every case they must convict him, whereas the direction ought to have been that they must be satisfied, after consideration of all the evidence, that the Crown had proved that Stoddart was a party to the conspiracy, and, if in doubt, they ought to acquit him. It is in failing to adequately explain this that the court is of opinion that there was a substantial misdirection. The learned trial judge seems, (as appears from the extracts quoted from his charge,) to have thought that if the jury were once convinced that the prisoner was the author of the homicide that was the end of the case, because evidence of facts justifying his act or reducing his crime to manslaughter must come from the prisoner alone. That, of course, was equivalent to withdrawing from the jury all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence of Jasbec or Jasbec's wife bearing upon the degree of culpability which ought to be attached to the prisoner's act, assuming the homicide to have been his act.\nBefore going into that evidence, (of Jasbec and his wife,) there are two material observations.\n1st. The prisoner's statements to these two witnesses having been put in evidence by the Crown they became evidence in his favour as well as against him. In Rex v. Higgins[30], Parke J. said:\u2014\nNow, what a prisoner says is not evidence, unless the prosecutor chooses to make it so, by using it as a part of his case against the prisoner; however, if the prosecutor makes the prisoner's declaration evidence, it then becomes evidence for the prisoner, as well as against him; but still, like all evidence given in any case, it is for you to say whether you believe it.\nIt was for the jury to say how much of the prisoner's statement they accepted as true, but the Crown having offered the statement and got it before the jury it was the duty of the jury to consider the statement as a whole, and the consideration of it as a whole could not properly be withdrawn from them; 2ndly. It was for the jury to say how much they were to believe of the accounts which Jasbec and his wife gave of the prisoner's statements to them. They might believe parts of those accounts, reject other parts.\nThe jurors are not bound to believe the evidence of any witness; they are not bound to believe the whole of the evidence of any witness. They may believe that part of a witness's evidence which makes for the party who calls him, and disbelieve that part of his evidence which makes against the party who calls him. Per Lord Blackburn, in Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[31], at page 12.01.\nThe point I have to discuss is whether, on any reasonable view of the evidence of Jasbec and his wife, (bearing in mind these principles,) the minds of the jury might, under proper instruction from the court, have been brought into a real state of doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner. Mrs. Jasbec's account of Eberts's statement is as follows:\u2014\nFritz Eberts said he was out with my husband that night, but he got bad luck; when he came round the corner the policeman standing right before him and the policeman takes a revolver and put it right in his face and say, \"Go to hell\" but he came before and he shoot.\nQ. Who shoot ?\nA. Fritz Eberts shoot.\nQ. Shoot who ?\nA. Shoot the policeman.\nQ. Do you remember anything else ?\nA. He says, \"Good I kill him right away \u2014 it is good that I kill him.\" He said that, too.\nQ. Is there anything else you remember ? I know it is a long time ago. Did you have any other conversation with Eberts and his wife, when they were together, or was that the only time ?\nA. That was the only time.\nQ. That was the only time Eberts spoke to you about the policeman ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That was on the Sunday that you heard of it ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And had you already heard that the policeman was killed at that time or not ?\nA. Yes; I heard it all right. Jasbec's account is this:\u2014\nQ. Did you have any talk with him ?\nA. And then I asked him what is the matter. And he said: \"When I came around that corner first I saw nothing; all at once a fellow standing in front of me and he pointed a revolver at me and said: What are you doing here, go to hell,' and I thought he drawed his gun up and fired at him\"\nQ. Who did ?\nA. Eberts took his gun up and fired at the fellow who pointed the revolver at him.\nQ. Did you say anything more to him about it ? What was next said by either of you after that ? What was next said ? Did you ask him anything then ? He said he drew his gun and fired at him ? He said he drew his gun up and fired at the man ?\nA. And I said: \"What became of him ?\" and he said he shot him \u2014 he shot the follow and he must be dead because he sank down as soon as the shot was fired, without a sound.\nQ. Did he say anything else about that man to you at that time ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What did he say ?\nA. He said: \"I guess it is one of the secret-police, but I am not sure about it.\" That is what he said.\nI shall assume for the moment that this evidence was evidence which the jury ought to have considered. On that assumption the trial judge would, of course, have instructed the jury that the first question to which they ought to apply their minds was how much of these two conversations really occurred; how far are the statements attributed to Eberts to be ascribed to him ? Both witnesses were speaking of conversations which had occurred four years before. Jasbec himself had been under arrest for five months and having regard to the suspicions attaching to him, (it was his gun, it will be remembered, from which the shot was alleged to have been fired,) a jury would be acting wisely in examining his testimony with critical care, even with suspicion, and no lawyer would, of course, dispute that the question of what Eberts did really say in the course of these conversations was a question exclusively within the province of the jury. Did Eberts, for example, say to Jasbec, \"I guess it is one of the secret-police ?\" Did he, in talking to Mrs. Jasbec, express satisfaction in having killed a police officer ? At the preliminary hearing Mrs. Jasbec had not recalled this part of the conversation. It is quite within the bounds of reasonable possibility that the jury might have rejected this part of the story altogether; or may have felt it to be of too doubtful credit to be acted on with safety. Assuming them to have reached that conclusion, let us examine the effect of these statements, in the light of the other evidence placed before the jury by the Crown, to see if there is any substantial foundation in them for the suggestion that the prisoner acted under such provocation or such reasonable fear of harm as to make it proper that the jury's attention should be directed to them.\nThere was, I may repeat, abundance of evidence from which the jury might have reached the conclusion that, when they saw the figure of the man who was shot, they had abandoned their criminal project and were on their way home. However little such a conclusion may commend itself to one's own judgment, Jasbec's own evidence is perfectly clear upon the point; and Jasbec had been put forward by the Crown as a credible witness. In his cross-examination, he says:\u2014\nQ. When you told Eberts that you had better go home Eberts agreed to go ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And he put the screw back in the door ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you started for home ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And he agreed to do that ?\nA. Yes. This is entirely consistent with the testimony given by him on his examination in chief. Again, his evidence is precise to the effect that Eberts thought the man they had seen was their friend Jan. If the jury accepted this part of Jasbec's testimony the situation they would have to consider was this \u2014 Eberts in these circumstances setting out to accost his friend Jan. suddenly meeting a stranger who, to use the language of the wife, \"takes a revolver and put it right in his face,\" and Eberts shooting. These are the bald facts presented by this story. But there is another, and a most important piece of evidence, touching the state of Eberts's mind, furnished by Eberts's statement to Mrs. Jasbec, as repeated by her. Her report of Eberts's words is this:\u2014\nFritz Eberts said be was out with my husband that night, but he got bad luck; when he came round the corner the policeman standing right before him and the policeman takes a revolver and put it right in his face and say, \"Go to hell\" but he come before and he shoot.\nThere can be no possible doubt that if the jury believed these words to have been used by Eberts they were entitled to regard them as indicating that Eberts acted in response to and in defence against a sudden assault with a pistol. A good deal was made on the argument of the exclamation, \"Go to hell.\" But the effect of such an exclamation upon a man in Eberts's position would depend wholly upon the attitude of the person uttering it, and it is to be observed, moreover, that Jasbec admitted upon cross-examination that it was not until after he had told his story to the police that he recalled the use of this expression. The jury might, in the circumstances, consider this part of the evidence to be negli- gible. The fact, it may be added, that there were lawless, not to say desperate, men about is a circumstance which weighs as much at least in favour of the suggestions made on behalf of the prisoner as against him.\nWeighing all the relevant considerations I am unable to convince myself that a jury properly instructed might not reasonably have taken a view of this evidence which would afford a foundation for real doubt as to the propriety of convicting the prisoner of the capital offence. I take it to be indisputable that, where a homicide follows instantaneously upon acts which may be a sufficient provocation to take the act of the accused out of the category of murder, it is a question of fact for the jury whether in the particular case there was such provocation. Criminal Code, sec. 261. It is said that there is no evidence here of passion; but, where provocation is proved, is it to be said that a jury is bound to convict of murder, as a matter of law, in the absence of express evidence of passion outside of the act of homicide itself ? That is an impossible proposition. If the circumstances are such as legitimately to raise in the minds of the jury a real doubt as to the presence of malice, in the legal sense, then it is the duty of the jury not to convict of murder. Is it to be laid down as a proposition of law that the presenting of a pistol, in such circumstances as those we are considering, cannot properly afford a foundation for such a doubt ? The case is perhaps stronger in support of the suggestion that the appellant acted in reasonable fear of bodily harm, A court of appeal would, however, be assuming a very grave responsibility, if, finding in the record, evidence of circumstances which ought to have been considered by the jury as bearing upon the question whether the accused had acted in self-defence in response to a sudden assault, it should say, as a matter of law, that these circumstances could afford no basis for a defence on the ground of provocation. To draw the line between the effect of acts and words such as those attributed to the unfortunate victim in producing such a state of passion as would constitute provocation within the meaning of the law and their effect in producing a reasonable fear of bodily harm such as would afford a ground for justification would be a feat of some difficulty, and one which a court of appeal could rarely attempt with safety.\nI suppose, indeed, that no one would argue that these circumstances ought not to have been considered by the jury had it not been for the fact that Eberts himself went into the witness box and denied all knowledge of the facts alleged against him. That he did so is undoubtedly a circumstance which would tell powerfully with any tribunal, and properly so, of course, against the defence now suggested. But I am quite unable to bring my mind to the conclusion that the weight to be attributed to that circumstance was not altogether a matter for the consideration of the jury.\nTwo points remain. As to the suggestion that Eberts's statements point to action in self-defence and not to action as a result of provocation and that, since the learned judge was asked to reserve a case only on the latter point, it is not open to us to afford any relief, even assuming the prisoner to have been deprived of the benefit of a defence fairly open on the evidence \u2014 it will be unnecessary to repeat what I have said as to the bearing of the circumstances in question upon the defence of manslaughter. But there is a further observation to be made. The learned judge, as we have seen, ruled in the most unmistakeable way that if the jury found the prisoner was the author of the homicide then it was their duty to convict of murder; and the necessary effect of that ruling was to withdraw from the jury all considerations arising upon the prisoner's statements to Jasbec and his wife. He did not tell the jury that on the whole case they must convict of murder or acquit. He told them in effect that if they found the prisoner had killed the deceased it was their duty to convict of murder. The statement of a case then, with regard to manslaughter, in effect would raise the substantial question I have been discussing, namely, whether assuming the prisoner to be the author of the homicide there was any ground upon which a jury might reasonably entertain a doubt as to whether he was guilty of murder.\nThe remaining question is whether it appears, in the language of section 1019 of the Criminal Code, that there was any \"substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\" It is contended by Mr. Johnson that the prisoner having deliberately elected to stand upon an alibi cannot avail himself of a defence which is open upon the evidence adduced by the Crown, but which assumes his complicity in the homicide. In civil cases it is a rule generally acted upon that, in order to prevent litigation going on forever, a party who deliberately elects at the trial to fight his case out upon one issue and gets beaten upon it cannot raise on appeal a new and totally different issue, (which he did not put before the jury,) although it should be open upon both the pleadings and the evidence; Browne v. Dunn[32]. I should desire to consider the question long and carefully before committing myself to such a proposition as applied to prosecutions for criminal and especially for capital offences. It is not easy to reconcile this contention with the rule laid down in Reg. v. Gibson[33], per Mathew J., at p. 543:\u2014\nWe have to lay down a rule which shall apply equally where the prisoner is defended by counsel and where he is not,\nIn any case it has no application here. It was stated in the argument by counsel for the prisoner and not disputed that the issue of manslaughter was fully placed before the jury by counsel, and, indeed, the suggestion that it was not would be incredible. Then it is said that the evidence, as a whole, as it appears upon the record is convincing of the prisoner's guilt, and that, since we can see that he was rightly convicted, we are bound to hold that there had been no \"substantial wrong or miscarriage.\" I cannot agree. The construction of these words was authoritatively settled eighteen years ago by the Privy Council in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[34]. Apart altogether from the binding force of the decision as an authority, the reasoning of Lord Herschell at pages 69 and 70 is complete and conclusive. This is the passage:\u2014\nThe point of law involved is, whether where the judge who tries a case reserves for the opinion of the court the question whether evidence was improperly admitted, and the court comes to the conclusion that it was not legally admissible, the court can, nevertheless, affirm the judgment if it is of opinion that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction, independently of the evidence improperly admitted, and that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was charged.\nIt was admitted that it would not be competent for the court to take this course at common law, but it was contended that section 423 of the \"Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1883,\" (46 Vict. No.\"17) empowered, if even it did not compel the court to do so. That section is in these terms:\u2014\n\"The judge by whom any such question is reserved shall as soon as practicable state a case setting forth the same with the facts and circumstances out of which every such question arose and shall transmit such case to the judges of the Supreme Court, who shall determine the questions and may affirm, amend or reverse the judgment given or avoid or arrest the same or may order an entry to be made on the record that the person convicted ought not to have been convicted or may make such other order as justice requires. Provided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be reversed, arrested or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice.\"\nReliance was, of course, placed upon the language of the proviso. It was said that if, without the inadmissible evidence, there were evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict, and to shew that the accused was guilty, there has been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. It is obvious that the construction contended for transfers from the jury to the court the determination of the question whether the evidence \u2014 that is to say, what the law regards as evidence \u2014 established the guilt of the accused. The result is that in a case where the accused has the right to have his guilt or innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the court. The judges are, in truth, substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone, and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.\nIt is impossible to deny that such a change of the law would be a very serious one, and that the construction which their Lordships are invited to put upon the enactment would gravely affect the much-cherished right of trial by jury in criminal cases. The evidence improperly admitted might have chiefly influenced the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury in view of the demeanour of the witnesses. Yet the court might, under such circumstances, be justified or even consider themselves bound to let the judgment and sentence stand.\nThese are startling consequences, which strongly tend, in their Lordship's opinion, to shew that the language used in the proviso was not intended to apply to circumstances such as those under consideration.\nTheir Lordships do not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to them.\nIn their Lordships' opinion, substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence. It need (Scarcely be said that there is ample scope for the operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended for.\nHis Lordship is here dealing, of course, only with the case in which inadmissible evidence has been admitted and has gone before the jury. His observations, however, seem to apply with equal force to the case of a misdirection in consequence of which relevant evidence has been withdrawn from the consideration of the jury which might, under a proper instruction and not unreasonably, bring their minds into a state of doubt as to the propriety of the verdict at which they ultimately arrived. Such a misdirection is error that, (since it deprives the accused of his constitutional right to have submitted to the decision of a jury all the defences open to 'him on any reasonable view of the evidence,) can only be corrected by setting aside the verdict.\nANGLIN and BRODEUR JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 2 West.

Levine, (1912) 47 S.C.R. 103\nDate: 1912-10-07\nHarry Serling (Plaintiff) Appellant.\nand\nWilliam Levine (Defendant) Respondent.\n1912: May 15, 17; 1912: October 7.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\n(Note: Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted, 17th December, 1912.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nAction against minor\u2014Exception of minority\u2014Practice\u2014Irregularity in procedure\u2014Waiver after majority\u2014Ratification\u2014Prejudice\u2014Nullity\u2014Review by appellate court\u2014Arts. 246, 250, 304, 320, 323, 324, 987 C.C.\u2014Arts. 78, 174, 176, 1039, 1263 C.P.Q.\nAn action for damages ex delicto was instituted against a minor without impleading a tutor to assist him, and the exception of minority was set up. Proceedings taken by the plaintiff to have a tutor appointed had not been concluded when the defendant became of age and an order, which was disregarded by the defendant, was then obtained requiring him to plead to the action. On a summons for his examination sur faits et articles, defendant appeared and certain objections to questions were made by counsel on his behalf. On an inscription for judgment ex parte, subsequently filed, judgment was entered against him.\nHeld, per Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ. that irregularities of procedure in a court of first instance are matters to be dealt with by the judges of that court and, unless some prejudice has resulted therefrom, the discretion exercised by such judges in respect thereto ought not to be disturbed by an appellate court.\nPer Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ., Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J. contra. In the circumstances the defendant suffered no prejudice within the meaning of article 174 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The exception resulting from minority is relative merely and may be waived by a defendant, sued during his minority, without the necessary assistance required by law, appearing after attaining majority and taking objections to subsequent\n[Page 104.]\nproceedings in the action. He cannot, thereafter, complain of being treated as a defendant properly cited before the court nor of a judgment ex parte entered against him therein.\nPer Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Irregularity in inscription for judgment ex parte is not a reason for the dismissal of an action.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J., dissenting.\u2014The fact that the defendant was a minor at the time of the institution and service of the action and that no tutor or curator was made a party to the suit for the purpose of assisting him therein constitutes an absolute bar to the action which could not be validated in consequence of further proceedings therein after the defendant attained the age of majority. The action was a nullity ab initio and, consequently, the defendant suffered prejudice within the meaning of art. 174 C.P.Q. Larue v. Poulin (9 Que. P.R. 157); Fairbanks v. Howley (10 Que. P.R. 72), and Robert v. Dufresne (7 Que. P.R. 226), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions raised on the appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nThe judgment appealed from reversed the order by Lafontaine J., made on the 27th September, 1910, requiring the defendant to plead to the action, the order of Charbonneau J., made on the 28th October, 1910, dismissing the defendant\u2019s exception, and the final judgment rendered on the 21st of January, 1911, by Demers J., maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action and condemning the defendant to pay the plaintiff $2,000 damages for malicious prosecution.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and A. Rives Hall K.C. for the appellant.\nSurveyer K.C. and Ledieu for the respondent. The Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I am obliged with great reluctance to differ from the conclusion reached by the majority of this court to reverse the unanimous judgment of the Quebec court of appeal.\nThe question at issue is of first importance, affecting as it does, not merely the practice and procedure of the Quebec courts but the broad question of the rights of minors in that province. The judgment below which is reversed here conforms with what I have always understood to be the settled jurisprudence of Quebec.\nThis is an action brought by the appellant against the respondent to recover the sum of $2,500 damages. It is unnecessary to state in greater detail the cause of action. Nothing turns upon the merits of the claim. The respondent was a minor when served with the writ but he attained his majority during the course of the proceedings in the Superior Court after the issue of minority had been raised.\nThe question is: In these circumstances, could the plaintiff, now appellant, ignore the plea of minority and proceed to judgment without a tutor being appointed to the defendant minor and without issuing a new writ of summons? The ex parte judgment of the Superior Court proceeds on the assumption that the plaintiff may obtain a condemnation against the minor although not represented by his tutor. The defendant was not represented by counsel at the hearing, and the attention of the trial judge does not appear to have been specially drawn to the plea of minority. In the Court of King\u2019s Bench, after very full argument, it was held that the fact of minority was an absolute bar to the action; and the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed. I concur in the judgment in appeal.\nMinority is an absolute bar to an action, and, even when not set up, may be invoked after judgment rendered, on a petition in revocation. Art. 1177 C.P.Q., par. 9. The general effect of articles 246, 304, 320, 323, 324 and 987 of the Civil Code, and of articles 1039 and 1263 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec is that, except in special circumstances and for very limited purposes, a minor is not capable of performing any civil act, or of assuming an enforceable civil obligation. On the other hand the Code of Civil Procedure (articles 78 and 174), when read as they must be with the provisions of the Civil Code, make it quite clear that no person can be a party to an action either as plaintiff or defendant, or in any form whatever, unless he has the free exercise of his rights; those who have not the free exercise of their rights must be assisted, authorized or represented in the manner prescribed by law. Since this case was decided in the Superior Court, the question we are now considering came up again for consideration in Paquette v. Auclair[1], and in a foot-note to the report of that case will be found a long series of decisions, dating from 1819, in all of which the law is laid down as decided by the court of appeal. I see no reason to innovate.\nI do not, of course, dispute the right of the plaintiff, in a suit like this, upon production of the plea of minority, to take such steps as are necessary to have a tutor appointed who could be brought into the case by a new writ when the proceedings are continued as if the tutor had been a defendant ab initio. Such is the practice in Quebec. But nothing of that sort was done here and I hold that the service of the writ of summons on the minor was a nullity which could not be cured except, if at all, in the way that I have just indicated. At the time the minor became of age he was not properly before the court and he was careful not to acquiesce in any of the subsequent proceedings.\nDemolombe\u2019s dictum \u201cOn ne confirme pas le n\u00e9ant\u201d (vol. 24, par. 382, page 367) will, I am convinced, continue to be acted upon by the Quebec courts even after this judgment is rendered and until this important point is settled by the Privy Council.\nI refer to the following French and Canadian text writers:\u2014\n10. Roy, \u201cDroit de Plaider,\u201d No. 89;\n20. 2 Mignault, \u201cDroit Civil,\u201d p. 215;\n30. Sirios, \u201cTutelles et Curatelles,\u201d No. 242;\n40. 1 Langelier, \u201cDroit Civil,\u201d p. 403;\n50. Laurent, vol. 4, No. 365;\n60. 1 Boitard, \u201cProcedure Civile,\u201d No. 215.\nIn answer to the argument that the respondent was not prejudiced, I refer to the following cases in all of which it was held, that, whenever there is a nullity, there is a prejudice:\u2014Larue v. Poulin[2]; Fairbanks v. Howley[3]; Robert v. Dufresne[4].\nI would dismiss with costs. Idington and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Brodeur J.\nAnglin J. (dissenting) agreed with the Chief Justice.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Le d\u00e9fendeur intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi en dommages pour avoir fait venir sous de faux pretextes le demandeur dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec afin qu\u2019il y fut arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur capias.\nIl a produit une exception \u00e0 la forme plaidant minorit\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019a jamais produit de plaidoyer au m\u00e9rite quoiqu\u2019il ait re\u00e7u ordre de le faire apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il fut devenu majeur.\nSon exception \u00e0 la forme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e, il y eut ensuite jugement ex parte contre lui et il fut condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer $2,000 de dommages au demandeur.\nAyant appel\u00e9 de ce jugement ainsi que de celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sur l\u2019exception \u00e0 la forme il eut gain de cause devant la cour d\u2019appel qui d\u00e9cida que, vu sa minorit\u00e9, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement assign\u00e9 et, qu\u2019a raison de cela, la poursuite prise contre lui aurait du \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e.\nLe demandeur appelle de ce jugement.\nLa question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir si cette exception \u00e0 la forme aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre maintenue.\nIl me semble d\u2019abord que la conduite de la proc\u00e9dure dans une cause doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e au tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. Or pas moins de cinq juges de la cour sup\u00e9rieure savoir; les honorables juges Davidson, Fortin, Martineau, Lafontaine et Charbonneau ont en \u00e0 rendre des jugements interlocutoires en cette cause o\u00f9 cette question d\u2019assignation se pr\u00e9sentait et tous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que les fins de la justice seraient absolument sauvegard\u00e9es non pas en renvoyant l\u2019action mais en lui faisant nommer un tuteur au defendeur lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait mineur ou en le for\u00e7ant de plaider au m\u00e9rite quand il fut devenu majeur. Ces jugements interlocutoires \u00e9taient d\u2019ailleurs conformes \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du juge Pagnuelo dans la cause de Gareau v. Denis[5].\nIl ne faut pas oublier que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 au nom du Souverain et qu\u2019en ob\u00e9issance \u00e0 ce bref il avait comparu et avait produit d\u2019abord une exception dilatoire pour demander cautionnement pour frais.\nMais quand par la suite il a, par son exception \u00e0 la forme, d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 sa minorit\u00e9 la cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui faire nommer un tuteur pour le repr\u00e9senter et l\u2019assister, et \u00e0 cette fin ordonna le convocation du conseil de famille. Ses parents, dans le but \u00e9vident d\u2019emp\u00eacher le bras de la justice de le frapper et de le punir comme il le m\u00e9ritait pour son d\u00e9lit si r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible, ont refus\u00e9 de se rendre aux ordres de la cour. Quand dix mois apr\u00e8s il devenait majeur, les proc\u00e9dures pour l\u2019assignation du conseil de famille furent discontinu\u00e9es et le d\u00e9fendeur re\u00e7ut ordre de plaider au m\u00e9rite.\nPour r\u00e9ussir sur son exception \u00e0 la forme l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y avait pr\u00e9judice. L\u2019art. 174 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile dit:\nLe d\u00e9fendeur peut invoquer par exception \u00e0 la forme, lorsqu\u2019ils lui causent un pr\u00e9judice, les moyens r\u00e9sultant: * * * 2. de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du demandeur ou du d\u00e9fendeur. O\u00f9 est le pr\u00e9judice pour le d\u00e9fendeur dans le cas actuel? Il a.pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de se d\u00e9fendre parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait mineur. La cour r\u00e9pond en lui disant nous allons vous donner un tuteur et quand il est devenu majeur elle lui intime d\u2019avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre lui-m\u00eame.\nL\u2019incapacit\u00e9 des mineurs est relative, elle n\u2019est pas absolue. Ils sont responsables de leurs d\u00e9lits, dit l\u2019art. 1053 du Code Civil.\nIls peuvent demander aux tribunaux la nomination d\u2019un tuteur et peuvent ester en justice dans certains cas (art. 250 et 323 C.C.). Ils peuvent \u00e9galement poursuivre pour leur salaire et pour les obligations r\u00e9sultant du contrat de louage de leurs services personnels. (Art. 304 C.C.).\nS\u2019ils sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s majeurs et peuvent engager leur responsabilit\u00e9 dans le cas d\u2019un d\u00e9lit qu\u2019ils auraient commis, ne pourraient-ils pas comme les mineurs commer\u00e7ants \u00eatre amen\u00e9s devant les tribunaux? La question peut \u00eatre pos\u00e9e mais il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de la d\u00e9cider dans cette cause-ci.\nL\u2019article 174 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure est de droit nouveau; c\u2019\u00e9tait autrefois l\u2019article 116 qui r\u00e9gissait la mati\u00e8re et il se lisait comme suit:\u2014\nSont invoqu\u00e9s par exception \u00e0 la forme les moyens r\u00e9sultant: 1. Des informalit\u00e9s dans l\u2019assignation; 2. Des informalit\u00e9s de la demande lorsqu\u2019elle est en contavention avec les dispositions contenues dans les articles 14, 19, 50, 52 et 53.\nIl faut donc maintenant, pour r\u00e9ussir sur une exception \u00e0 la forme, \u00e9prouver un pr\u00e9judice. C\u2019est l\u00e0 une question de fait qui doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion des juges de premi\u00e8re instance. Et si, comme dans le cas actuel, on a pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour faire dispara\u00eetre le pr\u00e9judice il n\u2019y a pas lieu pour les tribunaux d\u2019appel d\u2019intervenir.\nM\u00eame sous l\u2019empire de l\u2019ancien code l\u2019assignation d\u2019un mineur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas radicalement nulle. Aussi Pigeau vol. ler, p. 79 disait:\u2014\nDeux choses sont n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019on puisse intenter une action contre une personne; la premi\u00e8re qu\u2019elle soit soumise au droit d\u2019o\u00f9 proc\u00e8de l\u2019action; la seconde, qu\u2019elle ait le discernement n\u00e9cessaire pour se d\u00e9fendre.\nGuyot, vo. \u201cMineurs,\u201d p. 526, n\u2019est pas moins explicite.\nLes mineurs, (dit-il,) ne peuvent ester en jugement sans l\u2019assistance d\u2019un tuteur ou d\u2019un curateur; mais comment doit-on entendre cette maxime g\u00e9n\u00e9rale? La demande form\u00e9e par le mineur seul sera-t-elle nulle? Donnera-t-elle seulement lieu \u00e0 une exception de la part du d\u00e9fendeur, qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas tenu de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019assignation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le mineur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pourvu d\u2019un curateur? * * *\nIl semble donc qu\u2019une demande form\u00e9e en justice par un mineur au-dessus de l\u2019age de pubert\u00e9, ne devrait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle, sur le fondement qu\u2019elle auroit \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e par lui seul, sans \u00eatre assist\u00e9 de son curateur, parce quc cette nullit\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie qu\u2019en sa faveur. * *\nL\u2019incapacit\u00e9 des mineurs n\u2019est donc que relative \u00e0 eux, afin qu\u2019ils ne puissent se pr\u00e9judiciel.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque la nullit\u00e9 de son assignation. \u201cEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\u201d dit Solon, \u201cTrait\u00e9 des Nullit\u00e9s,\u201d pp. vi., vii.,\nles nullit\u00e9s sont odieuses. * * * Que signifie, en effet, dans le for int\u00e9rieur l\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 d\u2019une demande dans sa forme, si cette demande est juste? * * * elle doit \u00eatre repouss\u00e9e dans tous les cas o\u00f9 le l\u00e9gislateur ne s\u2019y oppose pas formellement.\nOr o\u00f9 trouvons-nous dans la loi que le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle une proc\u00e9dure comme celle que nous avons \u00e0 examiner?\nL\u2019article 304 du Code Civil dit bien que les actions appartenant au mineur sont port\u00e9es au nom d\u2019un tuteur et il donne des cas, cependant, o\u00f9 le mineur peut agir seul ou avec l\u2019autorisation du juge. Il n\u2019est nullement question dans le Code Civil des actions port\u00e9es contre le mineur. Le Code de Proc\u00e9dure dispose de ce point \u00e0 Particle 78 qui se lit comme suit:\nIl faut avoir le libre exercise de ses droits pour ester en justice, en demandant ou en d\u00e9fendant sous quelque forme que ce soit sauf dans le cas de dispositions sp\u00e9ciales.\nCeux qui n\u2019ont pas le libre exercise de leurs droits doivent \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, assist\u00e9s ou autoris\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re fix\u00e9e par les lois qui r\u00e8glent leur \u00e9tat ou leur capacit\u00e9 respective.\nLe Code n\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle part que l\u2019assignation d\u2019un mineur \u00e9tait nulle; il appartient donc au juge de d\u00e9cider. Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. \u201cMineur,\u201d par. 8, dit:\nIl semble donc qu\u2019une demande form\u00e9e en justice par un mineur au dessus de l\u2019age pubert\u00e9, ne devrait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle sur le fondement qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e par lui seul, sans \u00eatre assist\u00e9 de son curateur, parce que cette nullit\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie qu\u2019en sa faveur; le d\u00e9fendeur pourrait seulement proposer une exception dilatoire, et soutenir qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9fendre \u00e0 la demande form\u00e9e contre lui, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le mineur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pourvu d\u2019un curateur.\nSi le mineur peut poursuivre, comme le dit Merlin, et si son adversaire peut simplement demander qu\u2019il soit assist\u00e9 de son tuteur, il me semble que ce droit existe \u00e9galement lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une action prise contre le mineur. Dans les deux cas les actions ne doivent pas \u00e9tre renvoy\u00e9s mais le tribunal peut ordonner la mise-en-cause du tuteur qui doit l\u2019assister et le repr\u00e9senter.\nSolon, \u201cDe la Nullit\u00e9,\u201d No. 15, dit ceci:\nIl resuite de ce que nous venons de dire qu\u2019il d\u00e9pend le plus ordinairement du juge d\u2019accueillir ou de rejeter une nullit\u00e9 qui n\u2019est point prononc\u00e9 de plein droit; au lieu que si elle a ce caract\u00e8re, il ne peut se dispenser de la pronouncer, car elle repose sur des pr\u00e9somptions l\u00e9gales contre lesquelles aucune preuve n\u2019est admise.

Some time before the date fixed for payment of the first deferred instalment the purchasers made requisitions for the production for inspection of the vendor's evidence of title to the interests he was selling and the vendor refused to comply with the requisitions. The payment was not made on the appointed date and the vendor declared the agreement cancelled in consequence of such default. In suit for specific performance, brought by the purchases;\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (17 B.C. Rep. 88), that the vendor was bound, upon requisition made within a reasonable time by the purchasers, to produce for their inspection the documents under which he claimed the interests he was selling in the lands; until he had complied with such demand the purchasers were not obliged to make payment of deferred instalments of the price and, in the circumstances, their failure to make the payment in question was not an answer to the suit for specific performance.

Gives[19].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I do not entertain any doubt; this appeal should be dismissed with costs. There are two tracts of land in question, and the agreements are identical in terms, except as to the description of the property. There can be no doubt on the evidence that the appellant's offer to sell was accepted by Ryan, and that acceptance made the offer an agreement inter partes for the sale and purchase of the tracts of land described in it. The appellant from that moment had a right of action to recover the purchase price and his corresponding obligation to deliver the things sold arose then. It seems to me also clear, on the authorities to which we are referred, that it was incumbent on the vendor to disclose his title before demanding payment and the purchaser, therefore, was justified in his request that this title should be produced before paying the purchase price or any portion of it. If there was any failure on the part of the purchaser to pay within the stipulated delay, it was caused by the wrongful refusal of the appellant to show his title. I accept the reasons of the judges in the Court of Appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of land from appellant to respondents. The trial judge dismissed the plaintiffs' action on the ground that they had failed to make payment of the instalment of the purchase money on the day provided by the contract, that there was no default on the defendant vendor's part excusing such failure, and that time was expressly made the essence of the contract.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversed this judgment, holding, amongst other things, that there was default on the defendant's part in refusing to produce for inspection the agreements under which he held the land he agreed to sell, and that this default excused the plaintiffs from the payment of the instalment of the purchase money on the day named.\nThe question was raised as to the nature and character of the defendant's interest in the land which the agreement professed to sell. At any rate one thing is sure, and that is that the plaintiffs bought and the defendant sold all the title and interest which the latter held in the land. I am of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to inspection of such agreements or evidence of title as the defendant had before they could be called upon to pay the instalment in question.\nThis inspection, although asked for by the plaintiffs a reasonable time before the instalment fell due, was refused by defendant. The defendant thus put himself in default, and his refusal to produce his agreements under which he claimed title excused the plaintiffs from tendering payment of the instalment on the day named.\nThe defendant, appellant, relied upon Cushing v. Knight[20], lately decided in this court. That case was a very different one from the present and turned entirely upon the terms of the agreement there in question, the construction of which we held demanded the payment of the instalment of the purchase money contemporaneously with, if not before, the execution of the written contract by the vendors, and that, there having been default in such payment, the obligation on the vendor's part to sell and convey the lands had not been created.\nAssuming, therefore, that the contention of the appellant's counsel was correct and that Newberry only agreed to sell whatever rights he had in the lands under his agreement with those from whom he bought, I think he was bound to grant inspection of these agreements to the plaintiffs before requiring payment by them of the substantial instalment of the purchase money and, having refused to do so, put himself in default and was not in a position to take advantage of the non-payment by the purchasers of the instalment and to cancel the agreement for such default.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The contention that the contracts here in question were mere options to purchase is hardly tenable in face of the express terms of the receipts evidencing same.\nThe relation of vendor and purchaser was created between the parties thereto in each case by the payment of the deposit and the delivery of the receipt fully in accord with the conversation had between, and fully disclosing the purposes of the parties.\nThe vendor became absolutely bound to sell. The vendee might, in law, have set up against him the statute of frauds.\nIf the vendee had chosen to forfeit the money paid and so plead that statute, if sued on his contract, the vendor was helpless.\nIn a colloquial sense descriptive of that situation it may, therefore, be that the parties who referred to these contracts as options were not far astray.\nBut, in the strict, technical sense, in law, of what an option means, as illustrated in the cases appellant's counsel referred to, such is not the nature of either of the transactions in question; but that of a selling and buying of an interest in real estate. The nature of the interest so sold is here quite immaterial, for the title asked to be shown was that which the vendor had. The appellant saw fit to maintain silence, when applied to by those entitled to claim, on behalf of the respondents, his attention to a request to show title. He chose to ignore what common courtesy and a straightforward mode of dealing required at his hands.\nI think he must take the consequence of failure in these regards and abide by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in an action for specific performance of two agreements entered into between the appellant, Newberry, and the respondent, Ryan, relating to two separate parcels of land; one parcel being part of district lot 382, group 1, New Westminster District, and the other part of lot 463 in the same group. The first of these parcels is referred to as the \"Kendal\" and the second as the \"Wakefield\" lot. The two agreements were entered into on the same day. The terms of the first (relating to the \"Kendal\" parcel) were set out in a receipt for the first instalment of the purchase money given by Ryan to Newberry, which reads as follows:\u2014\nINTERIM RECEIPT.\nVancouver, B.C., Nov. 18th, 1910.\nReceived from W. B. Ryan the sum of $500 (five hundred dollars), being deposit on account of purchase of dist. lot 382, westerly 54 7\/100 Block, Coquitlam, subdivision * * * for the sum of $10,940, on the following terms; $500 cash, balance, $5,440 in January, 1911, balance will assign my agreement Kendall to myself. The deferred payments to bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum until paid. Net. No commission.\nTime is the essence of this agreement, and unless payments with interest are punctually made at the times appointed this sale shall be (at the option of the vendor), absolutely cancelled or rescinded, and all money paid on account hereof forfeited to the vendor as and for liquidated and ascertained damages. Cost of conveyance, $5, to be paid by the purchaser. This receipt is given by the undersigned as agent and subject to the owner's confirmation.\n$500.\nF. M. NEWBERRY\nAgent for owner.\nThe same amount ($500) was also paid as a first instalment of the purchase of the \"Wakefield\" parcel, and a receipt given identical in terms with that set out, except as to the price and the description of the property.\nThe instalments of purchase money which became respectively payable under these agreements on the 1st of January, 1911, were not paid. The appellant, thereupon, notified the respondents that because of their failure to make these payments he would treat the agreements as having come to an end; and, on the 13th of January, the respondents commenced their action. The position taken by the respondents was this. They said that it was the duty of the appellant to disclose his title to the property he had undertaken to sell, that the provision requiring payment of an instalment of the purchase money on the 1st of January, though absolute in form, must be read as subject to the implied condition that the vendor must first perform his obligation to satisfy the reasonable demands of the purchaser with respect to disclosure of title, and this the vendor had refused to do.\nThe first question is: What was the vendor's duty in respect of the disclosure of title?\nThe appellant contends that the agreements in question created options to purchase merely. The appellant, it is said, bound himself in each case, in consideration of the cash payment of $500, to an offer in terms of the receipt which was irrevocable up to the 1st of January, and which, in the meantime, could be ac- cepted in one way only; namely, by the payment of the sum stipulated in their receipt to be paid on that date. If this were truly the nature of the contract between the parties\u2014that the relation of vendor and purchaser was not to be constituted until the January payment should be made\u2014then no obligation to disclose his title would, of course, rest upon the appellant until that payment had been made.\nBut the language of the instrument manifestly cannot be reconciled with any such view of the character of the bargain; and the learned trial judge has explicitly found that\nthe agreements were that the defendant sold and Ryan bought the properties for a certain sum.\nThen it is said that the subject-matter of the purchases was not the fee simple in the parcels respectively described in the receipts, but certain agreements for the sale of these lands to the appellant. It was, in point of fact, understood by both parties at the time of the transactions in question that the appellant was not the holder of the fee in either parcel, but that, in respect of one of them, he had an agreement for the purchase of it with one Kendall, whose name appears in the receipt transcribed above, and, in respect of the other, with one Wakefield. In my view it is not necessary to decide, and I do not commit myself to any opinion upon the question whether or not the documents, read by the light of the facts in evidence, justify the conclusion that the subject\u2014matter of the transactions was not the land, but these agreements for the sale of the land. There is, certainly, not a little to be said for the view that the parties were buying and selling the fee simple in the land; but I will assume that the other view, which is the view of the learned trial judge, is the better one. What, then, in this view of these transactions, was the obligation of the vendor in respect of disclosing his title? If the law of British Columbia touching this matter is the law of England, then the rule to be applied seems to be stated by an eminent equity judge, (Fry J., in Brewer v. Broadword[21], at p. 107,) in this passage:\u2014\nThe first inquiry is, what is the obligation of a person who agrees to sell an agreement to lease? It may be shown either from the surrounding circumstances or by direct evidence that the intention of the agreement is to sell only such interest, if any, as the vendor may have: and, in such a case as that, the purchaser has no right to require a title to be shown by the vendor; but, in the absence of such evidence, the view which I take of such an agreement is that it requires the vendor to show that he has a title to a valid agreement. The law of England in the case of a sale of land in fee simple requires the vendor to show that he has the fee simple of the land. In the case of a sale of a lease, it requires the vendor to show that he has a valid title to the lease or to the term granted by the lease. Likewise, in the case of an agreement to lease, I hold that the vendor is bound to show that there is a subsisting valid agreement to lease.\nAssuming that these agreements were the subject-matter of the respondent's purchase, the respondents were then entitled to have valid and subsisting agreements for the sale of these parcels by the vendors vested in them, on the 1st of January, on payment of the stipulated sums. And they were entitled to something more; there were entitled, in each case, to have an agreement vested in them under which the sums remaining at that date to be paid to the original vendor should not exceed the residue of the purchase money stipulated for in the agreement between the appellant and Ryan after the payment to the appellant of the January instalment. It was, consequently, their right to have it shown, within a reasonable time before the 1st of January, that the appellant was in a position to discharge his obligation in that respect. As I will presently explain more fully, I think the evidence shows that the appellant refused to make any disclosure whatever; but another question of law must first be disposed of. The learned trial judge took the view that the law of England, (with regard to this matter of the obligation of the vendor of land under an open contract to disclose his title) is not, in its entirety, the law of British Columbia, and that there was, in this case, no duty on the part of the vendor to furnish the information demanded by the purchaser.\nI quite agree with the learned trial judge to this extent,\u2014 that the establishment of a statutory system of title to land, (such as prevails, for example, in the Province of Saskatchewan,) by which the title is not completely constituted by documents and transactions inter partes, but rests upon registration by a public officer, may have the effect of rendering obsolete some of the specific rules governing the reciprocal rights of vendor and purchaser touching the matter in hand. Some of these rules have had their origin in the practice of conveyancers in England and others are based upon considerations of convenience or necessity which may cease to apply when the system of titles has been fundamentally changed. Moreover, the rule entitling the purchaser to demand a solicitor's abstract is a rule of comparatively modern origin, (Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers, 9 ed., p. 447,) and I can conceive circumstances, (having no special relation to the system of land titles,) in which an over-punctilious deference to the letter of the rule as it would, perhaps, be applied in England would, in British Columbia, have consequences very widely at variance with the expectations of the parties. But, on the other hand, the rule that the vendor under a contract for the sale of an interest in land is under an obligation to give a title to that which he is selling, in the absence of express or implied stipulation, (whether it be an obligation resting upon an implied term of the contract, as Baron Parke and Lord St. Leonards seem to think, or an obligation imposed ab extra, so to speak, by the law itself,) is a rule which nobody has ever doubted was introduced into British Columbia with the general body of the law of England; and it has, without any specific enactment on the subject, always been regarded as having been introduced in the same connection into the other provinces in which the body of the law has been derived from the same source. If it is the duty of the vendor to give a title, it would seem to follow, in the absence of special circumstances, (since the vendor may be supposed to know his title,) that the vendor ought to disclose the particulars of the title he proposes to transfer unless he stipulates to the contrary. If the circumstances of the contract are such as to exclude the possibility of the parties to such a contract having contemplated the delivery of a solicitor's abstract, then, in such a case, there could be no difficulty in implying a stipulation of that character. I can quite understand, for example, that a vendor holding land under a certificate of indefeasible title, (and proffering his certificate,) might properly regard a demand for a solicitor's abstract as a purely vexatious demand. But, in the ordinary case of the sale of land held under a registered title, there being nothing in the circumstances of a special character, I do not see why the rule should not take effect. A cer- tificate of title under the \"British Columbia Land Registry Act,\" not being a certificate of indefeasible title, is only prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the title of the holder and the documentary evidence upon which the certificate rests is not necessarily disclosed by the register. The view expressed by the learned judge has never, I think, been accepted in British Columbia. The difficulty of accepting that view is enhanced in the case where, as here, the vendor's interest is in whole or in part unregistered.\nThis brings us to the question of fact.\nThe Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal says:\u2014\nThe two agreements in question in this action, dated 18th November, 1910, are for the sale by the defendant to one Ryan, the plaintiff's assignor, of two parcels of land. They are practically identical in terms, the one with respect to one parcel and the other to the other. One parcel may be conveniently designated the \"Wakefield\" lot, and the other the \"Kendall\" lot. The defendant, prior to said 18th November, agreed with Kendall to purchase his lot on deferred payments. He had paid a deposit of $50 and received a receipt therefor. Defendant and one Clark had bought the Wakefield lot on similar terms, but had a formal agreement of purchase which was registered, at all events, before the commencement of this action. It also appears that the defendant had an assignment of Clark's interest, which was not registered. These agreements were not shown to Ryan, with the exception of the receipt for $50. On the 19th of November, defendant procured a formal agreement from Kendall, which was not shown to Ryan. * * *\nEarly in December, plaintiffs requested defendant to show them the agreements under which he held the property and, I think, the inference from the evidence is irresistible that they were refused such inspection. Failing to get such inspection, the plaintiffs, on 27th December, formally notified the defendant that they intended to proceed with the purchase, and demanded a solicitor's abstract of title. This demand was ignored.\nI think the evidence fully supports this; and I entirely agree with it.\nThere was, therefore, not only a disregard of the request for a solicitor's abstract, but a refusal to permit inspection of the documents evidencing the agree- ments which the appellant was professing to sell. Such inspection was necessary to enable the respondents to ascertain whether those agreements were of such a character and so vested in the appellant that the appellant was entitled to assign them and whether the conditions on which the appellant's rights must rest had been observed; and it would have been folly for them to proceed with the payment of the purchase money without first having obtained it.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014On the true construction of the receipts which evidence the transactions here under consideration, I have no doubt that the agreements between the appellant and the respondent Ryan were for the sale and purchase of the lands in question, or at least of the appellants' interest in them. Punctuality in payment was made of the essence of the bargains and provision was made, in the nature of a condition subsequent, for rescission by the vendor upon default of prompt payment. Payment on an instalment due on the first of January was not made on that day. The vendor relies upon this as a default which entitled him to exercise his option to cancel and rescind. The purchasers answer that the vendor had already refused a legitimate demand for production of his title,\u2014 namely, in the case of one parcel, the agreement from the registered owner under which he held, and, in the case of the other, the transfer of the interest of his co-purchaser from the registered owner,\u2014and that the failure to make the January payment was, therefore, not a default entitling the vendor to rescind. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal finds that early in December, plaintiffs requested defendant to show them the agreements under which he held the property, and I think the inference from the evidence is irresistible that they were refused such inspection. Failing to get such inspection, the plaintiffs, on the 27th of December, formally notified the defendant that they intended to proceed with the purchase and demanded a solicitor's abstract of title. This demand was ignored and the plaintiffs did not make the January payments. When they took the matter up with the defendant, within two or three days afterwards, the defendant in effect declared the agreements cancelled for non-payment on the first of January.\nThe letter of the 27th of December has been criticized on the ground that it is open to the construction that it calls upon the vendor to furnish an abstract of the titles of the registered owners of the land, and not merely an abstract of his own title from such owners. The language is\nin the meantime you will please furnish Whiteside and Edmonds at once with an abstract of your title.\nFor the respondents it is contended that the purpose of this letter was merely to put in writing the demand already made verbally for the production of the agreements from the registered owners under which the vendor claimed and that an abstract of those agreements only was called for. Whatever may be the proper construction of the letter, and whether the respondents were or were not entitled to an abstract of the titles of the registered owners, they were, at all events, in my opinion, entitled to production and inspection of the documents under which their vendor claimed the interests in the lands of which he was disposing. The evidence abundantly justifies the holding of the learned Chief Justice that production of these documents had been refused and has convinced me of the accuracy of the inference drawn by Mr. Justice Irving that\nthe defendant was then (on the 3rd of January), and had been at the time when he was requested to show title endeavouring to bring about a deadlock with a view to preventing this contract being carried out.\nThis case is entirely distinguishable from the case of Cushing v. Knight[22], much relied upon by the appellant. We have here a contract of sale with a provision in the nature of a condition subsequent for defeasance in the event of non-payment at the stipulated times; whereas, in Cushing v. Knight[23] it was held that, on the true construction of the contract there in question, the relationship of vendor and purchaser, with its incidental rights, would not come into existence until actual payment of the money in respect of which there had been default. The refusal of the appellant to produce the agreements evidencing the interests which he was selling I think put him in default and prevents him from claiming that, while such default continued, the respondents were under obligation to make further payments. There was, in my opinion, therefore, no default on their part which entitled the vendor to rescind, and the judgment for specific performance against him was right and should be maintained.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed, and I concur with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gwillim, Crisp & Mackay.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bodwell & Lawson.\n[1] 17 B.C.

C.R. 53), Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that sawn boards or planks which have been \u201cdressed on one side only\u201d by a machine which not only dresses them on one side but, at the time of such operation, reduces them to uniform widths, by means of another sawing process which has the effect of \u201csizing\u201d the lumber, have not thereby been subjected to such \u201cfurther manufacture\u201d as would bring them within the exception from free entry under item 504.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the appellants\u2019 claim with costs.\nIn April, 1912, at the Customs Port of Entry of the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba, the appellants presented a free entry for a carload of fir lumber described as \u201cbeing lumber of wood, sawn and dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured.\u201d The lumber in question consisted of planks and boards which had been sawn in the mill by circular or gang saws and, afterwards, planed or \u201cdressed\u201d on one side in a planing-mill which was fitted with machinery that not only dressed one side of the plank or board but, during that operation, performed also the function of \u201csizing\u201d the lumber, reducing the planks and boards to uniform widths by means of another saw, called a \u201cside-head,\u201d attached to the planer. The Collector of Customs, at Winnipeg, refused to pass the free entry and levied duty on the lumber at the rate of 25 per cent. ad valorem under item 506 of the \u201cCustoms Tariff, 1907.\u201d The appellants claimed to have a rebate of the duty so collected and their claim was referred, under section 38 of chapter 140, of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, (\u201cThe Exchequer Court Act,\u201d) by the Minister of Customs, to the Exchequer Court of Canada for adjudication thereon.\nIn the Exchequer Court, Mr. Justice Cassels decided that the lumber in question, after having been first sawn, went through another process of manufacture and, therefore, was not entitled to free admission on importation into Canada under tariff item 504. The judgment appealed from ordered that the claimants should recover nothing and that they should pay the costs.\nOn the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the British Columbia Lumber and Shingle Manufacturers, Limited, were, by order of a judge, permitted to intervene, as respondents, with liberty to file a factum and to be represented and heard by counsel, upon the argument of the appeal, under the provisions of Rule 60 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nUpon the proper interpretation of item 504 of the tariff the lumber in question should have been admitted free. It consists of planks sawn on three sides or surfaces and dressed on one surface, and fits the exact language of the item in that respect. There is no other or further manufacture appearing on the planks than that of sawing on three sides and dressing on one side. If, by ingeniously constructed machinery, a plank, after it is taken from the sawmill, may be planed on one side and sawed to a uniform width on the same machinery, this does not alter the character of the lumber as planks or boards sawn on three sides and planed on one side. When the planks came for examination to the Customs Officer they were in fact planks of wood sawn and dressed on one side; the fair and reasonable interpretation of tariff item 504 is that planks, boards and lumber not further manufactured than sawn on three sides and dressed on one side are free.\nThe judge of the Exchequer Court has endeavoured to distinguish between the first sawing in the mill and some subsequent sawing upon the plank which may be done by another saw or at another time. It is quite possible that planks in their rough state, as taken from the mill, would come under item 503, but even under that section, assuming that no other manufacture could be applied to it than sawing or splitting, there is nothing which would prohibit a further sawing or splitting than the original first sawing or splitting of the wood, nor can it be said that under item 504 the sawing must be that of the first or original sawing of the plank in the mill. The word \u201csawn\u201d simply means that the plank has been made by the operation of a saw, as opposed to the operation of some other method of producing a plank, and if the plank or board is sawn on three sides when it is produced to the collector for entry it is impossible and absurd to say that because a plank has been reduced by sawing to a uniform width it is anything more than, or exhibits any difference from, a plank or board not further manufactured than sawn on three sides and dressed on one.\nThe rule to be applied in the application of a tariff item is that the form of the material at the time of importation into Canada should form the discriminating test for duty. To depart from this rule would necessarily lead to confusion and want of uniformity in the application of the tariff. Compare The Queen v. The J. C. Ayer Co.[2]; Magann v. The Queen[3]. See also the \u201cCustoms Act,\u201d R.S.C. 1906, ch. 48, sec. 2, sub-sec. 2; Cox v. Rabbits[4]; Partington v. Attorney-General[5], and Elmes, Laws of Customs, p. 22, sec. 49.\nThe imposing of duty on this lumber was contrary to the practice which had prevailed for many years in regard to the lumber of the kind in question. Ever since the enactment of the \u201cCustoms Tariff, 1894,\u201d lumber dressed on one side only and sawn on three sides has been admitted free of duty. The tariff provisions and changes in this class of lumber, since 1894, have been as follows:\u2014Customs Tariff, 1894\u2014free list\u2014item 739; \u201cSawed boards, planks, deals, and other lumber undressed or dressed on one side only, free.\u201d This was repealed by \u201cCustoms Tariff, 1897,\u201d and the item relating to the number corresponding to this, (item 611) was \u201cSawn or split boards, planks, deals and other lumber when not further manufactured than dressed on one side only, or creosoted, vulcanized or treated by any preserving process, free.\u201d This again was repealed by \u201cCustoms Tariff, 1907,\u201d and the item 504 now in question was substituted.\nIt will thus be seen that lumber dressed on one side only and sawn on three sides has long been the subject of free admission; and where the executive department of the Government having charge of the matter has continued, unbroken, a certain interpretation of a statute the courts will confirm that interpretation as being the proper construction to be placed upon the statute. In United States v. The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co.[6], the rule was there laid down by Mr. Justice Brown; a similar opinion was given by Mr. Richard Olney, Attorney-General, in 1894, (20, Opinions of. Attys.-Gen., p. 719, Op. 246), and in Merritt v. Cameron[7], and Robertson v. Downing[8].\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the respondent. The court has granted leave to the British Columbia Lumber and Shingle Manufacturers, Limited, to intervene and, as they are now represented by counsel, who will support the judgment of the Exchequer Court, it has become unnecessary on the appeal in this test case for the Crown to do more than to submit the question in controversy, as it is only desired to administer the law in accordance with the construction the court may place upon the tariff item in dispute.\nLafleur E.C. for the intervenants. The planer by means of which the dressing was done, contained additional machinery which sized the lumber, reducing it to a uniform width. This uniformity in width could not be obtained by means of the saws in the saw-mill, for it is impossible to get machinery running rigidly enough or regularly enough to produce these results with a saw-mill equipment. The machinery of a sawmill is operated rapidly and the devices for carrying the logs to the saw are such that it is impossible to get the machinery to run without some lateral movement, and it is, consequently, impossible to get a number of pieces of uniform width in the edgers. It was conceded, at the hearing, by counsel for the appellants that there is no such thing as a saw-mill with a \u201csizing\u201d equipment. The secondary machinery, which in this case was added to the planer, and which forms no necessary part of the planing or dressing equipment, consisted in a guide or straight-edge with rollers and spring guides, or some equivalent device, to hold the plank up to the straight-edge and to carry it through straight to a small saw. By means of this machinery the planks which had been sawn in the mill and afterwards dressed on one side, were equalized in width, and it is this further process which was contended by the Crown and by the intervenants to be a \u201cfurther manufacture\u201d within the meaning of item 504 of the tariff. It is contended that, because this additional operation was done by means of a saw, the article is not dutiable upon the proper construction of item 504. It is proved that it would have been cheaper to do both the dressing and the edging by means of a planer, that is, by means of cutting instruments, than to do the dressing by a cutting instrument and the sizing by the saw attachment and, consequently, as one of the witnesses puts it, the saw attachment increases the cost and no one does it except for the purpose of evading the tariff.\nThe judge in the Exchequer Court finds as a fact that the planks, after being sawn and dressed on one side, went through a further process of manufacture. No other finding could have been made upon the evidence, If the contention be admitted that item 504 should be construed so that lumber may be sawn, split or cut any number of times, so as to produce a fully manufactured article, provided it is dressed on one side only, that would permit of practically exhausting every process to which lumber may be subjected for manufacturing purposes and nothing would remain which could fall within the operation of item 506, \u201cmanufactures of wood not otherwise provided for.\u201d The words \u201csawn, split, or cut,\u201d in item 504, obviously refer to the sawing, splitting or cutting which produces the plank or board, and not to any subsequent sawing, splitting or cutting which might completely alter the form and utility of the article. That the words \u201csawn, split or cut\u201d are intended to refer to the original sawing, splitting or cutting, by means of which the plank or board is produced, is very manifest from a comparison of item 504 with item 503, which reads as follows: \u201cPlanks, boards, clap-boards, laths, plain pickets and other timber or lumber of wood, not further manufactured than sawn or split, whether creosoted, vulcanized, or treated by any other preserving process, or not: Free.\u201d The words \u201csawn or split\u201d in item 503 evidently refer to the sawing or splitting by means of which the planks, boards, clap-boards, laths and pickets are manufactured. As applied to planks, it means the rough planks as they leave the saw, and no further manufacture or treatment is permitted except the creosoting, vulcanizing or preserving by some other process. Then item 504 goes a step further and allows the plank, whether sawn, split or cut, to be dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured. It is evident that the words \u201csawn, split or cut\u201d in item 504 are adjectival terms qualifying the substantives \u201cplanks, boards or other lumber.\u201d The same idea might have been appropriately expressed with regard to a plank by saying that a sawn plank could be dressed on one side, but not further manufactured, and this excludes the idea that, after having produced a plank by sawing and then dressed it on one side, the manufacturer is at liberty to apply other sawing machinery to that plank for the purpose of modifying it and further fitting it for the market. The words \u201cnot further manufactured,\u201d in item 504, cannot mean not further manufactured simply by way of dressing, but must also exclude further manufacture by way of sawing, splitting or cutting. To confine the expression to further manufacturing by way of dressing would be redundant, for the language already clearly indicates that the dressing must be on one side only. Then, as the learned judge of the Exchequer Court shews, if one takes the different steps which occurred in this very case in their chronological order, one is forced to the conclusion that the \u201csizing,\u201d which was done last of all and by special machinery, must be considered as a process of further manufacture upon a plank which has already been dressed on one side only.\nThe decision in Magann v. The Queen[9], has no application because, in that case, the item of the tariff provided that the following articles should be admitted into Canada free of duty: \u201cLumber and timber, planks and boards, sawn, or box-wood, cherry, walnut, chestnut, gumwood, mahogany, pitch-pine, rosewood, sandal-wood, Spanish-cedar, oak, hickory, and white wood, not shaped, planed, or otherwise manufactured, and saw-dust of the same, and hickory lumber, sawn to shape for spokes of wheels but not further manufactured.\u201d The plaintiff had entered into a contract to supply white-oak planks and boards of specified thicknesses, widths and lengths, and arranged with mill-men in Michigan to saw these planks and boards from the log, and they were in fact sawn to such thicknesses, widths and lengths as to admit of their being used in the construction of cars and railway trucks without a waste of material. It was held, upon these facts, that the planks and boards in the form in which they were imported were not shaped within the meaning of the statute, and were not dutiable. The sawing in that case was done at the saw-mill and no further manufacturing process took place after the lumber left the saw-mill. In the present case, after everything had been done that could be done in the saw-mill to convert the wood into planks and after the dressing on one side permitted by the tariff had also been performed, the planks were then subjected to the operation of special and different machinery for the purpose of producing a result which could not have been obtained by any means at the disposal of the sawmillman.\nW. D. Hogg K.C. and R. C. Smith K.C. for the appellants.\nTravers Lewis K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court given on a reference by the Minister of Customs, arising out of these facts:\nA carload of fir lumber was entered at the Custom House at Winnipeg, on the 2nd of April last (1912), by the appellants, on the value of which duty at the rate of 25 per cent. was collected. The question referred is: Was that lumber subject to the duty levied upon it? The judge of the Exchequer Court held that it was.\nThe value of the lumber is admitted at $308, and the amount of duty paid at $77. The several pieces of planks, produced at the trial and here, were taken from the carload in dispute, and are accepted as fair samples of the kind and quality of lumber which is the object of this reference. The answer to the question must largely depend upon the meaning and effect to be given to the word \u201csawn\u201d in item 504 of schedule \u201cA\u201d of the Customs Tariff of 1907. That item reads as follows:\u2014\nPlanks, boards and other lumber of wood, sawn, split or cut, and dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured. Free.\nOn the evidence it appears that the lumber in question was cut, from the original log, in the mill where it was sawn on four sides; it was then removed to the planing mill and there dressed on one side, and again sawn on another side. So that, on one side, the lumber was sawn twice,\u2014once in the saw-mill and a second time in the planing-mill\u2014and the whole question is: Does that second sawing in the planing-mill constitute a \u201cfurther manufacture\u201d within the meaning of the item of the Customs Tariff above quoted?\nSpeaking of the way in which the revenue laws are to be interpreted, Sir William Ritchie said, in The Queen v. The J. C. Ayer Company[10], at pages 270 and 271:\u2014\nIn the first place let us see how the revenue laws are to be interpreted. There is a general provision in the \u201cCustoms Act,\u201d 1883, that all the terms of that Act, or of any Customs law, shall receive such fair and liberal construction and interpretation as will best insure the protection of the revenue and the attainment of the purpose for which that Act, or such law, was made, according to its true meaning, intent and spirit. But I do not understand from this that laws imposing duties are to be construed beyond the natural import of their language, or that duties or taxes are to be imposed upon terms of vague or doubtful interpretation.\nAnd he adds later, quoting Lord Cairns in Coco v. Rabbits[11], and Partington v. The Attorney-General[12]:\nBut it is clear that the intention of the legislature, in the imposition of duties, must be clearly expressed and, in cases of doubtful interpretation, the construction should be in favour of the importer.\nTo this I would add what Lord Taunton said, when speaking of the \u201cStamp Duty\u201d:\nThe stamp law is positivi juris. It imports nothing of principle or reason, but depends entirely upon the language of the legislature.\nTaken literally and giving to each word used its natural meaning the section we are asked to construe says that planks of lumber \u201csawn\u201d on three sides and dressed on the fourth side, (not further manufactured) should be admitted free of duty. The planks in question come, if we are to judge from their physical appearance, in all respects within that description. It is, however, argued on behalf of the Crown that, notwithstanding their outward aspect, the planks having been sawn a second time, with a special saw in the planing-mill, at the same time as they were dressed for the special purpose of what is called \u201csizing,\u201d this second sawing for that purpose constitutes a \u201cfurther manufacture\u201d within the meaning of those words in item 504, and takes the lumber out of the operation of that item. I understand that \u201csizing\u201d is admitted, by both sides, to be a process by which the lumber is reduced to a uniform width and thickness.\nI cannot agree that the second sawing is, in the circumstances, a further manufacture. Whatever may be the object or purpose of those who subject the plank to the process of a second sawing in the planing-mill, the effect is to produce a piece of plank sawn on three sides. If this second sawing had been done in the sawmill, when the log was originally sliced into lumber, for the same purpose, viz., \u201csizing\u201d\u2014assuming that I have given to this word its accepted meaning,\u2014would, or could any question of further manufacture arise? I fail to understand how the second sawing, if done in the planing-mill, makes a difference; the result of that operation, in whichever mill executed, is the same in so far as the outward physical appearance of the plank produced is concerned. Perhaps my meaning may be more clearly expressed in these words: The second sawing process to which the plank is subjected is not the less a sawing because it is done in a planing-mill to which the plank was admittedly properly taken for the purpose of being dressed. And, when put through that process, the only way in which the plank can be accurately described is to call it a plank sawn on three sides and dressed on a fourth. The colloquial as well as the dictionary meaning of the verb \u201cto saw\u201d is \u201cto cut with a saw\u201d. One can, of course, imagine, as argued by the respondent, a variety of ways in which, by the aid of a saw, the process of manufacture might be very considerably advanced, but Ave are now called upon to ascertain the intention of Parliament from the words used in this item, as applied to the facts in this case, and we are not concerned with interesting speculations as to the possibility of that intention being defeated by ingenious devices. \u201cWords, like certain insects, take their colour from their surroundings.\u201d Here the word \u201csawn\u201d is used in the adjectival sense and must be read in connection with the noun \u201cplank\u201d of which it expresses a quality. The dictionary meaning of the word \u201cplank\u201d is \u201ca broad piece of sawn lumber\u201d, and, in familiar speech, a plank may fairly be said to be a more or less regularly shaped oblong board; and a \u201csawn plank\u201d is a board reduced to that shape by the aid of a saw. A piece of ornamented wood produced by a fret-saw may be a piece of furniture or wood for decorative purposes, but it would not be described as a \u201cplank\u201d.\nIn conclusion, I am of opinion that the particular carload of lumber with which we are concerned, when presented for entry to the Customs official, was made up of \u201cplanks\u201d which came, in so far as he could gather from their outward form and appearance, within the words of description contained in the section of the tariff item 504; and it was no part of his duty to inquire into the purposes or uses to which those planks might subsequently be applied.\nIf I had any doubt, which I have not, I would adopt the principle of construction laid down by Elmes, in his Law of Customs, page 26, section 60. In cases of serious ambiguity in the language of an Act, or in cases of doubtful classification of articles, the construction should be in favour of the importer, for duties and taxes are never imposed on the citizen upon vague or doubtful interpretation.\nThe appeal is maintained with the usual recommendation as to costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The questions which are involved in this appeal must be determined by the interpretation and construction of item No. 504 of the tariff, which reads as follows:\u2014\nPlanks, boards and other lumber of wood, sawn, split or cut, and dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured.\nThe literal meaning of these words in their plain grammatical and ordinary sense, which is said to be the golden rule of interpretation, is to my mind just what appellants contend for; that is, planks sawn on three sides and dressed on one side. And, when we go beyond such literal meaning, we depart from the long established mode of reading a taxing or revenue Act.\nThe interpretation clause of the \u201cCustoms Act,\u201d subdivision 2 of section 2, does not seem to me to carry us any further.\nIf I could read the Act as the learned trial judge does when, in the passage quoted from his judgment in the respondent\u2019s factum, he says\nI think the whole scope of the statute and the tariff is to prevent completely manufactured articles being entered free of duty,\nthen I might see my way to a different reading, first of the said interpretation clause, and next, as a consequence thereof, of the above quoted item of the tariff.\nWith the greatest respect for the learned judge, I submit that lumber in any shape is clearly, for the greater part of its uses, a completely manufactured article and yet is admitted free. Whether quite as large as ninety per cent. of the whole importation of lumber, as one witness states, is so or not I cannot say, but obviously a very large percentage thereof goes into consumption without being dressed on one side. This latter work preparatory to use of the lumber which may be so treated widens the field wherein it can be used as completely manufactured.\nEvidence put forward by the Crown shews that usually saw-mills do not contain the machinery that would enable the sawing to be done so evenly as to produce as straight an edge as appears in one of the edges of each of the pieces put in evidence as exhibits herein. Indeed, some of the witnesses go very far and seem to state no saw-mill does, but that is, as some of these witnesses point out, an obvious error as a statement of what no witness can be likely to know.\nCounsel for the intervenants put the matter fairly that, even if a saw-mill did contain such machinery and appliances as would enable this to be done, then, according to the claim made herein by the Crown, it must be held in using same to be engaged in a process of manufacture within the meaning of the words \u201cbut not further manufactured\u201d.\nThat view presents the case and the claim in its fairest light. If that contention is right, then and not otherwise can the claim of the Crown be made good.\nLet us test that. How many times has a piece of timber to be turned round and set and then to be passed through by a saw before it is fit to fill the commercial uses and demands for lumber of various lengths and dimensions and yet be clearly duty free?\nThe first cutting admittedly is to be free of duty. But that will not fit for the market all that which is just as clearly duty free as that dropped from a first cut. Indeed, a second or even third cutting of the same saw may be involved in the production of what admittedly is duty free. Nay, more, much of it, but not of necessity all, has to go to the edger and be trimmed by that saw. It is admitted an edger can properly be used without rendering the produce thereof dutiable. But why? Surely it is only to produce out of boards that sort of lumber the other saw would not produce, yet by a wasteful process could have produced, and to make by a sawing process a more completely manufactured article.\nTwo different kinds of saws can thus, it is admitted, be used in succession on the same material in a variety of ways to put it through a process of completely manufacturing it and yet leave it free of duty. Why permit two saws to be thus used when planks could be turned out with one? Better work, greater economy, cheaper production are the objects sought by the use of two saws. And, if a third can produce in a higher degree such results, or like thereto, wherein lies the objection? So far as I can see the objection might as well be made to the use of the edger and supported by the like train of reasoning as to a third saw. And, if you say, \u201cOh! an edger has been used for ever so long\u201d, I answer, \u201cthere is no satisfactory evidence that the use of the third saw was not in actual operation long before this tariff item was framed, and, possibly, it was so framed to meet such possibilities of production.\u201d\nBut again, if the necessary clamps, clutches, levers and other devices that would hold the board first sawn were used to hold it in place to apply an improved edging saw to the work, then that sawing cannot be permitted if this claim of the Crown is well founded. Yet, in my humble judgment, such a thing is physically possible and, according to the reasoning of the Crown, a legitimate proceeding to produce what item No. 504 admits free of duty.\nIt has often been said that a protective tariff tends to lessen the mechanical ingenuity likely to be applied to cheapen production, but I never heard imputed to it that such mechanical ingenuity as it might accidentally develop cheapening production was not only to be despised and set aside but also, when discovered, declared unlawful.\nIf the saw-mill can conceivably be equipped in the way I suggest to produce the sawing desired with two saws, then I hardly think it was intended to prevent the use of three or more saws. If that was the purpose of this legislation, then it can easily be enacted that only one saw can be used in the process of manufacture, or if two, then only two, and thus make the item clear.\nIf the third sawing is, as I think, permissible, then the accidental circumstance of its taking place under the same roof or on the same table as the permissible dressing is of no consequence.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nThe order made on the consent of all parties to the record permitting the intervention of third parties but reserving for the full court the question of its validity or propriety I do not think should be treated as a precedent to be followed hereafter under our rule No. 60.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The question is whether a certain carload of lumber imported by the appellants from the United States is liable to Customs duty. This lumber admittedly falls within the item of the Customs Tariff, (the Schedule to the \u201cCustoms Act\u201d of 1907), numbered 506 unless it is embraced within the exemption created by the item numbered 504. For convenience I set out in full these two items as well as the items numbered respectively 503 and 505 which are in pari materia.\n503. Planks, boards, clap-boards, laths, plain pickets and other timber or lumber of wood, not further manufactured than sawn or split, whether creosoted, vulcanized, or treated by any other preserving process, or not. * * * Free.\n504. Planks, boards and other lumber of wood, sawn, split or cut, and dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured. Free.\n505. Sawn boards, planks and deals planed or dressed on one side or both sides, when the edges thereof are jointed or tongued and grooved. * * * 25 per cent.\n506. Manufactures of wood, n.o.p. * * * 25 per cent.\nThe appellants\u2019 contention is that the lumber in question consisted of \u201cplanks\u201d and \u201cboards sawn * * * * and dressed on one side only but not further manufactured\u201d. This is disputed on behalf of the Crown.\nThe facts bearing on the question are really not in dispute. The shipment with which we are concerned comprised several parcels of what is known in the lumber trade as \u201csized lumber\u201d suitable for use in the construction of buildings as \u201cjoisting\u201d and \u201cstudding.\u201d To fit them for this purpose it is essential that the pieces in any given parcel should be of uniform width and it was admitted at the trial that the required uniformity of width cannot be secured by any machinery which is part of the ordinary equipment of a saw-mill. It was further admitted that machinery adapted to secure that uniformity\u2014machinery, that is to say, for performing the operation of \u201csizing\u201d\u2014is never found in a saw-mill.\nThe cutting instrument commonly used in \u201csizing\u201d is a knife. The instrument used in this case was a saw. The ingenuity at the command of the persons engaged in manufacturing lumber for export from the United States into Canada has produced a machine which not only does the office of dressing on one side by planing but performs also the function of \u201csizing\u201d. As in this latter process the cutting is done by saws alone it was supposed that the lumber subjected to it would fall within the category of \u201cplanks sawn\u201d and \u201cdressed on one side only\u201d and thus, by way of the exemption provided for in item 504, would escape the incidence of the duty imposed by item 506. This method of reducing a parcel of lumber to a uniform width is in itself more expensive than the methods usually employed; but the additional expense so incurred would be more than offset by the advantage of free admission to the Canadian market.\nIn these circumstances, have the appellants established the proposition upon which they base their appeal that this carload of lumber falls within the description \u201cplanks, boards, * * * sawn, split or cut * * * and dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured\u201d? I think they have not. Each one of the parcels in question comprises, it is true, only pieces of lumber which answer the description \u201cplanks or boards * * * sawn * * * and dressed on one side only\u201d, but it cannot, I think, be affirmed of these pieces of lumber that they are \u201cnot further manufactured\u201d. After having been completely manufactured as \u201cplanks\u201d or \u201cboards\u201d they have been subjected to a further process\u2014a process which forms no part of the procedure by which \u201cplanks\u201d and \u201cboards\u201d as such are produced from timber and which is a special process that is designed to fit the \u201cplanks\u201d and \u201cboards\u201d so produced for certain special purposes; and did, in fact, fit them for those purposes. It is true that this special process consisted in part in applying a saw to each of these pieces. But that was not the whole of the process; in addition to that there was manipulation by special devices which reduced the pieces comprised in any parcel to the uniformity of dimensions which was necessary to make them suitable and did, in fact, make them suitable for use as \u201cjoisting\u201d and \u201cstudding\u201d and by which they were converted into a commercial commodity having, in the lumber trade, a distinctive designation. Before they were subjected to this process they were \u201csawn\u201d boards and planks simply; but I see no escape from the conclusion that by the operation of \u201csizing\u201d they were \u201cfurther manufactured\u201d and, consequently, were excluded from the category of articles falling within the exception which the appellants invoke.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The simple question before us is whether sawn planks and boards which, in addition to being dressed on one side, have also been \u201csized\u201d by a sawing process are \u201cfurther manufactured\u201d so as to exclude them from the exemption allowed by item No. 504 of the Canadian Customs Tariff of 1907. It was conceded at bar that if the lumber in question had been \u201csized,\u201d as was formerly the custom, by the use of a knife or plane that process would have been such a further manufacture. The planks or boards would then be sawn and cut\u2014not sawn or cut. The evidence is conclusive that the sizing now accomplished by the use of fine saws run comparatively slowly and attached to the planing machinery used to dress the planks or boards on one side is equally effective and answers the same purpose as that formerly done by the use of the knife or plane\u2014the \u201cside-head\u201d of the planing machine. In both cases it is essential to the operation that the board or plank which is to be sized should be held firmly in place by such devices as spring-guides, a straight-edge and rollers. A rigidity unattainable in ordinary saw-mill machinery is required. The board or plank produced by the saw-mill is only approximately uniform in width throughout its own length and with the other boards or planks with which it is classed as assorted dimension lumber. The exact uniformity necessary for some purposes can be obtained only by subjecting these planks or boards to the further process of \u201csizing\u201d. Solely because this latter result has been attained, in the case now before us, by the use of saws the appellants insist that the board or plank is still merely \u201csawn\u201d and is, therefore, \u201cnot further manufactured\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in item No. 504. If that position were tenable it would follow that a piece of lumber which has been subjected only to sawing processes, however numerous or varied, would not be so \u201cfurther manufactured\u201d so long as it might still properly be described as a plank or board. It seems to me to be only necessary to state this proposition to demonstrate its fallacy.\nIf an order were given to a lumber manufacturer for sawn boards or planks of certain dimensions he would deliver the product of the saw-mill\u2014not sized lumber. The latter is a different and a more expensive product and is supplied only when specially ordered. The evidence makes it clear not merely that it is the ordinary practice to \u201csize\u201d lumber in the planing-mill after it has left the saw-mill, but that \u201csizing\u201d cannot be performed by the machinery of the saw-mill. The sawn plank or board produced by the latter, known as an article of commerce to the lumber and building trades, must be subjected to a further manufacturing process before it will answer the description of a sized board or plank\u2014equally well known as a distinct article of commerce to the lumber and building trades. The uses to which the latter may be put are different from those for which the former is employed. The difference in cost is material. The articles are distinct in fact and are so recognized as articles of commerce\u2014and that is the result of a further process of manufacture to which one of them has been subjected. The sawn board or plank has been \u201cfurther manufactured\u201d and it is, in my opinion, immaterial whether, in effecting such further manufacture, saws or knives have been employed.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014We are called upon to decide whether the \u201csizing\u201d process on planks and boards exempts them from duty under item 504 of the Customs Tariff. That article reads as follows:\u2014\nPlanks, boards and other lumber of wood, sawn, split or cut, and dressed on one side only, but not further manufactured. Free.\nIt is stated on behalf of the respondent that the process in question constitutes a manufacturing process more advanced than the sawing operation.\nOn the other hand, it is contended by the appellants that sizing is simply a sawing process and that the planks and boards so manufactured do not lose their qualification of sawn wood.\nWhat is that \u201csizing\u201d process? It consists in giving the planks a uniform size. Of course, that result could be reached through the saws of the edging machine with which all saw-mills of some importance are equipped. But some planks might not have the same width. Then they are passed through the saws of a sizing machine that renders the planks absolutely uniform.\nAfter that sizing process is through the planks are put on the planer to be dressed, sometimes on three sides and sometimes only on one side. It is the usual process followed in Canadian mills.\nIn the United States a new machine has been found by which the dressing of the planks on one side and the sawing or sizing of the edges is all done at the same time. It is a cheaper process.\nThe honourable judge of the Exchequer Court decided that the item of the tariff in question contemplated pieces of lumber that had been simply sawn once and that the sizing of the lumber which required the plank to pass through a second sawing process constituted an article \u201cfurther manufactured\u201d than what the legislature had in view. He stated also that the sizing machine not forming part of the ordinary equipment of a saw-mill constituted the further manufacturing process contemplated by the statute.\nHis conclusions are based on two grounds; First, that the law contemplates one single sawing process; and, secondly, that the work should be done in a sawmill. I am unable to agree with those conclusions. As to the second sawing operation I may say that the gang-saw or circular saw that cute the logs is not the only one that is used in the saw-mills, as every one is aware. The planks, after having been converted as such by the gang-saw, have to pass through the butt-saws and edge-saws. By the latter process the edges of the planks are removed in order to give them the same width.\nSo several sawing processes are made in order to manufacture the plank and, if you are not satisfied with the width of your planks, if you find them too wide, you can also pass them through the saws of the sizing machine and have an absolute uniform width.\nOf course, that uniformity could be reached by simply passing the planks through the saws of the edging machines.\nIt appears that, generally speaking, this sizing process is made in the planing-mills and the sizing machine is not very often found under the roof of the saw-mill. Nothing prevents it, however, from being part of the saw-mill equipment; quite the reverse. It is a sawing process all the same and the plank, when it has passed through the operation, should be called a sawn plank. The fact that the size is absolutely accurate in one case and that the same uniformity would not exist in the other does not alter the nature of the plank. It is a piece of wood having the dimensions of a plank and which has been sawn purely and simply.\nThen\u2014What is the meaning of the words \u201cnot further manufactured\u201d? It means that a plank that is further manufactured than sawn on three sides and dressed on one side is subject to duty.\nIf it is dressed on two sides; if the edges are dressed also, or if they are grooved or bored, then they become \u201cfurther manufactured,\u201d\u2014and must pay the duty. It has already been decided that pieces of oak which had been cut and so could be used more easily in a certain manufacturing process than if imported in the ordinary length should not be taxed under a statute that required that oak to be duty free should not be shaped. Magann v. The Queen[13].\nWe should take into consideration also the fact that a statute imposing a tax should always be strictly construed and that, in case of doubt, the tax should not be levied. Maxwell, \u201cInterpretation of Statutes,\u201d (5 ed.), p. 461; The Queen v. The J. C. Ayer Co.[14]; Cox v. Rabbits[15].\nI do not find in this case very grave doubts. But if our interpretation is not in accordance with the intention of the legislature, if the sizing process was to be eliminated in its intention, then it should have said so. But as the sizing process is, after all, simply a sawing process, and as it does not constitute any difference with the edging process, I am unable to come to any other conclusion than that this appeal should be allowed, with a recommendation that the Crown should pay the costs of this appeal and of the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hogg & Hogg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The tariffs so filed for the first time established a fixed rate for the carriage of petroleum and its products. In October, 1907, and in May, 1908, supplementary tariffs were filed by the foreign companies and concurred in by the Canadian carriers, but they were not sanctioned by the Board. These substituted for the fixed rate on petroleum\n[Note.\u2014Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted, 13th December, 1912.] a variable rate made up of the sum of the local rates on each side of the border. The respondent companies, iu 1910, applied to the Canadian Board for an order declaring that the appellants had overcharged them by exacting the variable rate for carriage of petroleum, and an order was made by the Board declaring that the rates chargeable were those fixed by the \u201cjoint tariff\u201d of January, 1907. The Canadian carriers appealed from this order to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of the Board on the question of law whether or not this order was right and by leave of a judge on a question of jurisdiction claiming that the Board could not make a declaratory order and grant no consequential relief, and that it could not declare in force a tariff which had ceased to exist.\nHeld, that sections 26 and 318 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d authorized the Board to make an order merely declaratory.\nHeld, also, that the tariff of January, 1907, had not ceased to exist, but was still in force, never having been superseded.\nHeld, per Davies and Duff JJ., that if the initiating company, or the companies jointly, had power to supersede a joint tariff duly filed they had not in this case taken the proper steps to effect that purpose.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ., that such a tariff could only be superseded by the action, or with the sanction, of the Board.\nThe order appealed from was, therefore, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada in favour of the respondents on an application complaining of an overcharge in rates for carrying petroleum from the United States into Canada.\nThe Board decided, on application of the oil companies, that the tariff filed in Jan., 1907, was still in force and made an order declaring that the legal rates chargeable on petroleum and its products, in carloads, from shipping points in Ohio and Pennsylvania to Toronto were the fifth-class joint through rates in effect at the time the shipments moved as shewn in the joint through tariffs published and filed with the Board. The railway companies were granted leave by the Board to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on a question of law, namely, \u2014 Did the Board place the proper legal construction on the documents referred to in the judgment of the Chief Commissioner in this matter? Mr. Justice Idington gave them leave to appeal also on a question of jurisdiction.\nChrysler K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellants.\nW. N. Tilley for the respondents.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners made on a complaint filed by the respondents whereby it was alleged that the appellants from and after the first of January, 1907, charged excessive tolls for the transportation of petroleum and its products when shipped from certain points in the United States to Toronto and other Canadian points.\nThe complaint was heard by the Railway Board on May 16th, 1911. The respondents contended and the appellants denied that from and after the date mentioned fifth-class rating applied to petroleum and its products in carloads. The appellants charged the sum of the local rates to and from the Canadian gateways.\nThe Board\u2019s reasons for judgment were given by the Chief Commissioner. The conclusion reached as stated in the last paragraph of the reasons was as follows:\u2014\nOfficial Classification No. 29 was used by the respondents without any order or direction of the Board, as provided by subsection 4 of section 321. It was, therefore, binding upon them; and the provisions of that classification would apply upon petroleum and its products to points in Canada, unless they have taken some steps within the provisions of the statute to prevent its application. We are compelled to conclude that they have not succeeded in so doing, and that petroleum and its products should have carried fifth-class rating at the time the shipments in question moved.\nThe Board accordingly made an order, dated the 16th of May, 1911, declaring:\u2014\nThat the legal rates chargeable on petroleum and its products in carloads from the said shipping points in the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania to Toronto, Ontario, were the fifth-class joint through rates in effect at the time the said shipments moved as shewn in the joint through tariff published and filed with the Board, and in accordance with the Official Classification No. 29 and subsequent issues thereof.\nThe Board granted leave to the appellants to prosecute an appeal on the question of law as follows:\u2014\nDid the Board place the proper legal construction on the documents referred to in the judgment of the Chief Commissioner in this matter?\nMr. Justice Idington also allowed an appeal on the question of jurisdiction.\nThe contention of the appellants as I understand it on the question of jurisdiction is that when the complaint was heard by the Railway Board on the 16th May, 1911, the Board had no jurisdiction because the wrong complained of had then been remedied and the order made was and could only be declaratory and could not give the applicant any relief.\nThe question of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction depends largely upon the construction placed upon section 338 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d In the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. British American Oil Co.[1], this court held that joint tariffs filed by foreign railway companies for rates on through traffic originating in foreign territory to be carried by continuous routes to destinations in Canada are effective and binding upon Canadian companies participating in the transportation until either superseded or disallowed.\nSuch joint tariffs had been filed by the foreign companies initiating the carriage of the oil as to the tolls for the carriage of which the complaint was made. If the tariffs had been \u201csuperseded\u201d under the 338th section of the Act as contended by the appellants by another tariff justifying the tolls charged that would be a good answer to the complaint.\nMr, Tilley, for the respondents, contended that once a joint tariff for a continuous route from a foreign country to a point in Canada was filed under the 336th section of the Act it remained in force until superseded or disallowed by the Board, and that admittedly there had not been any such action by the Board in this case, and further contended that assuming there was power in the company or companies by which the joint tariff was filed to supersede it nothing had been done which could be construed as supersession. The appellants contended that the superseding was something to be done by the foreign company which initiated the joint tariff and that there had been such supersession in the amendments to and alterations of that initial joint tariff subsequently filed by the companies.\nOf course if section 338 vests in the Board alone as contended by respondents the power of superseding or disallowing an initial joint tariff then, admittedly that not having been done, no question could arise with respect to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to make the order.\nAssuming, however, that the appellants\u2019 contention is correct with respect to the company\u2019s power to supersede an initial joint tariff after it had been filed then I am of opinion that they had not done so up to the time the complaint was filed. On the question of jurisdiction I do not entertain any doubt. The Board (section 10) is made a court of record. Section 26 confers upon it power\nto inquire into, hear and determine any application by or on behalf of any party interested\ncomplaining (inter alia)\nthat any company or person has done or is doing any act, matter or thing contrary to or in violation of this Act, etc.\nThe Board has clearly the power to determine all disputes arising as to whether a shipper or a carrier has violated any of the provisions of the Act. It is not necessary for us to consider the extent of the relief the Board may grant in cases where it finds either shipper or carrier guilty of such violation. In the present case it finds in accordance with respondents\u2019 contention that the legal rate at the times of the shipments and carriage complained of was the fifth-class rate. Any charge above or beyond that was an overcharge. But the Board did not assume to direct any refund. It left the parties to their legal remedies if they decided to recover such overcharges.\nThe appellants contend that some limitation must be read into the 26th section of the Act, because if read literally it would confer power upon the Board to determine every complaint of any violation of the Act either of commission or omission and that we might have in cases of railway accidents in which passengers or others were injured the absurdity reached of the Board sitting to determine whether a bell had been rung at a crossing or a whistle blown at the times and places required by the Act.\nI venture to think, however, that upon a proper construction of the section no such absurd results could happen. What Parliament conferred upon the Board was power to determine complaints of failure on the part of a company, qu\u00e2 company, to discharge or obey some statutory duty or obligation either positive or negative imposed upon it as such company, not complaints that some subordinate or employee of the company had failed to discharge a duty which the company charged him with and for the neglect to discharge which the company might be liable to the party suffering. That is, in my judgment, the meaning of the language used in section 26, and when so read it carries out fully the underlying idea of the Act, namely, that with private ownership there should be public effective control. Construed as I construe section 26 there does not appear to be either justification or excuse for the courts to read any limitation into the section. The Board has jurisdiction to hear and determine any complaint from an interested party that a company has failed to discharge or obey some statutory duty or obligation binding upon it as a company or violated some prohibition of the Act or they might, under the 49th section, make an interim ex parte order as to such failure or violation of their own mere motion and without complaint. Such jurisdiction, however, does not extend to the failure on the part of an employee to discharge a duty with which he was charged by the company alike to it and to the public. It is true that the section speaks of a company or person, but that word person as used in the section does not embrace or include employees of the company who fail in the discharge of the duties with which they are charged by the company. Different considerations would apply where the \u201cRailway Act\u201d or the \u201cspecial Act\u201d or a regulation of the Board imposed directly upon an individual person or official, as distinct from the company he represented, a duty or obligation to do or abstain from doing some act or thing. Beyond that the Act does not profess to go. Nor do I attach any weight to the contention that the order complained of does not profess to give any relief and that the Board had no power to give relief under the circumstances. In my opinion the determination of the facts as to the legal tariff in operation during the period the order covers is one peculiarly fitting for the Board. The mere fact of the company desisting from the violation complained of before the hearing of the complaint does not oust the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. Whether they could have supplemented their order with another directing a refund I am not called upon to determine. That question would probably have called for a wider inquiry and a great deal of evidence as to the overcharges paid by different individuals more suitable for the ordinary courts of the land to hear and decide. But that this Board, experienced men on the subject before it, advised by trained experts and possessing in its records at first hand all the evidence necessary to determine the subject-matter of this complaint as to whether in the first place there had been a joint tariff established for the carriage of this oil from the United. States to Canada, and secondly, whether that tariff had been superseded by another at the time the complaint was filed, or was then still in force, and lastly, whether the complaint in whole or in part as to overcharges on the oil was well founded, was the proper tribunal to make such determination I have no doubt.\nWith the results which may follow their finding and order I am not at present concerned. Whether their finding on the facts as expressed in their order will be binding and conclusive on the ordinary courts of the land in the event of suits being brought to recover the overcharges it would not be proper for me to express any opinion now.\nIt is sufficient for me to say that in my judgment the Board had jurisdiction to make the order appealed from.\nAs to the question of law whether the Board placed the proper legal construction on the documents referred to in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Commissioner I can only say that I think it did.\nThe joint tariff filed by the foreign company gave the Board jurisdiction as determined by us in the Stoy Case[2]. Whether it was superseded or not by the amended tariffs filed by the foreign company is a question of law, and has been referred in this appeal to us. In my opinion this question of law was properly determined by the Board and therefore having jurisdiction on the subject-matter and having properly determined it the appeal fails.\nIt is not necessary for us to determine whether the Board has the sole jurisdiction to supersede any such joint tariff so filed or whether the company filing it can supersede it.\nIf the Board alone had the power to supersede such joint tariff such supersession has admittedly not taken place. If the company has the power it has not expressed it properly and the joint tariff remained in force when the complaint was laid.\nI cannot put the argument as to the supplementary tariffs filed and their effect as superseding the joint tariffs more clearly or concisely than it is put by the Chief Commissioner in the following remarks:\u2014 We do not see how a tariff, changeable as to tolls, at the will of either, without reference to the other, can be said to be a joint tariff. This must mean a tariff that all participating carriers are interested in jointly; not interested jointly in part only, but in the entire tariff; including not only the through or continuous route, but also the through rate or toll. In the case in hand the attempt is not to destroy the entire joint tariff; the continuous route, through billing, accounting, etc., are preserved, but the partnership is attempted to be, in part, dissolved by saying all our other arrangements regarding the carriage of this traffic shall remain, but hereafter each carrier shall fix its own local, and the through rate shall be the sum, or combination of those locals that may be in effect when and as shipments move.\nIt seems to me that this is just what section 338 was designed to prevent, and this is particularly so with reference to traffic falling under section 336, where Parliament has said such a tariff shall be filed, but has no means of compelling the foreign carrier to comply with its direction. That carrier complying, it seems reasonable to say, unless the Board disallows that joint tariff those shall be the tolls to be charged until you file another joint tariff shewing other or different tolls; when, unless disallowed, those latter shall be the only lawful tolls until again superseded by another joint tariff.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised by the appeal herein relative to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, seems to me after it has been thoroughly argued out to be without foundation.\nThe respondents\u2019 complaint having been lodged against the appellants whilst they persisted in maintaining a rate of tolls found by the Board to have been unjustifiable, the Board would have been derelict in duty if it had refused to continue the hearing simply because the appellants had abandoned the unfounded claims to rates. Not only had the Board the admitted power to have adjudged costs of the inquiry if it had found it just to award same, but also the power and duty to make a ruling that would guide such like parties in a future dispute of the like kind and enable them to avoid such positions as the Board could not justify. Appellants no doubt felt this, when they appeared before the Board and, without protest, contested the matter on its merits.\nIt is not necessary to deal with long arguments founded on the hopes or fears of such uses as may or may not be made of the ruling in future or pending litigation, further than to say I think that we cannot here properly pass upon the questions of whether the ruling is or is not a declaration within section 318. I have no opinion thereon.\nA question of law which the Board submitted is stated as follows:\u2014\nDid the Board place the proper legal construction on the documents referred to in the judgment of the Chief Commissioner in this matter?\nThe complaints lodged by respondents against each appellant were identical, were heard together and the judgment of the Chief Commissioner deals with both as founded on the like conditions of fact.\nThe questions raised therein must turn on the construction to be given sections 336 and 338 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d supported or illuminated by sections 314, 321, sub-section 4, and other sections of the Act.\nAs pointed out in the case of The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The British American Oil Co.[3], the \u201cRailway Act\u201d does not profess to confer any jurisdiction over foreign railway companies, but recognizes that relations may exist between those companies and the Canadian railway companies which so far as the latter are concerned may, as regards shippers over their roads, become the subject of administrative or judicial control in Canada.\nThe foreign companies, within a recognized area, associate together for the purpose of determining, amongst other things, their dealing with the subject of freight rates, classifications of freight, and through routes and rates; and the appellants have representatives in this association or relations therewith, relative to such subjects, so far as a common purpose may require.\nThese foreign companies, or the association on behalf of them, had filed joint tariffs with the Board, and then in the month of January, 1907, filed also an official classification, No. 29, which placed the commodities now in question in the fifth class and thereby constituted a common through route and joint tariff and continuous through routes and joint tariffs within the meaning of section 336 of the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n336. As respects all traffic which shall be carried from any point in a foreign country into Canada, or from a foreign country through Canada into a foreign country by any continuous route owned or operated by any two or more companies, whether Canadian or foreign, a joint tariff for such continuous route shall be duly filed with the Board.\nThese several through routes seem to have been continued and operated, over the period in question, by the foreign railway company and the respondents respectively. Neither of the appellants, however, whilst availing themselves thereof adhered to the joint tariff thus constituted in January, 1907, but it is said later on charged the respondent higher tolls than could have been legally collected under such joint tariff or joint tariffs as settled by the filing of No. 29, Official Classification. They allege in justification that any joint tariff so constituted was subject to variations to be made therein by the foreign companies, or any of them, by means of supplements to the Official Classification.\nOn the other hand it is urged and has been ruled by the Board that such an official classification coupled with the through rate then existent constituted a joint tariff, or joint tariffs, relative to the commodities in question that could not within the \u201cRailway Act\u201d be departed from by the Canadian companies in such an irregular manner. In other words, the Board holds that the latter cannot abandon the joint tariff and yet continue the through route.\nSection 338 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is the only means it gives for terminating a joint tariff. It is as follows:\n338. Joint tariffs shall, as to the filing and publication thereof, be subject to the same provisions in this Act as are applicable to the filing and publication of local tariffs of a similar description; and upon any such joint tariff being so duly filed with the Board the company or companies shall, until such tariff is superseded or disallowed by the Board, charge the toll or tolls as specified therein: Provided that the Board may except from the provisions of this section the filing and publication of any or all passenger tariffs of foreign railway companies.\n2. The Board may require to be informed by the company of the proportion of toll or tolls, in any joint tariff filed, which it or any other company, whether Canadian or foreign, is to receive or has received.\nOne interpretation of this section contended for is that the plain grammatical meaning thereof is just what the words \u201csuperseded or disallowed by the Board\u201d imply, and that, therefore, no departure from a joint tariff can be made by a Canadian company without the sanction of the Board.\nIt is urged, however, that other sections dealing with the subject of joint tariffs indicate that such is not the intention. There are three other joint tariffs dealt with by the Act \u2014 one the passenger specially excepted from the section 338 if the Board says so \u2014 another the joint tariff for freight originating in Canada and going to a foreign country, and a third for exclusively Canadian routes, and indirectly, as it were, a fourth which I need not refer to.\nThe joint tariff for exclusively Canadian routes is in its formation liable to be either the product of the action of the companies or to be imposed by the Board. It is, however, whether directly or indirectly, apt to be so much the creation of the Board that I do not see how the provisions relative thereto or to the ordinary tariff charges on wholly Canadian roads, can help us much to interpret section 338.\nThere certainly is a degree of liberty given all companies relative to changes of their own tariffs that does not seem in terms extended to the joint tariffs which any of them may take a part in forming. To my mind that fact itself is more instructive than anything which may be drawn from similarity of expression relative to the superseding or of the disallowance by the Board, as, for example, in section 328, sub-section 4, so much dwelt upon. The apparent liberty to change a tariff does not apply to a changing of route such as is the foundation of a joint tariff. In Canada the Board can make or unmake this foundation.\nOne thing is quite clear in this Act and that is that it was the intention of the legislature to give the Board as effective control as it possibly could over the tolls.\nAnd even if the word \u201csuperseded\u201d in section 338 is to imply that the companies concerned may have some liberty of action or some say relative to the changing of a joint tariff, it does not seem to me consistent with such purpose of control by the Board that the Canadian companies were ever intended to be parties to any scheme that in fact was not, or did not include in it, the actual creation of a joint tariff in any substitution intended to supersede a joint tariff which must be presumed to have received its sanction by the act of filing with, and fact of non-rejection by, the Board. In that way and sense the words of section 338 now in question can each be given effect to.\nIt does not appear quite clear, on the material before us, how the obvious purpose of the Act, that each change should have the Board\u2019s approval, is supposed to have been in any case brought about.\nIt may arise from regulations that are not in the case or from practice.\nIt nowhere appears that a change of through route is permissible to the companies without being accompanied by a joint tariff.\nThe Canadian companies seem bound to have a joint tariff corresponding to each through route over a combination of roads, or parts of roads, and their own, and that of either joining with the foreign companies to constitute it. I have no doubt the objects of section 318 can best be attained by thus holding a check over such combinations.\nAnd even if it be implied that those furnishing a through route may change or supersede the tariff, it must be by means of a joint tariff. The departures herein were not joint tariffs. So the Board has found, and I think, correctly. We must assume, I think, that the freight classification (such as No. 29) in the United States referred to in sub-section 4 of section 321, was the basis of all the Board had impliedly sanctioned, and that partial departures therefrom were not within their recognition.\nThe possible hardship of having to account for tolls collected by the respective appellants in cases not conforming with the preceding principles and accounted for to the foreign companies, is no argument. The Canadian companies must in all such cases conform to Canadian law, and clearly when making a through route be sure they have a corresponding joint tariff, or ask the Board for relief.\nHence this appeal should be dismissed with costs and the question of law submitted be answered in the affirmative.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Co. v. British American Oil Co.\u2014The question of the jurisdiction of the Board herein raised is somewhat more arguable than in the case of the joint appeal of this appellant and the Grand Trunk Railway Company against the Canadian Oil Companies heard just before this.\nIt seems clear that a formal complaint, such as I presume the rules of the Board require, was not made until the continuation of the offences in question had been abandoned.\nThere was, however, a clear complaint in writing to the Board before the appellant abandoned what was objected to and there was, so far as I can see, nothing to prevent the Board acting thereon and for the time being to waive its own regulation I have presumed to exist. The jurisdiction exists, therefore, for reasons I gave in the other case.\nThe ground respondent\u2019s counsel takes under section 318 may be good, but I do not desire to pass upon that section till I have to. Nor yet do I desire to cast any doubt upon what support it may or may not give and which respondent may need elsewhere. I have no opinion.\nThe question of law herein submitted by the Board seems pretty much what I had supposed was disposed of in the case The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The British American Oil Co.[4].\nWhat I said in that case, and have said in the other case above mentioned, will furnish my reasons herein and I need not repeat them here. The consequence thereof seems to me to be that the supplements, which are said not to have been dealt with therein and are shewn more fully herein, cannot affect the rights of the parties. The answer to the question submitted ought to be that the filing of the supplements had no legal effect on the joint through rate established 25th of January, 1907, and the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014By the order out of which these appeals arise, (dated the 16th of May, 1911,) the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada declared that the \u201clegal rates chargeable upon petroleum and its products, in carloads,\u201d in respect of certain shipments from certain \u201cshipping points in Pennsylvania and Ohio to Toronto were the fifth-class joint through rates, etc., thereof.\u201d From this order both of the railway companies appeal by leave of the Board upon a question of law and upon a question of jurisdiction, by leave under an order made by Mr. Justice Idington.\nThe question of law, (with which I shall first deal,) is stated in these terms:\u2014 Did the Board place the proper legal construction on the documents referred to in the judgment of the Chief Commissioner in this matter?\nIt was agreed on both sides that the point which it was intended to refer was that which was the real point in controversy before the Board, namely, whether the legal effect of the documents mentioned was correctly stated in the declaration I have just quoted.\nThe complaint of the respondents, the Canadian Oil Co., was that the railway companies had unjustly discriminated against certain shipments of crude oil, (from the shipping points mentioned to Toronto,) by refusing to carry that commodity at the rates prescribed in the tariffs filed. The shipments in question were made between the first of January, 1907, and the thirty-first of December, 1910, and the contention of the applicants, which the Board upheld, was that during the whole of that period the rates legally chargeable on such shipments were the rates referred to in the order of the Board, the rates, that is to say, which were legally chargeable at the dates of the shipments as \u201cjoint through rates\u201d for commodities of the fifth class according to the classification mentioned and according to the \u201cjoint through tariffs\u201d published and filed with the Board.\nFor the purposes of the argument on this appeal it was admitted that in consequence of the filing of \u201cOfficial Classification No. 29,\u201d by which \u201cpetroleum and its products\u201d were for the first time classified as commodities of the fifth class, the \u201cjoint through\u201d rate for commodities of that class must be taken to have become applicable to crude oil, on January 1st, 1907. That point was determined adversely to the railway companies by the judgment of this court in The Grand Trunk Railway Company v. The British American Oil Company[5], confirming a ruling of the Board.\nThe contention of the railway companies is that by a series of tariffs filed subsequent to that date \u201cpetroleum and its products\u201d were taken out of the category of commodities of the fifth class so far as regards shipments into Canada from the shipping points in question. By these various tariffs the railway companies concerned endeavoured to abrogate the \u201cjoint through rate\u201d in force for these commodities in respect of such shipments and to substitute therefor a rate which should be made up of the sum of the local rates (1) from the point of origin to the Canadian gateway, and (2) from the Canadian gateway to the point of destination, which should be in force when the shipment should move. The question referred by the Board is, in substance, the question whether the railway companies have succeeded in accomplishing this. The tariffs upon which the appellants rely are very numerous, but it will be found on examination, (as pointed out in the appellants\u2019 factum,) that the methods adopted by the carriers to attain the object they had in view may be classified as follows:\u2014\n(1) By a supplement to a joint tariff concurred in by the carriers, providing that the rates to points in Canada shall be the local rates to the frontier plus the local rate beyond.\n(2) By providing by joint freight tariffs, containing so-called exceptions to the Official Classification that the Official Classification basis shall not apply to points in Canada, but that these rates shall be made on the sum of the totals.\n(3) By providing by joint freight tariffs or supplements thereto, that the through rates to points in Canada shall not apply.\n(4) By providing by such supplements that no through rates are in effect.\nAll these methods, if effective, would result in the same thing, namely:\u2014 the rate for shipments of the commodities affected from the shipping points in question into Canada would be a variable rate made up of the sum of the local rates in force from time to time, first, from the point of shipment to the Canadian gateway, and secondly, from the Canadian gateway to the terminus of the route. These tariffs were concurred in by all the carriers concerned, but none of them had the sanction of the Board.\nThe Board has held that these methods were ineffective for the purpose the railway companies had in view. I concur in that opinion and I agree, moreover, with the reasons which were given in support of it by the distinguished and lamented judge who then filled the office of Chief Commissioner.\nEach of the shipments in question, it is, of course, admitted, passed over a \u201ccontinuous route\u201d in part \u201coperated\u201d by one of the appellant companies. In such a case, by section 336 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d a \u201cjoint tariff for such continuous route\u201d must be filed, (according to the decision in the case already mentioned,) and the \u201ccompany or companies\u201d operating the route are required, by section 338, to charge the toll or tolls specified therein \u201cuntil such tariff is superseded or disallowed by the Board.\u201d There has been in this case no action by the Board. It is not strictly necessary to pass upon the point, but the view I am disposed to take is that the language of the section does not require us to hold that every \u201cjoint tariff\u201d is only subject to alteration by the action of the Board; I think there is no satisfactory ground for drawing such a sharp distinction between a \u201cjoint tariff\u201d and other freight tariffs. It would not, of course, necessarily follow that every \u201cjoint tariff\u201d would be subject to alteration at the will of the parties. It may be, for example, that on the true construction of section 334 a \u201cjoint tariff\u201d framed pursuant to an order of the Board under that section remains in force until displaced by the Board itself.\nHowever that may be, the Act plainly contemplates that for a \u201ccontinuous route\u201d to which section 336 applies there shall be a \u201cjoint tariff.\u201d That being so, then, (assuming the companies operating such route to have in some cases the power to \u201csupersede\u201d by their own action a \u201cjoint tariff\u201d once established without invoking the sanction of the Board,) it must be taken, conformably to the principle declared by section 336, that such supersession necessarily involves the establishment of another tariff which itself falls within the category of \u201cjoint tariff,\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as used in the sections referred to. I agree with the late Chief Commissioner that a tariff of rates made up of variable local rates does not fulfil that condition.\nThe question of jurisdiction remains. I confess I can entertain no doubt that each of the several orders of the Board of the 16th of May, 1911, records and was intended to record an adjudication by the Board in its judicial capacity upon an issue between the complainants and the company or companies respectively against which the complaints were lodged; and I have come to the conclusion that the Board had, under section 26, jurisdiction to make the declarations contained in those orders.\nThe contention on behalf of the appellants is that the jurisdiction of the Board to adjudicate inter partes upon questions of law or of fact is confined to cases in which the Board has jurisdiction to give some consequential relief. The answer to the contention appears to be that sub-section (a) of section 26 confers the broadest jurisdiction to decide upon complaints with respect to past offences of omission or commission and the form of the sub-sections (a) and (b) suggests that the jurisdiction to pass upon such complaints is intended to be exercisable independently of the jurisdiction under sub-section (b). There are, obviously, many reasons of good sense and policy why such a jurisdiction should be exercisable by the Board; and I think there is no ground upon which the restriction contended for can be sustained.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners, on the application of the Canadian Oil Companies, Limited, made an order in which, following an introductory recital of facts,\nit is declared that the legal rates chargeable on petroleum and its products, in carloads, from the said shipping points in the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania to Toronto, Ontario, were the fifth-class joint through rates in effect at the time the said shipments moved, as shewn in the joint through tariffs published and filed with the Board, and in accordance with the Official Classification No. 29, and subsequent issues thereof.\nBy leave of the Board the railway companies appeal from this order on a question of law formulated by it in this form:\u2014 Did the Board place the proper legal construction on the documents referred to in the judgment of the Chief Commissioner in this matter?\nBy leave of my brother Idington they also appeal on the ground that in making the above order the Board acted without jurisdiction. On this branch of the appeal two points are urged:\u2014\n(1) That before the Board heard the application the use of the combined local rates complained of had been discontinued and the joint tariff demanded by the applicants had been restored, or brought into force, and the Board was, therefore, not called upon and was not in a position to afford any relief, and should not have proceeded to pronounce a merely declaratory order.\n(2) That the order purports to declare illegal rates charged by the United States railways from the points of shipment to the Canadian border.\nThe substantial grievance of the appellants is that they anticipate that in prospective actions by the Canadian oil companies to recover from them the sums paid for freight on shipments of petroleum from the United States shipping points to Toronto (the freight charges for the entire continuous routes were collected by the Canadian railway companies on delivery to the consignees) in excess of the joint tariff rates which the order of the Board declares to have been in force, that order will, under section 54 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d be used to establish conclusively their liability to refund.\nI shall deal first with the questions of jurisdiction.\nBy the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d notably by sections 26 and 318, the Board is empowered to \u201cinquire, hear and determine\u201d and to \u201cdetermine\u201d (which involves inquiry, if not hearing) complaints in respect of anything which a railway company \u201chas done or is doing\u201d in contravention of that statute, etc. While ordinarily such an inquiry and determination will be had for the purpose of deciding the right of an applicant to some relief and will, in proper cases, result in an order affording such relief, there may arise many cases in which, although the particular practice complained of has ceased, it may be desirable to institute, or to pursue, an investigation and to reach and formulate a determination for the future guidance of the railway company against which complaint has been made and of other railway companies and of the general public in regard to matters kindred to that which forms the subject of inquiry. What the Board may do under section 26 at the instance of a complainant, it may do under section 28 \u201cof its own motion.\u201d While I more than gravely doubt that it was the intention of Parliament to constitute the Railway Board a tribunal for the determination of facts in cases of alleged contraventions of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d or of regulations made under that statute or of orders of the Board, etc., merely as a step towards, and to facilitate the prosecution of civil actions brought or to be brought against railway companies by aggrieved persons to obtain relief in damages or otherwise, I entertain no doubt that for the other purposes above indicated the Board possesses the jurisdiction which it has exercised in the present case. There is nothing before us to suggest that its object in making the order appealed from was to enable the respondents to use it under section 54 as a foundation for proceedings in the civil courts. If this order may be so used that is merely an incidental consequence which does not displace the jurisdiction of the Board to make it and is a phase of the matter with which we are not presently concerned.\nThe order as drawn affects only the Canadian railways which were before the Board. It does not purport to declare illegal any charges made by the foreign railways which operated those parts of the continuous routes beyond the Canadian gateways. It necessarily deals with the joint tariff which the Board (rightly, having regard to the decision of this court in the Stoy Case[6]) holds had been established for the continuous routes operated by the Canadian and foreign railways. It merely declares that, because that joint tariff had not been \u201csuperseded or disallowed\u201d in accordance with the provisions of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d it is still binding on the Canadian railways for the entire continuous routes. Whether the effect of this order will be to enable the respondents to recover from the appellant companies the whole amount paid them in excess of the joint tariff rates for the entire continuous routes is a question not now before us. I cannot see in an order which does nothing more than declare that as to the Canadian railways which were before the Board the joint tariff to which they became parties continues to bind them, anything in excess of the jurisdiction conferred by Parliament on the Railway Board.\nOn the question of law submitted to us I am also of the opinion that the appeal fails. The respondents maintain that if it were competent for the railway companies by their own joint act to \u201csupersede\u201d the joint tariff which became effective on the 1st of January, 1907, under the application of Official Classification No. 29, adopted pursuant to sub-section 4 of section 321 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d they did not take effective steps for that purpose. I find it difficult to understand why, having regard to the terms of the consents filed by the Canadian railway companies, (especially that of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company,) in virtue of which the tariffs filed only by the American railway companies have been held to be joint tariffs[7], the filing by the same companies of supplements or amendments to such joint tariffs should not be deemed joint acts of the American and Canadian companies, and, if railway companies had the power of superseding joint tariffs, should not be effective for that purpose. (See section 323, sub-section 3.) But if the railway companies had the power of supersession in regard to a joint tariff I incline to the view that it would properly be exercised only by an amendment or supplementing of the tariff itself and not by filing an exception to a freight classification used under the authority of section 321, sub-section 4. It is, in my opinion, not competent for a railway company operating the Canadian section of a continuous route to or from a point in the United States to use a freight classification in use in the United States subject to a special exception in regard to goods to be carried to or from Canada. The \u201cfreight classification in use in the United States,\u201d of which the use is authorized by sub-section 4 of section 321, means a freight classification in general use in that country under which goods of the same kind will be treated as in the same class when shipped for carriage to or from Canada as when shipped for local carriage in the United States. I am, therefore, of the opinion that if railway companies had the right by their own action to supersede joint tariffs, they could not do so in the case of a joint tariff for a continuous route, partly in Canada and partly in the United States, by specially excepting from a classification in use in the United States, either when adopting it or afterwards, all goods, or any particular kind of goods destined for or shipped from Canadian points. If a railway company sees fit to adopt for such a route a freight classification in use in the United States which contains such an exception, it will, I think, be bound by the classification without the exception. But in the view which I take it is not necessary to dwell further upon, or to definitely determine these questions.\nIn my opinion upon the proper construction of section 338 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d it is not competent for two railway companies, one foreign and the other Canadian, which have filed or concurred in the filing of a joint tariff, themselves to \u201csupersede\u201d it. It can be \u201csuperseded or disallowed (only) by the Board.\u201d Section 338 does not itself confer powers of supersession and disallowance. These powers are given to the Board by section 323, and to the powers so conferred section 338 refers. Domestic \u201cspecial\u201d tariffs may be superseded within defined limits (section 323, sub-section 3; section 328, sub-section 3; section 328, sub-section 4; section 332, sub-section 3) by the railway company itself filing a new \u201cspecial\u201d tariff. But section 338 appears to preclude the supersession of joint tariffs, whether purely domestic or partly domestic and partly foreign, by the railway companies, inasmuch as it enacts that such tariffs when duly filed shall bind them until \u201csuperseded or disallowed by the Board.\u201d In section 328, sub-section 4, and again in section 332, sub-section 3, the supersession of domestic special tariffs by the filing of new special tariffs is provided for. The language used is:\u2014\nUpon any such (special freight) tariff being so (duly) filed, the company shall, until such tariff is superseded, or is disallowed by the Board, charge the toll or tolls as specified therein; and such (special freight) tariff shall supersede any preceding tariff or tariffs or any portion or portions thereof, so far as it reduces or advances the tolls therein.\nIn sub-section 3, of section 332, the comma, found after the word \u201csuperseded\u201d in sub-section 4, of section 328, is omitted; and for the semi-colon after the word \u201ctherein,\u201d where it first occurs, a comma is substituted. These differences I regard as purely accidental. But in section 338 the word \u201cis\u201d is dropped before the word \u201cdisallowed,\u201d and the clause which I have italicized, found in sections 328 and 332, is wholly omitted. These changes were, in my opinion, deliberate. The important clause in section 338 reads:\u2014\nAnd upon any such joint tariff being so duly filed with the Board, the company or companies shall, until such tariff is superseded or disallowed by the Board, charge the toll or tolls specified therein.\nGrammatically, the words \u201cby the Board\u201d apply equally to the two verbs \u201cis superseded or disallowed.\u201d Not only do I find no ground for discarding the grammatical construction, but there appear to be several reasons for adhering to it. Comparison with sections 328 and 332 makes it reasonably clear that the departure from the language of those sections was intentional. Under section 323 the Board has a power of supersession in the sense of replacing. \u201cRemplac\u00e9\u201d is the translation of \u201csuperseded\u201d in the French version of section 338. The Board\u2019s jurisdiction probably does not extend to requiring a foreign company and a domestic company to unite in filing a joint tariff under section 336. (Compare section 335 and note the difference in form.) It apparently has not the power, if a joint tariff once filed has been disallowed or has been withdrawn with its approval, subsequently to require the filing of another joint tariff to take its place. The only means by which it can deal with such cases appears to be to prevent Canadian companies from participating in the operation of continuous international routes until satisfactory joint tariffs are duly filed. But it seems to be the scheme of the Act to enable the Board to retain control once acquired by providing that if a joint tariff has been filed it shall remain operative and binding at least upon Canadian companies interested until the Board sees fit to supersede or disallow it, and by denying to the railway companies in respect of joint tariffs the power, which is given in respect of special domestic tariffs, of superseding or abrogating them by merely filing new special tariffs to replace them.\nFor these reasons, bowing to the decision of this court in the Stoy Case[8], while respectfully adhering to the dissenting opinion which I there expressed, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Co. v. British American Oil Co. What I have said in regard to the Canadian Oil Companies Case applies to this appeal, which should likewise be dismissed with costs.

The omission in nomination papers to mention the residence, addition or description of the candidate proposed in such a manner as sufficiently to identify him constitutes a patent and substantial failure to comply with the essential requirements of section 94 of the Act; on the objection in this respect taken by the only opposing candidate it is the duty of he returning officer to reject a nomination so irregularly made and to declare such opposing candidate elected by acclamation. Such rejection and declaration of election by acclamation may properly be made by the returning officer after the expiration of the time limited for the nomination of candidates by section 100 of the Act.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J., and Davies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. (Idington and Duff JJ. contra).\u2014The receipt for the required deposit of $200, accompanying the nomination papers, given by the returning officer under the provisions of section 97 of the \u201cDominion Elections Act,\u201d is evidence merely of the production of the papers and payment of the deposit and not of the validity of the nomination.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ. (dissenting).\u2014The receipt so given for the required deposit constitutes a legal assurance that the candidate has been duly and properly nominated; it cannot be revoked nor the nomination papers rejected by the returning officer after the expiration of the time limited by section 100 of the Act for the nomination of candidates; when that time has passed all questions touching the statutory sufficiency of the papers are concluded in so far as it is within the province of the returning officer to deal with such matters.\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014Where the returning officer has received papers professing to nominate a proposed candidate with the consent of the candidate to such nomination and given his receipt for the required deposit pursuant to section 97 of the Act, and the time limited for the nomination of candidates at the election has expired, the status of such candidate becomes finally determined quoad proceedings under the control of the returning officer and it is then the duty of that official to grant a poll for taking the votes of the electors.\u2019\nPer Duff J. (dissenting).\u2014In view of the limited jurisdiction conferred upon judges in respect to election trials under the \u201cDominion Controverted Elections Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 7, where the returning officer has exceeded his legal powers by improperly returning a candidate as having been elected by acclamation the judgment should declare that the election was not according to law.\nThe judgment appealed from (Q.R. 42 S.C. 235) was affirmed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment by Robidoux and Laurendeau JJ. in the Controverted Elections Court[1] in the matter of the controverted election of a member for the Electoral District of Two Mountains in the House of Commons of Canada, dismissing the petition with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments reported.\nHon.

Atwater K.C. and Mignault K.C. for the appellant.\nPerron K.C. and Geuest, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Terrebonne dismissing with costs the appellant\u2019s contestation of the election of the respondent Ethier.\nOn the nomination day two persons put in nomination papers, the respondent, Mr. Ethier, and Mr. Guillaume Andr\u00e9 Fauteux. Fauteux\u2019s nomination paper consisted of two large double-sheets of paper, the first page of each double-sheet containing a printed form of the nomination of some person as a candidate, with blank spaces to fill in the nominee\u2019s name, residence and occupation, and with spaces below for the nominating electors to sign their names, professions and residences. At the foot of the page, below where the electors\u2019 signatures are to be placed, was a clause also printed with blanks to be signed by a witness to the electors\u2019 signatures, and also a printed form of acceptance, by the person nominated, of the nomination, with an attesting clause by a witness.\nOn the inside of each of these double-sheets was printed the form of \u201coath of attestation of the nomination paper.\u201d\nThese forms were in accordance with those required by the statute (Forms H and I).\nOne of these large double-sheets, with the form of nomination at the top not filled in, containing thirteen names of electors had a witness\u2019s name attached at the foot of the names, with residence and addition certifying that the paper had been signed by the said electors in his presence and also had, at the foot of the same page, the form of acceptance by the person nominated filled up and signed. On this double-sheet the form \u201cI\u201d of the oath of attestation of the nomination paper was filled up by a witness and contained the names not only of the thirteen electors whose names appeared on the front page of that large double-sheet, but also the names of nineteen electors whose names appeared on another double-sheet of the same kind and character as that containing the thirteen names.\nOn this latter double-sheet the form of the oath of attestation was printed in blank and was not filled up and the form at the foot of the nominating electors\u2019 names providing for the witness to their signatures and also that for the acceptance by the candidate of his nomination, were both struck out.\nOn the other hand, this double-sheet containing the nineteen names had the blank at the top of the first page filled up nominating Mr. Guillaume Andre Fauteux as a candidate, but without any residence or addition or description of him.\nThese two double-sheets were not in any way attached or fastened together though they were handed in together and, some of the witnesses at the trial said, folded together.\nA written objection was fyled by Mr. Ethier, the respondent, who had also been nominated as a candidate, to the reception of these papers as a valid nomination of Mr. Fauteux on the grounds: 1st. That they did not mention his domicile or his occupation; and 2ndly. That they were not signed by 25 electors conformably to the law. He demanded in consequence that he should be declared elected by acclamation.\nThe returning officer, after taking time to consider and consult counsel, acceded to Mr. Ethier\u2019s objection and demand, and returned him by acclamation accordingly.\nIt was against this return that the election petition was fyled. The learned judges upheld both objections.\nIn the view I take of this case, it is unnecessary for us to express any opinion whether the two double-sheets, unattached to each other, but delivered to the returning officer on the nomination day in the manner I have described, should have been accepted by him as a valid nomination paper.\nAssuming, therefore, without deciding, that the returning officer should have treated both sheets as really one nominating paper and that the candidate\u2019s acceptance and the witnesses\u2019 attestation were all right and should have been treated as applying to both double-sheets, the question still remains, did they together contain the essential requisites of a valid nomination?\nTo determine this we must have recourse to the \u201cDominion Elections Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 6), but before setting out the relevant and controlling sections of that Act I desire to point out that neither in the body of the nomination paper itself, in which section 94 and form \u201cH\u201d require \u201cthe name, residence and addition or description\u201d of each person proposed, nor in the witnesses\u2019 \u201coath of attestation of the nomination paper,\u201d nor in the candidate\u2019s acceptance of the nomination, was there any attempt made to comply with the statute\u2019s requirements as to the nominee\u2019s residence, addition or description, and so make up as it were for the defect in the nomination paper itself. On the face of the nomination papers, including the candidate\u2019s acceptance and the attesting witnesses\u2019 oath, these requirements were entirely absent.\nThe sections of the Act which, on the particular point I am discussing, are controlling, are the 94th, 97th, 107th, and 314th. They are as follows:\u2014\n94. Any twenty-five\u2019 electors, except in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Yukon Territory, may nominate a candidate, or as many candidates as are required to be elected for the electoral district for which the election is held, by signing a nomination paper in form \u201cH,\u201d stating therein the name, residence and addition or description of each person proposed, in such manner as sufficiently to identify such candidate and by causing such nomination paper to be produced to the returning officer at the time and place indicated in the proclamation, or to be filed with the returning officer at any other place, and at any time between the date of the proclamation and the day of nomination. 97. The returning officer shall give to the candidate or his agent a receipt for such deposit which shall, in every case, be sufficient evidence of the production of the nomination paper, of the consent of the candidate and of the payment therein mentioned.\n107. On a poll being granted, the returning officer shall cause to be posted up notices of his having granted such poll, indicating the names, residences and occupations of the candidates nominated, in the order in which they are to be printed on the ballot papers.\n2. Except in the Yukon Territory, such notices shall, as soon as possible after the nomination, be placarded at all the places where the proclamation for the election was posted up.\n3. Such notices shall be in form \u201cK,\u201d except in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, where they shall be in form \u201cL.\u201d\n4. In Prince Edward Island, the returning officer shall, in addition to such notices, cause to be placarded at the same time and places such notice or advertisement regarding the qualification of voters as is required under the provincial law to be posted.\n314. No election shall be declared invalid by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of this Act as to the taking of the poll or the counting of the votes, or by reason of any want of qualification in the persons signing a nomination paper received by the returning officer under the provisions of this Act, or of any mistake in the use of the forms contained in schedule one of this Act, if it appears to the tribunal having cognizance of the question that the election was conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in this Act, and that such non-compliance or mistake did not affect the result of the election.\nThe contentions on the part of the petitioner (appellant) are: 1st. That section 94 is directory only and not imperative in its requirements, that the identification called for was for the satisfaction of the returning officer only, and that he knew well who the M. Guillaume Andr\u00e9 Fauteux really was and, therefore, that the statute was satisfied. 2ndly. That the receipt given by the returning officer for the $200 was conclusive, and that in any event, section 314 prohibited the election from being declared invalid by reason of the alleged non-compliance with the Act.\nIn construing the sections of such an important public Act as the one under consideration, I think that while we should be careful on the one hand not to allow merely technical or formal objections to prevail so as to defeat the manifest purpose and intention of the Act, on the other we should not attempt to re-write the Act or to strain the clear, precise language of its sections so as to render them innocuous.\nAs Lord Chief Justice Coleridge said in the case of Mather v. Brown[17], at page 601:\u2014\nIt must be remembered that, in dealing with cases under these Acts, we are sitting as a final tribunal of appeal, in the exercise of a duty cast upon us under peculiar circumstances and as a sort of compromise between conflicting parties in the legislature, and, therefore, are more especially bound to keep ourselves strictly within the letter of the Acts, and to abstain from any attempt to strain the law. Therefore, although I yield reluctantly to the objection, conceiving it to be a fair one, I do so without hesitation.\nIn a later case, Gothard v. Clarke[18], at page 265, Lopes J. says, line 8:\u2014\nI entirely agree with the Lord Chief Justice when he said in Mather v. Brown(1), that in construing these Acts it is a duty with which the court is entrusted to keep strictly to the Acts themselves.\nNow, applying these rules and principles to the section 94 under consideration, how can this court say that any 25 electors may legally nominate a candidate for an electoral district by signing a nomination paper in form \u201cH,\u201d while omitting to state the name, residence and addition or description of the person they nominate in such manner as sufficiently to identify such candidate.\nThe essential conditions of a legal nomination paper are the signatures of 25 electors as nominators, and the name, residence and addition or description of the person proposed \u201cstated therein.\u201d\nThe court certainly could not declare valid a nomination paper with only 24 electors\u2019 names attached. If the name of the candidate was incorrectly spelled, or there was some inaccuracy in the residence and addition or description of the person nominated, there might be much room for argument that the language used was sufficient to identify the candidate. The result would depend altogether upon the extent of the inaccuracy of the language used.\nBut where there is no inaccuracy of language or spelling to construe or give effect to, but a total omission of any residence, addition or description, and this omission extends as well to the acceptance of the nomination and to the oath of attestation of the witness to the signature to the nomination paper, so that, on the face of the papers as delivered, there was absolutely nothing to identify the person nominated, I cannot see how the court can hold such paper a legal nomination paper. It does not \u201cstate therein\u201d any of the statutory requisites, and it seems to me, with deference, that to construe such language as directory merely would be to do violence to the expressed intention of the legislature. As well might the court declare that less than 25 nominators\u2019 names would suffice or that a paper signed in blank with the name subsequently filled up was good. The \u201cname\u201d may not require the insertion of each and all of the nominee\u2019s Christian names in full, but at least there must be a surname and such Christian name or abbreviation as would sufficiently identify the party nominated.\nThen as to the receipt. If the nomination is bad the receipt certainly cannot cure it. The nomination paper must stand on its intrinsic merits and the receipt is good just for what the statute says, sufficient evidence of the production of the nomination paper, of the consent of the candidate, and of the payment therein mentioned.\nEvidence of the production of the nomination paper, not of its validity. If it was the latter, then it would cure the cardinal defect of want of the proper number of nominators.\nThe importance of the language requiring the name, residence and addition or description of the candidates is seen by the 107th section, which requires the returning officer on a poll being granted to post up notices\nindicating the names, residences and occupations of the candidates.\nIf the nomination paper does not itself give him this essential information, where else can he acquire it? In many small constituencies it is said the candidates are well known. That may be true, but this Act relates to constituencies all over Canada and it is reasonablely certain that no such assumption could be made with respect to the returning officers in many of the larger thinly populated districts.\nThe returning officer is not authorized to hold any court of inquiry so as to ascertain the identity and the residence and occupation of the candidate. But he is bound to give that information to the electors in the notices he puts up of his having granted a poll. He must find the information on the face of the nomination paper, and to allow him to go outside of such paper and obtain information elsewhere might lead to much gross injustice and defeat the express purpose of the Act that the identical candidate proposed by the 25 electors and no one else shall be published as the candidate.\nThe defect in these nomination papers is one apparent on their face, and not one requiring any inquiry or investigation on the part of the returning officer to ascertain or determine. Being a patent and substantial defect in the omission of a specific statutory requirement it became the duty of the returning officer, when at the proper time his attention was called to it, to give effect to the objection and reject the nomination.\nThen with reference to section 314, a most useful section to prevent mere technicalities defeating the expressed will of the electors, the only possible part of the section which could be invoked in this case is that referring to \u201ca mistake in the use of the forms.\u201d\nBut those defects complained of in this nomination paper are in no possible sense mistakes in the use of the forms. The proper form was used. But the essentials necessary to make the form a living and valid nomination paper were wanting.\nThe decisions in the English courts which I have consulted are chiefly upon statutes relating to municipal elections. They are, nevertheless, of value because they cover analogous cases to the one we have now before us and outline principles which should control courts in deciding upon statutes relating to elections and the distinction between matters of form and those of substance. Mather v. Brown[19]; Gothard v. Clarke[20]; Harmon v. Park[21]; Marton v. Gorrill[22]; The Queen v. Deighton[23].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The first duty of a returning officer, on receipt of a nomination paper, is to inspect it and ascertain if it appears to be conformable to law, and if found defective to point out wherein he finds it so; and then if duly rectified, or if originally in appearance correct, to require, pursuant to section 99 of the \u201cDominion Elections Act,\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 6,) the person or persons presenting it to take before him the oath or oaths of verification required by said section. When that has been duly done and deposit made, his next duty is to give, in obedience to section 97, a receipt for the deposit, which is the assurance the law gives the parties promoting the candidature of any person, that he has been duly and properly nominated.\nThis section is so comprehensive and complete in its terms that it is, for me, difficult to see how any one who has accepted the office of returning officer, desiring to discharge his duties with fairness to all concerned, could, after complying with its imperative direction, see his way to attempt a revocation of his act.\nThe section is as follows:\u2014\n97. The returning officer shall give to the candidate or his agent a receipt for such deposit which shall, in every case, be sufficient evidence of the production of the nomination paper, of the consent of the candidate and of the payment therein mentioned.\nThe officer in question herein did point out certain defects, had them rectified in his presence, and then administered the oath of verification to the agent who had presented the paper or papers.\nThe signatures of the alleged electors appear on two sheets of paper which, if joined together in an orderly way as the act of the officer in administering the oath implies to have been done, and the contents of that oath naming the several parties who had signed, clearly demonstrates was intended to be the case, ought to have sufficed for the purpose then in hand. At its best the mode of joining was slovenly. A pin or fastening of some kind to keep these sheets together in their proper order of sequence would have saved a world of trouble.\nWhen separated these papers were misleading.\nThe evidence of how this separation happened is conflicting, but the officer\u2019s acts and their consequence, I submit, must be passed upon in light of the transaction as it must have appeared to him when he administered the oath, and not by weighing this conflict of evidence arising later and elsewhere.\nIt is to be noted that the Act provides for the presentation of a nomination paper at any time between the date of proclamation and the day of nomination.\nUnless the determination of the officer, as evidenced by the receipt for the deposit, is treated as irrevocable, so far as he is concerned, the door would be thrown open for frauds, and worse results than any I can conceive of as possible from holding such determination as irrevocable.\nI am much more puzzled as to the proper disposition of the question of costs than I am by the merits of the case.\nThe appeal, I submit, should be allowed with costs thereof to the appellant against respondents, and the election be set aside; and, as at least a deterrent against such slovenly work hereafter, I think the several parties should be allowed to bear their respective costs of the proceedings in the court below. I confess I fear this division of costs may encourage the late taking of such objections as were taken here. The temptation appellant\u2019s slovenly work held out was no doubt great. But for the view taken by the learned judges in the court below, I should have been disposed to order the returning officer to pay all costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the judgment under review cannot be sustained. For the purposes of this judgment I shall assume that the nomination paper is (on one or both of the grounds upon which the respondent\u2019s objections rest) defective in some essential requirement of the statute so that if a poll had been held and the appellant had been returned on account of receiving the larger number of votes (and the question had come before an election court in a proper proceeding under the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d) the respondent (the now sitting member) must on account of the invalidity of the appellant\u2019s nomination have been declared entitled to the seat. The very short ground on Which I think the return of Mr. Ethier ought to be declared null is this: The returning officer having received the paper professing to nominate the appellant along with the appellant\u2019s consent and the sum required by law to be deposited, and having given his receipt for that sum pursuant to section 97 of the \u201cDominion Elections Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 6)\u2014and the time for nominating candidates having expired\u2014 the status of the appellant as a candidate (for the purpose of all proceedings under the control of the returning officer) was finally determined and it was the duty of that official to proceed with the poll. For the sake of clearness and convenience of reference I set out here in full the enactments of the \u201cDominion Elections Act\u201d which are comprised in the fasciculus bearing the title \u201cNomination Papers\u201d (sections 94 to 103 inclusive).\n94. Any twenty-five electors, except in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Yukon Territory, may nominate a candidate, or as many candidates as are required to be elected for the electoral district for which the election is held, by signing a nomination paper in form \u201cH,\u201d stating therein the name, residence and addition or description of each person proposed, in such manner as sufficiently to identify such candidate and by causing such nomination paper to be produced to the returning officer at the time and place indicated in the proclamation, or to be filed with the returning officer at any other place, and at any time between the date of the proclamation and the day of nomination.\n95. Each candidate shall be nominated by a separate nomination paper; but the same electors, or any of them, may subscribe as many nomination papers as there are members to be elected.\n96. No nomination paper shall be valid or acted upon by the returning officer unless it is accompanied by,\u2014\n(\u0430) The consent in writing of the person therein nominated, except where such person is absent from the province in which the election is to be held, when such absence shall be stated in the nomination paper; and\n(b) a deposit of two hundred dollars in legal tender or in the bills of any chartered bank doing business in Canada; or a cheque for that amount drawn upon and accepted by such bank.\n97. The returning officer shall give to the candidate or his agent a receipt for such deposit which shall, in every case, be sufficient evidence of the production of the nomination paper, of the consent of the candidate and of the payment therein mentioned.\n98. The sum so deposited by any candidate shall be returned to him in the event of his being elected or of his obtaining a number of votes at least equal to one-half the number of votes polled in favour of the candidate elected; otherwise, except in the case hereinafter provided for, it shall belong to His Majesty for the public uses of Canada, and shall be applied by the returning officer towards the payment of the election expenses, and an account thereof shall be rendered by him to the Auditor-General of Canada.\n2. The sum so deposited shall, in case of the death of any candidate after being nominated and before the closing of the poll, be returned to the personal representatives of such candidate.\n99. The returning officer shall require the person, or one or more of the persons producing or filing as aforesaid any such nomination paper, to make oath before him that he knows or they know that,\u2014 (a) The several persons who have signed such nomination paper are electors duly entitled to vote;\n(b) they have signed it in his or their presence; and\n(c) the consent of the candidate was signed in his or their presence, or as the case may be, that the person named as candidate is absent from the province or territory.\n2. Such oath may be in form \u201cI,\u201d and the fact of its having been taken shall be stated on the back of the nomination paper.\n100. At the close of the time for nominating the candidates, the returning officer shall deliver to every candidate or agent of a candidate applying therefor a duly certified list of the names of the several candidates who have been nominated.\n101. Any votes given at the election for any other candidates than those nominated in the manner provided by this Act shall be null and void.\n102. Whenever only one candidate, or only such a number of candidates as are required by law to be elected to represent the electoral district for which the election is held, have been nominated within the time fixed for that purpose, the returning officer shall forthwith make his return to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, in form \u201cJ,\u201d that such candidate or candidates, as the case may be, is or are duly elected for the said electoral district, of which return he shall send within forty-eight hours a duplicate or certified copy to the person or persons elected.\n103. The returning officer shall accompany his return to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery with a report of his proceedings and of any nomination proposed and rejected for non-compliance with the requirements of this Act.\nThe \u201cElections Act\u201d does unquestionably contemplate the possibility of nominations being \u201cproposed and rejected for non-compliance with the requirements\u201d of the statute, since section 103 in express terms lays upon the returning officer the duty of making a report upon any such rejected nomination. But the Act does not seem to contemplate the rejection by the returning officer of a nomination paper (verified as required by section 99 and accompanied by the consent and the deposit provided for by section 96) which has been accepted by him and for which he has given a receipt in pursuance of section 97. Once that is done section 98 appears to come into play. The sum deposited is by the provisions of that section to be returned to the candidate only in one of three specified events: 1st, his election; 2nd, his obtaining a specified proportion of the votes cast; 3rd, his death after being nominated and before the closing of the poll. Otherwise the money deposited is to belong to His Majesty as part of the public funds of Canada. There is nothing to authorize the return of the money in the case in which after having signified his acceptance of the nomination paper by giving the receipt under section 97 the returning officer discovers some defect in it, which had previously escaped his observation. The enactments of section 98 are explicit, the money once deposited is to be the property of His Majesty except in one of the three events enumerated above. From this the inference seems irresistible that the returning officer\u2019s authority to reject the nomination paper for non-conformity with the statute is at an end upon the giving of the receipt; for it is inconceivable that the legislature should have conferred upon the returning officer authority to reject the nomination after receiving the deposit and in circumstances in which he is prohibited from returning the deposit. Even if this view of the effect of these proceedings were doubtful and it could fairly be argued that the status of the nominee as candidate is not fixed by them, it still seems hardly open to doubt that his status as such is (as regards the duties of the returning officer) irrevocably fixed when (his nomination having been accepted) the time for nominating candidates has closed. That is made very clear by the provisions of sections 100 and 102. \u201cAt the close of the time\u201d for nominating candidates the returning officer is, under the provisions of these sections, to deliver to \u201cany candidate\u201d applying therefor, a list of the names of \u201cthe candidates who have been nominated.\u201d At that point of time\u2014\u201cat the close of the time for nominations\u201d\u2014if not before\u2014 the number and identity of the candidates are determined, a state of affairs obviously impossible if after that point of time is passed the returning officer has authority to reject a nomination already accepted. Section 102 again provides that when only \u201cone candidate\u201d has been \u201cnominated within the time fixed for that purpose,\u201d the returning officer shall \u201cforthwith\u201d make his return to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery that \u201csuch candidate\u201d has been duly elected; and by section 103 this return is to be accompanied by a report upon nominations\nproposed and rejected for non-compliance with the requirements of this Act.\nThis return and this report then are to be made \u201cforthwith\u201d on expiry of the time fixed for the purpose of nominating candidates; an enactment obviously proceeding upon the assumption that when that time has passed all questions touching the statutory sufficiency of nomination papers have been concluded in so far as it is within the province of the returning officer to deal with such questions.\nThe inference arising from the language of these sections receives support from that of section 124, which provides that if the number of candidates is greater than two the returning officer shall give effect to any agreement between them that their names shall be arranged on the ballot paper otherwise than in alphabetical order where such agreement is made \u201cwithin an hour after the time appointed for the nomination;\u201d a provision which presupposes all questions as to what persons are entitled to have their names placed upon the ballot papers to have been at the time mentioned finally determined.\nIt is argued, however, that the respondent must eventually have been returned since (the appellant\u2019s nomination being in point of law inoperative) the respondent was the only candidate for whom ballots could validly be cast; and consequently it is said the respondent has rightfully been elected. I assume, as I have already said, the appellant\u2019s nomination to have been invalid by reason of one or both of the objections raised by the respondent. On that hypothesis we are still, it seems to me, (if I am right in the view I have just expressed touching the powers of the returning officer,) under a necessity imposed upon us by law to declare that the respondent was not duly returned and that he is not under the law entitled to the seat. The jurisdiction conferred upon the courts by the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 7, is a very special one. At common law all questions touching the election and return of members to the House of Commons were questions exclusively within the cognizance of the House itself. By the \u201cControverted Elections Act\u201d the duty of passing upon certain of such questions, when raised by a proceeding authorized by the Act, was imposed upon the courts. But the duties and jurisdiction of the courts are strictly prescribed by the Act; and the Act, as it appears to me, leaves no other course open to us (if the returning officer exceeded his legal powers in returning the respondent as the elected member) but to declare that the return was not according to law. The powers vested in the court in such circumstances are to be gathered from two of the sections of the \u201cControverted Elections Act.\u201d These sections are as follows:\u2014\n11. The petition presented under this Act may be in any prescribed form; but, if or in so far as no form is prescribed, it need not be in any particular form, but it must complain of the undue election or return of a member or that no return has been made, or that a double return has been made, or of matter contained in any special return made, or of some such unlawful act as aforesaid by a candidate not returned, and it must be signed by the petitioner, or all the petitioners if there are more than one.\n58. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judges shall determine whether the member whose election or return is complained of or any and what other person was duly returned or elected, or whether the election was void, and other matters arising out of the petition, and requiring their determination, and shall, except in the case of appeal hereinafter mentioned, within four days after the expiration of eight days from the day on which they shall so have given their decision, certify in writing such determination to the Speaker, appending, thereto a copy of the notes of evidence.\n2. The determination thus certified shall be final to all intents and purposes.\nThe petition in this case complains of the undue election of the respondent and asks to have the return made by the returning officer declared a nullity. Under section 58 it was the duty of the trial judges to pass upon these questions and report to the Speaker accordingly. In the view I have expressed these questions are, of course, susceptible of only one answer.\nAnglin and Brodeur JJ. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

Eaton and Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1912: October 21, 22; 1912: October 29.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME OOURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAppeal\u2014Final judgment\u2014Reference.\nIn an action claiming rescission of a contract for the sale of timber lands and other equitable relief and, in the alternative, damages for deceit, the trial judge held that it was a case for damages only and gave judgment accordingly and referred to a referee matters arising out of a counterclaim ordering him also to take an account of moneys paid, an inquiry as to liens and incumbrances and as to the quantity of standing timber on the lands and other proper accounts. Further consideration of the cause was reserved. This judgment was affirmed by the full court and the defendants sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, that the action tried and determined was the common law action for deceit only; that the judgment given therein was not a final judgment within the meaning of that term in the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d; and that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Clarke v. Goodall (44 Can. S.C.R. 284), and Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner (44 Can. S.C.R. 616) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia maintaining the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs and dismissing the defendants\u2019 counterclaim.\nThe action claimed relief in equity and in law. The trial judge held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to equitable relief and dealing with the case as an action in damages for deceit gave judgment for the plaintiffs with a reference for inquiry as to the action and counterclaim and reserved further consideration of the cause. His judgment was affirmed by the full court and the defendants took an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nL. A. Currey K.C. for the appellants.\nT. S. Rogers K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The statement of claim in this action sets out certain agreements for the sale of timber lands and asks as relief rescission of the agreements, re-payment of moneys paid on account, a receiver and an injunction, and, in the alternative, damages for deceit. It is, therefore, framed both as an action in equity and an action at common law. The defence, besides denying the allegations as to misrepresentation, is united with a counterclaim in which the defendant asks for damages for breaches of the agreement with respect to the time within which the lumber was to be cut and for an injunction restraining the plaintiffs from continuing their wrongful acts. The counterclaim contained the usual common law counts to recover the price of goods sold and delivered, for work and labour done and for the values of a steam saw-mill, engine and boiler.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Meagher gave reasons for judgment in which he generally found in favour of the plaintiffs, but decided that it was not a case for rescission, but for damages, and the formal judgment of the court ordered, declared and decreed that the agreements in question had been obtained through fraudulent misrepresentations. He refused the remedy of rescission, but declared that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages, the amount thereof being reserved pending the report of the referee, and referred to the referee a number of matters referred to in the counterclaim above mentioned, and directed the referee to take an account of all moneys paid by the plaintiffs, an inquiry as to liens and incumbrances, an inquiry as to the quantity of timber standing upon the purchased premises within the meaning of the first agreement, such other accounts as the referee might deem proper, and also finally reserved further consideration of the cause.\nIt would appear, therefore, that the action which was tried, and for which relief was given, was the action for deceit, and it was, therefore, a common law action in which the judge, although determining generally on the question of fraudulent misrepresentation as between the parties did not attempt to assess the damages, but referred these and other matters to a referee and reserved to the court the final judgment which should be given after the referee had made his report.\nThe case, therefore, would seem to be entirely on all fours with Wenger v. Lamont[1]; Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[2]; and Clark v. Goodall[3]; and we are without jurisdiction on this branch of the case.\nWe are also of opinion that the appellant failed completedly to maintain his counterclaim and the appeal is dismissed as to that claim with costs, for the reasons given by the trial judge.\nDavies, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. concurred. Idington J.\u2014The individual respondents and the appellant Dunn entered into an agreement, dated the 10th of May, 1909. Then the corporation named The S. E. Dunn Company was created, apparently for the purpose of executing the purposes which the individual respondents had in effecting the first agreement.\nOn the 18th of January, 1910, an agreement was entered into between Dunn and the said corporation based upon what the first agreement had in view. This action was launched by the individual respondents and said corporation seeking to rescind said first agreement on the ground that it had been induced by fraud of Dunn, but, alternatively, asking for damages if rescission could not be had.\nThe appellant Dunn, by way of counterclaim, amongst other things asked for a declaration that the agreement of the eighteenth of January, 1910, was not his deed, was never delivered, and to have it set aside.\nThe learned trial judge could not see his way to rescind the first agreement, but found there had been fraud practised, and, with a view to giving relief in respect thereof, directed a reference embracing numerous inquiries.\nBy the same judgment he dismissed that part of the counterclaim which sought to have the agreement of the eighteenth of January, 1910, set aside.\nAn appeal was had by appellants herein to the full court, and a cross-appeal was taken by the present individual respondents, and that court dismissed these appeals.\nTherefrom the appellant brought this appeal seeking to have said judgment of reference set aside and to have the judgment reversed so far as it dismissed the counterclaim as to the part of it seeking to set aside the agreement of eighteenth o f January, 1910. No objection was taken by respondents to the jurisdiction of this court, but, upon its being observed in course of the argument, that it was an appeal involving chiefly the judgment of reference, attention of counsel was called thereto. Nothing urged in support of the jurisdiction save as to one part of the counterclaim can maintain it.\nThe cases of the Union Bank of Halifax v. Dickie[4]; Grown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[5]; and other cases rendered it hopeless to maintain that the judgment of reference was a final judgment within the meaning of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d\nThat part of the appeal should, therefore, be dismissed for want of jurisdiction with such costs as might have been given on a motion by the respondent at the proper time to quash the appeal.\nThat part of the judgment dismissing the part of the counterclaim impeaching the agreement of the 18th of January, 1910, is, of course, final and properly appealable, but the evidence given on the trial of the issues raised thereby renders the appeal therefrom apparently hopeless and it should be dismissed with such costs of and incidental to the appeal as would be properly taxable had the appeal been confined to that part of the counterclaim alone.\nDuff J.\u2014The trial judge held that the first of the two agreements was procured by means of representations which were false and which were fraudulent in the sense that they were made recklessly and without care whether they were true or untrue. This finding was affirmed by the full court and it cannot be said that there is not evidence to support it. On this ground I should dismiss the appeal with costs. I express no opinion on the question of jurisdiction because it was not argued and I am by no means satisfied that the facts of the case bring it within the principles upon which this court acted in Wenger v. Lamont[6]; Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[7], and Clarke V. Goodall[8].\nAppeal from judgment in action quashed with costs. Appeal from judgment on counterclaim dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H. W. Sangster.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. M. Ferguson.\n[1] 41 Can. S.C.R. 603.\n[2] 44. Can.

On appeal from the judgment dismissing the motions,\nHeld, that the judgment in question was not appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of section 64 of the \u201cDominion Controverted Elections Act.\u201d L\u2019Assomption Election Case (14 Can.

The judgment appealed from was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cCimon J.\u2014La cour, ayant entendu les parties par leurs avocats sur la motion du p\u00e9titionnaire pour faire prolonger le d\u00e9lai pour commencer l\u2019instruction de la p\u00e9tition d\u2019\u00e9lection en cette cause, examin\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure et d\u00e9lib\u00e8r\u00e9:\u2014\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019accorder la pr\u00e9sente motion, car les raisons invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appui ne sont pas suffisantes pour la justifier, rejette la dite motion avec d\u00e9pens.\n\u201cLa cour, ayant entendu les parties par leurs avocats sur la motion du p\u00e9titionnaire aux fins de faire fixer un lieu, un jour et une heure pour preuve et audition sur ce qui reste des objections pr\u00e9liminaires du d\u00e9fendeur, examin\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure et d\u00e9lib\u00e8r\u00e9:\u2014\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que les six mois fix\u00e9s par la loi pour commencer le proc\u00e8s sur le m\u00e9rite de la p\u00e9tition d\u2019\u00e9lection expirent demain:\u2014\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que ce d\u00e9lai de six mois n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9: et consid\u00e9rant que ce d\u00e9lai de six mois n\u2019\u00e9tant pas prolong\u00e9, il deviendrait inutile de fixer Un jour pour la production de la preuve sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires, qui ne pourrait \u00eatre qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de six mois alors que la cour n\u2019aurait plus de juridiction, met de c\u00f4t\u00e9, pour le moment, la pr\u00e9sente motion, sauf \u00e0 la reprendre si le d\u00e9lai pour le commencement du proc\u00e8s venait d\u2019\u00eatre prolong\u00e9.\u201d\nT. J. Flynn K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Lapointe K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, at Fraserville, District of Kamouraska, dismissing two motions made on behalf of the petitioner; (a) to obtain an enlargement of the delay for the commencement of the trial, (b) to fix a day for proof and hearing on certain preliminary objections then undisposed of.\nWe were asked by the appellant\u2019s counsel to decide in limine the question of jurisdiction raised in the respondent\u2019s factum so as to avoid, if that point was decided against him, the necessity of a lengthy argument on the merits of the motions. I was of opinion at the hearing that we were without jurisdiction and in this opinion I am confirmed by subsequent examination of the authorities. Among a host of others I refer to the L\u2019Assomption Election Case[1], in which Strong J. said, at page 432:\u2014\nNothing can be clearer than that appeals in controverted elections are limited to two matters only, viz.: First, an appeal from any decision, rule or order on preliminary objections to an election petition the allowing of which is final and conclusive and puts an end to the petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final and conclusive and have put an end to the petition; and, secondly, an appeal from the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried the petition. As the appeal is now presented, it is quite clear that it does not fall under either of these heads, and, consequently, this court has no jurisdiction.\nSee to the same effect the King\u2019s County (N.S.) Election Case[2], and the Gloucester Election Case[3]. In the Halifax Election Case[4], Sir Louis Davies, speaking for the court, said, at page 404:\u2014\ni do not think it is open to serious argument that every decision given by the trial judges, either before or during the progress of the trial, is at once and before the end of the trial appealable. Such a conclusion would defeat the object of the statute absolutely and make election trials a farce.\nWe may, therefore, safely say that it is now well settled by authority that this court is not competent to hear this appeal. If we were to hold that we are competent to hear an appeal in an intermediate proceeding like this appeals would be repeated in all election trials to the great oppression of the parties and to the injury of the public which demands that election trials should be speedily disposed of.\nOf course we express no opinion on the merits.\nThe appeal is quashed for want of jurisdiction, costs to be taxed by the registrar as if motion made in accordance with rule.\nDavies J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014Unless we reverse the view taken of this statute in a long line of decisions in this court, this appeal must be dismissed with costs for the reason that we have no jurisdiction to interfere with the order appealed from.\nDuff J.\u2014It has been pointed out time and again that the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of controverted elections is a very special jurisdiction and is strictly limited by the terms of the \u201cControverted Elections Act.\u201d Section 64 of that Act defines the jurisdiction of this court. There is obviously no jurisdiction under sub-section (b). Under sub-section (a) an appeal lies only from a\njudgment, rule, order or decision on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it has been allowed would have that effect. The order sought to be impugned in the present proceedings is expressed in these terms:\u2014\nMet de cot\u00e9 pour le moment la pr\u00e9sente motion sauf \u00e0 la reprendre si le d\u00e9lai pour le commencement du proc\u00e8s venait d\u2019\u00eatre prolong\u00e9.\nThis is clearly not a \u201cjudgment, rule, order or decision\u201d on a preliminary objection within the meaning of the provision quoted above. Consequently no appeal lies from it.\nAnglin and Brodeur JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. J. Flynn.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lapointe & Stein.\n[1] 14 Can. S.C.R. 429.\n[2] 8 Can. S.C.R. 192.\n[3] 8 Can. S.C.R. 204.\n[4] 39 Can. S.C.R. 401.\n"}

The plaintiffs recovered at the trial, the jury\u2019s findings being all in their favour, among them being findings that the breaches as to encumbrance and the railway were waived. On the trial the defendants abandoned the charge of arson and failed to prove fraud and misrepresentation. The verdict against them was set aside by the full court on grounds of defective proofs, failure to arbitrate before action, breach of warranty as to the railway and breach of condition against encumbrances on the lumber. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHazen K.C. and F. R. Taylor for the appellants. The court below was wrong in holding that there was a breach of the arbitration clause. As defendants denied all liability there was nothing to arbitrate. Margeson v. Guardian Fire and Life Assurance Co.[1]; Morrow v. Lancashire Ins. Co.[2].\nThe defendants are estopped by their actions from objecting to the proofs of loss as informal. Western Assur. Co. v. Doull[3].\nThe International Railway, being only in course of construction, was not a railway within the meaning of the policy. See McGillivray on Insurance, 295; Wing v. Harvey[4], at page 270.\nIf it were the company, through their agents, had full knowledge of its existence and location when they issued the policy and the finding of the jury must stand. See Crozier v. Phoenix Ins. Co.[5].\nThe security given to the bank was not a chattel mortgage and, therefore, not within the condition as to encumbrances. See Hazzard v. Canada Agricultural Ins. Co.[6].\nTeed K.C. and J. E. A. L. Fairweather for the respondents. The insurance brokers who examined the property were not our agents and the knowledge they obtained as to the railway cannot be imputed to the defendants.

Taylor for the appellants.\nTeed K.C. and J. E. A. L. Fairweather for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside a verdict entered for the plaintiffs, appellants, and directing a verdict to be entered for the defendant company, respondent.\nThe action was one brought to recover the amount insured by the respondents upon a quantity of sawn lumber of the appellants piled in their lumber yard in or near the Town of Campbellton, N.B. A great many questions were submitted by the trial judge to the jury and nearly all were answered by them in the plaintiffs\u2019 favour resulting in a verdict being entered by the trial judge for them for $3,875, the full amount claimed.\nThe reasons given by the Supreme Court for setting side the verdict and directing judgment to be entered for the defendants are set forth by Chief Justice Barker with great clearness and fullness, and were rested upon four distinct grounds.\n1. That there was a breach of warranty as to railway track.\n2. Non-compliance with the arbitration or appraisement clause.\n3. Non-compliance with several conditions precedent in the proofs of loss.\n4. That the policy was voided by the security given to the bank on August 15th.\nMr. Justice White, who concurred in the judgment appealed from, expressly refrained from giving any opinion as to the sufficiency of the proofs of loss or as to the questions of waiver and estoppel in respect to the same.\nAs I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must be dismissed upon the ground that there was a breach of warranty as to the railway track, it will not be necessary for me to touch upon or express any opinion upon any of the other points relied upon by the court below for its judgment.\nThey were argued before us at great length and the respective contentions of the contesting parties as to non-compliance with the conditions of the policy and the waiver by the insurance company of compliance with such conditions and as to estoppel and alleged over-insurance and as to the effect of the statutory security given to the bank on the lumber, were presented to us very fully.\nThe property insured, the amount, and certain special conditions of the risk are described in the following passage, which was typewritten, taken from the face of the policy:\u2014\nFour Thousand Dollars.\nOn sawn lumber, piled and lying on northwest of Tobique Road, in the Town of Campbellton, N.B.\nOther concurrent insurance permitted without notice until requested.\nLoss, if any, payable to La Banque Nationale.\nSubject to conditions of average hereto annexed.\nIt is warranted by the assured in accepting this policy that a clear space of 300 feet shall be maintained between the lumber hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest, any steam or water-power saw-mill, planing mill or other special hazard, and that no railway passes through the lot on which said lumber is piled, or within 200 feet.\nIt was admitted at the argument that the track of the International Railway was within the prohibited distance when the policy was issued and when the loss occurred, in fact that the jury so found in one of their answers. The jury also found that the insurance company\nhad either by itself or its duly authorized agent waived performance of the conditions of the policy (e) in regard to there being a railway running through the yard where the lumber was piled; that an agent of the company had inspected the plaintiff\u2019s lumber yard immediately before and as a preliminary to the placing of the insurance upon the lumber piled therein; that the company or its agents were aware at the time of insuring the lumber that it was within one hundred feet of the railway,\nand that the railway was not open for \u201cgeneral business\u201d before the lumber was destroyed by the fire.\nThe contention put forward by the plaintiffs in their pleadings and at the trial was that the word \u201crailway\u201d in the warranty necessarily means only a completed railway authorized to be operated for general public traffic, and does not include such a railway as the International Railway here in question which was at the time of the issuance of the policy and also when the fire occurred a railway in course of construction only, and not open for general public traffic. I cannot accept this contention. Although the International Railway Company only began to operate with respect to general public traffic a short time after the fire, it had been in operation for all construction purposes and for freight traffic for some length of time before the policy issued.\nThe evidence is clear and was not questioned that this International Railway was so far completed and operated past this lumber yard as to carry freight and that as a fact all the lumber in the plaintiffs lumber yard covered by the policy sued on had been hauled over this railway from plaintiffs\u2019 mills to the yard, a distance of some 12 or 15 miles. It also appeared that large quantities of lumber sold by the plaintiffs to their customers were carried by this railway from the plaintiffs\u2019 mill past the lumber yard to Campbellton and to the wharf for shipment and elsewhere, and that this had been going on, if not after the policy issued, at any rate up to within a very short time before it issued. The issues submitted for trial and actually tried did not render necessary any proof of the actual running of trains along the railway past the lumber yard during the time the policy was in existence and neither party offered any evidence on that point.\nThe only inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the operation of the railway for the purposes of freight traffic was under legal authority. It was not suggested by any one that the railway had been illegally operated as regards freight traffic, and we cannot assume that to have been the case. Mr. Hazen\u2019s further submission, however, on this branch of the case was first, that there was sufficient evidence to justify the findings by the jury above referred to as to the waiver by the defendants of the condition or warranty in the policy that \u201cno railway passed through the lot on which the lumber was piled, or within 200 feet,\u201d and as to their knowledge when issuing the policy of the existence of this railway; and secondly, that no specific evidence of the actual running of trains along this railway from the time of the issuance of the policy had been given.\nOn the question of the alleged knowledge of the company of the existence of this railway and of their waiver of the warranty in the policy, I am of the opinion that there was no evidence whatever to justify the findings of the jury.\nThese could only be upheld on the ground that Frink and Shannon were the agents of the company when the policy issued and that the knowledge they may have obtained from such an inspection of the premises as they made must be imputed to the defendants, their principals, or if only one of them should be held to be such agent, that his knowledge should be so imputed.\nI agree with Chief Justice Barker in his conclusion after reviewing the evidence on this point, that there was nothing to sustain the contention that \u201cFrink acted or was in fact the defendants\u2019 agent.\u201d As he says, \u201cthe evidence was all the other way. Neither he nor Shannon had any connection direct or indirect that I can see with the defendants. To attempt under such circumstances to fix the defendants with knowledge of facts which they had as in any way affecting this insurance seems to me altogether useless.\u201d Moreover, there is no evidence that either of them had any knowledge that the railway had been operated for any purpose.\nBut even if the findings of the jury could be sustained of the company\u2019s agents having knowledge of the existence of this railway within the lumber yard, I cannot see how such knowledge on their part could avail to overcome, either on the ground of estoppel or waiver, the express warranty which the company chose to require from plaintiffs as a condition of their insurance contract attaching. There is nothing whatever to indicate that either Frink or Shannon had communicated any information respecting the existence of this railway or its relation to the lumber yard to the defendant company.\nI see no essential element of estoppel present in the facts as proved, and I cannot see how the doctrine of waiver can be applied to an express warranty written in the body of the policy and forming part of the contract.\nThe plaintiffs must be assumed to have read their policy and if they did not read it cannot plead their ignorance of the existence of the warranties on which it is expresssly issued as an answer to evidence of their breach. I understand waiver to mean something said or done, some agreement made or assumed to have been made, subsequent to the condition or warranty, whereby the performance or observance of the condition or warranty need not be carried out, made nor proved.\nBut that is not the case here. Nothing of the kind is alleged respecting, this warranty and if there was any question of its waiver there is nothing to shew that the waiver was in writing and attached to the policy as required by its conditions.\nAs to the suggestion or argument not presented in the pleading nor in the appellants\u2019 factum, but advanced here by Mr. Hazen, that because evidence was not given of the actual running of trains over the railway past the lumber yard during the period covered by the policy, therefore there was no breach of the warranty proved, I am unable to accept it.\nThe warranty was that no railway passed through the lot on which the lumber was piled. The company pleaded this warranty and alleged that the International Railway ran through the lot. The plaintiffs rejoined that when the policy was written and the loss occurred, the said railway was not completed and was not a railway within the meaning of the policy. That was the issue and the evidence admittedly shewed that such a railway did de facto exist, and had carried all the lumber insured from the plaintiffs\u2019 mills to the lumber yard, and other lumber of the plaintiffs from the mills and the lumber yard to Campbellton, and to the wharf and other places. If the plaintiffs had shewn that neither construction nor freight trains had been run past the lumber yard during the currency of the policy, they might have been in a position at least to argue that the railway had ceased to continue as such within the meaning of the policy.\nThe warranty was not that no train would pass along the railway during the continuance of the policy, but that no railway passed through the lumber yard. When it was proved that a railway did de facto so pass, and that construction and freight trains were in the habit of passing over it and that the very lumber insured had been then recently carried by such trains to the lumber yard, and other lumber of plaintiffs to their purchasers past the yard, it seems to me the fact of a railway being there was sufficiently shewn.\nIt could hardly be said to be arguable that a railway in process of construction, over which construction trains were passing, and which had authority to carry freight and had exercised for a long time that authority, was not a railway within the meaning of such a warranty as that contained in this policy. If the plaintiffs in this case under the issues of fact joined desired to shew that although it had been a railway it had ceased to be one, either because it had been abandoned, or because the company had stopped running trains over this part of the tracks either for construction purposes or for carrying freight or for any other purpose, it was their duty to have given some evidence of the facts. A railway running trains for construction purposes or for carrying freight was as much a railway within the meaning of the term used in the warranty as one having statutory authority to operate for all purposes. The risks against which the warranty was obviously inserted to guard existed as much in the one case as the other.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants sued on a fire insurance policy wherein appeared in the typewritten particulars thereof, amongst other things, the following:\nIt is warranted by the assured in accepting this policy that a clear space of three hundred feet shall be maintained between the lumber hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest, any steam or waterpower saw-mill, planing mill or other special hazard; and that no railway passes through the lot on which said lumber is piled, or within 200 feet. The verdict obtained was set aside on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on the ground, amongst others, that there was a breach of this warranty (which was not observed by the assured, and indeed was broken as soon as made), and thus the right of recovery defeated.\nThe lumber in fact was piled on a lot within the prohibited two hundred feet from a railway.\nThis railway had been constructed for twenty miles or more and ran past the place where the lumber in question was piled, but the railway company had not been given the authority of the Railway Commission to run passenger cars and do general business.\nIt was contended we must, therefore, hold that it was not a railway within the meaning of the words in said warranty.\nIt had been in use not only for construction purposes, but also for carrying freight, and amongst other freight had carried for appellants this very lumber now in question, and a great deal more.\nHaving regard to the manifest purpose of such a condition as this warranty in an insurance policy, it seems impossible to read it in the restricted sense asked by the appellants.\nThe contention that the respondent knew all this has no evidence to support it. The brokers who induced appellants to apply to the respondent for insurance were neither in fact its agents nor held out in any way by it to give them the appearance of agents for it and thus to lead people to believe them such.\nThe objection thus raised, therefore, seems fatal to recovery herein.\nNo good purpose can be served so far as I can see by deciding here the validity or invalidity of the several other objections taken. I may, however, be permitted to observe that some, if not all, of them might by according due weight to some cases cited by appellants, have been overcome had there been in force in New Brunswick legislation dealing with conditions in or upon insurance policies similar to what has existed in Ontario for a great many years and also for some time past in some if not all of the Western provinces.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014On the ground stated in the judgment of my brother Idington I think this appeal should be dismissed. It is strictly unnecessary to discuss any of the other grounds upon which the respondent company supported the judgment of the court below, but one point is relied upon to which, I think, it is right to refer. The policy contained the following clause:\u2014\nThis entire policy, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed hereon, or added hereto, shall be void if the insured * * * or if the subject of insurance be personal property and be or become encumbered by a chattel mortgage * * * or if any change other than by the death of an insured take place in the interest, title, or possession of the subject of insurance.\nOn the 15th August, 1910, after the risk attached, the appellants gave La Banque Nationale security for loans amounting to $29,133.15 upon part of the personal property which was the subject of the risk under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d It is argued that in consequence of giving this security \u201cthe subject of insurance\u201d became \u201cencumbered by a chattel mortgage.\u201d The proposition upon which the contention rests is, of course, that a security taken by a bank under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d is a chattel mortgage within the clause above quoted. I cannot agree with this contention. It is not necessary to say whether or not a security taken under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d has such legal effect and such legal incidents as would technically justify one in describing it as a mortgage. The term \u201cchattel mortgage\u201d is a term of common use in those provinces in which the legal system is based upon the law of England. In most, if not all, of those provinces the class of instruments understood to be designated by that term is eo nomine the subject of legislation; and that legislation has, of course, nothing whatever to do with securities of the description in question. In the \u201cBank Act\u201d itself such securities are nowhere alluded to as \u201cchattel mortgages,\u201d and in common speech, whether of lawyers or laymen, that term would not be taken to comprehend such securities and I do not think any legal draftsman would regard \u201cchattel mortgage\u201d as an apt term for the purpose of designating them. As the phrase does not necessarily include such a security it seems to follow in accordance with the general rule governing the construction of insurance policies that the insurance company must submit to that construction which accords with the common understanding of the words employed and which is most favourable to the insured. There is here, of course, no suggestion of a controlling context.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies in so far as it is based on the ground that the proximity of the International Railway to the plaintiffs\u2019 lumber yard constituted a breach of warranty and on the absence of any evidence that either Mr. Frink or Mr. Shannon was an agent of the defendant company. Beyond this I wish not to express an opinion, which is unnecessary to the decision of this appeal, on the questions of waiver and estoppel discussed in my learned brother\u2019s notes.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed.\nIt was the duty of the appellants when they received their policy to examine it and see whether the contract as expressed therein was acceptable or not.\nThere was in the main body of the policy a typewritten clause to the effect that the insured warranted that no railway was passing within 200 feet of the lumber insured.\nAs it has been decided by this court in the case of The Provident Savings Life Assurance Society of New York v. Mowat[11], the insured or his agent had opportunity to examine the policy and he cannot now be heard to say that it did not contain the terms of the contract agreed upon and that the warranty stipulated was of no effect.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: F.

This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The Master then made his report which, on appeal to the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was varied by reduction of the amount awarded. The Chancellor then pronounced a formal judgment on further directions in favour of the plaintiff for the damages as reduced. The defendants appealed from the judgments of the Chief Justice and the Chancellor and the two appeals were, by order, heard together, but not formally consolidated. Both judgments were affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the defendants sought to appeal from the judgment affirming them and also from the original judgment sustaining the decision at the trial, having applied without success to the court below for an extension of time to appeal from the latter judgment. See Nelles v. Hesseltine (27 Ont. L.R. 97).\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the only judgment from which an appeal would lie was that affirming the judgment of the Chancellor on further directions; that the Chancellor could not review the original judgment of the Court of Appeal nor that varying the Master\u2019s report and the Court of Appeal was equally unable to review them on the appeal from the Chancellor\u2019s decision, and the Supreme Court being required by statute to give the judgment that the Court of Appeal should have given was likewise debarred from reviewing these earlier decisions. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThough the appeal was decided on the merits it was argued on a question of jurisdiction only, the appellants contending that though the appeal was from a judgment on further directions, the court could review earlier judgments in the cause. The facts are fully stated in the above head-note.\nNesbitt K.C. and Matthew Wilson K.C. for the appellants. All the judgments can be reviewed on this appeal. See Roblee v. Rankin[1]; North Eastern Banking Co. v. Royal Trust Co.[2]; In re Boyd[3].\nHolman K.C. for the respondents referred to Clarke v. Goodall[4]; Shaw v. St. Louis[5]; The Queen v. Clark[6]; Desaulniers v. Payette[7].\nDAVIES J. agreed with Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I do not think this court was constituted as counsel urges for the purpose of reviewing upon appeal all that had transpired in any cause in the courts below, but only such possible causes of error as might be found to exist in a final judgment of the court of last resort in any of the several jurisdictions from which appeal here is given.\nIf, by the law of the jurisdiction in question, such a power of review existed in the appellate court of final resort therein, then in order that we should give effect to the meaning of section 51 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d we could review what was reviewable by that appellate court.\nThat not being what appellants claim or admit they are here for, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with Anglin J. One question and one only arises and that is: Are we, in passing upon the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal given in the appeal to that court from the judgment of the Chancellor on the hearing of the action * * * on further directions, bound by the judgments, first of the trial judge, and secondly of the Court of Appeal itself on the appeal from the judgment pronounced by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas on the motion to vary the Master\u2019s report? That the Court of Appeal in determining the appeal from the Chancellor was bound by the Master\u2019s report as varied by Meredith C.J., or by itself, on appeal from Meredith C.J., as well as by the judgment of the trial judge, nobody having a competent knowledge of the practice governing such proceedings can entertain a doubt; and, (the duty of this court being to give the judgment which ought to have been pronounced in the court below,) we are governed, of course, on this appeal by the same principles of law, both substantive and adjective, as the Court of Appeal was. The fact that the appeals from the Chancellor and Meredith C.J. were heard by the Court of Appeal together does not affect the matter in the slightest.\nANGLIN J.\u2014A judgment determining the liability of the defendant company was pronounced by the trial judge on the 16th of March, 1907, and was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario on the 21st of April, 1908. Under these judgments a reference took place before the Master at Windsor to ascertain the amount to which the plaintiffs were entitled by way of damages for breach of the defendants\u2019 agreement to transfer certain bonds and shares of stock. The Master made his report on the 7th of April, 1909. The defendants appealed from the report and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, on the 23rd of January, 1911, varied it by reducing the sums awarded as damages. On the 1st of March, 1911, the Chancellor of Ontario pronounced a formal judgment on further directions awarding the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment for the damages allowed them by the Master\u2019s report as varied on appeal. The defendant company appealed to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and also from the judgment of the Chancellor. An order was made for the \u201cconsolidation\u201d of the two appeals and the printing of one appeal book in both. Though spoken of as a consolidation, this order in effect merely provided for the hearing of both appeals together. These appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the 28th of September, 1911, and from the judgments dismissing them the present appeal is brought. The appellants seek on this appeal to have this court review not merely the judgment of the Chancellor on further directions, but also the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas varying the report as to damages and the original judgment of the trial judge determining liability, affirmed on appeal as against the company by the Court of Appeal.\nAt an early stage of the present appeal in this court an application was made to the registrar to affirm its jurisdiction. On that application the appeals which had been taken to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and from the judgment of the Chancellor were treated as two distinct appeals. They had been entertained and disposed of as such by the Court of Appeal and not as consolidated in the technical sense, but merely as joined for convenience at the hearing and to save expense in printing. I have no doubt that they were rightly so dealt with and that the suggestion now made that there was a complete consolidation in the technical sense is ill founded. The mere hearing of the two appeals together would not, of course, enlarge the scope of the appeal from the judgment on further directions. The learned registrar determined that in so far as the appeal was from the judgment on further directions, this court had jurisdiction; that in so far as it was from the judgment affirming the order of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas varying the Master\u2019s report this court had not jurisdiction; and that in so far as it was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the original judgment determining the liability of the company no appeal would lie. On appeal the registrar\u2019s conclusions were affirmed by this court. On the argument counsel for the appellants then insisted, as he now insists, that the action, though in form equitable, was in substance and reality a common law action to recover damages for breach of contract, and the case was dealt with by the court on that footing. See Clarke v. Goodall[8].\nApplication for leave to appeal, or to extend the time for appealing to this court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the original judgment of the trial judge as against the company, was subsequently made to the late Chief Justice of Ontario, who refused it; and on appeal to the Court of Appeal his refusal was affirmed.\nThe appellants now seek, notwithstanding all that has taken place, to have this court review upon the present appeal, limited as it is to the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the judgment of the Chancellor on further directions, the question of the company\u2019s liability under the judgments of 1907 and of 1908 and also the question as to the amount of damages to which the plaintiffs are entitled under the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas affirmed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, from which it has already been held that no substantive appeal lies to this court.\nIt is quite clear that according to the practice of the courts of Ontario on the motion for further directions the learned Chancellor could not review the original judgment determining the company\u2019s liability; and it is equally clear that he could not have entertained anything in the nature of an appeal from the report of the Master as varied by the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The matters dealt with by those judgments were res judicat\u0153. He might, however, have considered the whole of the evidence both at the trial and before the Master and all the proceedings which had taken place for the purpose of adjudicating upon the question of costs. This latter fact explains the recital in the formal judgment of the Chancellor of the reading of the evidence and of all the proceedings. See Goodall v. Clarke[9]; Gould v. Burritt[10]; Downey v. Roaf[11]; McGill v. Courtice[12]. There is here no suggestion that the original judgment was improvidently pronounced or did not correctly express the intention of the court as in Kelly v. McKenzie[13]; Commercial Bank v. Graham[14], and Mitchell v. Strathy[15]; no contention that the report was improper or unsatisfactory in the sense which caused the court to refuse to act upon reports in Baldwin v. Crawford[16], and Taylor v. Craven[17], decisions which may also be ascribed to the undoubted jurisdiction over reserved costs. The learned Chancellor could not on the hearing on further directions take into consideration any matter which was in issue on the original hearing; Daniels\u2019 Ch. Pr. (7 ed.), p. 948; nor anything which was, or would properly have been, the subject of an appeal from the report, ibid., p. 946. Neither was it open to the Court of Appeal on the appeal from the judgment on further directions to do what the learned Chancellor might not have done. Our jurisdiction is statutory. By section 51 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d we are required to give the judgment which the court whose decision is appealed against should have given. In discharging that duty it is not within our power on an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal confirming a judgment on further directions to do anything which the judge who disposed of the motion on further directions in the first instance could not have done. We are, therefore, not in a position on the present appeal to review either the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the judgment of the trial judge determining the liability of the defendant company, or the later judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas varying the Master\u2019s report.\nIt was strongly pressed on behalf of the appellants that unless these two judgments are open to review on the present appeal from the only final judgment which has been rendered in this action, they are denied any effective recourse to this court. No doubt that is the case, due to the fact that a course of procedure has been followed in this instance with which we have latterly become quite familiar in common law actions. Since the \u201cJudicature Act,\u201d and more particularly in recent years, the High Court judges when dealing with such cases have sometimes found it convenient to adopt the procedure of a court of equity and to refer the assessment of damages and similar questions to an officer of the court for determination, reserving further directions. When this court was constituted in 1875 (38 Vict. ch. 11, sec. 17), it was given jurisdiction, subject to certain limitations, to hear appeals\nfrom all final judgments of the highest court of final resort * * * established in any province of Canada in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court.\nBy the statute 42 Vict. ch. 39, sec. 9, \u201cfinal judgment\u201d was interpreted to mean\nany judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nThis definition is now found in sub-section (e) of section 2 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d By section 1 of the statute 42 Vict. ch. 39, it was also provided that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada from any decree, decretal order, or order made in any suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding originally instituted in any superior court of equity in any province of Canada, other than the Province of Quebec, and from any decree, decretal order, or order in any action, suit, cause, matter or judicial proceeding in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity which shall have been originally instituted in any superior court in any province of Canada other than the Province of Quebec.\nThis provision, slightly altered, now appears in the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d as clause (c), of section 38. It was made because in equitable procedure it frequently happened that judgments, which did not finally determine and conclude the suit or matter, did finally determine and dispose of substantial rights of litigants. But the procedure followed in common law actions did not require such a provision. Except in the case of a judgment allowing a demurrer to, or otherwise finally disposing of one or more of several distinct claims or grounds of action; Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[18]; McDonald v. Belcher[19]; and in the case of post-judgment interpleader issues which have been treated as distinct judicial proceedings; Hovey v. Whiting[20], at page 525, ordinarily the only judgment in an action which, under common law procedure, disposed of the rights of litigants in the subject-matter of the litigation was the final judgment that concluded the action itself. A judgment determining rights and directing a reference to assess damages or to take accounts with a reservation of further directions was not a feature of that procedure. In common law cases, subject to the exceptions which I have mentioned, the right of appeal to this court was, therefore, allowed to remain limited to judgments which concluded the action. It would appear to have been thought at first that every appeal to the court of last resort in the province might be deemed \u201ca judicial proceeding\u201d within the statutory definition of 1879, and the judgment rendered in it appealable as a judgment finally disposing of such proceeding. That view was expressed in Chevalier v. Cuvillier[21], followed in Shields v. Peak[22], at p. 592. It should be noted, however, that in both these cases the appeals were from judgments allowing demurrers. Under such a construction of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as used in the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d every judgment of a provincial court of appeal involving a sufficient amount would be appealable to this court. The restriction of the right of appeal to final judgments and the special provisions for appeals in equitable and other cases would be meaningless and useless. The view that every such appeal is in itself \u201ca judicial proceeding,\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in the section of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d interpreting \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d was soon found to be so inconsistent with the whole scheme of the statute that it was abandoned. Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. v. Marcheterre[23], at page 147; Molson v. Barnard[24]; Rural Municipality of Morris v. London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[25]; and it is now well established in the jurisprudence of this court that, except in equitable proceedings and other cases specially provided for, an appeal will not lie from any order or judgment pronounced in the course of an action brought in the courts of a province where the procedure is modelled on the English system, although it may have the effect of disposing of substantial rights, unless it finally determines and concludes the action itself or some distinct claim or ground of action. Wenger v. Lamont[26]; Goodall v. Clarke[27]; Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[28]. This harmonizes with the fact that, like an appeal to the English Court of Appeal (O. 58, R. 1), an appeal to a provincial court of appeal under the system established by the judicature Acts is not a distinct judicial proceeding, but is a motion in the cause \u201cby way of re-hearing\u201d (B.C. Rules, O. 58, R. 1, and R.S.B.C. (1911), ch. 51, sections 6 and 13; Man. K.B. Rule 647, and 5 & 6 Edw. VII., ch. 18, sec. 7 (a); Ont. Con. R. 798.) By the last\u2011mentioned rule an appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal is expressly declared to be \u201ca step in the cause.\u201d\nIn considering cases in which this court has entertained appeals from judgments and orders of the Exchequer Court, which would not be deemed final judgments under the statutory definition of that term in the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d it must be borne in mind that by section 82 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 140) providing for appeals to this court, it is declared that\na judgment shall be considered final for the purposes of this section if it determines the rights of the parties, except as to the amount of damages or the amount of liability.\nAgain, in considering cases from the Province of Quebec in which interlocutory judgments have been reviewed by this court, whether on substantive appeals from them, or incidentally when dealing with appeals from judgments finally disposing of actions, it should be remembered that in the opinion of eminent judges from that province who have been members of this court, some judgments, which lawyers trained in the English system might deem interlocutory at all events under the statutory definition of final judgment in the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d should be regarded as wholly or in part final and definitive under the system of jurisprudence which obtains in that province, and as such appealable to this court; while others, as purely interlocutory, are subject to the maxim \u201cl\u2019interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge,\u201d and, therefore, reviewable on appeal from the final judgment concluding the action. Shaw v. St. Louis[29]; Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. v. Marcheterre[30]; Desaulniers v. Payette[31]; Willson v. Shawinigan Carbide Co.[32] Whatever difficulty the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d may present to the hearing of a substantive appeal from a judgment which, though final in another sense under the Quebec system of jurisprudence, does not finally determine and conclude the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, section 51 of the statute offers no obstacle to the review of an interlocutory judgment to which the maxim quoted applies on appeal from the judgment which finally determines an action in the Province of Quebec.\nIf it should be thought desirable to give to litigants in other provinces a right of appeal to this court from any judgment which finally determines or disposes of substantial rights, that might be done by substituting for the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d now in the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d a definition similar to that which governs in Exchequer Court cases. To permit the review of interlocutory judgments on appeals from the final judgments in actions brought in provinces in which legal procedure is based on the English system would tend to unduly prolong litigation and to enormously increase its expense. To allow the opening up, on an appeal from a judgment merely on further directions and costs, of the judgment which determined liability and directed a reference to ascertain its amount would probably result in the entire cost of what might have been a very expensive reference being thrown away whenever the original judgment should be reversed by this court or should be so varied that the basis of reference would be substantially altered. But any such change in our jurisdiction must be made by Parliament. We are powerless to effect it.\nSince we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the final judgment on further directions the present appeal may not be quashed; but inasmuch as counsel for the appellants has intimated that if he cannot open up the judgment determining their liability or the later judgment on the quantum of damages it would be useless to argue the appeal from the judgment on further directions, in which nothing but the disposition of costs could be dealt with, this appeal should be now dismissed; and I see no reason why the usual result as to costs should not follow. Desaulniers v. Payette[33].\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014We are called upon to decide whether on an appeal from a final judgment in Ontario we can review the interlocutory orders which have disposed of the real points in dispute.\nIt is claimed by the respondents that an interlocutory order is res judicata, that it cannot be opened by the judge who renders the final judgment, and that the Court of Appeal and this court are bound by that order.\nOn the other hand, the appellants state that an interlocutory order can be reviewed and that it should not operate so as to bar or prejudice this court from giving such decision as may be just.\nIt is now the settled jurisprudence of the Supreme Court as evidenced by the following decisions: Union Bank of Halifax v. Dickie[34]; Clarke v. Goodall[35], and Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[36], that the interlocutory judgments similar to the ones in question in this case cannot be formally appealed from.\nBut it has never been decided whether those interlocutory judgments could be reviewed when the action is brought before us on an appeal from the final judgment.\nWhat are the facts in the present case? First the question of liability of the defendant company, now appellant, was decided in 1908 by the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and a reference was ordered to determine the quantum of damages. It was certainly the most important question to be decided as to whether the defendant company was or was not liable. However, as that judgment was not a final one no formal appeal therefrom on account of the decisions above quoted, could be taken.\nThe parties then proceeded on the reference and there also a most important issue was fought. The referee having reported a certain amount of money as representing the quantum of damages that the company should pay, an appeal from his decision was brought before the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Sir William Meredith, who varied the report as to the amount. The latter judgment was rendered on the 23rd of January, 1911.\nOn the 8th of March, 1911, a judgment was rendered by the Honourable Chancellor on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for further directions and for costs. In the formal order of the Chancellor it is stated that;\nUpon hearing read the pleadings, proceedings, judgment at trial, certificate of the Court of Appeal, the report of the local Master at Sandwich, the judgment of the Honourable the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas varying the report, the evidence, orders, certificates, papers and all proceedings had and taken in the cause and upon hearing counsel as aforesaid\u2014\nThis court doth order and adjudge that the defendants, The Windsor, Essex and Lake Shore Rapid Railway Company do pay to the plaintiff, A.J. Nelles the sum of $10,648.90 * * * that the defendants, The Windsor, Essex and Lake Shore Rapid Railway Company do pay to the plaintiffs their costs. * * *\nThe defendants appealed from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and from the judgment of the Chancellor and those appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the 28th of September, 1911.\nNotice of appeal was then given to this court and later on a motion was made before the registrar to affirm the jurisdiction of this court to hear the appeals, first from the judgment of 1908, secondly, from the order of Sir William Meredith given on the 23rd of January, 1911, and thirdly, from the judgment of the Chancellor of the 8th March, 1911.\nThe registrar refused to grant the motion as to the two first orders or judgments relying on section 69 of the statute and on the cases above quoted of Clarke v. Goodall[37], and Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Skinner[38], but he added:\u2014\nIn holding that no appeal lies from this judgment (referring to the judgment of the Chief Justice at the Common Pleas) I am not to be taken as being of the opinion that the Supreme Court may not in dealing with an appeal from the final judgment, open up any interlocutory judgment of the Court of Appeal or any other court below on this matter.\nThat opinion of the registrar was confirmed later on by the court itself.\nThe appeal then came up on the merits and the first question that was discussed was whether we could review the interlocutory judgments, first the one rendered in 1908 declaring the liability of the company, and the second rendered in January, 1911, determining the amount of damages.\nWe did not consider it advisable to hear the parties upon the merits of those two interlocutory judgments until we would decide that preliminary point.\nI am strongly of the view that Parliament in giving an appellate jurisdiction to this court intended to give us and has given us the power to hear and determine all the issues in a case.\nThe formal appeal may be taken only from the final formal judgment, but in considering that judgment we have the right to review all the interlocutory orders which at one time or another have been rendered in the case by the High Court (section 51 \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d).\nIn general principle an interlocutory order remains, until final judgment, subject to the control of the court and open to reconsideration and revision (Cyc., vol. 11, page 503). That rule is simply the confirmation of the old Roman saying, judex ab interlocutoris discidere potest. We find also that principle established in the French law under the well-known phrase \u201cl\u2019interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge final.\u201d\nIt is claimed that the practice in Ontario is that in a final judgment the interlocutory orders are never disturbed. I may say that we have in the Province of Quebec an almost similar practice, and it is very seldom that we see a judge reversing the opinion of one of his confreres on demurrer or another incident. They do as the Chancellor did in this case, they examine all the papers, interlocutory judgments and other proceedings and render \u2018the final judgment. But in law those interlocutory judgments have no binding effect and they can be reviewed and reconsidered. But supposing that a judge of co-ordinate jurisdiction cannot reconsider the interlocutory order, could that rule be applied as to the appellate courts? As far as England is concerned that question is disposed of by Order 58, Rule 14, which says:\u2014\nNo interlocutory order or rule from which there has been no appeal shall operate so as to bar or prejudice the Court of Appeal from giving such decision upon the appeal as may be just.\nIn Ontario section 81 of the \u201cJudicature Act\u201d states that on questions of law or practice the Court of Appeal and the High Court are bound by their former decisions until they are overruled by a higher court. Here is what it says:\u2014\n81 (1) The decision of a Divisional Court or of the Court of Appeal on a question of law or practice shall, unless overruled or otherwise impugned by a higher court, be binding on the Court of Appeal and all Divisional Courts thereof, as well as on all other courts and judges, and shall not be departed from in subsequent cases without the concurrence of the judges who gave the decision, unless and until so overruled or impugned. (2) It shall not be competent for the High Court or any judge, thereof in any case arising before such court or judge to disregard or depart from a prior known decision of any court or judge of coordinate authority on any question of law or practice without the concurrence of the judges, or judge who gave the decision; but if a court or judge deems the decision previously given to be wrong and of sufficient importance to be considered in a higher court, such court or judge may refer the question to such higher court.\nWe have in British Columbia a decision in the case of Edison General Electric Co. v. Edmonds[39], almost similar to this one.\nThe statement of defence has raised an objection in point of law. Judge Drake had decided the point of law in favour of the defendants. Upon appeal the Divisional Court had confirmed Mr. Justice Drake\u2019s decision. Upon motion then made to him the action was dismissed by the same judge as the action was substantially disposed of by the decision of the point of law.\nAppeal was then made to the full court, which decided that the interlocutory judgment of Mr. Justice Drake and of the Divisional Court could be reviewed. Chief Justice Davie in rendering the judgment of the full court said, at page 379:\u2014\nIt never, I think, was intended. either by our own \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d or the rules, or by the \u201cSupreme and Exchequer Court Act,\u201d that by virtue of an interlocutory tribunal pronouncing what in effect is a final judgment that there the litigant\u2019s rights should be concluded. There can, I think, be but one final determination upon the merits of an action, and when you arrive at that stage, and not until then, the right of appeal as from a final judgment arises; and upon the final appeal in determining the merits of the case, the court is not to be barred by any interlocutory decision not brought by appeal to the full court. To this effect, I take it, is Rule 683, which says that no interlocutory order or rule from which there has been no appeal shall operate so as to bar or prejudice the full court from giving such decision upon the merits as may be just. That Rule 683 is the exact reproduction of the English Order 58, Rule 14, and we find in England the following decisions which enunciate the principle that an interlocutory order will not operate so as to bar the Court of Appeal from giving the decision which is considered just. Sugden v. Lord St. Leonards[40]; see per Mellish L.J., page 208; Laird v. Briggs[41].\nNow coming to the examination of the jurisprudence of this court on the point at issue I find that the court in the case of Magann v. Auger[42] has reviewed an interlocutory judgment and has allowed the appeal and maintained the exception declinatoire the object of that interlocutory judgment. The formal appeal was from the final judgment. In 1906 in the case of Willson v. Shawinigan Carbide Co.[43], there had been a direct appeal from the judgment on an exception declinatoire. This court quashed the appeal on the ground that the objection as to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court might be raised on a subsequent appeal from the final judgment on the merits.\nIn 1908 in a case of North Eastern Banking Co. v. The Royal Trust Co.[44] we find facts very much similar to those in this case. It was an Exchequer Court case. Judgment had been rendered on the merits and a reference had been ordered. The report of the referee was brought down and no appeal was taken to the judge from the report within the 14 days mentioned in sections 19 and 20 of the then rules of the court (Exchequer Reports, vol. 6, page 449). The power of the court to vary seemed to be at an end. It was held that an appeal will lie to the Supreme Court from an order of the judge confirming the report. It is to be noticed that by section 82 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d chapter 140, R.S.C. (1906), some interlocutory judgments of the Exchequer Court may be appealed to this court. Though there was no appeal from the interlocutory I draw the inference that it would, however, be reviewed by this court.\nThe respondents have referred to three cases decided by this court and which according to them preclude the consideration of interlocutory judgments.\nThese are the cases of Shaw v. St. Louis, in 1883[45]; The Queen v. Clarke, in 1892[46], and Desaulniers v. Payette, in 1904[47].\nOf those three cases the last one seems to have some bearing upon the point at issue.\nThe two other cases, Shaw v. St. Louis45 and The Queen v. Clarke46 were decided on an entirely different question since the court declared that the judgments were final though they did not terminate the suit and that some references were ordered.\nIt was simply decided there might be appeals from interlocutory judgments which terminate a question of law or of fact, but which are not, however, the final judgments of the case.\nI may add, however, that in the case of The Queen v. Clarke46 the judges, Patterson and Gwynne JJ. who were dissenting gave us their opinion that those interlocutory judgments could be reconsidered on an appeal from the final judgment.\nThe judgment in Desaulniers v. Payette[48], upon which was rendered, later on the judgment above quoted[49] could hardly be considered as a good precedent as it was practically overruled in the case of La Ville de St. Jean v. Melleur[50], where it was decided that a judgment depriving the appellant of his right to rely on some of the grounds of his action was a final judgment which could be appealed here.\nThe contention that this court has no alternative other than to affirm the judgment appealed from because the question of costs alone was then decided seems to me absolutely wrong\u2014and why? Because it is said the Supreme Court can only reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal if that court is wrong; but the judgment of the appeal court was right, because how could it have said that the judge below was wrong when he had done no more than conform to its own judgment on the earlier appeal? And so it happens that the judgment of the trial judge which may have been absolutely wrong can never be reformed by the highest appellate court.\nThat conclusion so repugnant to my common sense comes about because the rules of practice which have been adopted by the courts below for the purpose of expediting the business of the court are permitted to produce a result which is nothing but a travesty upon the due administration of justice.\nThe trial judge or the Court of Appeal in the future will have simply, in order to avoid an appeal to this court, to state in their decree that the defendants or the plaintiffs should win on the true issues in the case and reserve the question of costs for further adjudication and those true issues could never be brought up here. When one considers the circumstances under which the Supreme Court was organized, that the bill as introduced in Parliament would have precluded any appeal from this Supreme Court to the Privy Council (R.S.C. (1906), ch. 139, sec. 159) that the Judicial Committee has always refused to be bound by any rule of practice or procedure in the courts below which would prevent it from doing justice, and that the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d (section 68) provides that proceedings in appeal shall where not otherwise provided in the Act, be as nearly as possible in conformity with the practice of the Judicial Committee, I, for one, find myself unable to concur in such an important conclusion as it is said the court must arrive at in the present case. In giving to that practice the effect which is asked by the respondents it would be limiting the appeals to the Supreme Court and it is not in the power of the provincial courts any more than of the provincial legislature to circumscribe the appellate jurisdiction granted by the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which was passed pursuant to section 101 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d (Crown Grain Go. v. Day)[51].\nMy conclusion is that the interlocutory judgments rendered by the Court of Appeal in 1908 and by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1911, can be reviewed and reconsidered in this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wilson, Pike & Stewart.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Rodd & Wigle.\n[1] 11 Can.

Bros. & Co., through the agents in New York of the respondent company obtained insurance on a stock of tobacco in a certain building in Quincy, Flo., and afterwards obtained the consent of the company to its removal to another building. Later, again, they wished to return it to the original location and an insurance firm in New York was instructed to procure the necessary consent. This firm, on January 14th, 1909, prepared a \u201cbinder,\u201d a temporary document intended to license the removal until formally authorized by the company, and took it to the firm which had been agents of respondents when the policy issued, but had then ceased to be such where it was initialed by one of their clerks on his own responsibility entirely. On March 19th, 1909, the stock was destroyed by fire in the original location and shortly after a formal consent to its removal back was indorsed on the policy, the respondents then not knowing of the loss. In an action to recover the insurance:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (25 Ont. L.R. 534) that the \u201cbinder\u201d was issued without authority; that even if the insurance firm by whose clerk it was initialed had been respondents\u2019 agents at the time they had, under the terms of the policy, no authority to execute it and authority would not be presumed in favour of the insured as it might be in case of an original application for a policy; and that it was not ratified by the indorsement on the policy as the company could not ratify after the loss. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe defendants pleaded several defences to the action on the policy insuring plaintiffs\u2019 tobacco in Quincy, Flo., but the only one dealt with on the appeal was that at the time of the loss the policy only covered goods in another building. The circumstances are sufficiently stated in the head-note.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellants. The defendants are estopped from denying that the New York firm were their agents. Montreal Assurance Co. v. McGillivray[2], at p. 121. Being agents they had authority to issue the binder. Eastern Counties Railway Co. v. Broom[3].\nThe issue of the binder was ratified. Lewis v. Read[4]; Williams v. North China Ins. Co.[5]\nEven if the New York firm were agents of respondents they could not license a removal of the stock insured without express authority in writing. The policy so provides, and see Western Assurance Co. v. Doull[6].\nThe indorsement on the policy after the loss would not have ratified if the respondents had knowledge of the fire: Grover v. Mathews[7].\nHamilton Cassels K.C. for respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe action is brought on a policy of fire insurance issued by the respondents through their agents in New York, to cover a stock of tobacco in a warehouse described as situated on the southeast corner of Love and Washington streets in the town of Quincy. The policy is dated 3rd September, 1908, and the fire occurred on the night of the 18th March, 1909; the amount claimed is $2,000. There are several defences, the substantial one being, that, by reason of changes in the contract of insurance previously made at the request of the insured, the goods were not, at the time of the fire, within the protection of the policy.\nIn December, 1908, it was found necessary by the insured to transfer the tobacco from the warehouse, at the corner of Love and Washington streets, to the Owl warehouse in the suburbs of Quincy, and this was done with the consent of the company, evidenced by the memorandum attached to the policy and dated 14th October, 1909. So that at the moment of the fire the subject of insurance was tobacco stored in the Owl warehouse, whereas the goods actually destroyed and for the value of which this claim was made had been removed from that location several weeks before. There can be no doubt as to the fate of this claim if there was nothing else on this record. And I must confess my inability to understand how the liability of the respondents has been affected by the subsequent happenings upon which the appellants rely. It is useless to insist upon the many reasons which may be urged to support the company\u2019s contention, that the location of the goods insured materially affect the risk; they are so obvious as not to require mention. For the better understanding of the appellants\u2019 case I will briefly state all the facts.\nAs I said before the policy was issued by the com- pany\u2019s agents in New York, and the indorsement consenting to the change in the location was given through the same agency. When, however, the appellants were prepared to transfer the tobacco to the corner of Love and Washington Streets the New York agency was closed, a fact which came to the knowledge of the appellants\u2019 insurance broker either at the time, or immediately after the application for the consent of the company to the change was made at the office in New York occupied by their former agents. In my view, however, the broker\u2019s knowledge of the closing of the agency is not of major importance because of the other facts of this case. Whatever may be the truth as to this, the brokers, when they applied for the consent of the company to the re-transfer, were content to accept from a clerk in the office of the company\u2019s former agents, instead of the document which they had prepared, a document known amongst insurance brokers as a \u201cbinder,\u201d and which it is alleged operates according to the custom of insurance brokers in New York, to bind the company until such time as a more formal agreement is issued. Whatever may be in some circumstances the effect of a \u201cbinder\u201d issued by a qualified agent, when the policy is first applied for, I entertain no doubt that it was of no value in the circumstances of this case. Excluding from consideration those cases where the agent is clothed with all the powers of the company itself, and has authority to issue and cancel policies of insurance generally without reference to the head office, I agree fully with the respondents\u2019 counsel who, in his very able factum, makes the distinction between the powers to be implied in the case of insurance agents when taking new risks, and their powers when assuming to deal with risks already in existence. In the former case a person dealing with the agent is entitled to assume that he has the general powers of an insurance agent, and within the scope of his ostensible authority, has power to bind the company to the extent of the risk accepted by the agent, even though, as a matter of fact, in accepting such risk, the agent is exceeding his authority. But where, after a risk has been accepted, and the terms of the contract are embodied in a policy, the agent is applied to for permission to change the location of the goods insured, or any of the conditions of that policy, the applicant deals with that agent at his peril, and if in fact the agent has no authority, the assent given by him is of no avail, even although the person obtaining the assent has no knowledge of the lack of authority. Here, of course, it cannot be successfully pretended that the agent had any authority to issue the \u201cbinder\u201d in view of this condition of the policy which the insured or their agents had at the time in their possession:\u2014\nIn any matter relating to this insurance no person, unless duly authorized in writing, shall be deemed the agent of the company,\nand admittedly there was no such writing. It is also provided that the entire policy shall be void if the hazard be increased by any means within the control or knowledge of the insured, or if any change takes place in the subject of insurance, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed on the policy or added thereto, and there is no such agreement here. As I have already said a change of location in the subject of insurance would, as materially affecting the risk, come within that provision. It may almost be accepted as an axiom in insurance law \u201cthat the locality and surroundings of insured property are always con- sidered material by insurers in accepting and rejecting applications for insurance, is a matter of common information to which the courts cannot be indifferent in the decision of questions of this character.\u201d Beach on Insurance, Vol. 2, sec. 623.\nBut it is said that on application to the company at its head office in Toronto the action of the clerk who issued the \u201cbinder\u201d was ratified, and the consent of the company then given operated retroactively to validate the action of the clerk (14 January, 1909). It is impossible to accept this contention. At the time the assent of the company was given, March 26th, 1909, the fire had actually occurred and the subject-matter of the insurance had been destroyed. The company could not insure with the knowledge of the loss, and, of course, there can be no ratification if the principal could not make the contract at the time he is asked to ratify it. Here we have this additional fact which certainly does not help the appellant. At the time the assent of the company was given the insureds\u2019 agents knew that the goods were destroyed and, notwithstanding, they carefully kept that fact concealed from the company. It is unnecessary to comment on such lack of candour. The assent could not in any case be referred back to the date of the binder, because it was given without any reference to it; the company appears to have been kept in ignorance of the fact that such a document ever existed. I also agree with Mr. Justice Garrow when he says that in any event the application to the company for its consent to a re-transfer of the goods should not have been delayed from the 14th January to the 26th March. For the neglect which caused the loss the appellant must now bear the consequences; the respondent company is not in any way responsible.

Duff J. contra. Brodeur J. hesitante.\nBy the \u201cLiberty of the Subject Act\u201d of Nova Scotia on an application to the court or a judge for a writ of habeas corpus an order may be made calling on the keeper of the gaol or prison to return to the court or judge whether or not the person named is detained therein with the day and cause of his detention. On the return of an order so made, an application for the discharge of the prisoner was refused, and an appeal from this refusal was dismissed by the full court.\nHeld, per Idington and Brodeur JJ. that such order is not a proceeding for or upon a writ of habeas corpus from which an appeal lies under said sec. 39(c).\nPer Duff J.\u2014That the judgment of the full court was given in a case of proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus within the meaning of sec. 39(c), and that the proceedings did not arise out of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d within the meaning of that provision; but that, on the merits, the appeal ought to be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment of a judge who refused to discharge the appellant from imprisonment on a conviction for keeping liquor for sale in violation of the \u201cNova Scotia Temperance Act.\u201d\nThe appellant having been convicted and sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment in gaol applied to a judge for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the magistrate at the trial had inquired into a previous conviction before the offence he was trying had been established. It appeared that on the trial a witness had been asked as to previous convictions and had stated that there were several, and it was alleged that the accused had been interrogated on the same matter. The judge, instead of granting the writ, made an order under the \u201cLiberty of the Subject Act,\u201d calling upon the the gaol keeper to return the date and cause of the detention. On return of this order he refused to discharge the prisoner and his refusal was affirmed by the full court. The prisoner then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRalston in opposing the appeal claimed that this was not a proceeding for or upon a writ of habeas corpus and that the court was without jurisdiction, citing In re Harris[2] and Ex parte Byrne[3].\nPower K.C. and Vernon for the appellant. The proceedings were for, if not upon, a writ of habeas corpus. See Rex v. Cook[4].\n(The objection was taken from the Bench that the proceedings arose out of a criminal charge which would deprive the court of jurisdiction.)\nPower K.C. and Vernon for the appellant.\nOn the merits counsel cited Rex v. Coote[5]; Rex v. Reid[6]; Rex v. Vanzyl[7]. The Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that we cannot entertain this appeal.\nIt was on the appellant to shew that we have jurisdiction, and he referred us to section 39(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d which provides for an appeal\nfrom the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus * * * not arising out of a criminal charge.\nIn other words, the statute gives an appeal when the petitioner for the writ is detained in custody on a process issued in a civil matter.\nAssuming, but without admitting, that the order made in this case, under the \u201cLiberty of the Subject Act,\u201d R.S.N.S. (1900) ch. 181, is for the purpose of determining our jurisdiction, the equivalent of a writ of habeas corpus, in what aspect can it be said that the commitment under which the petitioner is detained is a civil process or that the order in question arises out of a civil matter? In my opinion it is clearly in the nature of an order in a criminal proceeding.\nThe proceedings originated in a complaint by the Inspector, a public official, to the effect that the petitioner\nunlawfully did keep intoxicating liquor in his possession for sale contrary to the provisions of the \u201cNova Scotia Temperance Act,\u201d 1910.\nThat complaint was tried by the stipendiary magistrate under the \u201cSummary Convictions Act\u201d (Canada) and he condemned the petitioner to be imprisoned for three months in the county gaol, without the option of a fine. This petition was made to obtain her discharge from that custody. In what aspect then can the subject of these proceedings be described as a wrong for which there is a remedy by civil process or how can this be said to be a proceeding which\nhas for its object the recovery of money or other property, or the enforcement of a right for the advantage of the person suing. Halsbury, vol. 9, No. 499. The act of keeping liquor in the circumstances of this case is not, in itself, an injury to a private person, nor is it an act forbidden by the statute\nin such a way that the person guilty may be liable to a pecuniary penalty which is recoverable as a debt by civil process.\nThe illegal act with which the petitioner is charged is a violation of the provisions of a statute passed to regulate the sale of liquor in the interests of the inhabitants of the Province of Nova Scotia and the punishment for that illegal act is imprisonment for a definite period. The petitioner is \u201cfurnished with no key,\u201d it is not in her power in any way to shorten that term; the imprisonment is, therefore, not imposed as a coercive or remedial measure for the benefit of the complainant; it is solely punitive to vindicate the authority of the law. The procedure at the trial was that prescribed by the summary procedure sections of the Criminal Code and the conviction is in the form given by that code. We have, therefore, in this case all the necessary elements of an offence against what has been not inaptly described as a provincial criminal law. But it is impossible to find in the proceedings below any of the distinguishing features of a civil process and to this latter class of case the jurisdiction of this court is, with respect to appeals upon writs of habeas corpus, expressly limited by the statute under which it is constituted.\nThe \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d was by decision of the Privy Council upheld on the ground that it might be referred to the general powers of the Dominion Parliament in respect of \u201cthe peace, order and good government of Canada.\u201d That legislation does not rest upon the execution of Dominion powers with regard to criminal law, although having as stated by their Lordships direct relation thereto. It is to be observed that the general principle and object of the local Act in question here is in a large measure the same as that of the Dominion Act, the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors within municipal divisions. Similar legislation was upheld by the Privy Council in the Prohibitory Liquor Laws Case[8] under the authority of the province to make laws for the suppression of the liquor traffic; \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d section 92(16).\nIf this subject comes within the powers of the province then the right to impose punishment by imprisonment to enforce its provisions undoubtedly exists. Sec. 92(15). Such legislation if enacted by the Imperial Government would be denominated criminal and fall within the category of criminal law; and I fail to understand how the element of criminality disappears merely because the Act is competent to the provincial legislature. At all events it cannot be said to be in any aspect legislation creating or regulating a civil remedy or process.\nThis appeal is dismissed but without costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The appellant had been convicted of having\nunlawfully kept intoxicating liquors for sale contrary to the provisions of the \u201cNova Scotia Temperance Act,\u201d 1910.\nThe conviction was for a second offence, and the punishment imposed was imprisonment for a term of three months.\nApplications were first made to the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia and afterwards to the Supreme Court of that province for the prisoner\u2019s discharge from imprisonment on the ground that by admitting some general evidence of the appellant\u2019s conviction of a previous offence before he had adjudicated upon the second offence for which appellant was being tried, the magistrate had acted illegally and deprived himself of jurisdiction, and that the conviction was therefore bad.\nBoth applications were dismissed and from the dismissal of the application to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia an appeal was taken to this court.\nPreliminary objections were taken at the hearing in this court to our jurisdiction to hear this appeal, on the ground that it did not come within sub-section (c) of section 39 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d under which alone we can claim jurisdiction.\nSection 39 enacts:\u2014\nExcept as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court,\u2014\n(c) from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge.\nThese objections were, first, that the order for the prisoner\u2019s discharge applied for was one under the \u201cLiberty of the Subject Act,\u201d and was not a \u201cproceeding for or upon a writ of habeas corpus\u201d within the meaning of the sub-section (c) and, secondly, that the proceeding impeached did \u201carise out of a criminal charge,\u201d within the meaning of those words in the sub-section, and was, therefore, exempted from our jurisdiction.\nI have reached the conclusion that this latter objection is fatal to the maintenance of the appeal.\nThe question involved is whether the offence for which the appellant was convicted and imprisoned is covered by the exception forming the closing words of sub-section (c) above quoted, \u201cnot arising out of a criminal charge.\u201d The contention that they are not so excepted is based upon the fact that section 91, sub-section. 27, of our \u201cConstitutional Act\u201d assigns the exclusive power to legislate upon criminal law, to the Dominion Parliament, and that the Act under which the appellant was convicted was a provincial one.\nThese words, no doubt, must be construed, as stated by Lord Halsbury in the reference respecting the validity of the \u201cLord\u2019s Day Act,\u201d as embracing criminal law \u201cin its widest extent,\u201d but that does not preclude the provincial legislatures, when legislating upon matters strictly within any of those assigned to them by the 92nd section of that Act, from enacting such necessary sanctions for their legislation as are essential to make that legislation effective, in fact subsection 15 of section 92 expressly confers such necessary powers upon them.\nIn the case before us no attack was or could successfully be made upon the constitutionality of the \u201cNova Scotia Temperance Act, 1910.\u201d The right of the legislature to pass it was indubitable, and in the legitimate exercise of that right its powers were plenary. The penalties and punishments it prescribed for offences against its provisions, though in a sense criminal legislation, were not unconstitutional because they were necessary to effective legislation on the main subject-matter which the legislature was dealing with and were expressly authorized by subsection 15 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nThe Act was one dealing with public law and order from a provincial standpoint, and not with private wrongs or civil rights.\nThe distinction of public wrongs from private, of crimes and misdemeanors from civil injuries, seems principally to consist in this\u2014that private wrongs, or civil injuries, are an infringement or privation of the civil rights which belong to individuals, considered merely as individuals; public wrongs, or crimes and misdemeanors, are a breach and violation of the public rights and duties due to the whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity. 4 Bl. Com. p. 5.\nAs defined in Russell on Crimes, vol. 1, p. 1, crimes are:\u2014\nThose acts or omissions involving breach of a duty to which by the law of England a sanction is attached by way of punishment or pecuniary penalty in the public interest.\nSee also, 1 Austin\u2019s Jurisprudence, Lecture 17, p. 405.\nIn Russell v. The Queen[9], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in determining the validity of the \u201cCanada Temperance Act, 1898,\u201d refer, at page 840, to an argument advanced by counsel for the appellant in that case as follows:\u2014\nIt was argued by (Mr. Benjamin that if the Act related to criminal law, it was provincial criminal law, and he referred to sub-sec. 15 of sec. 92, viz., \u201cThe imposition of any punishment by fine, penalty, or imprisonment for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section.\u201d No doubt this argument would be well founded if the principal matter of the Act could be brought within any of these classes of subjects; but as far as they have yet gone, their Lordships fail to see that this has been done.\nIn Hodge v. The Queen[10], at p. 129, the Judicial Committee adopt with approval the following statement of the law made by their Lordships in Russell v. The Queen9, having reference to such legislation as was embodied in the \u201cCanada Temperance Act.\u201d Laws of this nature designed for the promotion of public order, safety, or morals, and which subject those who contravene them to criminal procedure and punishment, belong to the subject of public wrongs rather than to that of civil rights.\nThese words apply with equal aptitude to the provincial \u201cTemperance Act\u201d in question. The nature and object of it and the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d are alike and they each, in their respective spheres, fall within legislation for the promotion of \u201cpublic order, safety and morals.\u201d\nI conclude, therefore, that the offence for which the appellant was convicted and imprisoned came within the classification of public wrongs or crimes. The only question remaining is whether Parliament intended, when exempting from our jurisdiction in sub-section (c) of section 39 proceedings \u201cnot arising out of a criminal charge,\u201d to embrace in the exemption cases arising under provincial legislation.\nI see no reason for reading any limitation into the general words of the exemption and to confine them either to criminal charges at common law or under Dominion legislation.\nIt seems to me that the same reasons for withdrawing jurisdiction from this court in proceedings arising out of a criminal charge under Dominion temperance legislation must apply to proceedings under provincial temperance legislation.\nParliament in the one case and the legislature in the other, when so legislating, do so in their respective spheres with plenary powers. The legislation in each case deals with public law and order, safety and morals; the offences created are those of public wrongs or crimes and not civil injuries or private wrongs. The only distinction between the legislation is that one is general, relating to the Dominion at large, and passed under the general power given respecting peace, order and good government, and the other provincial,\nrelating to matters of a local or private nature in the province.\nI am unable to find any sufficient reason for excluding from our jurisdiction respecting appeals under the section of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d I have quoted, proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus to test the validity of convictions for offences under the \u201cCanada Temperance Act\u201d on the ground that they arise out of a criminal charge, and at the same time including as within that jurisdiction similar proceedings if taken under provincial temperance legislation.\nI think they equally come within the exemption and decline to read a limitation into the section which would give us jurisdiction in the one case and exclude it in the other. I do not think we have jurisdiction in either case.\nI would, therefore, quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nIdington J.\u2014Such jurisdiction as this court has in regard to habeas corpus appeals falls entirely within and is defined by the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d section 39, sub-section (c), which reads as follows:\u2014\nExcept as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court,\u2014\n(c) from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge.\nWe have not before us the motion paper or other material of that kind, if any, presented to the learned judge who made what may be called an order nisi when the application was made to him, to shew exactly what was asked. Appellant\u2019s affidavit shews she had instructed her solicitor to move for a writ of habeas corpus. What he got was an order under an Act known as the \u201cLiberty of the Subject Act,\u201d of which the first part of section 3, sub-section 2, provides:\u2014\nWhere it would be attended with unnecessary delay, expense or inconvenience to bring in the body of a person illegally restrained of his liberty before the court or judge, the court or judge, upon sufficient cause shewn by or on behalf of any person confined in any jail or prison, may, in the discretion of such court or judge, instead of granting a fiat for the writ of habeas corpus cum causa requiring the keeper of such jail, etc.,\nand defines the proceeding adopted.\nCould anything be more explicit than this to shew that it was not within the language of the section 39 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d that the proceedings were taken?\nThe \u201cHabeas Corpus Act\u201d has not been supplanted by this new Act. The former is still in force in Nova Scotia.\nThis new proceeding for whatever purpose furnished and however much in many of its features and operative results alike to those of what the \u201cHabeas Corpus Act\u201d provides, is certainly not in the language of section 39, \u201ca case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d\nIt is no part of our right or duty to presume to fit the jurisdiction given us to something which we in our wisdom may deem suitable to produce the same results.\nWe might as well presume it our right or duty to hear appeals from a county court in a province should its legislature enlarge the county court jurisdiction therein so as to cover some cases heretofore originating in a court of superior jurisdiction.\nThe local legislatures might by some such provisions thus subtract from our jurisdiction a large part of the field of litigation which now falls within it; yet we could not thereafter reach out and claim that so incidentally taken away as part of our jurisdiction because in substance it was within the field originally given us.\nThe \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d has defined by technical terms the limits of our jurisdiction and we have no right to depart therefrom or go beyond the limits so defined however technical the boundaries may be.\nWhatever be said in this case the mode of procedure adopted renders our jurisdiction, to say the least, exceedingly doubtful. The rule properly observed by this court has uniformly been to refuse jurisdiction where it appeared doubtful or by virtue of changes had become doubtful.\nI think we have no jurisdiction in this case.\nIt so happened that not being all agreed in this view after argument on the objection taken by Mr. Ralston, the case was heard upon its merits.\nComing to the conclusion I have, I do not think I have a right to pass any opinion upon the several interesting points discussed in the argument on the merits.\nNo good purpose can be served by doing so. Even if we were all agreed thereon such result could not establish a precedent or determine any rule of law when we were without jurisdiction.\nThe appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Mr. Ralston takes a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the court, which is as Follows: He says that section 39(c) confers jurisdiction only where the judgment appealed from is\nthe judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus,\nand that the proceeding, in which the judgment now appealed from was given, was a special statutory proceeding and was not a proceeding either \u201cfor nor upon a writ of habeas corpus,\u201d I do not think this objection can be sustained. The original application was an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The proceeding was begun therefore as a proceeding for a writ of habeas corpus. It is perfectly true that no writ was issued but that an order was made under the statute requiring the gaoler to return the cause of commitment but dispensing with the production of the body of the prisoner and the judgment refusing the application for the discharge of the prisoner followed upon the return made pursuant to this order. I think that for the purposes of this section the nature of the original application which as I have said was an application for a writ of habeas corpus may not unfairly be said to determine the character of the proceedings in which this judgment was given. I think one is not doing violence to the language of the statute in holding that this is a judgment in a \u201ccase of proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d\nAnother point has been raised which was not taken by the counsel for the respondent and which it is necessary to discuss. It is said that the offence with which the appellant was charged was a crime and the proceeding in which she was convicted a criminal proceeding and, consequently, that the judgment appealed from falls within the exception created by section 36(a) which is in these words:\u2014 There shall be no appeal from a judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge or in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty.\nThe phrase, \u201ccriminal charge\u201d means of course a charge forming the foundation of a judicial proceeding which is criminal proceeding and the point for consideration is whether or not (using the word \u201ccriminal\u201d in the sense in which it is used in this context) that word is properly descriptive of the proceeding in which the appellant was convicted.\nThe first question one naturally asks oneself is whether in the contemplation of the law of Canada such a proceeding is properly designated as a \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d\nThe law of England from which our criminal law is derived furnishes no infallible test by which for all purposes one can determine whether a given proceeding is civil or criminal.\nIn the earlier history of the law the point, if it arose, could present little difficulty. A criminal proceeding was a proceeding at the suit of the Crown having for its object the punishment of an offence against the law of the land and speaking generally in the case of a commoner it involved a trial by jury pursuant to indictment, presentment or information. In modern times a vast number of statutes affecting the conduct of people in a great variety of ways have frequently given rise to questions whether the summary proceedings taken with a view to punishing offenders or delinquents are or are not to be regarded as criminal proceedings for the purpose of applying some rule of law or some statutory provision. \u201cIt must always be,\u201d said Lord Bowen in Osborne v. Milman[11], at page 475 dealing with one of these questions,\na question on the construction of the particular statute whether an act is prohibited in the sense that it is rendered criminal, or whether the statute merely affixes certain consequences more or less unpleasant to the doing of the act,\nand decisions upon one statute must always be applied with caution as authorities for the construction of another. But these decisions do furnish us with illustrations of the criteria which have been applied by eminent judges in England in determining whether for some particular purpose a given proceeding under one of these modern statutes was to be regarded as a criminal proceeding or not; and where the proceeding is instituted for the punishment of an offence against an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instituted by the Crown ad vindicatam publicam then it has, I think, invariably been held that you have a criminal proceeding unless there is something in the Act to shew that it is not to bear that character. It is characteristic of such proceedings that they are proceedings at the suit of the Crown in the public interest and that the sanctions sought to be enforced cannot toe remitted at the discretion of any private person; or, in other words, where the sanction is remissible at all it is remissible at the discretion of the Crown.\nWhen we come to apply these criteria in this country to summary proceedings taken under the authority of a provincial statute for enforcing penalties imposed by such statutes we are confronted with a difficulty. All such criteria contemplate an offence punishable and a proceeding taken under the sanction of a law-making authority having unfettered jurisdiction to make laws in respect of crimes and criminal proceedings. The language of Lord Bowen quoted above is of course used with reference to the enactments of a Legislature possessing such powers. When Littledale J. in Mann v. Owen[12], at page 602, says in language often cited that a crime is \u201can offence for which the law awards punishment\u201d he is not contemplating a rule of conduct which has force as law solely by the enactment of a legislative body that is destitute of all authority over the subject of the criminal law. And it may be added that when Austin asserts the characteristic of the criminal law to be that \u201cits sanctions are enforced at the discretion of the Sovereign,\u201d he is not thinking of an authority which, while for some purposes it acts in the name of the Sovereign, has nothing whatever to do with the exercise of the Sovereign\u2019s prerogative of pardon in reference to crimes strictly so called.\nBy section 91, sub-section 27 of the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d exclusive legislative authority upon the subject of the criminal law including the subject of criminal procedure is committed to the Dominion. The prerogative of Parliament in respect of criminal offences is under his instructions exercised in Canada by the Governor-General acting on the advice of His Majesty\u2019s Canadian Ministers acting under their responsibility to the Parliament of Canada. It is for the Parliament of Canada alone to say what acts the criminal law shall notice and punish as crimes and in what manner all criminal proceedings in Canada shall be conducted. In Attorney-General of Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[13], at pages 528-9, the supreme judicial authority for Canada expounded the effect of section 91, sub-section 27 of the \u201cBritish North America Act;\u201d \u201cThe criminal law in its widest sense is,\u201d said Lord Halsbury, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, \u201creserved for the exclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament.\u201d His Lordship added that\nthe reservation * * * is given in clear and intelligible words which must be construed according to their natural and ordinary signification. Those words seem to their Lordships to require, and indeed to admit, of no plainer exposition than the language itself affords.\nBy sub-section 15 of section 92 the provinces are authorized to attach the sanctions of fine and imprisonment to acts or omissions in violation of their enactments; but it seems to be clear that consistently with the views thus expressed by Lord Halsbury acts or omissions struck at by such penal enactments cannot with strict propriety be described as crimes nor can the proceedings taken with a view to enforce the sanctions attached to them be properly described as criminal proceedings. Under a constitutional system such as ours that which the supreme legislative authority declares to be so, is so in contemplation of law; and in face of this declaration in the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d construed as it has been construed in the passages quoted, it cannot be said that in the contemplation of the law of Canada an act which is an offence against a provincial statute is for that reason alone a crime; and no definition of the terms \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d which fails to take this circumstance into account, can be considered adequate with reference to the law of this country. To put it in another way, the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d which is the supreme law of this country, says to the provincial legislatures: \u201cThough you may pass statutes creating prohibitions and imposing duties in the public interest and attach to them penal sanctions enforceable and remissible at the instance of the Crown alone, yet you are incompetent to pass any enactment which in itself can have the effect of making a given act or omission a crime in the eye of the law.\u201d The limitation upon the powers of the local legislatures respecting public offences may be said to be tacitly recognized in every valid enactment passed by a provincial legislature creating such an offence; and every such enactment may be read as containing an implicit declaration that the offence created by it shall not be deemed to be a crime. In the eye of the law, therefore, the proceeding in question here is not a criminal proceeding. It is true, nevertheless, that the phrases \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d may be used by a legislative body in a manner which is not strictly accurate, and it is necessary to consider whether there is anything in the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d (or in other enactments of the Parliament of Canada which as being in pari materia may properly be resorted to for aid in the construction of that Act) justifying the inference that in the instance in question Parliament has used the phrase \u201ccriminal charge\u201d in a sense broad enough to include within its scope a charge made under a provincial statute.\nIt may first be noted that the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d is a statute dealing with jurisdiction and procedure and primarily addressed to lawyers\u2014a statute in which one may consequently expect to find that the language of the law will not be employed without due attention to its strict meaning; and the onus, therefore, seems to be upon those who argue that the phrase in question is used in a sense different from that which the law of this country in strictness attaches to it. The appellate jurisdiction of this court in criminal matters is referred to in three sections, 35, 36 and 39 (c), which are as follows:\u2014\n35. The Supreme Court shall have, hold and exercise an appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction within and throughout Canada.\n36. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court: Provided that,\u2014\n(a) there shall be no appeal from a judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge or in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty; and, (b) there shall be no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code.\n39. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court, * * * (c) from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge.\nSub-section (b) of section 36 shews clearly enough that the subject of the appellate jurisdiction of the court in criminal matters is regarded by Parliament as falling within the general subject of criminal procedure which is dealt with in the Criminal Code; and that being the point of view from which the legislature has envisaged the subject, the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d may properly, in so far as it deals with criminal matters, be read as an Act in pari materi\u00e2 with the Criminal Code. Turning now to the Criminal Code we find there that the authors of the Code have used the words \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d throughout in the strict sense; in the sense, that is to say, in which they are used in the \u201cBritish North America Act;\u201d and without apparently a suspicion of their possible application to offences against provincial penal enactments. There is a striking illustration of this in the group of sections, 10, 11 and 12, bearing the sub-title \u201cApplication of the Criminal Law of England.\u201d As to Ontario I quote section 10:\u2014\n10. The criminal law of England as it existed on the seventeenth of September, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, in so far as it has not been repealed by any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom having force of law in the Province of Ontario, or by any Act of the Parliament of the late Province of Upper Canada, or of the Province of Canada, still having force of law, or by this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, and as altered, varied, modified or affected by any such Act, shall be the criminal law of the Province of Ontario.\nHere indeed is a declaration by the Parliament of Canada\u2014the Legislature entrusted with exclusive authority over the subject of the criminal law\u2014professing to define what in the Province of Ontario is comprised within the body of law known as the \u201ccriminal law\u201d; and provincial penal enactments are obviously excluded.\nI mention another statute relating to criminal procedure and to that extent in pari materia with the provisions we are considering, chapter 145, of the Ee-vised Statutes of Canada, 1906, known as the \u201cCanada Evidence Act.\u201d In section 2 of that statute the phrase \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d appears and is obviously used in the strict sense. So far as my observation extends I am not aware of any instance in any enactment of the Parliament of Canada in which the word \u201ccrime\u201d or \u201ccriminal\u201d is used in the broad sense it is suggested we should attach to it in the enactment under consideration.\nComing to the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d itself, there is nothing in the language of the Act affording a reason for ascribing to the word \u201ccriminal\u201d as used in section 36 any broader scope than that which the word bears in other enactments passed by the Parliament of Canada dealing with the same subject matter, viz., criminal procedure.\nTwo reasons I understand are given in justification of the broader construction. First, it is said that the effect of the strict construction would be this: From judgments of the court of last resort in proceedings under provincial penal statutes there would in the case of some of the provinces be an unrestricted right of appeal, while from the judgments of such courts in criminal matters strictly so called which are usually matters of far greater moment, the appeal is by the provisions of the Criminal Code very narrowly restricted. It cannot be supposed, it is argued, that Parliament could have contemplated such a result.\nThis argument, with great respect, seems to prove too much; for a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in a civil action condemning a litigant to pay the sum of $100 is appealable to this court, even although the court be unanimous; while the unanimous judgment of the same court affirming a conviction for murder is not subject to such appeal. Manifestly the test which Parliament has applied in determining in what cases an appeal shall lie to this court is not the relative gravity of judgments as affecting the interests of the parties. The truth is that in the matter of the appealability of judgments a set of considerations has always been regarded as applicable to criminal proceedings which admittedly has no application or very limited application to proceedings of a different character. The \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d (accordingly) treats the subject of appeals to the Supreme Court in criminal matters as belonging to and governed by the same considerations as the general subject of appeals in such matters (or, in other words, as an integral part of the subject of criminal procedure) and therefore as proper to be dealt with in the Criminal Code; a manner of treatment of course in no wise fitting in respect of appeals from judgments in provincial penal proceedings. It may be noticed in passing that one circumstance which unquestionably has weighed with legislators in dealing with the subject of appeals in criminal matters in an exceptional way is the fact that the prerogative of pardon in itself affords some security against manifest injustice. This prerogative as exercisable by the Governor-General in Council under the advice of Canadian Ministers and under the control of the Dominion Parliament has, of course, nothing to do with judgments given in proceedings taken under the authority of a provincial statute.\nThen I understand it is suggested that section 62 of the Act which confers jurisdiction in habeas corpus upon the judges of this court in resp\u00e9ct of commitments in \u201ccriminal cases under any Act of the Parliament of Canada\u201d in some way supports the inference that the phrase \u201ccriminal case\u201d as used in section 36 is not used in the strict sense. The suggestion as I understand it is that because the scope of the phrase is restricted by express words in section 62 it must be given the broadest meaning of which it is capable in the other sections. But the truth is that for some reason Parliament when conferring original jurisdiction upon the judges of this court in habeas corpus in criminal matters, determined to restrict that jurisdiction to criminal matters of a particular class or to commitments of a particular class, and to give effect to that purpose used appropriate qualifying words. Giving the phrase \u201ccriminal case\u201d the narrowest conceivable interpretation the qualifying words were absolutely essential to give effect to the legislative intention; and one has some difficulty in understanding why the use of such necessary qualifying words can be supposed to have any relevancy touching the construction of this phrase when standing alone. If Parliament had used in section 62 the phrase \u201ccriminal case\u201d simply without qualification that language construed in the strictest manner would have given a larger jurisdiction than Parliament intended to give. The restriction, therefore, has really no bearing whatever upon the construction to be given to the same phrase when found in other parts of the Act.\nFor these reasons we have, in my judgment, jurisdiction to entertain the appeal before us. On the merits I think the appeal must be dismissed. The statutory provision relied upon was not intended, in my opinion, to exclude any evidence which, if the statute had not passed, would have been lawfully admissible on the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused in respect of the offence charged. I am unable myself to understand upon what ground it can be disputed that it was open to the prosecution to shew as bearing upon the character of the accused\u2019s possession of the liquor found on her premises that she had previously kept liquor on the same premises for the purpose of sale. Nor can I understand upon what principle it can be held that a judgment determining that fact against her in a proceeding to which the Crown and she were parties \u2014 I am unable to understand, I say, upon what principle it can be contended that such a judgment would not be admissible evidence for the purpose of proving that fact. But assuming that a previous conviction would not be legal evidence of previous possession for the purpose of sale, how far does that carry us? The magistrate permitted the question to be asked in a general way whether or not there had been previous convictions against her in respect of the same premises. He also admitted evidence to the effect that it was the common report that the accused kept liquor for sale on those premises. If the magistrate erred in the first mentioned instance, does not the first mentioned error stand in the same category as the second? Is it anything more than an instance of the improper admission of evidence? The magistrate was not engaged upon any substantive enquiry into the charge that there had been an earlier conviction. He was engaged in taking evidence relevant as he thought upon the trial of the charge before him. I think nothing occurred which amounted to an inquiry into the charge of a former conviction within the meaning of the statute. I express no opinion upon the question whether there being non-compliance with the statutory provision the effect of such non-compliance would or would not be to deprive the magistrate of jurisdiction.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014In my opinion we have not jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because, assuming that the order of Mr. Justice Graham for a return by the keeper of the common gaol, made under the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, chapter 181, section 3(2), should be deemed the equivalent of a \u201cwrit of habeas corpus\u201d for the purpose of clause (c) of section 39 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d the judgment appealed from was rendered \u201cin a case of proceedings * * * arising out of a criminal charge\u201d within the meaning of that phrase as used in that clause. The appellant was convicted of having unlawfully kept intoxicating liquor for sale contrary to the provisions of the \u201cNova Scotia Temperance Act\u201d of 1910 after a previous conviction for a like offence. Under that Act, and an amendment of 1911, this is made an offence punishable by imprisonment with or without hard labour, without the option of a fine. That the statutory offence thus created constituted a crime, as that term is ordinarily understood in English law, admits of little doubt.\nThe proper definition of the word \u201ccrime\u201d is an offence for which the law awards punishment. Mann v. Owen[14], at page 602, per Littledale J.\nSee also The Queen v. Tyler and International Commercial Co.[15], at pages 594-5, per Bowen L.J.; and Easton\u2019s Case[16]. The proceedings against the appellant arose out of what would commonly be deemed \u201ca criminal charge,\u201d and she is \u201ca criminal prisoner.\u201d Osborne v. Millman[17]; Reg. v. Sparham[18]; Reg. v. Roddy[19]; Reg. v. Sullivan[20].\nIt has been recognized in several decisions of the Judicial Committee that provincial legislatures in passing statutes of which the principal matter is within one of the classes of subjects assigned to them by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d may include, under the authority of sub-section 15 of section 92 of that Act, provisions of a criminal character without offending against sub-section 27 of section 91, which assigns to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament the field of \u201ccriminal law.\u201d Hodge v. The Queen[21], at page 133. As put by Ramsay J. in Pope v. Griffith[22]:\u2014\nIn one sense of the word, the act of which appellant is accused (keeping liquors for sale without a license) is a crime; but it is equally plain that it is not a crime in the sense of sub-sec. 27 of sec. 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nIn Russell v. The Queen[23], at page 840, Sir Montague Smith, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, appears to endorse Mr. Benjamin\u2019s designation of provisions such as that now under consideration as \u201cprovincial criminal law.\u201d As put by the present Chief Justice of Canada, in Ouimet v. Bazin[24], at page 505:\u2014\nIt must be accepted as settled that \u201ccriminal law\u201d in the widest and fullest sense, is reserved for the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament, subject to an exception of the legislation which is necessary for the purpose of enforcing, whether by fine, penalty or imprisonment, any of the laws validly made under the \u201cenumerative heads\u201d of sec. 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d 1867.\nThe facts that the \u201ccriminal law\u201d is assigned by the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to the Federal Parliament and that the offence of which the appellant was convicted is the creation of a provincial legislature do not, therefore, involve the conclusion that that offence is not a crime or that the proceedings against the appellant did not arise \u201cout of a criminal charge.\u201d\nExcept a suggestion that section 39(c) and section 62 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d are mutually complementary, and embrace the whole field of habeas corpus jurisdiction\u2014an idea which, as I shall presently point out, is based on a misapprehension\u2014I have neither heard nor do I know of anything which would indicate that the words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d are used in section 39(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d in any restricted sense or with any other than their ordinary legal meaning. That is in itself a sufficient reason for giving that meaning to them. Vestry of St. John, Hampstead v. Cotton[25], at page 6; The King v. Judge Whitehorne[26], at page 830. Moreover, I find several indications in the statute itself that these words are intended to have their widest signification. By section 62 every judge of this court is given original jurisdiction to issue\na writ of habeas corpus ad subjicidum for the purpose of inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe form of this provision indicates two things:\u2014\n1. That when Parliament meant to limit the application of the word \u201ccriminal,\u201d it said so; and\n2. That section 62 and section 39(c) are not mutually complementary.\nWhen the Supreme Court was established in 1875 the original habeas corpus jurisdiction, now provided for by section 62, was conferred. (See section 51 of the Act of 1875.) At that time a great deal of indisputably criminal law, which has since been codified, was not the subject of any Act of the Parliament of Canada. At the present time there remains a body of criminal law of some importance which is not covered by the Criminal Code, or by any other federal statute. (See Criminal Code, sections 10 et seq.) It is therefore obvious that in certain criminal cases this court has neither original nor appellate jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings, and there is no ground for the contention that section 39 (c) should be given a construction which would extend our appellate jurisdiction to all cases not within section 62. That is simply impossible. Parliament has in the former provision deliberately omitted the qualifying words \u201cunder any Act of the Parliament of Canada,\u201d which are found in the latter. Why then should we restrict the meaning of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d in section 39(c). to a charge of an offence such that only the Dominion Parliament could create or deal with it? The purpose of Parliament would appear to have been to confine our jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters of a criminal character to those cases in which jurisdiction is expressly conferred by section 62, which now embraces many cases of crime to which section 51 of the original Act did not apply\u2014to place upon our appellate jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters a restriction similar to that imposed on the jurisdiction of the English Court of Appeal by section 47 of the \u201cJudicature Act.\u201d Ex parte Woodhall[27]; Ex parte Schofield[28]; Seaman v. Burley[29]; Rex v. D\u2019Eyncourt[30]. The word \u201ccriminal\u201d is, I think, used in section 39(c) in contradistinction to the word \u201ccivil\u201d and connotes a proceeding which is not civil in its character. The proceeding against the appellant was of this class. I am therefore, of the opinion that she cannot invoke the jurisdiction conferred by that section.\nI base my judgment on this ground rather than on the ground that the order of Graham J., should not be deemed the equivalent of a writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of clause (c) of section 39, because the strict construction of that clause, which I understand that some of my learned brothers favour, might result in our being deprived of jurisdiction to hear appeals in cases of certiorari and prohibition from provinces in which writs of certiorari and prohibition have been abolished, or are not now in use, having been superseded by the modern \u201corder of the court or a judge.\u201d (See Ont. Consolidated Rules, Nos. 1100 and 1101.) Without much further consideration I am not prepared to accept the view that our jurisdiction has been thus curtailed.\nIt was strongly urged on behalf of the respondent that, since the intent with which the liquor found on the appellant\u2019s premises was kept by her is the gist of the offence of which she has been convicted, in order to establish that intent evidence of her having been formerly convicted of a similar offence was admissible and that the casual and incidental introduction of such evidence on behalf of the prosecutor in a general form and without particulars, while the defendant was on trial for a subsequent offence, charged as such, and before she had been convicted of such subsequent offence, was not contrary to the purpose of the legislature in prescribing with notable particularity the procedure to be followed in such cases, and did not vitiate the whole proceeding before the magistrate, rendering the conviction void and the imprisonment under it illegal. I believe one of my learned brothers takes this view. While I wish to refrain from expressing a judicial opinion on the merits of an appeal which I think we have not jurisdiction to entertain, I desire not to be understood to accede to these propositions of the learned counsel for the respondent.\nBrodeur J.\u2014After a great deal of hesitation I have come to the conclusion that the judgment a quo has not been rendered in a case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, and I concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice Idington.\nSome of my colleagues are quashing this appeal on the ground that the proceedings for the discharge of the appellant arose out of a criminal charge though based on a provincial statute.\nI do not think it would be advisable to decide this most important point. It was not mentioned in the factums of the parties and it was not discussed at bar, and I would not like to commit myself to such a proposition unless it would be fully argued.\nThe effect of such a decision might curtail the legislative powers of the provinces, because if all the provincial penal laws are criminal it might mean that the procedure in respect thereto under the provisions of sub-section 27 of section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d should be made by the Federal Parliament.\nAt the same time it may be argued that the Federal Parliament in giving us an appellate jurisdiction on writs of habeas corpus excluded the criminal cases because it had given original jurisdiction to judges of this court to issue the writ of habeas corpus in criminal matters, and in speaking in section 39 of criminal charges it simply referred to the criminal laws that were under its control and not to what has been called criminal provincial laws.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\n[1] 46 N.S.

On stock being taken by the parties the plaintiff was unable to produce invoices for a large portion of the goods, but insisted that their prices could be ascertained from private markings on the packages which, she alleged, represented the prices taken from the missing invoices. Differences arose between the parties respecting the prices of these goods, but the inventory was closed with the prices, as they had been marked on the packages, carried into the valuation columns. The defendants refused to complete the purchase on account of failure to produce the invoices in question and the action was brought to recover damages for breach of the contract.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (2 D.L.R. 293; 1 West. W.R. 1103), Duff J. dissenting, that the consent of the defendants to the closing of the inventory with the prices in question stated according to the information obtained from the private markings constituted satisfactory proof of the fulfilment of the original agreement and, consequently, damages could be recovered for breach of the contract to purchase.\nPer Duff J. dissenting.\u2014There could be no contract capable of enforcement until the prices of the whole of the stock had been ascertained in the manner contemplated by the agreement, and the closing of the inventory with prices supplied from the unverified statements of the plaintiff did not constitute a new contract varying the condition in the agreement as to the fixing of the prices to be paid. Therefore, no action could lie to recover damages for breach of the contract to purchase. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe action was to recover damages for breach of a contract to purchase a stock of merchandise and the trade fixtures in a shop in Vancouver, B.C. The circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions raised on the appeal are fully discussed in the judgments now reported.\nNewcombe K.C. appeared for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. and W. L. Scott for the respondents.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think this appeal must be allowed. I agree with the opinion of Chief Justice MacDonald in the Court of Appeal and see no ground for imputing any dishonesty in the transaction in question to the appellant or to those who acted for her.\nThe appellant was unable, it is true, to produce all the invoices shewing the prices at which she had bought the goods, but she gave the best evidence in her power and the production of these missing invoices was not insisted upon at the stocktaking by the parties. The custom of the appellant had been to mark the boxes containing goods and other packages and parcels with the selling price and also with a private mark representing the cost price. Bergeron, one of the respondents, had been with the appellant in the store for nearly a month before the stocktaking, with every opportunity afforded him of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the business and merchandise he had contracted to purchase. The inference I draw from the evidence, which I have carefully read, is that in the cases where disputes arose as to the cost price and the invoices could not be produced, these disputes were practically settled either by reference to the private marks on the packages shewing the cost price, or by the decisions of Mr. French, who was called in by both parties to determine what should be allowed. These disputes I gather were, considering the quantity of the goods in question, comparatively few. The conclusion I reached from a perusal of the evidence was that they arose from the fact of Periard having paid more for some classes of her goods than a close and good buyer could have purchased them at.\nBut this, if true, would not justify the purchasers in repudiating their contract, which was that they would pay Periard for her \"merchandise at the rate of one hundred and ten cents on the dollar invoice price.\" This was subsequently increased to $1.13 to cover freight charges. Whether, therefore, the Periards had purchased skilfully and closely or improvidently and carelessly had nothing to do with the question of prices. The one thing that had to be determined was what had been bon\u00e2 fide paid by Periard as the purchase price of the goods.\nMy conclusions were, after considering the whole evidence, that the appellant had, on the stocktaking, given the best evidence she could of the cost prices of the goods and that though there was much wrangling over some of these prices they were adjusted and settled more or less satisfactorily with the aid and assistance, when he was called in, of Mr. French.\nI think the true secret of the attempted repudiation by the respondents of their contract to purchase this stock of goods lies in the fact that the total amount of the purchase money was found largely to exceed that which was anticipated.\nMy conclusion is that the question of the non\u2014production of the invoices was only resorted to as an excuse to escape from a bargain the obligations of which were found, after stocktaking, to be much heavier than had been anticipated.\nI would allow the appeal and remit the case back for assessment of plaintiff's damages.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Undue importance was attached in the courts below to the evidence of Mr. French. In answer to a question as to how much of the time of stocktaking he was present at, he says:\u2014\nNot a great deal of the time. I was busy attending to my own business. I was sent for, as I say, possibly four or five times. I think the first day I was up there a couple of times, and I don't think any more. I was up in the morning once, and in the afternoon, and possibly the next day about the same. It may have been four or five times that I went up altogether. My man that works with me was up there assisting.\nAnd in answer to a question relative to the substantial quantities of goods he had spoken of, he says:\nOh, yes \u2014 fair quantities \u2014 particularly the hosiery, there was a considerable quantity of that there, and the shirts I cannot recollect how many dozens there were of those \u2014 and the ties there was a considerable number of them.\nWhen we find that the stocktaking had involved three days of preparatory arrangement of said stock, and then parts of three days thereafter, making in all two full days' work for the staff employed by both parties checking it over and setting down the results in the lists used by each party; that the character of the stock was so varied as to embrace gents' furnish- ing and boots and shoes, and clothing, and other things which, in the whole, made a total of nearly $18,000 estimated value; that an examination of the stock-lists so made out discloses, when roughly estimated, nearly four thousand entries of different items; that the witness French was only professing to be an expert as to classes of the goods involving, according to his own estimate, one-half of the total stock, and was called upon only in respect of disputed items of such half; that of the half-dozen things he was called to give an opinion upon some were satisfactorily explained; and that as to each and every one of such, according to the evidence of a number of witnesses, including Corderoy, the accountant, called by the respondent, the prices reached after hearing him (Mr. French) were set down in the list as settled, it seems impossible to rightly give much weight to his evidence as a determining factor in support of the judgment in the case.\nThere was not a single item of the thousands in question in the stocktaking reserved for future consideration, and no mark or note made of remonstrance for want of invoice or objection in that regard or otherwise.\nAnd when we find these occasional appeals to Mr. French resorted to and that coupled with absence of record or note of any sort of objection in other instances, surely it must be concluded that these others had all been satisfactorily adjusted between those engaged in the work.\nThe calling him in to help to settle differences in half-a-dozen cases demonstrates how the parties concerned had felt and acted at the time relatively to the other items. Mr. French denies being a party to any settling or agreement in the result, as to the items regarding which he was called upon to give his opinion, but he cannot and does not swear they were not adjusted.\nI pressed respondents' counsel to explain the absence of any record of objectionable items and he frankly and properly admitted he could not and that such a record would be what one might expect if permanent importance were to be attached to the objection relative to the want of invoices.\nThe erroneous taking of French's opinion on what the legal meaning of so plain and ordinary a phrase as \"invoice price\" implies seems to have misled the court. This was a purchase on a basis of price ascertainable either by the production of the original invoice, or such satisfactory evidence as would convince fair-minded business men skilled in such business of the truth of what the original invoice had, or of necessity must have, exhibited if correctly made out.\nNeither party could be bound by an error in the original or deprived of his bargain because of the destruction of the original piece of paper. The price that appeared or ought to have appeared therein was the basis to be used. If Mr. French had made such a bargain and was deeply impressed with the idea that he had made one which should yield him a profit of ten thousand dollars, for example, and it was found when time arrived for taking stock that a thief had removed all original invoices, or other destruction, of which the vendor was innocent, had overtaken them, and his vendor had been tempted to re-sell the goods at an advance of five thousand dollars and set up the impossibility of producing the invoices as a defence or reason excusing himself from observing the contract, I must be permitted to think he (Mr. French) would be constrained to see the absurdity of what he so persistently maintained in his evidence. True, he finally, under pressure, lessened his pretension, but that pretension and its sorry consequences seem, I respectfully submit, to have borne fruit.\nIt is to be observed that the evidence for the appellant shews that the invoice prices were discoverable from the private markings on the goods, or boxes holding them, that the respondent Bergeron had, as agreed, been engaged as a clerk in the shop for a month preceding the stocktaking, had been given every opportunity for acquainting himself with such marks, inspecting the goods, verifying the systems, and invoices, and comparing the latter with these markings, and that Erisman, a fellow clerk, describes very well how he had availed himself of his opportunity and ends his account of what had transpired by saying:\u2014\nWell, really, Mr. Bergeron and I took stock of the whole store before the stocktaking took place.\nBergeron was called for the defence after this witness had given such evidence, but never ventured a word of either denial or explanation of what Erisman says.\nIt seems, I submit, rather an impudent thing on his part, after such an opportunity for investigation, and that investigation, to impute fraud to the appellant and fail so signally, not only to make no proof, but not even to try, and shew in a single instance, that the private markings in truth had been deliberately made to appear different from the original invoice.\nIt is absurd to suppose any merchant would in ordinary practice systematically put upon his goods or cases a false instead of the true private marking, which is intended only for the use of himself or his servants. It could only deceive himself.\nIt is conceivable that a systematic fraud of that kind might be resorted to by a man intending to sell his stock, but inconceivable he should invite his purchaser to spend a month in his shop and be given every opportunity to detect it. And there is not a word even from Bergeron, who had such opportunity of discovery to suggest that a single change had been made in such markings. It is sworn by Erisman that Bergeron had, whilst so engaged in his own investigation, gone over \"those invoices,\" meaning, no doubt, those invoices to be had relative to what he had examined. If he could have shewn a false system had been adopted, or even a few instances suggesting it, no doubt he would gladly have done so. He would not then have had to set up such a cry as is made about the palpable mistake of a few shirts put in the wrong box. If there was an intention to commit fraud in the way suggested it was about as easily detected as possible to conceive of.\nI go further and submit that it was the duty of the respondents to have exposed the fraud if it existed. If half the energy put by the respondents' solicitors into the fortnight of correspondence that ensued had been applied to investigate such a charge and to demonstrate its truth they could easily have done so if any foundation had existed for it. In the event of failure they ought to have submitted another alternative than this litigation.\nI conclude from reading and considering every bit of evidence in this case that the defendants never had any reason to say that they were being unfairly dealt with in the matter of the invoices. Their own conduct throughout destroys the pretension and makes it sound hollow.\nIf they had held over any items for production of invoices, had called for account books to verify anything, had specified certain items or varieties of the stock-in-trade and, where invoices were wanting, had insisted on duplicates as means of testing the questions involved, or done in short anything that ordinary business men anxious to complete a bargain would likely have done under the circumstances, then suspicion or surmise as to their motives might have been in order.\nOn the contrary without, so far as the evidence shews, anything of that kind having influenced the action of the defendants or been present to the mind of Mr. French, he called defendants aside at the close of the stocktaking and said the deal could not go through.\nIt was he who acted and not they. They knew from hour to hour over three days such, if any, difficulties as want of invoices had created. It had produced no operative effect on their minds.\nHe, as I have shewn, knew very little of what had transpired. And as to want of any invoice, he had called for them twice, he thinks, and failed once to get them produced; whether one item or what is not explained.\nBut, to do Mr. French justice, he says it seemed as if they \"could not produce the invoices\" asked for and not produced, and he shews that he had no proper opportunity of deciding as to the validity of such a contention as is raised. Then he says that, at the close of the stocktaking, he called defendants aside and told them \"we (meaning, I take it, the firms he represented) could not go on,\" and then adds:\u2014\nI also had a conversation with Mr. Periard in which I told him unless he could alter his prices and make the thing a little more satisfactory than it was then that I would not have anything to do with it, and I would not advise these men to go on with it paying the price they were paying for the stock;\nhe says also that Periard and his daughter came to see him in his office another day and, though he cannot recall the conversation exactly, believes he told the man at the time\nthat I did not care to go on with the thing as long as he was taking the stand he was in regard to prices.\nSuch was the attitude of French, who had from the inception been the directing mind.\nIt was not the want of invoices to verify prices, but the prices and the result of a total which he had not expected.\nAppellant may have been loaded up with too much old stock at high prices, compared with what French's backers could have supplied such a stock for. And adding 13% to these prices when the total reached nearly $18,000, and a couple of thousand more for fixtures, and thus made the total figures rather high for men who had calculated on, and only provided for, fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars all told.\nIt is quite clear that that was the true situation and it was a surprise. French had undertaken to acquire for respondents a business on the unusual terms of invoice price plus 13%, which might not be an extravagant thing if applied to a small stock with the purpose of expanding the business after acquisition, but when applied to a large one, probably the safe limit to carry in any case, and not permitting expan- sion meant, using French's own words, \"commercial suicide.\"\nHe never ventured, when shewn the result, to challenge Periard to produce evidence of the actual invoice prices and that then he would pay.\nAnd when the matter passed into the hands of the respondents' solicitors they insisted on \"invoices or copies of same,\" a thing probably impossible in many cases, and waived aside appellant's suggestion of verification \"in any reasonable way\" in cases where in voices could not be produced. This proposal ought to have been accepted.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the courts below and judgment be directed for appellant and the case remitted for assessment of damages with costs thereof to the appellant.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Morrison J. by which the appellant's action\u2014for the recovery of damages for breach of contract to purchase a stock of goods in Vancouver\u2014was dismissed. The contract upon which the action was brought is contained in three letters, set out in the statement of claim as follows:\u2014\nVancouver, June 1st, 1910.\nA. J. Periard,\nAttorney for S. Periard,\nVancouver.\nDear Sir,\u2014We, the undersigned, beg to submit the following proposition for the purchase of your stock of merchandise contained in the premises known as 135 Hastings St. East. We will pay you for said merchandise at the rate of one hundred and ten cents on the dollar, invoice price ($1.10). Fixtures to be taken at a valuation. Each party to have them valued. Failing to come to an agreement, the matter to be left in the hands of a third party by mutual consent. Terms of sale to be half cash on taking possession of the business, and the balance at the rate of one thousand dollars per month ($1,000), bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent (7%) per annum on approved notes, with the option of paying all cash at the time of taking possession. The date of said possession to be August 1, '10, or sooner, if so desired, or not later than the 15th of August. You to agree to immediately cancel all goods purchased by you for the coming fall, and to reduce the stock in the interval of taking possession as much as possible. One of the purchasers to have the privilege of working in the store during the month of July.\nIn consideration of this offer, we enclose our marked cheque for one hundred dollars ($100).\nAwaiting your reply by letter, we remain,\nYours truly,\nNOAH BERGERON.\nW. RICKSON.\nWitness:\nA. French.\nVancouver, June 1st, 1910.\nMessrs. Bergeron & Rickson,\nVancouver.\nDear Sirs,\u2014Replying to your letter of this date. I hereby accept your offer for my stock at the rate of $1.10 cents on the dollar, with 3% added for freight. And I further want the sum of $2,000 deposited in any chartered bank as an evidence of good faith on your part. I will also deposit a like sum as an evidence of good faith on my part.\nThe other conditions of sale mentioned in your letter are quite satisfactory to me.\nYours truly,\nS. E. PERIARD.\nA. J. PERIARD,\nAttorney.\nWitness:\nA. French\nVancouver, June 2, 1910.\nA. J. Periard,\nAttorney of E. S. Periard,\nVancouver.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your letter of the 2nd inst. we beg to say that we accept the terms as laid down by you, viz., the 3% for freight, and we have deposited the sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) in the Merchants Bank of Canada here to your credit, pending the taking over of the stock by us.\nYours truly,\nNOAH BERGERON.\nW. RICKSON.\nThe learned trial judge held that it was a condition of the contract that the appellant should produce reasonably satisfactory evidence of the prices at which the goods comprising her stock had been purchased by her in time to enable the purchasers to complete the contract and take possession at the date fixed in the first letter; and that the appellant had not produced such evidence and had given the purchasers reasonable grounds for thinking that her husband, who acted for her, was not acting in good faith in the matter of the information furnished by him respecting the prices alleged to have been paid for the goods and consequently that the respondents were justified in terminating the agreement. In the Court of Appeal Irving J. agreed with the trial judge. Galliher J. was unable to say that the trial judge was wrong, and McDonald C.J. thought the judgment of the trial judge ought to be reversed on the ground that, in the last week of July, the goods were gone over by the husband of the appellant and the respondents and that an inventory was made in which were entered the prices which the parties agreed were to be paid for the goods and that this agreement the appellant is entitled to enforce; and the contention in this court was that the appellant is entitled to succeed upon that ground. I think this view cannot be sustained and that the appeal ought to be dismissed.\nThe prices at which the goods, according to the agreement of June, were purchased were the \"invoice prices\" plus 10%. Until these prices were ascer- tained with sufficient precision to fix the amount to be paid by the respondents in figures there could, of course, be no completion of the contract; and it is quite obvious that the contract contemplated the ascertainment of these prices before the time fixed for completion, the first, or at latest the 15th, of August. The information, moreover, which would be required for this purpose being presumably in the possession of the appellant, the contract further contemplates that it shall be produced by her. It is not necessary to say that she was bound in every case to produce the original invoice, but it is clear that the respondents were, in cases in which invoices could not be obtained, entitled to some reasonable substitute, something which a business man would regard as satisfactory evidence of the price paid for the goods. The respondents were not bound to accept the appellant's own unverified statement; the appellant, on the other hand, was clearly bound to give, in good faith, every reasonable assistance to the respondents to enable them to get at the true facts.\nAs regards a large portion of the goods (the respondents say 50%, and the appellant admits 25%), it is quite clear that invoices were not produced. Nor is it suggested that in such cases there was any satisfactory evidence of what the prices paid actually were. The appellant must, therefore, succeed, if she can succeed at all, on the ground that the parties had agreed upon some other way of fixing the price of the property sold; and it is, as I have said, argued that this was done by agreement between the parties.\nThe inventory referred to contained an enumeration of goods and prices set opposite them. It was stated by the appellant's husband, her daughter (and by one or two other witnesses who were in her employ at the time) that these prices were assigned only after the parties had agreed to them as the prices the appellant should receive under the contract. This is contradicted by all the witnesses called by the respondents. One of these witnesses, a Mr. French, is a partner in one of the two well-known firms of manufacturers who were financing the respondents, and he was present during part of the time while the inventory was being compiled. The learned trial judge has accepted his evidence as reliable and I do not think there is the slightest ground for casting a doubt upon his candour.\nHis evidence is as follows:\u2014\nI called on Mr. Periard on Saturday, and he said he would be ready to take stock on Monday, and on Monday we went up with Mr. Bergeron and Mr. Rickson and Mr. Corderoy, and Mr. Periard said he would not allow us in the store, as he proposed to take stock himself before we went in, and that consumed three days. On Thursday we were allowed to go in, and we were not there probably more than five minutes before a dispute arose about invoices which were not produced, and this continued throughout the two days, I may say. I was not there all the time, but I was frequently sent for and called up to try and settle disputes that arose between them. This lasted up until Friday afternoon, when they were through. * * *They claim, I believe, that I settled these prices and passed them, and I certainly did not.\nQ. By Mr. Reid: What is the last?\nA. They claim, I believe, that I agreed to these prices. I certainly did not, it would have been absurd.\nCourt: Those are the prices in the stock list?\nWitness: Those are the prices put down in the book\u2014taken down.\nCourt: And you did not agree to that?\nA. No. There was so much disputing, and so much unpleasantness, that if we had not gone down and got the thing put down in some shape we would probably have been there now, trying to get it settled. I thought when I got through that I would have been able to make some reasonable settlement with Mr. Periard, but the further matters went the worse they were getting, and when they got into other lines that I did not know anything about the same disputes were cropping up, but these I can only speak of that I know of.\n* * * * * *\nCourt: And you got them?\nA. No, I only saw the one invoice; that was the underwear, that Mr. Rickson insisted on getting.\nQ. Now, what was Miss Periard's attitude on the question of producing invoices?\nA. Well, it appeared to me that they just simply could not produce them.\nQ. Now, do you know whether this stock sheet was ever approved of by Rickson & Bergeron?\nA. It certainly was not approved by them. It was not approved when we got through because I said, \"We cannot go on.\"\nMr. Reid: I object. Who did you tell?\nCourt: Just wait.\u2014 Was Mr. Periard there when you told something to some one?\nWitness: No, I called Rickson and Bergeron to one side, and told them we could not go on, and I also had a conversation with Mr. Periard in which I told him unless he could alter his prices and make the thing a little more satisfactory than it was then that I would not have anything to do with it, and I would not advise these men to go on with it, paying the price they were paying for the stock. And Mr. Periard, I believe, took the construction from one of my remarks that these men could not finance it. Well, that was not right. We had $20,000 in sight, and could have got more, if necessary. But I would not have anything to do with it, or would not allow either of the firms I was representing to go into the thing and take over the stock at what it was listed down at.\nQ. Then you thought, Mr. French, that Mr. Periard ought to be compensated in some way?\nA. Yes and no. I did not think that Mr. Periard acted in good faith with us, because, as far as damages are concerned, these other men purchased goods to the extent of several thousand dollars.\nCourt: That is the defendants?\nA. Yes, they advertised that they were going into business. We ourselves shipped goods to Vancouver for them, and we lost money, because they had to be sold for the cost less the freight. They had made all their arrangements to go into business, and they were acting in good faith and I don't think that Mr. Periard was acting in good faith, and as far as damages are concerned it is horse and horse with them. But I did think, and I do think, as these men were leaving the matter pretty much in my hands\u2014\nCourt: The defendants?\nA. Yes.\nCourt: Well, just refer to them as that. A. Yes. When I took in the situation, and saw the trouble we were going to have, I do think that I make a mistake in not stopping right there \u2014 at the very commencement, when the trouble and disputes arose. In the first place, Mr. Peniard had no right to close up his store Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and not allow us to go in; it is a thing I never heard of in the mercantile business before, I never heard of a seller refusing the purchaser the right to go in and take stock with them.\nQ. On what ground did you think that an offer should be made to Mr. Peniard for compensation?\nA. For the two days that they had him closed. I said: \"Give him what he thinks is reasonable,\" and I suggested this matter of settlement with Mr. Periard, but Mr. Periard had his head full of this $2,000 that was in the bank, and he said he was going to have it and the matter ended there.\nBoth Bergeron and Rickson also deny that they agreed upon the prices put into the inventory, and this evidence was accepted and acted on by the trial judge. The evidence on behalf of the appellant on the other hand was not accepted and was distinctly discredited by the trial judge, who took the view that the appellant's family (who were really in charge of the business) were not acting in good faith. There are several instances given by French of what would appear to have been rather bold attempts at overcharging in respect of classes of goods with which he was familiar and I agree with Mr. Justice Irving in thinking that the learned judge's view is supported by the evidence as it appears in the record.\nThe learned trial judge evidently thought that the respondents having made their arrangements to take over the appellant's business and desiring, if possible, not to withdraw from the project (entailing, as such a course would necessarily, not a little loss to themselves), went on with the inventory even after they became aware that the appellant was not living up to the contract in the matter of the verification of prices in the hope that a satisfactory arrangement might ultimately be reached; and that neither party entertained the idea that the respondents by the part they took in connection with the inventory were irrevocably committing themselves to purchase at the unverified prices entered in it. That this was so appears to me to be demonstrated by the subsequent conduct of the parties. The appellant's husband and daughter admit that they were informed by French, shortly after the completion of the inventory, that the respondents would not go on with the purchase on account of the absence of invoices. Almost immediately a correspondence ensued between the solicitors for the appellants and the solicitors for the respondents.\nThe respondents' solicitor at once took the position that the agreement had fallen through because of the failure of the appellant to produce evidence of the cost prices of the goods, and proceeded to discuss a fresh arrangement. To this position he adhered throughout the two weeks during which the correspondence lasted. The appellant's solicitor insisted that she was under no obligation to produce invoices, but nowhere is there a suggestion that the parties have agreed upon the inventory prices. The whole correspondence, indeed, is inexplicable on that assumption. In a letter of August 1st, Mr. Reid, who acted for the appellant, proposes to leave the question of\nwhat is the invoice price of any goods concerning which the invoice cannot be produced to arbitration,\nand proceeds to say that \"she contends\" not that the invoice price of such goods has been settled by agreement, but that\nthe exact invoice price has in all cases been affixed to the articles in question. On the same day he writes:\u2014\nWe deny the inability to produce invoices to carry out the agreement for sale or that the agreement for sale requires the production of invoices.\nNot a word about prices having been agreed upon.\nAgain, on August 4th:\u2014\nIs it necessary to again point out that the production of invoices is not required by the contract? An inventory has been made out, submitted, checked over and verified by your clients, and in a great majority of cases the prices have been verified by invoices. There are some cases where the invoices cannot be found. In these cases, if your clients think that the prices put by my clients are not the correct invoice prices, the matter may be verified in any reasonable way.\nNot easily reconcilable with the contention that the inventory prices had at that time been accepted by the purchasers.\nThen, on August 9th:\u2014\nWe find on consultation with our clients that about 75% of the stock can be vouched for by invoices, and that these were passed by your clients when stocktaking was done.\nThis by implication is a distinct admission that the only items \"passed\" by the respondents were those in respect of which invoices were produced.\nThese passages are consistent with the general tenor of the letters and they appear to be incompatible with the hypothesis on which the contention I am considering is based. The attitude indicated by these letters was not departed from by the appellant down to the trial. The respondents in their defence set up the failure of the appellant to produce evidence of \"invoice price.\" In reply the appellant dealt specifically with this defence by simply denying the facts alleged; there is no suggestion of an agreement to purchase at the inventory prices nor of waiver of the production of invoices, or evidence of \"invoice price.\" It is impossible to believe (if the appellant's husband had really understood the respondents were binding themselves to accept the prices appearing in the inventory), that the appellant's solicitor could have so long remained in ignorance of this crucial point.\nAll these considerations convince me that the appellant's contention has no substantial basis and I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Although I was, at the close of the argument, inclined to the view that this appeal should be dismissed, after carefully reading the evidence several times I am convinced that the conclusion in the defendants' favour reached by the British Columbia courts was erroneous and that the dissent of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal was well founded.\nAssuming that the defendants were prima facie entitled to have the prices of the stock which they had purchased vouched by the production of invoices, I am satisfied that in cases where such invoices were called for on the stocktaking and were not forthcoming, production of them was waived and either the prices demanded by the plaintiff were accepted or compromise prices were then agreed upon and such prices were thereupon inserted in the stock list. When the stocktaking was completed, on the Saturday afternoon, the prices of the entire stock had been settled and the defendants did not then take the stand that they would require the production of such invoices as the plaintiff had failed to exhibit. Neither did they keep any question of prices open by protest or other step taken for that purpose. It was not until the following Monday; when the defendants and their backer, French, had determined, for an entirely different reason, to escape from their bargain, that they brought forward the failure to produce certain invoices as a pretext for repudiating the contract. The real difficulty was that it then appeared that the plaintiff's stock would cost much more than the defendants had anticipated or had provided for and that at the unusually high figure they were paying for it \u2014 $1.13 on the dollar of invoice prices \u2014 the venture was likely to prove unprofitable, or much less profitable than they had expected. French, too, had then realized that with such a stock on the defendants' shelves their orders for his principals, manufacturers and wholesale dealers, could not be as extensive as he had hoped for and he probably began to doubt the wisdom of the latter advancing upwards of $12,000 to enable the defendants to carry out their purchase.\nI have no doubt that these were the true reasons why the defendants repudiated the contract. They were not warranted in doing so. Their attitude from the Monday after the stocktaking and their final letter of repudiation on the 16th of August justified the plaintiff in refraining from taking steps towards ascertaining the value of the fixtures by arbitration. The fact that in this letter the failure of the plaintiff to make a deposit of $2,000 \u2014 which it is admitted had been waived at an early stage of the negotiations \u2014 is put forward as one of the chief grounds for the defendants' withdrawal confirms me in the view that they were looking for excuses and that the objection based upon non\u2014production of invoices to verify prices and that based upon the plaintiff's failure to deposit $2,000 are of the same type \u2014 both of them pretexts to escape from an unsatisfactory bargain. I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother Idington. I concur in his views upon the effect of the evidence as a whole, and in his appreciation of the testimony of French, to which I fear the learned trial judge attached quite too much importance.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs to the plaintiff throughout and the action should be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the assessment of the plaintiff's damages according to the usual practice of that court.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014In selling her stock at invoice price, it does not necessarily follow that the appellant was bound to produce the invoices themselves.\nThe sale of the stock was made under the conditions which have become of a very common practice. No lump sum is stipulated, but the price is fixed at so much as the goods cost. In the cases where a merchant has been in business for many years, it would become absolutely impossible to shew the invoices or to establish their relation to the goods that are in the store.\nIn this case, however, if the invoices that would cover all the goods that were inventoried were not produced, a large number of them were shewn or could be shewn if they had been asked for. The parties relied evidently upon the cost prices that had been put on the boxes containing the goods.\nSome disputes arose as to the value of some of these goods; they seem to have been adjusted during the inventory. And if there is some doubt as to whether the prices mentioned in the inventory were accepted or not, the respondents had the opportunity as shewn by the correspondence to indicate later on the articles against the value of which they objected.\nThey refused to accept that proposition and preferred to stay their case on the ground that the invoices should be produced.\nThat question has already come up before the courts in England and we find a case of Plank v. Gavila(1), where the agreement provided that the commission of the plaintiff was to be fixed on the invoice price, it was held\nthat it was competent to the plaintiffs to shew the proximate value of the consignments upon which they claimed commission without producing the invoices.\nIt is evident to me that the respondents and their indorsers did not want to carry out the agreement after they found that the stock was larger than what they expected.\nThey at first claimed that the contract was at an end. But later on they saw how weak their position was in that respect and they carried on a correspondence which shewed very clearly their intention to repudiate their obligations. Because if they had been willing to stand by their contract they should have accepted the offer made by the appellant to arbitrate on the value of the goods in cases where they thought they were too high. No, they waited until the date which had been fixed for the delivery of the stock, and they formally declared that the plaintiffs not having put up a deposit and not having produced the invoices, they had to withdraw from the deal.\nThat claim as to the deposit is only a pretext, for it had been understood that such a deposit would not be made; and their request for the production of the invoices was not founded in law.\nI have come to the conclusion that the action in damages instituted by the appellant for breach of contract ought to be maintained.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below and the case sent back to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to assess the plaintiff's damages.\n[1] 2 D.L.R. 293; 1 West W.R. 1103\n"}

Tailby v. The Official Receiver, (13 App. Cas. 523,) followed.\nWhere a bank, in order to secure present or future advances to a customer, has taken from him an assignment vesting in it the legal title to a chose in action arising out of a contract and, subsequently, receives notice of another assignment thereof for valuable consideration by the customer to a third person, before moneys have been advanced upon the security held by the bank, the claim of the bank for advances made after notice is postponed to that of the other incumbrancer. Dearie v. Hall (3 Russ. 1); Hopkinson v. Rolt (9 H.L. Cas. 514); Bradford Banking Co. v. Briggs (12 App. Cas. 29), and West v. Williams ((1899) 1 Ch. 132), applied.\nWhere an assignee of a chose in action with knowledge that the same chose in action has also been assigned to another person for valuable consideration permits the other assignee to rely upon his security by acting on the faith of his assignment, without giving him notice of the former charge, the claim of the latter is entitled to priority over that of the assignee by whose conduct he has been thus misled. Russell v. Watts (10 App. Cas. 590), and Stronge v. Hawkes (4 DeG. M. & G. 186), applied. Per Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting.\u2014The circumstances of the case do not justify the finding that there was an equitable assignment of the chose in action to the appellant and there is no sufficient evidence of notice to the bank that there was any assignment to him; consequently, the assignment to the bank, which was duly notified to the debtor, gave the claim of the bank priority in respect of the advances made by it on that security.

Deeley v. Lloyds Bank ((1912) A.C. 756).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J., at the trial, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nIn the circumstances stated in the judgments now reported, the action was brought by the plaintiff, appellant, to recover moneys which he claimed as due to him for work performed and materials for the same furnished by him in the construction of a number of buildings for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company under a contract entered into between one William Garson, deceased, and the railway company, (alleging that the moneys arising out of that contract had been assigned to him by Garson,) and for a declaration that the moneys in question belonged to him and were not affected by an assignment of the same funds made by Garson to the bank. The action was against the bank and the railway company for the recovery of $7,830, part of the moneys earned under the contract which had been received and retained by the bank, and for the balance of $8,433.70 still owing by the railway company. The company deposited the latter amount in court to be disposed of in such manner as the judgment might direct. At the trial, the claim against the railway company was abandoned and the case proceeded against the bank alone. The plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed by the learned Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench, and his judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nM. G. Macneil for the appellant. No special form of words is necessary to constitute an equitable assignment, and it is clear that the appellant had such an assignment from Garson. Leake on Contracts (6 Can. ed.) 857; Hughes v. Chambers[2]. A verbal assignment is good against a subsequent written assignment. Heyd v. Millar[3]; Molsons Bank v. Carscaden[4]; Pollock, Contracts (8 ed.) 232.\nThe evidence clearly shews that the bank had knowledge of the assignment to Fraser, and notice thereof to the railway company is not necessary. As Garson had previously assigned the moneys to arise out of the Outlook contract, it cannot be said that he intended to assign or could assign the same funds to the bank. The reasons in the court below dealings with the question of non-assignability are quite beside the issue. Burck v. Taylor[5], and Re Turcan[6], have no application. Notice of assignment is necessary only for the protection of the debtor and, where that, protection is not required, the date of the assignment prevails. See In re Miller[7], per Wetmore C.J., at page 96. This decision was under a statute exactly similar to the provisions of sec. 39(e) and (\u0192) of the Manitoba \u201cKing\u2019s Bench Act,\u201d R.S.M., 1902, ch. 40. In Newman v. Newman[8], and Dearie v. Hall[9], there was an element of fraud; consequently, notice affected the priority. The rule in Dearie v. Hall9 cannot apply in view of the provisions of the Manitoba \u201cKing\u2019s Bench Act,\u201d referred to. Gorringe v. Irwell India Rubber Works[10]; Jones v. Jones[11]; Rochar\u00e1 v. Fulton[12]; Scott v. Lord Hastings[13]; In re Richards[14]; Ward v. Duncombe[15], per Herschell L.C., at page 378, and per Lord Macnaghten, at pages 391-394;\nC. P. Fullerton K.C. for the respondent. We rely upon the reasoning of the judges in the court below[16]. There is no evidence of record that there was an equitable assignment by Garson to Fraser and all that took place between them, as well as the conversations and correspondence with the officials of the bank at Winnipeg, are consistent with Fraser being an employee of Garson, or a sub-contractor for the works on the Outlook branch. Indeed, this is the irresistible conclusion to be drawn from all the facts and the absence of any proof whatever of express or implied notice to the bank that there had been an assignment of any kind by Garson to Fraser. At the same time, to the knowledge of both these parties, the bank had given notice of their assignment to the debtor, the railway company, and obtained its assent thereto, signified in various ways and, particularly, by the actual payment of the amounts of all the progressive estimates, up to the time of Garson\u2019s death, by the company directly to the bank. Even assuming the evidence established an equitable assignment, the respondent, by giving notice to the railway company obtained priority. Dearie v. Hall[17]; Loveridge v. Cooper[18]; Foster v. Cockerell[19]; Re Freshfield\u2019s Trust[20]; Montefiore v. Guedalla[21]; 4 Halsbury, Laws of England, p. 379; In re Lake[22]; Pollock on Torts (5 ed.), p. 209; Marchant v. Morton, Down & Co.[23].\nM. G. Macneil for the appellant.\nC. P. Fullerton K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014In April, 1910, William Garson had two contracts from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.; one to build roundhouses at Calgary, and the other, to erect six stations on what is called the \u201cOutlook Branch\u201d of that railway. The appellant\u2019s claim is for the price or value of work done by him in and about the erection of these six stations. Both contracts provide, amongst other things, that all the work should be proceeded with\nunder the personal supervision of Grarson until completed,\nand that the agreements\nshould not be assigned or the work sub-contracted without the written assent of the company\u2019s engineer.\nA short time after the contracts were made, Garson had some conversation with the appellant, as the result of which, it was agreed between them that the latter should take over the building of the six stations on the Outlook Branch. It is admitted on this appeal that the company had no knowledge of that arrangement.\nSubsequently, on the 24th June, 1910, Garson, for valuable consideration, assigned in writing and under seal to the respondent bank\nall his claim and demand against the C.P.R. Co. for moneys then due or thereafter to accrue due to him from the said company.\nOf this assignment the railway company was duly notified. At the time this action was brought the company had paid (of the moneys earned under the contract) to the respondent, as assignee of Garson, in all the sum of $14,850 and a balance of $8,433 was still owing. The bank made advances to Garson on the faith of the assignment to the extent at least of the amount due under the contract and how much more does not appear. Garson died in February, 1911.\nThe railway company, sued originally as joint defendant with the bank, denied all knowledge of the arrangement between Garson and the appellant and brought the balance due under the contract into court to be disposed of as the rights of the parties might appear. The company was not made a party to the appeal either below or here. The issue, therefore, is narrowed down to the contest between the appellant and the bank, and the result depends chiefly upon the legal effect of the arrangement made between Garson and the appellant under which the latter built the stations in question.\nThe appellant\u2019s case on the pleadings was novation; his contention then was that by virtue of his arrangement he took the place of Garson on the contract, with the assent of the company, and that the moneys were his from the beginning. On the evidence this position could not be maintained. It was abundantly proved that the railway company only knew Garson in the transaction and dealt with him alone throughout. The moneys paid Fraser as the work progressed were paid by Garson\u2019s cheque on the respondent bank in which both Garson and Fraser kept their accounts.\nOn this appeal two questions arose for consideration; 1st. Did the arrangement between Garson and Fraser under which the latter carried on the work constitute an equitable assignment of the moneys earned? 2ndly. Did the assignment to the bank, duly signified to the railway company, give the bank priority? In case the first question is answered in the affirmative, the second becomes important.\nIt has been assumed throughout the argument here that the trial judge found there was an equitable assignment from Garson to Fraser, as the result of the arrangement made with respect to the stations. I prefer to quote the language of that learned judge; he says[24]:\u2014\nI think it is fairly clear that he (Garson) intended to have the plaintiff take his place under this contract in so far as it was possible for that to be done without the knowledge or consent of the railway company. I think the real arrangement was that the plaintiff should construct the stations in the place and stead of Garson and that the latter would turn over to him the progressive payments as and when they were received from the company. The moneys were Garson\u2019s as between him and the railway company and what took place (between Garson and the plaintiff at most amounted to an equitable assignment of these moneys to the plaintiff.\nIn appeal it was held, by Howell C.J.[25]:\u2014\nI think it would be unsafe from the evidence to find as a fact that there was an equitable assignment of this chose in action. For all that appears in the evidence, the bargain might have been (and indeed it seems to have been) that the plaintiff was to do the work for the deceased for the same sum which the latter had contracted for, and that he would be paid for the same from time to time as the deceased received the money therefor from the company. This would not be an assignment of the chose in action.\nThe first question, was there an equitable assignment by Garson to Fraser, must, I think, be answered in the negative. The railway company recognized in Garson no right to part with any portion of his contract. He was under an obligation to personally supervise the work contracted for, and no attempt was made to prove that, to the knowledge of the company, Fraser ever occupied with respect to the work any position other than that of an employee of its contractor. The arrangement between Garson and Fraser, said to have been reduced to writing at the time, is not now forthcoming, and we are obliged to rely upon the appellant\u2019s recollection of what occurred, Garson having died before these proceedings were instituted. I cannot find in Fraser\u2019s evidence an intention on the part of Garson to transfer the money payable under the contract. Fraser\u2019s failure to notify the railway company of his agreement, Garson\u2019s assignment of the same fund to the bank a few weeks later, the way in which the parties dealt with the money after it was paid over to the bank as assignee, all convince me that Garson never intended, when the agreement was made, to part with his control over the moneys and that Fraser relied for his payment upon Garson\u2019s general business credit.\nIt is quite true that no particular form of words is required to operate an equitable assignment, but there must be proof of an engagement to transfer the right, here the claim to the money, or to provide for the payment of that money out of a particular debt or fund. A mere agreement to hand over work to be done does not operate an assignment of the money to be earned if the agreement is silent as to this. There must be evidence of an intention to assign the very fund which will be created by the execution of the work or to give a charge upon it. I cannot find any evidence of an intention on Garson\u2019s part to assign the money to be earned under the contract, although he undoubtedly undertook to pay Fraser the same price that he was to receive for the work. They are both presumed to have had present to their minds the conditions of the contract with the company; Garson remained liable at all times for its complete and exact fulfilment by Fraser and it does not appear probable that Garson would abandon all control over the payments made on the progress estimates so long as his liability under the contract remained. On the other hand it is not to be lightly assumed that Fraser, if the money as earned was available to him, would have neglected the very elementary precaution of notifying the railway company of his assignment, which he now swears was in writing.\nI will briefly examine Fraser\u2019s testimony, having in mind his interest, the form in which his claim was first presented, and the finding in appeal that his evidence is \u201cconflicting and unsatisfactory.\u201d\nIn answer to his own counsel Fraser says\nhe took over the construction of the six stations from Garson.\nBeing pressed to tell all that took place between himself and Garson at the time of the arrangement in question, he says\nthe latter phoned over to him if he would take them off his hands, that he would turn them over to him if they were any good, and being pressed repeatedly by his own counsel for a more favourable reply, he says\nthat he was to do the work at the same price as Garson;\nfinally he says, in answer to the question,\nGo on and tell us what was said, what took place and what was said?\nA. Well, we arranged to meet, and it was either that day or the next day that he came over, and he brought the plans with him, and the specifications, and I estimated, and I told him that I would take them over at that price, that is, the price that he had for them, and he agreed to it, and there was nothing more said about it. So we used to meet occasionally and speak over it.\nWhat does all this mean if not as found in appeal that the appellant undertook to do the work for Garson for the price the latter was to receive for it, without reference to a special fund out of which he was to be paid?\nAs I have already said, the case turns entirely upon the effect of Eraser\u2019s evidence and I cannot find in it sufficient to justify me in reversing the judgment below. The appellant\u2019s version of the agreement with Garson, as I understand it, is at most evidence of a promise by the latter to pay for the work when he received the funds from the railway company, but not to pay over the moneys when and as received. There is no evidence of a distinct unequivocal agreement, such as is necessary to constitute an equitable assignment, that the particular funds received should be appropriated to the payment of Garson\u2019s liability to Fraser under the contract. Read in its entirety his evidence points to the conclusion that Fraser relied upon Garson\u2019s credit; and I am much impressed by the absence of notice to the company. Such a notice, it is true, was not necessary to complete the arrangement, but it is, in the circumstances, an ingredient in considering the effect of the evidence. If he relied upon the payments made under the contract he would have taken steps to protect himself. All the facts of the case point irresistibly to the conclusion that Fraser must have known the money earned was paid when and as due to the bank and he never made any inquiry or protest. He nowhere says that he was to have the benefit of the fund as and when created. When examined as a witness at the trial he tells us that \u201cnothing was said as to who was to pay him,\u201d and on discovery he says\nthat he did not expect the moneys would be paid to him, but to Garson direct.\nI must confess to some doubts on this branch of the case. The law on the subject as Brett J. said,\nis brought to such an exquisite degree of refinement that it is by no means easy to understand it,\nbut I certainly do not feel justified in reversing the unanimous judgment below.\nDealing now briefly with the second branch, I agree with the learned trial judge, who says: \u201cBut if notice was material I could not find that the bank had notice of what the plaintiff\u2019s claim to those moneys actually was until after the commencement of this action.\u201d The assignment to the bank was made to secure past and future advances to Garson and there is no evidence to justify the assumption that at the time it was made the bank had knowledge of the previous arrangement between its assignor and Fraser. The fact from which we are asked to draw the inference of notice is connected with a conversation that Fraser says he had with two of the bank officials on the subject of advances he required and during the course of which he pretends to have given them a list of his contracts, including the one now in question. He does not pretend to say that he intended to give the bank notice of his assignment, but we are asked to draw from this casual conversation the inference that the bank knew of the arrangement between Garson and Fraser and this notwithstanding the positive denial of the two bank officials who were believed by the trial judge. I cannot go that far and I respectfully urge that to do so would be to establish a precedent which would seriously disturb the business of banking so largely dependent upon good faith and plain straightforward dealing. The bank took the assignment, notified the company and made the advances as agreed, and to defeat its claim upon such flimsy evidence as is relied upon here is, I repeat, to create a dangerous precedent. Why did Fraser not say plainly that he had an assignment instead of leaving that fact to be inferred, and further, why, with the knowledge of such an assignment, should the bank have undertaken to make advances to Garson on the credit of the same fund?\nThe same observations apply to the subsequent alleged conversation with Garson during the course of which he is supposed to have told the bank officials that money received on the progress estimates belonged to Fraser. If it was Fraser\u2019s why not have paid it to him instead of depositing it to Garson\u2019s credit to be drawn against for his general liabilities? I quote Leslie\u2019s version of the incident from which we are asked to draw the inference of notice:\u2014\nQ. Now, when did you first become aware of the fact that Mr. Garson had transferred the Outlook Branch contracts to Mr. Fraser?\nA. Never knew it.\nQ. You never knew it?\nA. No.\nQ. When did you first become aware of the fact that Fraser was building these Outlook Branch stations?\nA. I don\u2019t know the date. Mr. Garson and Mr. Fraser came in and Mr. Garson said, \u201cI came in, Mr. Leslie, to let you know I have handed over my stations to Mr. Fraser,\u201d and that is the only interview or knowledge I have of the matter.\nQ. Can you fix the date at all?\nA. No.\nQ. You say it would be after the assignment?\nA. Yes, it was some time in the summer.\nQ. Some time in the summer?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Apart from that, did you know the arrangements, or anything about the arrangements between Garson and Fraser?\nA. None, nothing whatever.\nIn any event the rights of the parties cannot be affected by anything that happened after the assignment was executed and when advances had actually been made on the faith of it. The law surely is that the subsequent assignee must know of the prior assignment at the time he takes his security. Mutual Life Assurance Society v. Langley (1886)[26].\nThis may be in some of its aspects a very hard case, but in the general shipwreck the \u201cTabula\u201d is, in my opinion, with the bank \u2014 \u201cDurum est sed ita lex scripta est.\u201d\nI would dismiss with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the appellant to recover from the bank and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company certain moneys claimed by the appellant as the unpaid balance of the contract price of six railway stations known as the Outlook Branch stations constructed by the appellant.\nThe contract for the construction of these stations had been entered into on the 11th of April, 1910, between one William Garson and the railway company, and the appellant\u2019s case was that some days after entering into the contract Carson offered Fraser that if he would take these stations off his hands he, Garson, would turn them over to him. That Fraser after examining the plans and specifications agreed to take them and to take over his contract with the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. for their construction, and that the agreement between them which was verbal only was then settled and concluded. That Fraser afterwards completed the buildings according to contract and became entitled to the contract price.\nSo far as the railway company was concerned there was practically no contest. They had not received any notice of any assignment of the contract to Fraser, but had been notified by the bank on the 24th of June, 1910, that Garson had assigned to it\nmoneys now due or hereafter to accrue due to the said William Garson from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company,\nand had in consequence paid over to the bank the different instalments as earned under the contract for the construction of the Outlook stations and some extras amounting in all to the sum of $14,850, leaving a balance of $8,433.07 still owing. This balance the railway company brought into court to be paid over as directed by the court.\nSo far as the railway company is concerned they practically drop out of the case, and the contest is one between Fraser and the Imperial Bank as to the moneys paid by the railway company for the construction of these Outlook stations.\nThere seems to be two questions on the determination of which the rights of the contestants rest, first: Whether there was an equitable assignment from Garson to Fraser of the former\u2019s contract with the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. for the construction of these stations. If so, was the notice of such assignment given to the bank before they made the advances to Garson which the bank\u2019s assignment was intended to cover and secure. The trial judge, Chief Justice Mathers, held, as I understand his judgment, that there was such an equitable assignment, but that\nwhen the bank took its assignment from Garson (on the 24th June, 1910) it had no notice of any interest that the plaintiff had acquired in any Garson contract with the railway company or of any arrangement that had been made between Garson and the plaintiff with respect thereto. That as soon as the bank took its assignment it perfected it by notice to the railway company and thus gained priority over the plaintiff\u2019s assignment of which no notice was ever given.\nFor these reasons he dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action. So far as advances made by the bank to Garson up to the time of the assignment to it are concerned these reasons might be good. I cannot see their application to subsequent advances made by the bank after notice of Fraser\u2019s assignment.\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba dismissed the appeal to it on the ground that it\nwould be unsafe from the evidence to find as a fact that there was any equitable assignment.\nThe facts of this case are somewhat unique. There was, of course, at the time of the alleged equitable assignment from Garson to Fraser of the former\u2019s contract, no fund in existence to assign, there was simply Gar-son\u2019s contract rights which were as and when he built the stations to receive the contract price as stipulated for. There never was any work done nor materials supplied by Garson under the contract and the work done and the materials supplied were done and supplied by Fraser. There was not any assignment from Garson to the bank of any specific moneys to accrue due to the former under the contract relating to the Outlook stations. It was a general assignment of\nall my claim and demand for moneys due or hereafter to accrue due to the said William Garson from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. The consideration for the assignment was $1 and its object and purpose as explained by the manager of the bank was to secure the bank for any then existing or future advances made to Garson. So far as advances made by the bank to Garson at the time it took this assignment and before it had notice of the equitable assignment to Fraser are concerned, of course, no question arises. With regard, however, to any subsequent advances made by the bank after such notice it would be plainly unjust and inequitable to permit the bank to hold these moneys received from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. as the price of construction of the Outlook stations as against the equitable assignee who had done the work and notified them of his assignment. And so with regard to the balance due by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. on the contract and brought into court the bank would, in the event of its being held to have had notice of the equitable assignment from Garson to Fraser, only be entitled to claim this balance to the extent of the advances made prior and up to the receipt of the notice.\nI entertain grave doubts whether the words of the assignment to the bank, construed in the light of the manager\u2019s evidence as to its object and purpose, cover moneys earned by the assignee of the contract, Fraser, after the bank had notice of his assignment. Technically they may be said to be moneys \u201caccrued due to Garson,\u201d in whose name the contract was made and remained, but really and equitably they were not, but accrued due to the assignee who by the expenditure of his time and money had earned them. Assuming the equitable assignment and the notice to the bank as proved, then the bank receiving the money legally enough from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. would hold it in trust for its real owner, the assignee. All it could claim would be the right to have any advances made by it, before it received notice, repaid out of the moneys it received.\nNow, was there an equitable assignment to Fraser of Garson\u2019s Outlook contract? I agree with the trial judge that there was. No form of words is necessary to create such an assignment. It is always a question of fact and of the intention of the parties to be gathered from what they said and did and from all the surrounding circumstances. Garson died before the suit began and the only direct evidence of what took place between Garson and Fraser is that of the latter. Reading it as I have done several times over and applying it to the admitted facts of this case I cannot doubt that if believed, and the trial judge who saw Fraser and heard his evidence believed it, the intention of both parties was that the entire contract and Garson\u2019s rights under it should, as expressed, be \u201ctaken over\u201d by Fraser at the price Garson had for the stations to be built and that Fraser should supply all the materials, do all the work and become entitled as between him and Garson to the contract price. As a matter of fact he did supply all the material and did all the work and in equity as between Garson and Fraser no doubt could arise as to his being entitled to the moneys to be paid by the railway company therefor.\nWe are not left, however, to Fraser\u2019s evidence alone on this point. We have the conduct and actions afterwards of Garson before his illness and his conversations and correspondence with and to the bank\u2019s officials. Mr. Leslie, the manager of the bank, himself says that Garson and Fraser came in together to see him at one time and that Garson said: \u2014 i came in, Mr. Leslie, to let you know i have handed over my stations to Mr. Fraser,\nwhich stations Mr. Leslie understood as the Outlook stations. If Garson was only subletting to Fraser there would be no reason in his giving the bank notice of it. He gave notice because he was assigning and ceasing to have further interest in it. As to when Garson made this statement Mr. Leslie seems very uncertain and hazy. He seems clear that it was before the $3,000 advance made in November, 1910, but how long before he could not say. It might be, he thought, a month, could not say whether it was two months, and the nearest he could get to the time was that it was sometime daring the summer after the assignment to the bank. Mr. Leslie evidently did not pay much attention to this statement of Garson\u2019s relative to the turning over of the Outlook stations to Fraser, because at the time the bank took the assignment from Garson the only contract that he knew definitely that Garson had with the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was for the roundhouse at Calgary. While the words of the assignment may be, and doubtless are, large enough to embrace these Outlook stations contract it seems clear alike from Garson\u2019s conduct in assigning it over to Fraser and from the bank officials\u2019 conduct and attitude towards it that they themselves did not intend the general words of the Garson assignment to include in them moneys becoming due on a contract standing in his name it is true, but which he had turned over to another contractor without investing a dollar either in labour, materials or otherwise, and which moneys only became due at all by the labour and expenditure of his assignee. That was doubtless one of the reasons why the manager of the bank paid little attention to the express notice Garson gave him in Fraser\u2019s presence that he had handed over this contract to Fraser and was unable to fix the time he received it more accurately than that it was sometime during the summer after the assignment. I conclude that as between Garson and Fraser it was not a mere subletting of the Garson contract, but a complete equitable assignment of it and that when Leslie swears that Garson told him he had called to tell him that he had handed over his Outlook contract to Fraser, who was then present, all parties understood that by handing over the contract he meant assigning it over. But the knowledge brought home to the bank of the assignment of this contract does not rest here. Fraser swears, though on this point he is contradicted by Morris, the assistant manager, that some two weeks or so after taking over from Garson these Outlook stations he went to the bank, saw the manager and assistant manager and gave the latter a memo, of the contracts he had, including the six Outlook stations, stating he wanted some financial assistance. He said he was told to call again, that he afterwards did so and was told by Mr. Leslie, the manager, that \u201cperhaps when he got those stations well through\u201d the bank could advance the money. If Fraser\u2019s evidence on this point is accepted following Garson\u2019s admitted notice to the manager the question of notice to the bank might be well determined in his favour. But apart from this evidence I think the dealings Fraser had with the bank respecting the moneys paid to it by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. under the Outlook contract, shew clearly that it had full notice of the assignment of the contract to Fraser. It is urged that the conduct of the bank officials is consistent with their belief that the work was being clone by Fraser as a sub-contractor under Garson merely and not as an assignee. I do not think so. First we have Fraser on August 25th, 1910, going to the bank, as he says, with reference to the payment of the first estimate on his work. The bank had not received the money, but Morris, the assistant manager, filled up a ten day note for $800 which Fraser signed, and received the amount less discount. Fraser swears that this was an advance on the first estimate of $1,620, which was then discussed between them, and that it generally took about 30 days to get the money after the estimate passed. Morris denies that this $800 was advanced on the $1,620 estimate or had anything to do with it and says that he first learned Fraser was building the stations or had taken them over from Garson token this action first started. I am not, however, able to reconcile this denial and this statement of Morris\u2019s with his actions respecting the cheque for the $1,620 estimate when received by the bank or with his correspondence referring to the subsequent estimates on the same contract.\nOn August 22nd, 1910, Garson drew a cheque in Fraser\u2019s favour on the bank for $1,620, expressing on the face that it was for \u201cpayment of first estimate Outlook contract, C.P.R.\u201d On the 9th of September the bank received and credited Garson with the amount of the estimate and marked the cheque \u201cAccepted, Sept. 9th, 1910, Imperial Bank of Canada.\u201d Fraser indorsed the cheque and the bank put it to his credit. Morris, the assistant manager, initialled the cheque himself, and it would seem idle for him now to say that he first learned Fraser was building the stations or had taken them over from Garson when this action first started. Fraser on the 24th of August drew a cheque for $700 in favour of his foreman, Simmons, who was erecting the stations, and in the body of it stated that it was \u201cA\/C stations.\u201d He says that he told Morris that it was for the building of these stations that he was sending the money. The bank with Morris\u2019s knowledge remitted the money to Simmons at Keeler, where he was erecting one of the stations, and the cheque itself contains a memo, indorsed in Morris\u2019s handwriting, \u201cKeeler, Sask.\u201d There were other cheques given by Fraser for the same purpose and remitted in the same way. On October 6th the bank received the second instalment of $5,400 on these stations contract. Before that, however, on September 20th, 1910, Garson had written the bank from Calgary, saying:\u2014\nAs C. P. August estimate is now overdue I enclose a cheque in favour of W. H. Fraser with amount blank, which you will oblige by filling in for the sum returned in the August estimates for the stations he is building and hand same to him as soon as the cash comes in.\nThis blank cheque on its face read: \u201cAug. estimates Outlook stations\u201d and when a few days later the blank was filled in with $1,000, the abbreviation \u201ca\/c.\u201d was placed before the words \u201cAug. estimates Outlook stations.\u201d Mr. Morris received and, on the 24th, answered this letter, enclosing this blank cheque, as follows:\u2014\nReferring to your letter of the 20th instant re W. H. Fraser we are advised by Mr. Fraser that his August estimates amount to about $5,400. We have filled in your cheque in his favour for one\u2019 thousand dollars ($1,000) in the meantime. Yours truly, M. Morris, Assistant Manager.\nIn the face of this correspondence it is clear that Morris\u2019s memory must have failed him when he stated that he first learned when this action began that Fraser was building the stations or had taken them over from Garson. Fraser swears that he was advised by Garson of his having sent the bank a blank cheque for the second estimate and that he went to the bank, saw Morris, who told him the money had not up to that time been received and asked him to fill in the blank with $1,000. As Morris himself writes Garson that Fraser then advised him that his August estimates amounted to about $5,400, it would seem there was no room for doubt that at that date at any rate the bank had full knowledge not only that Fraser was building the stations, but that he was building them under an arrangement with Garson which entitled him to receive the estimates as they were passed and paid in by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. On October 8th on another cheque being received by the bank from Garson in favour of Fraser the balance of their estimates, namely, $4,400, was paid by the bank to Fraser\u2019s credit and this cheque again on its face expressed that it was \u201cestimate No. 2, Outlook stations.\u201d\nLater on, in November, Fraser states that he became aware the third estimate for $7,800 had been passed, but not paid and that he and Garson went to the bank to see about getting an advance. Fraser got the advance on a note signed by both Garson and himself on the 21st of November, payable on demand. Morris again denies that this $3,000 was being advanced \u201cin anticipation of the estimate.\u201d It is worthy, however, of note that some days previously, namely, on November 9th, Garson wrote a letter to the bank on his general business matters, which contained the following sentence:\u2014\nIt is likely the C.P.R. estimate in Outlook work will be paid in shortly. It belongs to W. H. Fraser. When it comes let him draw on me at sight for the amount and transfer it to him, and in another paragraph:\u2014\nLet me know if you approve of my keeping the money in your bank here.\nTo which letter Mr. Morris signing himself \u201cassistant manager\u201d replies on the 14th November as follows:\u2014\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th and note your advices. There is no objection to your retaining money in Calgary for your Calgary contracts providing that proceeds of your C.P.R. contract will be sufficient to protect advances in this office.\nNot a single word throwing a doubt upon Garson\u2019s statement that the November estimate on the Outlook work belonged to W. H. Fraser and was to be transferred to him. Surely if any doubts existed as to the bank\u2019s knowledge that Fraser was the real contractor for the Outlook stations and entitled to receive the estimates as they were paid into the bank, this letter should have set them at rest. This third estimate was for $7,800. $3,000 had been advanced on Garson and Fraser\u2019s note to the bank and $1,000 of the three forwarded by the bank by express on the same day to Fraser\u2019s foreman, Simmons, on Fraser\u2019s cheque expressing that its \u201cA\/C. Simmons, C.P.R. stations.\u201d This cheque was initialled by Morris and indorsed by Fraser with the words, \u201cGlenside, Saskatchewan,\u201d indicating the place where the money was to be spent, that being one of the places where he was erecting a station. There were also cheques drawn by Fraser on the bank, one for $1,002.50 on October 18th, 1910, favour of \u201cDfts. Moose Jaw and Keeler,\u201d the other for $1,003.25 on October 28th, favour of \u201ccash,\u201d each of which contained in the margin the words and figure \u201cC.P.R. 6 S.,\u201d which I conclude meant the 6 Outlook stations being built by Fraser and the amounts of each of which cheques were forwarded by the bank at the places indicated, the latter cheque being accompanied by a requisition from Fraser, \u201cRequired a draft on Broderick in favour of J. H. Simmons. Applicant, W. H. Fraser.\u201d \u201cBroderick\u201d was the name of one of the stations and Simmons the name of Fraser\u2019s foreman building them. Sometime after the 21st November, 1910, when the $3,000 were advanced to Garson and Fraser on their note taken \u201con demand,\u201d the $7,800, being amount of the third estimate, was received by the bank. The exact date of its receipt I do not find, but Garson was then ill in the hospital at Calgary and his account at the bank in an unsatisfactory condition. Fraser made repeated applications to the bank for this money, which were rejected and ultimately he went to Calgary and, Garson being sick in the hospital and not able to be seen, obtained from his foreman or manager a cheque for the amount of $7,800 expressed as \u201cTransfer re C.P.R. Outlook stations,\u201d and signed \u201cpp. Wm. Garson, John Sweeny, attorney.\u201d This cheque the bank refused to honour. Garson subsequently died, and this action was brought in which the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was joined, inasmuch as they had not paid the balance of the contract into the bank. That balance, $8,503, remaining unpaid in respect of the contract for the Outlook stations the railway company brought into court, claiming no interest in it other than for costs and leaving it for the disposal of the court between the contestants Fraser and the bank.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Co. or their interests, are, therefore, in no wise concerned in the result of this case. Their stations were admittedly built for them by Fraser. The money contracted to be paid became due. Whether they had notice or not of the assignment to Fraser by Garson or whether they did or did not waive the clause in the contract prohibiting its assignment without the written consent of the engineer cannot have anything to do with the issues as between the bank and Fraser. The money had been paid in part, $7,800 to the Imperial Bank, who still claim to hold it presumably for advances due them by Garson, and the $8,503 is in court payable to the bank if their legal contentions are maintainable, and if there is still that amount due them for advances to Garson, or payable to Fraser if he was the equitable assignee of Garson\u2019s Outlook contracts and if the bank had notice of such assignment before making the advances.\nAs I have previously stated I do not myself think there can be any doubt as to what was meant by the parties, Garson and Fraser, when after the former had asked the latter to take over this contract and Fraser having first examined the plans and specifications and made his own estimates told Garson he would take them over at the price he had for them and Garson agreed to it. By \u201ctaking over\u201d the contract the parties meant that Fraser should stand with respect to it and its obligations and rights in Garson\u2019s shoes. If there was any doubt as to what \u201ctaking over\u201d at his tender price meant, the subsequent conduct and actions of the parties sets that doubt at rest. Garson never claimed a cent of the estimate paid on the work by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., but, on the contrary until his fatal illness occurred, the contract standing in his name, gave Fraser cheques, one of them in blank, for the amount of these estimates as they were paid into the bank and in his letters to the bank used language which could only have one meaning, and that was that the contract was entirely Fraser\u2019s, who did the work, supplied the material and became entitled to the moneys earned under it for his own benefit. As to the bank having notice I think they had full and ample notice in the summer of 1910.\nI do not know whether an earlier date than August is necessary to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s contentions as the bank\u2019s account with Garson is not in evidence and we do not know the dates when they made the advances to Garson, but I see no reason for refusing to accept Fraser\u2019s statement that within two weeks after his taking over the contract he was seeking financial assistance from the bank and left the list of the contracts he had, including the one now in question, with them, and that he then gave them the necessary notice. If there is doubt with respect to that then, in my judgment, the evidence of their having had notice in August and the early part of September, when the first estimate was passed to his credit is sufficient to fix the date and the cumulative evidence which follows in the correspondence between the bank and Garson and in the dealings of the bank with Fraser, is overwhelming. I cannot myself see how in the face of this correspondence and these dealings, so corroborative of what Fraser has sworn to, the bank could for a moment seek to appropriate the fruits of Fraser\u2019s labours and expenditure towards the payment of advances made by them to Garson, which advances it cannot be seriously contended were in any wise made on the strength of the assigned Outlook contract.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in all courts against the bank. Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s costs to be paid out of money in court. Judgment to be entered for Fraser for $7,830 admitted in the 6th paragraph of the bank\u2019s defence to have been received by it, with interest at statutory rate, from the date of its receipt, and also for the moneys paid into court by Canadian Pacific Railway Co., less its costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The late Mr. Garson tendered to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. by separate tenders put in at the same time, for the construction of its round-house at Calgary and also six stations on its Outlook Branch, and was awarded the contracts therefor. The former was a large contract and Garson seems to have thought there was not enough in the latter to render it worth his while distracting thereby his attention from the former and other contracts he had undertaken, and hence offered the appellant to take the latter off his hands, do the work, supply the material and receive the entire amounts named in the tender therefor or accruing under the contract. Appellant accepted his proposal. Garson being alone known to the company had of necessity to sign the contract. As between him and the company he was the contractor responsible for the execution of the work. As between him and the appellant the contract being non-assignable he was bound to appellant to see that he got all moneys accruing thereunder in respect of work done by appellant.\nThe learned trial judge held rightly that there was thus created an equitable assignment of said moneys.\nTwo months later and after the appellant had entered upon the work pursuant to this understanding the respondent obtained from Garson an assignment dated 24th June, 1910, of which the operative part is as follows:\u2014\nKnow all men by these presents that William Garson, of the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar paid to the said William Garson by the Imperial Bank of Canada (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) doth hereby sell, assign and transfer unto the said Imperial Bank of Canada all my claim and demand against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for moneys now due or hereafter to accrue due to the said William Garson from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThere follows this a power of attorney to collect the moneys referred to for the use of the bank absolutely as its own forever.\nIt is to be observed that on its face this assignment is only in consideration of one dollar.\nObviously on the evidence this document does not tell the Whole of what it was intended for. The bank manager who witnessed its execution says in his discovery examination\nit was given as security for the advances made from time to time to Garson,\nand proceeds as follows:\u2014\nQ. Was it for advances already made or for future advances?\nA. It was both.\nQ. Did you know at the time of taking that assignment what contracts he had with the C.P.R.?\nA. No.\nQ. What moneys were owing to him?\nA. Not definitely.\nQ. Why do you say \u201cnot definitely\u201d?\nA. I knew that he had contracts with the C.P.R., but I knew nothing as to the amount definitely coming to him.\nQ. Did you know what kind of contracts he had?\nA. No, not \u2014 I knew that he had \u2014 nothing definitely; The only thing I can remember that he had was some contract for roundhouses or something of that kind.\nQ. Do you remember him stating that he had contracts for stations and roundhouses? A. Not definitely; the only thing I can\u2019 remember that he had some contract for roundhouses at Calgary; that is the only definite contract that I\u2014\u2014\nQ. He told you that he had tendered?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you remember that distinctly, and you remember definitely about the roundhouse at Calgary?\nA. Yes. I am pretty sure that that is right. But we never made any inquiry as to the nature of his contracts or where they were.\nIn his examination-in-chief at the trial to the question put thus: \u201cQ. Under this assignment from Garson to yourselves \u2014 the bank \u2014 was any money advanced by the bank?\u201d he answers, \u201cNo, not at the time.\u201d And later the question was repeated with the added words, \u201con the strength of this assignment.\u201d \u201cA. Why, I can\u2019t remember just now. It strengthened Garson\u2019s credit.\u201d And he continues:\u2014\nQ. It was advanced on the strength of Carson\u2019s credit?\nA. Yes.\nQ. After this assignment was made were moneys advanced to Garson?\nA. Yes; that is my recollection, at least.\nQ. Would all the moneys in question in this action be sufficient to pay off Garson\u2019s indebtedness to the bank?\nMr. Elliott: I object to the question.\nHis Lordship: I will allow it.\nA. No.\nQ. You say no?\nA. Yes \u2014 I am not positive about that. Yes, I think I can say no.\nQ. You say no?\nA. Yes; that is the moneys coming from here would not be sufficient.\nIn other parts of his evidence he indicates inquiries were sometimes made of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. respecting the amounts due on specific contracts on faith of which or to subserve the purposes of which advances had been asked by Garson.\nThe bank cannot, therefore, claim that it ever knew of and as result of definite knowledge relied upon this alleged assignment of the Outlook stations contract as security for either past or future advances. There appears in the letter of September 20, 1910, from Garson to the bank, which I will deal with presently, a report, as it were, of the progress he was making in his several contracts, and I think it fairly inferable from that and other evidence that the bank from time to time relied upon similar reports from Garson as well as answers of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\u2019s officers for information as to the progress of his contracts when making advances either to help out the execution of such contracts or make the money earned therein the basis for further advances or security for past indebtedness.\nI cannot find a single instance of such inquiry or report relative to the Outlook stations contract, save when the facts relative thereto were, as I am about to shew in detail, so coupled with respondents\u2019 rights as should have put it on inquiry and have destroyed any right to claim reliance on the proceeds from said contract for any advances made to Garson outside of the scope of said contract.\nSuch is the nature of the claim set up by respondent to deprive the appellant of his equitable assignment and to despoil him of his labour, his money and his property spent in reliance thereon.\nHaving regard to the express non-assignability of the contract between Garson and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.; to the want of definiteness in the form of assignment respondent relies upon; to the nonexistence, at the date of the assignment, of any debt due or known to the respondent to be accruing due as arising out of this contract now in question; to the want of proof of any debt due from the assignor Garson to the respondent at the said date and remaining due when the assignment could have acquired any conceivable operative effect; and in short to the entire history of legal assignments of choses in action, including the \u201cKing\u2019s Bench Act\u201d of Manitoba, section 39, and the effect thereof I submit that the said assignment, if anything, cannot be treated as any higher or stronger than an equitable assignment and that the rights of respondent and respective rights of the parties hereto must be determined by the principles of law governing equitable assignments and the equities between them as will be developed presently.\nIt is said respondent must succeed by virtue of notice to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. within the rule laid down in Dearie v. Hall[27], and a long line of cases of a like kind ever since. But I cannot find such a case as this in all that long and varied line.\nThe only notice given the debtor, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., was a delivery of the assignment accompanied by a letter as indefinite as the instrument itself.\nThe language used by Lord Cairns in Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Co. v. The Queen[28], at page 506, and quoted with approval by Lord Macnaghten in Ward v. Duncombe[29], at page 391, is so comprehensive and forceful and expresses so much better than I can exactly what I feel should not be lost sight of in dealing with so remarkable a claim as respondent presents herein, that I cannot forbear quoting the entire passage as presented by Lord Macnaghten. He says:\u2014\nThe general principle applicable to all equitable titles is, I think, well expressed by Lord Cairns in Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company v. The Queen28, at p. 506: \u201cA pre-existing equitable title,\u201d said Lord Cairns, \u201cmay be defeated by a supervening legal title obtained by transfer\u201d \u2014 he was there speaking of an equitable title to shares. Then he goes on: \u201cAnd I agree with what has been contended, that it may also be defeated by conduct, by representations, by misstatements of a character which would operate and enure to forfeit and to take away the pre-existing equitable title. But I conceive it to be clear and undoubted law, and law the enforcement of which is required for the safety of mankind, that in order to take away any pre-existing admitted equitable title, that which is relied Upon for such a purpose must be shewn and proved by those upon whom the burden to shew and prove it lies, and that it must amount to something tangible and distinct, something which can have the grave and strong effect to accomplish the purpose for which it is said to have been produced.\u201d\nHow can such a requirement of the law thus defined be held to have been complied with by the delivery of such an assignment as this now before us?\nThe further expressions of Lord Macnaghten himself on pages 392 to 394 of latter case criticizing the expressions so usual as to \u201cperfecting\u201d or \u201ccompleting the title\u201d of an assignee and constituting the debtor in a contract or the holder of a fund \u201ca trustee\u201d for the assignee and the duties or rights of a trustee in such a position are worthy of note in the same connection.\nThe assignment if purely voluntary could not acquire, even with notice, priority over an earlier one for valuable consideration. See Justice v. Wynne (1860)[30], which is the only express authority on the point, cited in the text-books, but I take the principle of law involved therein to be undoubted, when regard is had to the doctrine, speaking generally, that courts of equity will not aid a mere volunteer in any case to enforce a gift failing in anything essential to its completion. I shall advert to this principle later when I come to deal with the respondent\u2019s claim as presented on the evidence outside this instrument. I am only concerned here just now with the bare question of the effect of notice when resting on such a foundation as presented here.\nThis assignment on its face is purely voluntary. How can it be that such notice as that carried should be converted into something higher than it seemed by its terms to express? If it had purported to be by way of security as now claimed, then this might have been of less consequence, but it appears from its contents as if an absolute gift. The alleged basis of the principle upon which notice is given such effect as it has is said by Lord Lyndhurst in Foster v. Cockerell[31], at page 475, to have been founded on the reason\nthat if a contrary doctrine was allowed to prevail, it would enable a cestui que trust to commit a fraud, by enabling him to assign his interest, first to one and then to a second incumbrancer, and perhaps, indeed, to a great many more; and these later incumbrancers would have no opportunity of ascertaining, by any communication with the trustees, whether or not there had been a prior assignment of the interest, on the security of which they were relying for provision of their claims.\nAnd he adds later on:\u2014\nIn a case of this sort it is necessary that a party claiming advantage from a title, should do everything that is requisite to complete that title before he sets up a claim in respect of it.\nSuch being the purpose of the rule as to notice, how can it operate when the reason for its application ceases, and it is sought to so extend its application as to enable the assignee in a kind of case without precedent, to rake in not only the whole or part of an ascertained fund, but of one to be created by the prior assignee\u2019s own labour and material? When and how does this fraud then appear? And when and how can we find in this notice a doing of everything requisite to complete title? Giving the doctrine full force and effect one would imagine that a thing so very important should be true and not as false as the notice relied upon herein. Again, in every one of the authorities the respondent sets forth in its factum in this regard the notice given was clear, specific and related to a well-defined claim or fund existent or to arise from another source than at the prior assignee\u2019s expense.\nIn the case of Marchant v. Morton, Down & Co.[32] the facts suggested to Mr. Justice Channell a feature that might possibly, on a slight variation of fact, have raised a question remotely resembling this relative to sources to feed the fund.\nBut a somewhat diligent search has failed to discover for me a single authority of an assignment and notice thereof substantially failing in these characteristics yet having been upheld.\nIn this case there is nothing specific, definite or clear in the notice which is the assignment itself. How could a debtor or trustee of a fund if such had existed be held bound to trouble himself with such a notice of a voluntary assignment? And how much less so in a case where he was not bound to recognize any assignment and had reserved the right to himself to resist and discard any assignment?\nSurely the paymaster, or trustee if you will, in such a case had a right to discard as notice that which might have entitled him, if set forth truly and at length, to elect to declare the whole contract, which is to produce the fund assigned, void and ended forever. Of what value, moreover, could a notice be, which neither pointed to one contract nor another? Is it possible to argue this one in question is wide enough in its terms to cover all past and possible future relations between the assignor and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. during the entire lifetime of the deceased? I think not.\nLet us then examine its terms closely and see if we can find anything definite.\nThe singular number is used in describing the thing assigned. It is not several claims, but Garson\u2019s single claim that is assigned. We know he had more than one claim, but from the evidence of the respondent\u2019s manager, who was the witness to this assignment, we find he only knew of one claim and the appellant is not concerned with that. If we must, as the language requires, restrict respondent to one claim, then that of which respondent had some knowledge or notice must be the one, rather than one absolutely unknown. Surely this ought, if the notice is not definite, to end the contentions set up. If not good notice then as appellant\u2019s equity is prior respondent must fail.\nI wish also to draw attention to the very peculiar language of this assignment.\nHow did the assignment get its very peculiar wording? It begins in the third person, but when it describes the claim it changes and takes the unusual form in the peculiar phrase, \u201cmy claim,\u201d etc.\nIt looks as if Garson had orally or in writing referred to \u201cmy claim\u201d in some instructions he had given to distinguish that to be assigned from claims merely standing in his name as trustee in effect, as he did in subsequent letters to respondent, not only in the reference made to the appellant\u2019s rights, but as he did in that of the 20th of September, 1910, when he refers to a Minnedosa account and says,\nthis really belongs to Snyder. i have sent him a cheque accordingly. I think this alleged notice of an equitable assignment held in the courts below as sufficient to give respondent priority fails for the reasons I have given. And I may add that the same reasoning is destructive of the assignment itself as covering the contract in question, whatever other contract it may cover.\nI have combatted thus far that line of argument which prevailed below, but incidentally have noted as relative thereto other facts and circumstances which in another light are equally fatal to the respondent\u2019s claim.\nA perusal of the entire evidence in this case has deeply impressed me with the conviction that Garson never intended by this assignment to pass to respondent, for its own benefit, or deprive appellant of, what he had undoubtedly promised him, and that he had made this clear to some one in such manner as to render respondent\u2019s officers indifferent regarding the stations contract in question.\nThe respondent\u2019s manager was applied to by appellant shortly after his agreement with Garson to furnish financial assistance in case of his making further arrangements with Garson for other work, but was refused.\nBoth are agreed appellant was then asked for a statement of his affairs. Whilst the manager admits he saw such a statement he denies hearing then of this Outlook stations contract. The appellant distinctly says he then told him of his arrangement with Garson for that contract.\nIt may be that the manager attached so little importance to the contract that he had forgotten it. I see no reason for disbelieving appellant\u2019s version which seems highly probable. It was part of the very business both agree was considered and must have concerned them both in the consideration thereof.\nAt all events the appellant, who was refused on that occasion, was a short time after given accommodation and later on several occasions further accommodation and each was, curiously enough, connected with the estimates for the work done under the very contract now in question. These estimates were the property of respondent if it ever had a claim; yet its manager and assistant manager let them be so dealt with by the appellant or by him through Garson as if they belonged to appellant.\nThe documents themselves in these transactions by the very language used therein seem to earmark the first two estimates so dealt with as appellant\u2019s property; the figures involved therein seem to fit in with and, as it were, to emphasize these facts, and taken therewith the letter of the 20th September from Garson to the respondent\u2019s manager clearly demonstrated appellant\u2019s claim to the eyes of respondent\u2019s officers; and the letter of the 24th September in reply thereto from the assistant manager to Garson conclusively proves that demonstration of fact had reached him. It must be presumed from all these and other facts, to have so reached the understanding of all concerned on behalf of respondent, that we can safely say these moneys were being treated to their knowledge by both Garson and appellant as the money and the property of the latter.\nThen the letter of the 9th November from Garson to the respondent\u2019s manager as to the third estimate after dealing with a variety of his contracts and the moneys earned thereon expressly states:\u2014\nIt is likely the C.P.R. estimate on Outlook work will be paid in shortly. Belongs to W. H. Fraser. When it comes let him draw on me at sight for the amount and transfer it to him. The answer to this last letter fails to repudiate such a suggestion, and in the first sentence says:\u2014\ni am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and note your advices,\nbut makes no remonstrance in answer to such a claim. That claim ought by this time, if the pretension now set up by respondent is well founded, to have been repudiated in no uncertain terms, but it was not. It was acquiesced in.\nThroughout the whole of these dealings the respondent never, either to appellant or Garson, disclaimed the grounds for such pretensions as implied therein.\nThis silence on the part of respondent\u2019s officers, and this manner on the part of all concerned of treating the claim of appellant, is consistent with the truth of his statements relative to what had taken place between him and the manager, and hardly consistent with any other theory than its truth; save and except a theory of the entire ignorance of the officers of respondent of any claim it had under the assignment and want of reliance by the respondent on any claim to, or to charge, the fund in question. It is absolutely inconsistent with a proper realization by respondent\u2019s officers of the legal and moral duty resting upon them under the circumstances which had transpired under their eyes, if their present pretensions herein were well founded.\nI cannot agree with the view of the learned trial judge that what transpired after the date of the assignment can have no effect on the light in which it is to be considered.\nRespondent\u2019s mode of treating what transpired after that is cogent evidence corroborative of what appellant states had taken place relative to his rights in the premises and of the notice he claims respondent had.\nBesides it could not be permitted to any one claiming under an equitable title the moneys in question to maintain under such circumstances such silence relative to such a claim, if it ever had existed, and then to try to set up such a claim as now set up by respondent as against him whose labour and money were creating and had at the institution of these proceedings created the fund now claimed by respondent.\nBut there is another ground yet which to my mind should bar the respondent\u2019s claim. It sets up by evidence I have quoted above, that the assignment was in truth not what it expresses, but was taken by way of security for advances to be made as well as for past advances.\nNo past advance is shewn to have existed unpaid when this suit began, and hence, as already stated, it cannot be held as security for that. No specific advance ever was made on the faith of this security. And no further advance was made before appellant\u2019s equity had to the respondent\u2019s knowledge, clearly intervened.\nIf this claim relative to later advances is to be treated, as I think it can well be treated in such case as the like advances were treated in the case of Hopkinson v. Rolt[33], as between a first and second mortgagee then the claim of what respondent had acquired by reason of its advances on the faith of its bargain and charge must be subject to the claim of the appellant for his labour and expenses which created the fund in dispute.\nThat was a case as (between first and second mortgages in which the first was held good only as to advances made when it was taken, or before the second was acted upon, but as to future advances which the first was intended to secure, they were held, so far as made after the advances on the second mortgage had intervened to be subject thereto. Assuming that by the assignment and notice to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., the respondent had obtained in form a first mortgage to secure future advances then applying the principle involved in said case it was incumbent on it to have shewn it had made such future advances in priority to those of the appellant. This mode of dealing with equitable claims to secure future advances was followed in the case of the Bradford Banking Company v. Briggs[34], where the facts were as stated in the head-note as follows:\u2014\nThe articles of association of a company registered under the Companies Act, 1862, provided that the company should have \u201ca first and permanent lien and charge, available at law and in equity, upon every share for all debts due from the holder thereof.\u201d A shareholder deposited his share certificates with a bank as security for the balance due and to become due on his current account, and the bank gave the company notice of the deposit. The certificates stated that the shares were held subject to the articles of association.\nIt was held the moneys which became due to the company after notice of the deposit of share certificates could not take priority over the equitable claim of the bank for its advances of which the company got notice.\nHolding, as I do, that if the respondent had not before its alleged assignment, it had at least shortly thereafter notice of the appellant\u2019s claim, then in any event the appellant obtained priority over it in respect of any later advances. It may be said the case was not so treated below as to call for a determination of the exact facts that might have to be investigated if we had to decide on this ground alone.\nIt was, however, I submit, respondent\u2019s own course of dealing with the case and contentions at the trial that led to this situation and hence its own fault.\nAs I have come to a decided view on the other grounds taken, I need not enlarge on this latter ground. Though it falls in line with the main argument taken to shew, in any view, what a hopeless case respondent in truth had, yet if the case had to turn exactly on this ground alone an opportunity should be given to shew that in fact the future advances were made before what I hold to have been notice.\nThis I say, however, is only in deference to the finding of fact by the learned trial judge as to anterior notice for my own impression does not quite coincide therewith. I should imagine it is the case of the man having only one thing of the kind to remember and so remembering it as against the man having possibly scores of the same sort to pass upon and dismiss and not quite so sure to remember.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and award judgment against the respondent for the moneys in question come to its hands and interest thereon and judgment for the moneys paid into court and direct the costs of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to be fixed as between solicitor and client, and to be paid by respondent to the company, or if already deducted to be recouped by the respondent so that appellant get from the funds or moneys what he would have got but for respondent\u2019s wrongful interference. Since writing foregoing I have agreed to the variation thereof as to costs embodied in memorandum prepared by my brother Mr. Justice Davies.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action in which the appellant, Fraser, as plaintiff, and the respondent bank, as defendant, each claimed to be the owner of two certain sums of money. These sums had been earned under a contract to which the parties were the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and one Wm. Garson, by which Garson was to build six stations on the \u201cOutlook\u201d Branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Under an arrangement with Garson the\u2019 stations were in fact built in the summer and autumn of 1910 by the appellant Fraser entirely at his own expense and the moneys in question formed part of the price payable under the contract for this work done by Fraser. Fraser\u2019s claim is based upon an alleged term of his agreement with Garson by which the moneys paid to Garson under the contract were (it is said) to be paid by him to Fraser as and when they should be received by Garson. The bank\u2019s claim rests upon an assignment dated 24th June, 1910, by which Garson professed to assign to the bank\nall his claim and demand against the railway company then due or thereafter to accrue due to him from the railway company,\nof which assignment the railway company was immediately notified by the bank and by which Garson also appointed the bank his attorney to receive such moneys from the railway company. One of the sums in controversy ($7,830) was paid by the railway company to the bank, the other ($7,020) was paid into court. The trial judge held that: The real arrangement was that the plaintiff should construct the stations in the place and stead of Garson and that the latter would turn over to him the progressive payments as and when they were received from the company.\nBut he held also that the bank having given the railway company notice of its assignment before having any knowledge or notice of the arrangement between Garson and Fraser had the better title to the moneys in question; and allowed the claim of the bank in its entirety. The Court of Appeal held that the appellant must fail on the ground that he had not satisfactorily established an assignment from Garson. I have gone over the evidence repeatedly with care and I am quite satisfied that the appellant has established his title to these moneys as between himself and Garson and that the rival claim of the bank is without substance. The case has been beset with confusion from the beginning of it, but when the facts, either admitted or established almost indisputably, have been grasped the rights of the parties fall to be determined by the easy application of one or two well established principles of law.\nIt was in April, 1910, that Garson entered into an agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by which he was to construct for them certain roundhouses at Calgary and the six stations already referred to and to finish them by the 1st September. Shortly afterwards Garson proposed to Fraser that he should take over the contract so far as it related to the stations; to this Fraser agreed and a memorandum signed by Garson and Fraser was indorsed upon a document which Garson had in his possession and which appears to have contained the terms of an intended formal contract between Garson and the railway company providing for the construction of both these sets of buildings. This document apparently never went into effect for the reason it seems that the company\u2019s engineers wished the contract with respect to each set of buildings to be embodied in a separate instrument. At the trial Fraser was unable to produce the memorandum signed by Garson and himself, and although he proved that the document on which it was written was not to be found at any of Garson\u2019s places of business the learned trial judge refused to allow him to state the purport of it. It is, I think, immaterial whether or not this ruling of the trial judge was right. Garson unfortunately died before the action was begun; but it is clear that Garson and Fraser both acted upon the footing that these moneys were Fraser\u2019s and that such was the understanding between them; and that on the faith of that understanding the contract was performed by Fraser will abundantly appear from the evidence to which I shall have to refer in discussing the claim of the bank. The appropriate principle of law is stated by Lord Macnaghten in Tailby v. The Official Receiver[35], at page 546:\u2014\nLong before Holroyd v. Marshall[36] was determined it was well settled that an assignment of future property for value operates in equity by way of agreement, binding the conscience of the assignor, and so binding the property from the moment when the contract becomes capable of being performed, on the principle that equity considers as done that which ought to be done, and in accordance with the maxim which Lord Thurlow said he took to be universal, \u201cthat whenever persons agree concerning any particular subject, that, in a court of equity, as against the party himself, and any claiming under him, voluntarily or with notice, raises a trust:\u201d Legard v. Hodge[37].\nThis arrangement, therefore, constituted Garson trustee for Fraser of any sums which should be paid to him under the contract in question; and the real point in controversy is whether the bank did or did not by virtue of what subsequently occurred acquire a superior right to them. Before proceeding to discuss the facts specially bearing upon the bank\u2019s position it is convenient to refer to one of the provisions of the contract between Garson and the railway company which was the subject of some discussion on the argument here as well as in the courts below. It is as follows:\u2014\n(4) This agreement shall not be assigned, nor shall the said work or any part thereof be sub-contracted without the written consent of the engineer to every such assignment or sub-contract.\nThis conditional prohibition against assignment is susceptible of being read as a prohibition against the assignment of any of Garson\u2019s contractual rights arising out of this contract, including, for example, the payment of moneys earned and payable. It is also open to a construction which would disable Garson from vesting in another (without the prescribed consent) the right to perform the obligations which Garson had undertaken and by which such moneys were to be earned, but which would not disable him even in the absence of such consent from vesting in another the right to claim such moneys after they had become due in consequence of Garson by himself or his agents or servants having performed his obligations under the contract. There is something to be said in favour of the first mentioned construction, but it is not necessary to decide the question whether it is or is not the true construction.\nI shall assume in favour of the bank that the other view which is the view most favourable to its claim is the correct one. The required consent does not appear to have been obtained to the substitution of Fraser for Garson as contractor and, as between the railway company and Garson, Garson continued to be treated as the contractor responsible to it, although the evidence of Simmons makes it clear enough that the officials of the railway on the ground knew the work was being done by Fraser. Under the terms of the contract there was to be an approximate estimate of the value of the work done at the end of each calendar month, the amount of which was to be paid on the 20th of the next ensuing month less 10% which was retained as security. The railway company was apparently not notified of Eraser\u2019s title to those moneys (except as to the sum paid into court) and saving that sum all the moneys payable under the contract were paid by the railway company to the bank for the credit of Garson\u2019s account under the authority of the assignment to the bank mentioned above, of which notice had been given by the bank. The railway company apparently never disputed its accountability for these moneys either to Garson or to the person who as against Garson should prove to be best entitled to them.\nFraser then having an arrangement with Garson by which the moneys earned under the contract (though payable to Garson as between him and the railway company) were to be subject to a trust in favour of Fraser, we come to consider the effect upon Fraser\u2019s rights of Garson\u2019s subsequent dealings with the bank.\nIn discussing this question, I proceed as if the bank were not in respect of any of its transactions with Garson under any of the disabilities affecting a bank deriving its power to carry on business from the provisions of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d but had in respect of these matters all the powers of a natural person who is sui juris. I do this because an examination of what restrictions such a bank may be subject to by virtue of section 76 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d in respect of advances upon the security of a transfer of the borrower\u2019s contingent right to moneys not yet owing or to moneys owing, but not yet payable under a contract such as that between the railway company and Garson might lead us into the consideration of points of some nicety and considerable practical importance upon which we have not had the benefit of argument; and since in my view of the case it is unnecessary to pass upon any such points it is, I think, altogether desirable to refrain from any discussion of them;\nIt was argued on behalf of the appellant that by virtue of the Manitoba statute (the \u201cKing\u2019s Bench Act,\u201d R.S.M., 1902, ch. 40, sec. 39, sub-sec. (e)) an assignment of a future chose in action by itself vests in the assignee a legal title to the subject of the assignment as soon as it comes into existence and that notice to the debtor is unnecessary to perfect the title of the assignee; and it was said that as a consequence of this the rule in Dearie v. Hall[38] does not govern the rights of the parties under an assignment taking effect by virtue of the statute. Assuming all this to be true, it can have no application to the arrangement between Garson and Fraser if the real intention of the parties was (as it seems to have been) that the moneys should continue as between the railway company and Garson to be payable to Garson, who was to receive them as trustee for Fraser. On the other hand, the assignment from Garson to the bank appears to have been in conformity with the statute and quite sufficient (in the view of the statute just indicated) to vest in the bank the legal title to the moneys dealt with as soon as they should become payable and the fact of the bank\u2019s notice to the railway company having been given before the moneys were earned (which was pressed upon us in argument) would appear in that view to be beside the question. I shall proceed on the assumption that the appellant\u2019s title was an equitable title only, and that on the other hand the bank under its assignment acquired by force of the statute a legal title to the moneys as soon as they were earned, the real point in issue being whether the bank has a title to the beneficial interest in them which is superior to the appellant\u2019s.\nThe bank\u2019s contention at the trial was that its assignment Had been taken without notice of Fraser\u2019s rights and that this circumstance alone gave it priority. The learned trial judge, as I have mentioned, accepted this \u2014 holding that the effect of the assignment to the bank followed by notice of it to the railway company was to give the bank a right to intercept the ultimate fruits of the appellant\u2019s exertions in performing Garson\u2019s contract and that an indefeasible title to appropriate those fruits when realized became forthwith vested in the bank. Early in the trial the learned judge ruled that nothing which occurred after its notice to the railway company could prejudicially affect the position of the bank, and it was by this ruling as a guide that his judgment against the appellant was finally determined.\nThis ruling might be capable of support if it had appeared that the assignment had been taken as security for debts contracted at the same time or anterior thereto and that these debts to the amount of the moneys in dispute were still unpaid, and if we leave out of view the effect of the bank\u2019s subsequent conduct in giving rise to an equitable estoppel. But assuming at the time the assignment was taken the bank had no notice of the appellant\u2019s rights \u2014 then the bank\u2019s priority must rest on one of two foundations: 1st, the present existence of some debt which was incurred at the time of or prior to the taking of the assignment and for which the assignment was to stand as security, or, 2ndly, the present existence of some debt incurred on the security of the assignment and subsequent to the taking of it without notice of the appellant\u2019s rights. And, of course, the limit of the interest in respect of which the bank can in any case maintain its priority must depend upon the extent to which debts belonging to one or other of these classes remain still unpaid. This is so rudimentary that the citation of authorities ought to be superfluous. It may be observed, however, that there is an interesting application of the principle involved in West v. Williams[39], at page 143.\nIn this case the facts in evidence seem to be sufficient to establish, 1st, that the bank had notice of Fraser\u2019s rights before any debt was incurred for which the assignment was to stand as security and which is still unpaid; and, 2ndly, even if any such debt remained unpaid the conduct of the bank would preclude it from asserting as against Fraser any title to the moneys in question.\nThe first point to consider is: When did the bank receive notice of an understanding between Fraser and Garson by which Fraser was to build the stations and to be entitled to the proceeds of the contract? The learned trial judge found that the bank was aware of such an arrangement as early as the beginning of September and that finding alone seems sufficient to entitle the appellant to judgment in his favour. It seems, however, not open to dispute that they had this knowledge as early as the month of July; and there are certainly powerful considerations in support of the view that they had it before the execution of Garson\u2019s assignment to the bank. Fraser himself says that shortly after making his arrangement with Garson he applied to Mr. Leslie, the bank\u2019s manager at Winnipeg, for an advance and gave him a list of his contracts. Leslie admits that the application was made and that Fraser gave him a statement of his affairs, but declares that nothing was said of the Outlook contract. There are grave difficulties in the way of accepting Leslie\u2019s recollection upon the point. Fraser had been a customer of the bank for some years; he was a man of limited means, and while the Outlook contract was not the only work he had in view for the ensuing season, it is obvious from an inspection of his bank account (which is in evidence) that it must have been by far the most important one. Why, in making an application for financial assistance largely with a view to enable him to carry out this contract, he should have omitted all mention of the contract does not appear to be easily explained.\nEvidence of notice, however, at a date not later than July is supplied by the testimony of Leslie himself. Garson had a number of contracts to execute in the summer of 1910 in or in the vicinity of Calgary; and some time in July he left Winnipeg for Calgary and remained there until late in November. It is clear that before Garson left Winnipeg he had a conversation with Leslie in the presence of Fraser, the substance of which Leslie professes to state. In effect Leslie\u2019s account of the interview is that Garson with Fraser called at the office of the bank and said to him, \u201cMr. Leslie I have come to tell you that I have handed over my stations to Mr. Fraser.\u201d\nLeslie\u2019s evidence on his viv\u00e2 voce examination for discovery touching this conversation is as follows:\u2014\nA. He came in. Oh, I don\u2019t know when it was; some time in the fall, or later on, he came in with Mr. Garson and wanted some money and we gave him three thousand dollars, hut Garson signed the note.\nQ. At that time when the three thousand dollar note was arranged, you conducted the negotiations with the plaintiff?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Your assistant took no part in it?\nA. Oh, he may have put it through.\nQ. But you had the conversation?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you say at that time that you had no knowledge of what the indebtedness of Garson to Eraser was?\nA. No, none whatever. About that time Fraser and Garson were here, and Garson told me that he had handed over the G.P.R. station work to Fraser.\nQ. He told you that?\nA. That was the first intimation I knew of the connection, just about the time that note went through; it may have been a little before, or it must have been a little before or a little after; it loas about that time.\nQ. It was not at the time that this note went through?\nA. No, it isn\u2019t at the time. It may have been a little before that \u2014 it must have been a little before that time.\nQ. A little before?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did he say \u2014\u2014\nA. He just came in and he said: \u201cI wish to tell you that the C.P.R. station work is to be handled by Fraser.\u201d\nAt the trial he said:\u2014\nQ. When did you first learn that Mr. Fraser had any business relations with Mr. Garson?\nA. Well, I can\u2019t give you the date definitely, the interview was so short, and there was nothing resulted from it that would lead me up to the time as to when it did take place.\nQ. Do you mean the interview between Mr. Garson, Mr. Fraser and yourself?\nA. Yes. Q. Do you know when that took place?\nA. No, I don\u2019t know.\nQ. Was that the occasion when you authorized the discounting of the $3,000 note?\nA. Well, it might have been about that time, and it might have been before.\nQ. It might have been before the 21st day of November, 1910?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was it an occasion when Mr. Garson was here in the city?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you know whether Mr. Garson was here during the summer at all?\nA. I could not say.\nQ. Did you see him during the summer?\nA. I couldn\u2019t swear definitely.\nQ. Could you tell me how long prior to the 21st of November it would be when you had the conversation with Mr. Garson?\nA. The time Mr. Garson and Mr. Fraser were in?\nQ. That was the date the note was discounted, was it?\nA. Well, no, I am not sure that it was. I had a conversation with Mr. Fraser at the time that this note went through, but I think the other conversation I refer to must have been before that.\nQ. Who would that be with?\nA. Mr. Garson \u2014 and Mr. Fraser toas there.\nQ. Mr. Garson and Mr. Fraser were there?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You say you think that would be before November 21st?\nA. I think, probably, about that time.\nQ. Can you give me any idea how long before November 21st? Can you give me any idea how long before that \u2014 a month?\nA. It may be.\nQ. Would it be two months?\nA. Well. I couldn\u2019t say; some time during the summer.\nQ. Some time during the summer?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was it before or after you had taken this assignment from Garson of the 21st of June?\nA. Oh, I suppose it would be after that.\nQ. It would be after that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. When did you first become aware of the fact that Fraser was building these Outlook Branch stations?\nA. I don\u2019t know the date. Mr. Garson and Mr. Fraser came in and Mr. Garson said, \u201cI came in, Mr. Leslie, to let you know I have handed over my stations to Mr. Fraser,\u201d and that is the only interview or knowledge I have of the matter. Q. Can you fix the date at all?\nA. No.\nQ. You say it would be after the assignment?\nA. Yes, it was some time in the summer.\nQ. Some time in the summer?\nA. Yes.\nThe nature of the conversation alone suggests the improbability of its having occurred in November when the work referred to had been almost, if not entirely, completed; and there can be no doubt that Leslie is quite right in his impression that it took place not later than some time in \u201cthe summer.\u201d The conversation must, therefore (since Garson was absent from Winnipeg from July until November) have taken place as early at least as July. Morris also says that he knew in August that Fraser was building these stations and that he must have learned of it from conversation with Garson.\nIt seems probable, indeed, that the conversation between Garson and Leslie took place shortly after Garson\u2019s arrangement was made with Fraser. Fraser wishing to obtain financial assistance from the bank, it is natural to suppose that Garson and Fraser would inform the bank of what had occurred between them and do so without delay. Then as we shall see it is clear that Garson never concealed from the bank the fact that he regarded these moneys as Fraser\u2019s and it seems unlikely that he would give a formal assignment of moneys coming from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. without informing Leslie of Fraser\u2019s interests in the proceeds of the Outlook contract.\nLeslie\u2019s evidence upon this point is so vague and hesitating, so self-contradictory even, as to suggest an entire want of such recollection on his part as would entitle him positively to affirm that this conversation occurred at a time subsequent to the assignment rather than anterior to it; and I think it would not be quite fair to read his language as involving such an affirmation. For all these reasons I am far from satisfied that we should not be entitled to disregard the finding of the learned trial judge that the assignment was taken without notice and give effect to the great weight of probability which favours the opposite view. We have, however, the indisputable fact that the conversation occurred at least as early as July, and that is sufficient for my purpose.\nThat conversation, accepting Leslie\u2019s account of it, must, I should have thought, have apprised Leslie as a business man of the fact that Garson had in a practical sense no further interest in the contract for the construction of the stations \u2014 at least as between himself and Fraser. I do not suppose the attention of Leslie or Garson or Fraser would be directed to the point of the technical legal position created by the arrangement Garson and Fraser had made; but I should have thought such a statement as that reported by Leslie must have left him with the idea that Fraser was to execute the contract and was also to have the benefit of the payments under it.\nThe interview was no casual talk. From Leslie\u2019s account of it, it appears that Garson and Fraser called upon him with the express purpose of informing him of their arrangement; and one at least of their objects in doing that undoubtedly would be \u2014 if the interview took place after the assignment \u2014 to instruct Leslie that moneys due under the Outlook contract and paid to the bank under the authority of the assignment were to be treated as Fraser\u2019s. But whatever construction might be placed upon Garson\u2019s words as reported by Leslie when taken by themselves \u2014 their subsequent conduct shews conclusively the view all parties took of Fraser\u2019s rights. On Garson\u2019s side, his cheques and his letters written to the respondent bank unmistakeably treat the moneys paid under this contract as Fraser\u2019s moneys. On the side of the bank, the conduct of Leslie and Morris in respect of transactions either between the bank and Fraser or between the bank and Garson, or between Garson and Fraser themselves taking place directly under the observation of those officers of the bank, during the months of July, August, October and November, establishes, I think, beyond controversy these facts: Leslie and Morris knew that Fraser (whose business, to their knowledge, was that of a contractor) was building the Outlook stations, and that he was providing the means for doing so out of his own resources quite independently of Garson; they knew, moreover, that the moneys received by Garson from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. on account of Outlook stations were scrupulously treated by Garson as Fraser\u2019s moneys. Leslie and Morris, moreover, acquiesced in this treatment of these funds as if in accordance with a course of business perfectly well understood among all parties concerned. Interpreting the conversation between Garson and Leslie by the light of these facts, I see no escape from the conclusion that it conveyed to Leslie\u2019s mind the idea that, in the sense I have mentioned, Garson\u2019s interest in the contract had passed to Fraser.\nLet us look at the evidence a little more closely. The bank became aware in July that Fraser was drawing on his own resources for funds to build the Outlook stations. Fraser remained in Winnipeg and early in July sent forward his foreman Simmons to Moose Jaw to begin work on the Outlook Branch. Fraser, as I have mentioned, had for some years been a customer of the respondent bank and kept his account in the Winnipeg branch. From time to time during the months of July, August, October and November remittances were forwarded by or through the bank to Simmons in order to provide him with money to pay wages and other bills requiring payment in cash. The first of these remittances was expressed (in blank bills) to Simmons by Morris on the 30th or 31st July. Morris admits that he assumed these moneys were to be used in connection with the Outlook contract. To provide for one of these remittances (on the 25th August) it was necessary, as appears from the state of Fraser\u2019s bank account, to make arrangements for an advance from the bank. The advance was made, the bank taking Fraser\u2019s promissory note at ten days. This note was filled in by Morris personally; and the cheque for the amount of the remittance is expressed to be made on \u201caccount stations,\u201d and was initialled by Morris, who also in a memorandum on the back of the cheque noted the destination of the remittance. Such remittances continued (as I have said) during the ensuing four months in circumstances shewing conclusively to the knowledge of Morris that they were being provided by Fraser from his own capital. There is not a suggestion anywhere in the case that it occurred to anybody that in making these remittances Fraser was acting in any way on behalf of Garson.\nThen as to the payments under the Outlook contract. Under the contract \u201capproximate estimates\u201d as they were called, were made at the end of each calendar month and the amount of each such estimate (less 10% which the company retained as security for the due completion of the work) became payable on the 20th of the next ensuing month. The sum ascertained to be payable under the estimate for July became payable on the 20th of August. This sum was, in fact, paid into the bank on the 9th September. It does not appear in the record whether the railway company\u2019s cheque was made payable to the bank or to Garson, but at all events the amount was by the bank placed to Garson\u2019s credit. Garson\u2019s account with the Winnipeg branch was at that time overdrawn, but the amount of the estimate ($1,620) was immediately transferred to Eraser\u2019s credit upon the authority of a cheque drawn by Garson. This cheque was expressed to be in \u201cpayment of first estimate Outlook contract\u201d and was initialled by Morris, Garson being at this time in Calgary. It does not clearly appear how the cheque reached the bank, but the bank produced no communication from Garson in the month of August. Either then the bank had some explanation from Garson which is not now forthcoming, or Garson\u2019s cheque transferring the estimate to Fraser was honoured as a matter of course in consequence of information the officers of the bank already had touching the title to these moneys. But there is a little more. Garson\u2019s cheque is dated 22nd August. That was two days after the day on which the July estimate was due (20th August) under the contract with the railway company, and Garson had been informed as to the amount, for the cheque is drawn for the exact sum afterwards paid. On the 24th, two days later, Fraser applied for an advance. He says he asked for the advance on the strength of this estimate. Leslie, in examination for discovery, in effect admitted the advance was made in the expectation of a payment being made under the Garson contract. All this points to the existence at this time of a common understanding among all concerned that these moneys, although nominally Garson\u2019s, were really the property of Fraser.\nThe conduct of the parties in respect of the August estimate is yet more significant. This estimate was, under the terms of the contract, payable on the 20th September. On that date Garson wrote from Calgary the following letter:\u2014\nManager, Imperial Bank,\nWinnipeg.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 17th received O.K. As C. P. August estimate is now overdue, I enclose a cheque in favour of W. H. Fraser with amount Wank, which you will oblige by filling in for the sum returned in the August estimate for the stations he is building and hand same to him as soon as the cash comes in. I also enclose a cheque in favour of the Guerney Foundry Co., also in blank, on account Kenora Bank. The balance accruing due to them on this account is $.909.80. Fill the cheque out for this or any part of it the Kenora special account will stand and send it to them, the balance of August will keep for a time. I have Kenora practically finished and quite a lot coming yet. I understand a payment has come in on Minnedosa account; this really belongs to Synder. I have sent him a cheque accordingly. I have given a cheque to Ashdown here for $500 on account. Kindly honour it. Work going well. Weather fine. Have broken tall records for Calgary in reinforced concrete construction by putting in 152 cubic yards in a 6-inch floor in one run.\nYours truly,\nWm. Gabson.\nAnd on the 24th September Morris sent him this reply:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014Referring to your letter of the 20th instant re W. H. Fraser, we are advised by Mr. Fraser that his August estimates amount to about $5,400. We have filled in your cheque in his favour for one thousand dollars ($1,000) in the meantime.\nYours truly,\nM. Morris, Assistant Manager. The cheque referred to as actually filled in by Morris is in the following form:\u2014\nCalgary, Alta., Sept. 20, 1910.\nImperial Bank of Canada.\nPay W. H. Fraser or order one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).\nA\/c. Aug. Est. Outlook Stations.\nWm. Garson.\nOn the 8th October the estimate was received by the bank and on the same day the balance, after deducting the $1,000 already transferred, was transferred to Fraser\u2019s account by a cheque of Garson\u2019s marked \u201cEstimate No. 2, Outlook stations.\u201d In this instance also both on the occasion of the transfer of the first sum of $1,000 and afterwards of the second sum. of $4,400, Garson\u2019s account at the Winnipeg branch appears to have been overdrawn. Comment upon this transaction seems superfluous. Garson\u2019s letter and the action of the bank upon it shew that both parties regarded the estimate for August, whatever might be the amount of it, as belonging to Fraser. Morris\u2019s language: \u201cWe are advised by Mr. Fraser that his August estimates amount to $5,400\u201d is no slip of the pen; it expressed in words the conception of Fraser\u2019s rights which, as these transactions shew, was acted upon by everybody.\nThere is still another exchange of letters. On the 9th of November Garson writes to the bank about the September estimate; and he uses these words:\u2014\nIt is likely the C.P.R. estimate on Outlook work will be paid in shortly. It belongs to W. H. Fraser. When it comes let him draw on me at sight for the amount and transfer it to him.\nLet me know if you approve of my keeping the money in your bank here. I know it would make your account look better if I sent it to Winnipeg, but it looks rather awkward to send you the money one day and have you wire it back the next. As it is, if you take the balances of both accounts into consideration I have had my slate cleaned again on this transaction. And will probably repeat the clean up again this month.\nYours truly,\nWm. Garson.\nP.S.\u2014I have just been advised that the Strathcona Post Office contract has been awarded to me.\nIn reply Morris, on the 14th, writes:\u2014\nImperial Bank of Canada,\nWinnipeg, Man., 14th November, 1910.\nWm. Garson, Esq.,\nDominion Hotel,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and note your advices.\nThere is no objection to your retaining money in Calgary for your Calgary contracts, providing that proceeds of your C.P.R. contracts will be sufficient to protect advances in this office.\nYours truly,\nM. Morris, Assistant Manager.\nThe sum received by the bank under the estimate referred to forms part of the moneys in dispute. To appreciate the significance of these letters it is necessary to recall the fact that the bank had been receiving moneys from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. for Garson\u2019s credit in respect both of the Calgary and Outlook contracts. The latter moneys, as we have seen, had been appropriated to Fraser; the others had been applied in satisfaction of the bank\u2019s advances to Garson. Garson\u2019s letter was a reminder to the bank that the moneys coming under the Outlook contract were Fraser\u2019s; and this statement is accepted without a word of comment by Morris. The phrase \u201cproceeds of your C.P.R. contract\u201d obviously refers to the Calgary contract. The inference seems irresistible. It was understood by everybody that the bank had no interest in or claim upon the Outlook moneys. From all this I conclude that Leslie and Morris, as well as Fraser and Garson understood, at least from the time of the interview mentioned by Leslie (which must have occurred, as we have seen, not later than July), that under that arrangement Fraser was to build the Outlook stations and was to be entitled to the moneys thereby earned, or in the words of the learned trial judge, in 22 Man. R., at p. 66: \u201cThese payments (under the Outlook contract) were to be handed over to the plaintiff.\u201d\nThe bank\u2019s knowledge, however, of Fraser\u2019s rights would not in itself prejudice its claim to have the moneys assigned applied in liquidation of any debt incurred before that time (for which the assignment was to stand as security) which is still unpaid. The exact particulars regarding the bank\u2019s advances to Garson have not been put in evidence. There is, however, sufficient, I think, to enable us to say with confidence that no such debt is now in existence.\nIt is stated by Leslie that no advance was made on the security of the assignment at the time it was executed; and that his intention in taking it was not to make advances on the security of Canadian Pacific Railway moneys generally, but only from time to time on the security of some specific sum known to have been earned and to be payable at a definite time.\nThe following passages from Leslie\u2019s evidence at the trial make this very clear:\u2014\nQ. Under this assignment from Garson to yourselves \u2014 the bank \u2014 was any money advanced by the bank \u2014\u2014\nMr. Elliott: I object to that. It is not an issue here.\nMr. Fullerton (continuing the question): To Mr. Garson?\nA. No, not at the time.\nMr. Fullerton: I will say this, if we had not set up all that I had proposed to ask for an amendment to that record, that on the strength of the assignment we advanced moneys from time to time, and our position was prejudiced. His Lordship: I think I will allow it, because it seems to me that it ought to be material.\nMr. Elliott: That changes the whole nature of the case. That changes the whole nature of this case, and it should not be gone into now on amendment.\nHis Lordship: I will allow it, subject to your objection, in the meantime. What is your question again?\nMr. Fullerton: What do you say as to that? Were any advances made, were any moneys advanced by the bank on the strength of this assignment?\nA. Why, I can\u2019t remember just now, it strengthened Garson\u2019s credit.\nQ. It was advanced on the strength of Garson\u2019s credit\nA. Yes.\nQ. After this assignment was made were moneys advanced to Garson?\nA. Yes; that is my recollection at least.\nQ. Would all the moneys in question in this action be sufficient to pay off Garson\u2019s indebtedness to the bank?\nMr. Elliott: I object to the question.\nHis Lordship: I will allow it.\nA. No.\nQ. You say no?\nA. Yes \u2014 I am not positive about that. Yes, I think, I can say no. Q. You say no?\nA. Yes; that is the moneys coming from here would not be sufficient.\nQ. Let me ask you this question: Did you take any steps from time to time to ascertain what moneys were coming from the C.P.R.?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You did that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And did the question of the advances that you were making from time to time depend to any extent upon your inquiry?\nObjected to by Mr. Elliott.\nHis Lordship: I don\u2019t think you should ask the question in that way.\nMr. Fullerton: What practice did you follow with regard to making advances to Mr. Garson?\nMr. Elliott: That is not a material fact here, as to what his practice or habit was, and I object to that.\nHis Lordship: I, don\u2019t think so.\nMr. Fullerton: I want to shew that he would come along for the advances, and they would ask the C.P.R. if an estimate were passed, and if the estimate were passed they would advance the money on the strength of that estimate being passed, and that is the question I want to ask. Mr. Elliott: That does not concern us.\nHis Lordship: I don\u2019t know.\nMr. Fullerton: It depends upon that, whether on the strength of these estimates being passed money was advanced, and I want to shew that really when an advance was asked for the C.P.R. would be asked as to whether there was any estimate passed or to be passed, and on the strength of the inquiry, or the answer received to it, the advance was made.\nHis Lordship: You can probably get at it without putting a leading question to him. He says that he did take steps from time to time to find out if there were any moneys coming from the C.P.R., and if you ask him why he did that you may get at it.\nMr. Fullerton: Why did you do that?\nMr. Elliott: I object again to that. His object and purpose in doing that would not, surely, affect us.\nHis Lordship: It may.\nMr. Elliott: How?\nHis Lordship: If it does not, it will not do you any harm.\nMr. Elliott: I object to it, my Lord.\nHis Lordship: I will allow the question.\nMr. Fullerton: You made inquiries from the C.P.R. from time to time as to moneys coming from them to Garson?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Why did you make those inquiries?\nA. Well, to ascertain whether we would be justified in paying his cheques.\nThis is the evidence given by Leslie at the trial.\nOn his examination for discovery he had made the following statement:\u2014\nQ. I see, Mr. Leslie, you witnessed this document. Just tell us all the circumstances and your reasons for taking that?\nA. This assignment was given to us as security for the advances made from time to time to Garson.\nQ. Was it for advances already made or for future advances?\nA. It toas both.\nQ. Did you know at the time of taking that assignment what contracts he had with the C.P.R.?\nA. No.\nQ. What moneys were owing to him?\nA. Not definitely.\nQ. Why do you say \u201cnot definitely\u201d?\nA. I knew that he had contracts with the C.P.R., but I knew nothing as to the amount definitely coming to him.\nQ. Did you know what kind of contracts he had? A. No, not \u2014 I knew that he had \u2014 nothing definitely. The only thing I can remember that he had was some contract for roundhouses or something of that kind.\nQ. Do you remember him stating that he had contracts for stations and roundhouses?\nA. Not definitely; the only thing I can remember that he had some contract for roundhouses at Calgary; that is the only definite contracts that I \u2014\u2014\nQ. He told you that he had tendered?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you remember that distinctly, and you remember definitely about the roundhouses at Calgary?\nA. Yes, I am pretty sure that that is right. But we never made any inquiry as to the nature of his contracts or where they were.\nQ. Why?\nA. We could find out how much was coming from the C.P.R. before we would lend him any money.\nQ. Did you find out in this case?\nA. I must have found out in this case what he said toas due, and had it corroborated to some extent.\nQ. What amount did he say that was due?\nA. Oh, I don\u2019t know. We generally figure on keeping a good margin.\nQ. Did you call up the C.P.R. after you got this?\nA. No, I wouldn\u2019t say that I did. I wouldn\u2019t state positively \u2014 at the time.\nQ. Was all the conversation with regard to this assignment made with you?\nA. Well, I think it was. I would say, \u201cHere, if you are dealing with the C.P.R. and moneys are coming from there, we need an assignment of all the moneys coming from there, in a general way.\u201d Garson would come in and when he was in need of money would say: \u201cNow there is so much due me by the company.\u201d We would endeavour to have that verified in some way or other, and telephone down to the depot, or engineers, and if they said \u201cYes,\u201d why we would take that for granted.\nMoneys advanced in this way would, in the ordinary course, be repaid as soon as the bank received the payment in anticipation of which the advance had been made; and the natural inference from this course of business seems incompatible with the supposition that any debt remains unpaid which was incurred as early as July, 1910. The evidence afforded by Garson\u2019s pass-book and correspondence with the bank is also inconsistent with it. So are the dealings with the July and August estimates already discussed and the correspondence between Garson and Morris in November. It is almost impossible to believe, for example, if Leslie regarded the moneys payable under the August estimate as security for an existing debt owing by Garson that he would have made an advance to Fraser in anticipation of these moneys being paid to Fraser as he admitted he did; or that the dealings with the July and August estimates already discussed could have taken place. And perhaps still more difficult to believe that Leslie and Morris would have abstained from comment upon Garson\u2019s statement in his November letter that the overdue estimate under the Outlook contract was Fraser\u2019s.\nThe only difficulty I have felt with regard to this matter of advances is this. I have not been altogether free from misgiving that the learned trial judge\u2019s ruling to which I have referred may be accountable for the lack of explicit evidence as to the dates of the bank\u2019s advances to Garson and I have carefully considered the question whether if the appeal should turn upon this point the bank ought not to have an opportunity of supplying such evidence. In a case which has been marked by so much misconception as to the legal principles governing the rights of the parties one naturally hesitates to proceed upon any merely technical rule as to the burden of proof. I am satisfied, however, that we have before us all the relevant facts that could lend support to the claim of the bank. The facts touching the matter of advances were all, of course, within Leslie\u2019s knowledge. On Leslie\u2019s viv\u00e2 voce examination for discovery the bank\u2019s solicitor took the position and adhered to it that the appellant was not entitled to any information touching Garson\u2019s indebtedness to the bank. In the affidavit of discovery Leslie states that the only book or document in the bank\u2019s possession containing anything relating to the controversy is the assignment itself. The bank\u2019s position, in a word, was that Fraser was a stranger having no interest in the moneys in question and the bank\u2019s relations with Garson had, of course, no bearing upon the issue thus raised. At the trial Fraser\u2019s counsel objected to evidence shewing advances by the bank on the ground that the bank by assuming and maintaining the position above mentioned had defined the issue and limited it to the single question whether or not Garson had assigned these moneys in question. With this counsel for the bank appeared to agree and there was some suggestion about an amendment. The learned trial judge eventually permitted, as appears from the extract quoted above, an examination of Leslie upon the subject of advances; hut notwithstanding the fact that such evidence was permitted to be given, none was offered to shew when the debts were incurred which the bank claims the right to have paid out of the moneys in question. Indeed, while Leslie\u2019s evidence was explicit that no advance was made at the time the assignment was given, there was not a suggestion that any debt remains unpaid that had been incurred as early as July, 1910 \u2014 a suggestion which, as I have pointed out, is not easily to be reconciled with the inference to be drawn from Leslie\u2019s account of the course of business.\nIn point of fact that suggestion was not put forward, even in argument on behalf of the bank; and from the circumstances I have mentioned I think we are entitled to conclude that there is, in fact, no foundation for it. But there is another ground upon which the appellant is entitled to succeed.\nWhere one man induces another to alter his position by active misleading, or by silence, where there is by contract, usage of trade, or otherwise, a duty to speak, or in an equitable case, one may say, where the circumstances are such as to make it against conscience to be silent, his, rights must be regulated by what he has himself brought about.\nIn these words Lord Blackburn (Russell v. Watts[40]), at p. 613) states a familiar principle of law; and in Stronge v. Hawkes[41], at p. 196, a great equity judge, Turner L. J., gives an illustration of the application of that principle to a particular class of cases in these words:\u2014\nIt has long been settled that where a party having a charge upon an estate, encourages or even permits another to advance money upon the security of the estate without giving notice of the charge, the party who has thus been encouraged or permitted to make the advance is entitled to priority over the party who has thus encouraged or permitted the advance to be made. The fact of the party having the charge standing by and permitting the further advance to be made, without giving notice of the charge, is alone sufficient to support this equity on the part of the subsequent incumbrancer.\nThe circumstances of this case already mentioned fairly bring it within both the general doctrine and the particular rule expounded in these passages. I assume for the purpose of applying this principle that when Garson and Fraser had their interview with Mr. Leslie and informed him of their arrangement, Garson was indebted for advances secured by the assigment which advances are still unpaid. If I am correct in my interpretation of that interview and of the subsequent conduct of Leslie and Morris, Leslie as a result of the interview was aware that Fraser had taken the Outlook contract off Garson\u2019s hands on the understanding that the moneys earned were to be his. He knew that both Garson and Fraser assumed that Garson was entirely free to make that arrangement. He subsequently became aware that Fraser was proceeding with the performance of the contract on the faith of that arrangement. During the months of July, August, September, October and November while, to Leslie\u2019s knowledge, Fraser was devoting his time and his capital to the completion of the contract, he and Morris co-operated with Garson and Fraser in treating the moneys arising from the contract as Fraser\u2019s. It was only after the contract had been completed by Fraser\u2019s exertions and at his own cost and Garson was in his last illness that the claim to appropriate the reward of Fraser\u2019s work under the bank\u2019s assignment was, for the first time, suggested. It would be something of a reproach upon the law if in such circumstances such a claim could be allowed to prevail in a court of justice.\nTo summarize for the sake of clearness these rather lengthy reasons for disagreeing with the court below. The evidence, and notably that which discloses the conduct of the parties, conclusively justifies the finding of the trial judge that there was in April an arrangement between Garson and Fraser by which Fraser was to assume the building of the stations on the Outlook Branch in performance of Garson\u2019s contract with the Canadian. Pacific Railway Co. and that by the same arrangement the moneys paid under that contract by the railway company to Garson were by him to be paid over to Fraser. It is, moreover, established that the bank had notice that an arrangement of this character had been made between Fraser and Garson at least as early as July. The proper inference from the facts in evidence (including the course of the bank in the conduct of its defence) is that no obligation from Garson to the bank which came into existence as early as July, and for which the assignment was to stand as security, is still unsatisfied. It follows that assuming the assignment of June to have been taken without notice of the appellant\u2019s rights and to have the effect of vesting in the bank the legal title to moneys (as soon as such moneys should be earned) which should become payable to Garson under the Outlook contract \u2014 still the bank having had notice of Fraser\u2019s rights before any debt was incurred for which it is now entitled to hold the assignment as security, cannot on well-known principles successfully assert any claim upon those moneys as against Fraser. Moreover, the conduct of the bank in not only standing by and permitting Fraser to proceed, but in effect encouraging Fraser to proceed with the work of performing the Outlook contract on the faith of his arrangement with Garson that he was to have as his own the proceeds of that contract when realized (without disclosing its own claim to retain those proceeds until after they had been earned by Fraser\u2019s exertions), disqualifies the bank on equally well-known principles as against Fraser from enforcing rights which otherwise might have been permitted to take effect.\nAnglin and Brodeur JJ. concurred with Duff J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George A.

Devine v. Holloway (14 Moo. P.C. 290) referred to.\nWhere the defendant has not been sued in an action for damages by reason of an act done in the exercise of a public function or duty, the provision of article 88 C.P.Q., as to notice of action against a public officer, has no application.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ought not, in ordinary cases, to take into consideration the notes of reasons for judgments in the courts below which have not been delivered before the settling of the case on the appeal: Mayhew v. Stone (26 Can. S.C.R. 58) followed. In a proper case, however, when the nondelivery of such notes is satisfactorily accounted for, the court may permit them to be filed and made use of as part of the record on the appeal: Canadian Fire Insurance Co. v. Robinson (Cout. Dig. 1105) referred to.\nThe court refused to reverse the concurrent findings of fact by the courts below.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, which affirmed the judgment of Demers J., in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, maintaining the respondent\u2019s action with costs.\nThe respondent, plaintiff, brought the action against the appellant, defendant, to recover $5,000, with interest, which, it was alleged, had been placed by him in the hands of the defendant, who was his notary, with instructions to invest the amount on loan secured by a second mortgage upon certain real estate in Montreal. It was charged that the defendant had not followed the instructions given by the plaintiff in regard to the security to be obtained, but that he had, without authorization, made new terms and that, in consequence, the money had been lost. No notice of action was given according to the provision of article 88 of the Code of Procedure of Quebec respecting suits against public officers. The effect of the defendant\u2019s pleadings and of his contentions in the courts below was that the plaintiff had been kept informed of all that transpired during the transaction of the business relating to the making of the loan and that he had acquiesced in all that had been done in the matter, and that, therefore, the loss of the money was not due to anything which he had done in the matter, but that it was the result of neglect and delay for which the plaintiff himself was responsible. The question of want of notice was not raised.\nAt the trial, Demers J. found that the defendant had not fulfilled his mandate, that he had acted contrary to explicit instructions of the plaintiff, and rendered judgment maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s action for the sum claimed with interest and costs. This judgment was affirmed, on appeal, by the Court of Review, Mr. Justice Tellier dissenting. Proceedings were commenced upon an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada by the defendant and, on 19th June, 1912, an order was made by the Court of Review settling the contents of the \u201ccase\u201d on the appeal, and the certified case, as settled, was filed in the office of the Supreme Court on the 11th September, 1912. Up to this latter date no notes of reasons for judgment had been delivered by Mr. Justice Tellier, but on the 20th of September, 1912, the learned judge delivered notes of his reasons for dissent from the judgment rendered in the Court of Review, and these notes were printed as an appendix to the case as filed and were deposited in the office of the Supreme Court on the 26th of October, 1912, during the session of the court at which the appeal was to come on for hearing.\nUpon the appeal coming on for hearing before the court, Mr. Rinfret, of counsel for the respondent, moved the court to strike out from the record on the appeal the document purporting to contain the reasons of Mr. Justice Tellier on the ground that it had been irregularly filed after the appeal had been taken, that it did not form part of the record in the court below, and that it had the effect of prejudicing the respondent, who was not aware of the contents of the document. On behalf of the appellant, Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. shewed cause, stating that similar reasons had been verbally delivered by Mr. Justice Tellier for his dissent at the time the judgment of the Court of Review had been rendered, but, owing to certain circumstances, that he had been unable to deliver the written notes until a later date.\nThe court referred to the case of Mayhew v. Stone[1], and Canadian Fire Insurance Co. v. Robinson[2], and expressed the opinion that the rule laid down in Mayhew v. Stone[3] was the correct one to apply in cases where reasons for judgment were delivered subsequent to the launching of the proceedings on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, although there could be no objection to making use of reasons where their non-delivery was accounted for on the ground of illness, absence, etc.; that, by the statute and the rules, appeals were to be heard on the case as settled and that no additional material should be considered in ordinary cases. At the same time, the court did not preclude itself, in a proper case and upon a proper application, from receiving reasons for judgment which have been delivered by judges after the appeal has been taken. In the present case leave was granted to counsel for the appellant to make a subsequent application, supported by affidavits, etc., shewing the circumstances which, in the view of counsel, might justify the court in receiving the notes in question.\nIn the meantime the appeal was heard upon the merits.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Richard Beaudry for the appellant. The contract of agency was not proved by the plaintiff; no mandate can result from the receipt of the cheque merely. Any instruction which may have been given as to the investment of the money was modified subsequently by conversations over the telephone; this parol evidence can be legally received under article 4585 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, which has full and unrestricted application in the circumstances of this case; it is, moreover, supported by a commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, the letter from the plaintiff.\nWe also submit that the action ought to be dismissed because it was not preceded by the necessary notice of action required by article 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure; the appellant, being a notary public, and having been employed in this matter to act for the plaintiff as such, is a \u201cpublic officer\u201d; art. 4575, R.S.Q., 1909; the article 88, C.P.Q., gives him this protection. Although not pleaded it is a provision of which the court is obliged to take judicial notice in this case; on the face of the proceedings it appears that the defendant is charged with the responsibility, if any, for which it is sought to make him liable, in his capacity as the notary and professional adviser of the plaintiff. We rely upon the following authorities: Lasnier v. Dozois[4], per Lynch J. at pages 604-5; Gervais v. Nadeau[5], confirmed on appeal, and arts. 1065 and 1709, C.C. The action, in any event, is based on liability for damages; the plaintiff was bound to allege notice in his statement of claim and to prove such notice, and, having failed to do so, his action must fail.\nRinfret and Genest, for the respondent. As to the facts we have the findings of both courts below in our favour; these findings ought not to be reversed on appeal. The respondent has acknowledged the receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s letter instructing him in respect to the investment of the money; the proof has failed as to the alleged modification of the mandate; parol evidence is not admissible to contradict the terms of the letter and, moreover, the verbal evidence as to the alleged change has been denied and that denial accepted in favour of the plaintiff. We refer to Gouillard, no. 45; Fuzier-Herman, art. 1985, nos. 57, 59; Rolland de Villargues, Rep. du Notariat, no. 211, vo. \u201cResponsabilite des Notaires\u201d; O\u2019Malley v. Ryan[6]; Brownlee v. Hyde[7]; Langelier, \u201cPreuve,\u201d p. 246, et seq. The provisions of art. 4585, R.S.Q., 1909, can have no application in a case such as this; it is governed by arts. 1233 and 1234, 0:0., which preclude parol testimony for an amount such as is in dispute in this case. See also Taylor on Evidence, vol. 2 (9 ed.), p. 742, par. 1132; Greenleaf, Evidence (16 ed.), vol. 1, pp. 404, 405; Phipson, Evidence (5 ed.), p. 536; Best, Evidence (11 ed.), p. 218; 8 Aubry & Rau, p. 320, note 2 to sec. 763; Pand.

Smith[10]; Laurent, vol. 19, nn. 558, 559, 564; Moody v. Jones[11].\nNo notice of action was necessary; the present action is not for damages by reason of any act done by defendant in the exercise of his functions as a notary, but for an omission to do what he was bound to do, as a simple mandatary: Lachance v, Casault[12]; Price v. Perceval[13]; J odoin v. Archambault[14]; Chagnon v. Quesnel[15]; Twin v. Boston[16]. Notice is not necessary where the action is for breach of contract: Davis y. Curling[17]; Fletcher v. Greenwell[18]; Davies v. Mayor of Swansea[19]. This objection should have been raised by way of exception, or in the plea to the merits, and not for the first time before the Supreme Court: Gale v. Bureau[20]; Davey v. Warne[21]; Richards v. Easto[22]; Law v. Dodd[23]; B\u00e9dard v. Corp. Comt\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec[24]; Kelly v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[25]; Gauthier v. Municipalit\u00e9 de St. Louis[26]; Sullivan v. Ville de Magog[27]; Pageau v. Corp. St. Ambroise[28]; Corp. de Douglas v. Maher[29]; Legault v. Lee[30]; Turner v. Corp. de St. Louis du Ha! Ha![31]; Laurin v. Corp. du Sault au R\u00e9collet[32]; Boulay v. Saucier[33]; Harrison v. Brega[34]; Harold v. Corp. of Simcoe[35].\nIn Gervais v. Nadeau[36] the defendant was sued in damages for a deed improperly drawn, against the law, and the question of notice had been raised in the plea.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Richard Beaudry for the appellant.\nRinfret and Genest, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment in an action brought to recover the sum of five thousand dollars which the plaintiff, respondent here, says was given by him to the defendant, appellant here, to be applied to the purchase of a piece of property, the case turned in both courts below on the nature of the instructions subject to which the money was deposited with the defendant. Both courts found on that issue of fact against the defendant, and he was condemned to refund the money.\nHere, for the first time, the defendant raises the point that he being a notary public and, consequently, \u201ca public officer,\u201d was by virtue of article 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure entitled to notice of this action, and that notice not having been given that the action must fail. It is doubtful whether such an objection, even if well founded, should be allowed to prevail here. Devine v. Holloway[37].\nThe complete answer to the objection, however, is that this is not an action in the form of an answer for damages. It may be that it is difficult to find a distinction in substance between such an action as this and one simply for negligence; but the case has been treated throughout as an action \u201cen repetition\u201d pure and simple and we cannot change its nature here, even to allow the defendant to take advantage of this highly technical objection. Of course it was open to the plaintiff to sue for damages (art, 1709, C.C.), in which case he might have recovered a sum in excess of the amount now claimed. If he chose, however to limit his recourse, without prejudice to the defendant, and to adopt an action in this form\u2014how can this right be denied to him?\nIt is further to be observed that the defendant in his plea to the action takes pains to deny that he acted as a notary public in this transaction.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the objection of want of notice cannot be allowed to prevail.\nOn the merits I can see no reason to reverse the concurrent judgments of the courts below. The money in question was advanced in the form of a bank cheque made by the plaintiff to the order of the defendant, and it is found as a fact that the cheque was given with definite instructions as to the conditions under which it was to be used and that the defendant accepted it subject to those instructions. He subsequently parted with the cheque in violation of those instructions and without the most elementary regard for the interest of his principal, to whom the money was, in consequence, lost. On these facts also we have the concurrent findings of the two courts below. How in these circumstances can the appellant hope to escape liability?\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. And, as to the proposed defence of want of notice of action, I think it cannot be permitted to raise such a defence at this stage for the first time.\nBesides, even if a notary public, as such, is entitled to a notice of action (as to which I say nothing) the facts in this case do not seem such as to have enabled the appelant to avail himself of it if he had pleaded it.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in dismissing the appeal. The highly technical objection based upon article 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure ought not, in my opinion, to be entertained. The objection was not taken in the pleadings nor at the trial nor before the Court of King\u2019s Bench. In his defence the appellant alleged that in the transactions out of which the respondent\u2019s claim arose he was not acting in his capacity as a notary public. There can be no risk of injustice in refusing to permit it to be raised now. In these circumstances I think the objection based upon the absence of notice of action, if it ever had any substance, comes too late.\nAnglin and Brodeur JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaudry & Beaudry.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret & Genest.\n[1] 26 Can.

Of the eight shares, that attributable to L. M., one of the children, was enjoyed by him up to the time of his death, in 1887, intestate as to the share in question and without issue.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting.\u2014That, as the will did not give the children and grandchildren of the testator any rights as proprietors in his estate, there was no substitution created by its provisions.\nHeld, also, Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\u2014That, on the death of L.M. without issue, the share allotted to him remained vested in the trustees subject to distribution among the children of the testator and their descendants in the same manner and upon the same conditions as if L.M. had pre-deceased the testator and the estate had been originally apportioned into seven instead of into eight parts.\nPer Davies J.\u2014As there was no provision in the will in respect to children dying without issue, and as there was no collateral substitution, there was intestacy resulting, on the death of L.M. without issue, in regard to the share allotted to him; consequently, it remained vested in the trustees for the benefit of and to be distributed amongst the heirs of the testator living at that date.\nPer Brodeur J. dissenting.\u2014The will had the effect of creating a direct and collateral substitution. At the death of L.M. his brothers and sisters became substitutes and their descendants are appel\u00e9s.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 20 K.B. 1) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Charbonneau[2], in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal.\nThe circumstances of the case are shortly stated in the head-note and are fully set out in the judgments now reported. In construing the will, the judgment of the Superior Court adopted the theory of accretion with its practical consequences, holding that the share of Louis Masson had accreted on his death to the seven other branches without forming a degree of substitutions. This judgment was reversed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, which decided that there had been a transmission on Louis Masson\u2019s death, counting as a degree of substitution.\nHon. A. R. Angers K.C. for the appellant\nNesbitt K.C. and Arnoldi K.C. for the respondents.\nHon. A. R. Angers K.C. for the appellant L\u00e9opold Masson. The will in question created a substitution by a joint disposition to co-legatees, directing that the same be reversible from the testator\u2019s children to their children respectively, and substituted from descendants to descendants, and this indefinitely or as far as allowed by law. This means, under art. 932 C.C. and in conformity with the jurisprudence anterior to the Code, that the children of the testator are the first institutes, the grandchildren the second institutes, and the great-grandchildren the final substitutes. Mitchell v. Moreau[3]. The testator bequeathed his estate to trustees, and disposed of it by joint disposition in the manner and form indicated by art. 868 C.C. which gives rise to accretion in favour of co-legatees in the event of one of them dying without issue, thus permitting the testator\u2019s estate to reach his greatgrandchildren. By art. 868 C.C. accretion takes place in favour of the legatees in the case of lapsed legacies, when such legacies are made in favour of several persons jointly, and by art. 901 C.C. every testamentary disposition made under a condition which depends on an uncertain event lapses if the legatee die before the fulfilment of the condition. The nature and the terms of the will constituted a legacy of the universality of his estate, with substitution to several jointly,\u2014to his surviving children by one and the same disposition,\u2014without assigning the share of each co-legatee in the thing bequeathed, but only indicating equal aliquot shares in the thing bequeathed, and, consequently, the share of which Louis Masson, deceased without issue, received one-half of the revenue passed by accretion to the bulk of the estate for the benefit of the other co-legatees, as if he, Louis Masson, had never existed and the estate of Joseph Masson had originally been divided into 7 aliquot shares instead of 8. We refer to Joseph v. Castonguay[4], where Lafontaine C.J. and Aylwin, Duval, Meredith and Mondelet JJ. held, that the usufruit usually created by the same deed of donation accrued to the surviving usufructuaries. This is acknowledging the right of accretion when the legacy is created by one and the same disposition. See also Denis v. Cloutier[5]; Coin-Delisle \u201cDonations et Testaments,\u201d pp. 512, 516.\nIn counting the degrees of substitution, care must be taken not to adopt the mode indicated by the Ordinance of 1747, posterior to the establishment of the Superior Council of Quebec, which was not registered in the province, and never was in force therein. We must revert to the Ordinance of 1629, which, by article 124, declares:\u2014\n\u201cVoulons que dor\u00e9navant que les degr\u00e9s des dites substitutions et fid\u00e9icommis par toute Notre Royaume soient compt\u00e9s par t\u00eate et non par souches et g\u00e9n\u00e9rations. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire chacun de ceux qui auront appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 et recueilli le dit fid\u00e9icommis fasse un degr\u00e9, sinon que plusieurs d\u2019eux eussent succ\u00e9d\u00e9 en concurrence comme une seule t\u00eate, auquel cas ne seront compt\u00e9s que pour un seul degr\u00e9.\u201d\nThis article 124 of the Ordinance of 1629 is the source of article 868 of our Civil Code, which decrees that there is accretion to the benefit of co-legatees in the case of lapsed legacies, when such legacies are made in favour of several persons jointly by one and the same disposition, and the testator has not assigned the share of each co-legatee in the thing bequeathed. Directions given to divide the thing jointly disposed of into equal aliquot shares do not prevent accretion from taking place. In other words it is repeating the exception contained in article 124 of the Ordinance and expressed by the words, \u201cSinon que plusieurs d\u2019eux eussent succ\u00e9d\u00e9 en concurrence comme une seule t\u00eate, auquel cas ne seront compt\u00e9s, que pour un seul degr\u00e9.\u201d Our article 868 is not new law. Our Code is declaratory of what the law was in the Province of Quebec before its promulgation. See Bourjon (2 ed., 1770), Questions de Droits, 293.\nThe Ordinance of 1747, which was never in force in the Province of Quebec, provides a different mode of counting the degrees. The Chancellor d\u2019Aguesseau is of opinion that the exception of article 124 of the Ordinance of 1629 expressed by the words, \u201cSinon que plusieurs d\u2019eux succ\u00e9d\u00e9 en concurrence comme une seule t\u00eate,\u201d is in compliance with the ancient law of the Custom of Paris. In the questions by him submitted to the courts and parliaments, preparatory to the Ordinance of 1747, is the following:\u2014\n\u201c10i\u00e8me question: \u201cSi ceux qui sont appel\u00e9s conjointment \u00e0 une substitution doivent \u00eatre compt\u00e9s pour un seul degr\u00e9 ou pour plusieurs?\u201d Jones v. Cuthbert[6].\nLe Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Paris r\u00e9pond:\u2014\n\u201cCette question toute unie n\u2019en est pas une; en effet, si plusieurs appel\u00e9s successivement forment plusieurs degr\u00e9s, la m\u00eame raison veut que plusieurs appel\u00e9s conjointement ne forment qu\u2019un degr\u00e9; aussi, tous les auteurs, les parlements, l\u2019Ordonnance de 1629, les arr\u00eats de M. le Pr\u00e9sident de Lamoignon, tout se r\u00e9unit pour cette d\u00e9cision.\n\u201cOn pourrait, peut-\u00eatre, pour lever toute l\u2019\u00e9quivoque, ajouter le mot concurremment qui se trouve dans l\u2019article 44 de ces arr\u00eates; on pourrait m\u00eame y ajouter pour lever encore un autre doute, ce que le parlement d\u2019Aix a ajout\u00e9, soit que les substitu\u00e9s acqui\u00e8rent de leur chef, ou caducit\u00e9, ou par accroissement, quoique on croie ces expressions surabondantes.\u201d\nPothier teaches that, notwithstanding the Ordinance of 1747, accretion takes place in the case of joint disposition (Trait\u00e9s des Donations et Testaments, No. 342, Biblioth\u00e8que du Code C. de Lorimier, vol. 7, p. 46, on article 868).\nIn Page v. McLennan[7], there was assignation of shares, and accretion could not take place; it was so likewise in McDonald v. Dodd[8]. In Perrault v. Masson[9], Pagnuelo J. has erred in counting the degrees and his opinion is obiter. We refer to Taschereau v. Masson[10] for the learned discussion by Loranger J., and the authorities cited by him. See also Pr\u00e9vost v. Lamarche[11]; De Hertel v. Goddard [12], affirmed by the Privy Council[13]; Fraser v. Fraser[14].\nAs to the case of L\u00e9on Masson, great-grandchild of the testator, representing his father L\u00e9on Masson, who pre-deceased Bodrigue Masson, we refer to art. 937 C.C.; in substitutions representation exists when the testator has bequeathed his property in the order of legitimate successions, or his intention to that effect is otherwise manifest. Art. 980 C.C. enacts that when the terms, \u201cchildren\u201d or \u201cgrandchildren\u201d are made use of, without qualification, they apply to all the descendants. Articles 937 and 980 of the Civil Code do not contradict each other. The rule that in substitution there is no representation does not apply where the institutes are designated by a term thus interpreted by art. 980 C.C. This confirms the contention that L\u00e9on Masson, great-grandchild of the testator comes to the estate as second substitute in the place of his father, L\u00e9on, at the death of Rodrigue Masson. Marcotte v. No\u00ebl[15], per Meredith, Stuart and Casault JJ.\nBastien K.C. for the appellants Henri Masson, and others. The executors and trustees, under the will, have not only the seizin provided by art. 918 of the Civil Code, but also the seizin decreed by article 981b in favour of trustees. They have the powers of trustees and administrators, they are vested with the seizin of all the property, without reserve or exception, they can revendicate the possession thereof even against the legatees, and the powers given them allow them, without the intervention of the legatees, to manage the property entrusted to them in the most ample manner possible, and they can claim application of the dispositions of articles 981b, 981j, and 981k of the Civil Code.\nAccording to the terms of the will the partition directed was to determine the property from which revenues were to be received by the substitutes in the first degree. In the partition actually made, the estate was divided into eight equal parts, and the sub-partitions, to be subsequently made were, in the same manner, definitely to determine what property was to be enjoyed by the substitutes in the second degree. As the children of the testator received only a moiety of the revenues, upon their death, the property was transmitted, through the testamentary executors, by a partition which was the necessary consequence of the transmission. Why should the testator order partitions upon each of such transmissions if the first partition was not of a permanent character, and why partition property which is not to be transmitted in full ownership to those finally called to receive it? The will, in speaking of the partition with which we are concerned, reveals the intention of the testator with regard to the successive partitions. The share assigned to each child attributes to such child a moiety of its revenues, and the whole revenue to the grandchildren and remoter descendants of the testator. This partition prevented indivision both as regards the revenues and as regards the capital of the estate. The legatees did not have to submit to a partition, but accepted that ordered by the testator, in such a way as to divide the revenues of his property between all his children and all his descendants. But it does not follow that the late Louis Masson became absolute owner of the share of which he had a moiety of the revenues, and, even had he become the owner thereof, it was only subject to a resolutory condition.\nTestamentary executors are what Thevenot d\u2019Essaule calls charged administrators simply, who do not take the property if the legacy fails through failing of legatees, but are simply ordered to deliver according to the wishes and intention of the testator. (Thevenot d\u2019Essaule, ed. Mathieu, 538, 539.) In the present case, the persons benefited are beyond doubt the children and descendants of the testator; and it is in an exclusive manner that the de cujus wished to transmit his property for the greater advantage of his children and descendants. By this will the testator created a trust. Rolland de Villargues, vo. \u201cFiducie.\u201d Trusts have been recognized and consecrated by the Civil Code in arts. 981a et seq. But this species of disposition, authorized by the Roman law, was recognized by and practiced under the ancient law, and was never prohibited by the Civil Code. See Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. \u201cFiduciaire h\u00e9ritier.\u201d Even to-day trusts may be constituted, although article 896 of the Code Napol\u00e9on, again prohibiting substitutions, declares null any disposition by which the donor, the instituted heir, or the legatee, is ordered to deliver to a third party. The same must a fortiori be true under a system of law which recognizes substitutions and favours them. Whether or not the will creates a simple trust is always a question of interpreting the wish of the testator. In Re R\u00e9n\u00e9 Masson Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 (28th of June, 1889) found in the testamentary dispositions now in issue all the elements of a trust:\u2014 \u201cConsidering that this disposition creates an actual trust limited by the testator to the degrees permitted in substitutions, that is to say, two degrees beyond the person first called, in conformity with the Ordinance de Moulins in force in this country before the promulgation of the Civil Code, article 869 of which is a reproduction of the said Ordinance in that respect, and that, in consequence, the property so entrusted by the testator to his fiduciary legatees could not be delivered in whole or in part to any other than to those actually called to possess them in full ownership;\u2014Considering, moreover, that even supposing that the will of the said Joseph Masson created only a simple substitution, it results from that that the intention of the testator, in any event, was that the property of which he died possessed, as well as that purchased with the accumulating moiety of the revenues thereof, would be transmitted to his great-grandchildren, and to bequeath to his children only one-half of the revenues.\u201d See art. 981a C.C.\nConsidering the dispositions of the will, the ample powers conferred on the testamentary executors, and the lapse of time intervening between the death of the testator and the first delivery of the revenues to the children appointed to receive them, we find all the elements of a trust as defined by the Code and the jurists. The estate is transmitted, without reserve or exception, to the executors as trustees for the benefit of the children, for the greater advantage of the children and descendants, and in favour of the said children to whom the testator could validly bequeath his property. In Freligh v. Seymour[16], it was held that a fiduciary bequest was valid in Lower Canada, and the dispositions concerning trusts, reproducing the old law, apply to the executors in this case, because they have received from the testator wider powers than are usually conferred upon testamentary executors. Arts. 921, 964 C.C.\nCan the will be interpreted as containing a mutual trust, or an accretion? The trust may be mutual or reciprocal when two persons are mutually charged, each in favour of the other. According to the Roman law, this species of trust might be conjectured; nevertheless the authors, without other rules than the Roman law to follow, have taught that a reciprocal trust could not be admitted without necessary proof. Thevenot d\u2019Essaule, Nos. 408, 409, 413. Under our law substitution cannot be assumed, and conjectural substitutions are abolished. Article 937 C.C. lays down that representation does not take place in substitutions, unless the testator has ordered that the property shall devolve in the order of legitimate successions, or his intention to that effect be otherwise manifested.\nArticle 868 C.C. provides for accretion in favour of legatees, in the event of any part of the bequest failing, where the whole bequest is made to several persons jointly. This disposition is based upon the presumed intention of the testator. If the late Louis Masson did not take the legacy in the sense of this article, and if, his right being limited to the reception of the one-half the revenues of his share, his decease without issue rendered the bequest to him void, the property from which he derived his revenue did not thereby escape the operation of the trust. But the rules mentioned in art. 868 may nevertheless be applied by analogy, even when the legatees have come into the property. The testator could manifest his intention of providing for accretion, even when the legatee has come into the property. The indication of sharing share and share alike in the partition of the thing bequeathed by a joint disposition does not prevent accretion, and this axiom may guide us where it is evident, under the terms of the will, that the testator wished to stipulate accretion, even when his legatees have taken the succession in the legal sense.\nIn Denis v. Gloutier[17] it was held that, over and above the accretion provided for by articles 868 et seq. C.C., there may be accretion, if the testator so intended. See Taschereau v. Masson[18]; 4 Marcad\u00e9, 141, No. IV. of art. 1044; 14 Laurent 300; Coin-Delisle, \u201cDonations and Wills,\u201d page 512, No. 3 and page 516.\nThe joinder of issue is confined to the question whether the share of which the late Louis Masson enjoyed one-half the revenues should come to the descendants of the testator by way of accretion or substitution. If he had had issue, the revenues of his share would have been transmitted to his children, there would have been a transmission of property to them. But he had no issue and, therefore, his share must be partitioned among the descendants of the testator.\nMust the share of Louis Masson be taken and divided into seven equal and distinct shares to add each of these subdivisions to the other shares; in other words, must share No. 2 be made to disappear and be spread over the other shares, as if share No. 2 had never existed? Must each of the other shares be increased by the addition of a seventh of share No. 2 in order that this share may be taken by the descendants of the testator called to come into the other shares? Is there an obligation, even under the terms of the will, of merging the shares? Does not the transmission of share No. 2 to the descendants of the testator take place irrespective of the other shares forming part of the estate? Do not the descendants of the testator, being jointly called by the will to take the succession or transmission of share No. 2, of which Louis Masson was the legatee in so far as one-half the revenues were concerned, constitute a degree, each for the share he is to take, charged with the obligation of re-delivering it to their posterity, since they are to receive only the revenues thereof? If the possibility of adding to the share of each of the legatees one-seventh of share No. 2, by way of accretion, as if the late Louis Masson had never existed and as if that share had always formed part of the other shares, what would be the result? In each of the shares, the accretion will reach the greatgrandchildren in the same manner as the original share.\nIn order to hand down the whole estate to the great-grandchildren it is absolutely necessary to admit that, at the death of the late Louis Masson without issue, his share was transmitted by way of accretion to the testator\u2019s descendants, just as if Louis Masson had never lived, and as if the succession of the Honourable Joseph Masson had been originally divided into seven equal shares. By the terms of art. 625 C.C. the children or their descendants succeed equally and by heads when they are in the same degree and called personally, and they succeed par souche when some or all of them are called by way of representation. Why should not a co-legatee have his share increased by a certain part of the estate, and why should the children of a co-legatee pre-deceased not come in lieu of the said pre-deceased legatee by right of representation, if the testator so wished, to give effect to his intention, which is that the estate should be handed down to his great-grandchildren?\nIn the matter of accretion, it is a constant and well recognized rule that accretion is from share to share. \u201cQuoniam portio * * * veluti alluvio, portioni adcrescit\u201d (Papinian.) See, also, Demolombe, No. 390. By adopting the theory of accretion, which seems ordered by the testator in the most formal manner, and which necessarily results from the dispositions of the will, all the administration of the estate becomes well ordered. The intention of the de cujus is carried out, his wishes are respected, and the desire of transmitting all his estate without exception or reserve, as far as possible, to his posterity and for the greater advantage of his children and descendants is given effect. In this manner the estate is given definitely to the great-grandchildren in each share, increased by the accretion of shares which fail of their object, without violating the rule which prohibits substitutions taking place more than two degrees beyond the instituted legatee, and nevertheless carrying out to the full the instructions of the testator.\nOtherwise an attempt is made to make definitive and final owners, of the property left by Louis Masson, the children of Madame Bossange, Madame Douvreleur, Roderick and John Masson, who are only the grandchildren of the testator, and to exclude from the ownership the only great-grandchildren of the testator, the descendants of Henri Masson, issue of the marriage of Dr. Harwood with the late Marie Masson, who had survived her co-legatee Joseph Henri Masson, and took in the second degree the share of the latter in the estate of the late Louis Masson, seeing that the will of the said late Marie Masson instituted her consort universal legatee of her property, while in the share attributed to the late Honourable Edouard Masson, the children of Joseph Edouard Masson, who are the great-grandchildren of the testator, would be only called in the first degree to the share accruing them in the property left by Louis Masson. The only great-grandchildren to come into their share as such in the property left by Louis Masson would be the children of Wilfred Masson and Edouard Masson, sons of R\u00e9n\u00e9 Masson.\nThis latter supposed condition of affairs, as may readily be seen, if legally correct, would, nevertheless, be contrary to the general dispositions of the will. The theory of accretion is surer, more natural, more equitable between the legatees, and especially in greater conformity with the intention of the testator. Eadem vis est taciti atque expressi.\nIt is better to admit this theory of accretion, which seems just, more in conformity with intention of the testator, and which allows the disposition made by him of his property to subsist in its entirety, giving his children one-half of the revenues, to his grandchildren the whole of the revenues, and the ownership to his great-grandchildren.\nMignault K.C. for the respondents. The case is based on the legal proposition that on the death of Louis Masson, there was accretion of his share in favour of the mass of the estate just as if Louis Masson never had existed. The respondents submit that this share passed by transmission to the other descendants of the testator by roots, such transmission counting as a degree of substitution. All parties admit that the will created a substitution, in favour of the children of the testator and their descendants, extending as far as allowed by law. Therefore, it is contended that there was accretion. The respondents submit that such accretion was juridically impossible, and that the only conclusion that can be adopted is that Louis Masson\u2019s share was transmitted, this transmission exhausting one degree of the substitution.\nThe only article of the Civil Code which treats of accretion is 868. It may be compared with arts. 1044 and 1045 of the French Code. Are these provisions in conformity with the law as it existed before the Code? The will was made and the testator died before the codification of our civil laws. None of the articles of our Civil Code define accretion. Let us define accretion by giving an example. Thus, A. bequeaths his house jointly to B. and to C. Each legatee receives a title to the whole house, but as they are two, if both accept the legacy, they will have to divide the house: concursu partes fiant. But if B. dies before the testator, or if he refuses the legacy, there is no conflict of title, and C. whose title extends to the whole house takes it in its entirety. It is in this sense that it is said that accretion takes place from B. to C. The authors observe that instead of the word \u201caccroissement\u201d it would be more apt to say that there is \u201cnon-d\u00e9croissement.\u201d What characterizes accretion and distinguishes it from transmission, is that C. receives nothing from B. or through B. His title to the whole house exists in the will. The pre-decease of B., or his refusal to accept the legacy, rids him of a competitor and that is all.\nBut few authors have attempted to define accretion, and it really seems unnecessary to do so for its nature and effects are well known and are clearly shewn by the example given above. Reference, however, may be had to the definitions given by Fuzier-Herman, vo. \u201cAccroissement,\u201d No. .1; Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises and Ferri\u00e8re, \u201cDictionnaire de droit, eodem verbo.\u201d Pothier, vol. 8 (Bugnet) \u201cdonations testamenaires,\u201d No. 340, thus indicates the nature of the right of accretion: \u201cLes col\u00e9gataires d\u2019une m\u00eame chose, ou d\u2019une m\u00eame somme, sont l\u00e9gataires du total de la chose, ou de la somme l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, ce n\u2019est que par leur concours que la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, quoique l\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux en total, ne pouvant pas n\u00e9anmoins appartenir \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux pour le total, cum duo pluresve unius rei in solidum domini esse non possint, se partage entre eux.\n\u201cDe l\u00e0 il suit que, si quelqu\u2019un des col\u00e9gataires ne recueille pas le legs, soit par son pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s, soit par son incapacit\u00e9, soit parce qu\u2019il lui plait de le r\u00e9pudier, la part qu\u2019il aurait eue dans dans cette chose doit accro\u00eetre \u00e0 ses col\u00e9gataires jure accrescendi, ou plut\u00f4t, jure non decrescendi: car chacun des col\u00e9gataires, \u00e9tant l\u00e9gataire du total de la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e, n\u2019y ayant que le concours de deux ou plusieurs l\u00e9gataires qui la partagent entre eux, lorsque l\u2019un d\u2019eux ne concourt pas, le total demeure de plein droit \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\u201d\nIn order that accretion may be said to exist, it is necessary that one or more of the legatees fail to take the legacy. Once they are vested, accretion is absolutely impossible. This is well shewn by the last paragraph of art. 868 C.C., which says that the right to accretion applies to gifts inter vivos made in favour of several persons jointly, when some of the donees do not accept. A legacy cannot be said to have lapsed when all the legatees have accepted it as in the present case. See also Coin-Delisle, \u201cDonations et Testaments,\u201d on art. 1044 C.N., No. 9. Even where a testator directs that if one of his legatees die without children, after having been vested with the legacy, his share shall accrue to the other legatees, the authors say that this is not accretion, but a transmission creating a substitution. See Demolombe, vol. 18, No. 113: Dalloz, R\u00e9p. vo. \u201cSubstitution.\u201d No. 220 et seq.; Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9p. vo. \u201cSubstitution\u201d No. 279; Baudry-Lacantinerie \u201cDonation et Testaments\u201d Nos. 3152, 3153, 3154.\nThe lapsing of the provision in favour of the substitute in a substitution (i.e. of la charge de rendre), can never give rise to accretion. The only question then is to ascertain to whom the property devolves, since there are no substitutes who can take it. If we find in the will expressions which shew that the testator intended that the property should remain in his family notwithstanding the death of one of his legatees, as in the present instance, the property will not go out of the estate of the testator to form part of the estate of the institute, but will be transmitted to the other descendants of the testator, and this without effacing the person of the institute, who will be considered as a first degree of the substitution with respect to the testator\u2019s other descendants as he would have been a first degree as to his own children. This is the only way to prevent the property from falling into the estate of the institute, thus defeating the substitution, accretion being impossible.\nMr. Justice Charbonneau seems to have confounded two essentially different things, accretion (art. 868 C.C.) and the right of return (art. 779 C.C.), for the species of accretion to which he refers, an accretion which would bring back to the general mass property which had been taken out of it, and this from the death of the legatee who had received the property, would be nothing else than a right of return or of taking back, rather than a substitution. When the right of return is stipulated, the thing received by the donee returns to the donor or to the persons indicated by him. In the case of a substitution, the thing passes from the donee or institute who had received it to the persons who are to take it after him. Any right, whether it be termed a right of return, a substitution, or even (but incorrectly) an accretion, whereby the thing passes from the beneficiary to a person other than the donor, or from the legatee to the general mass of the estate, is nothing else than a substitution. (See Demolombe, vol. 18, Nos. 110 and 111).\nMoreover, real accretion differs essentially from the right of return or of substitution. The former exists by virtue of a legal presumption and without an express stipulation, provided, of course, that the required conditions exist; the latter must be stipulated. The first supposes that the donee or legatee has not been seized of the thing given; the second requires a vesting in the donee or legatee, since the thins: comes or returns from him. Accretion confers no right, it merely prevents a right already given from being diminished or shared by another; the right of return, on the contrary, when it operates in favour of the donor\u2019s heirs, and the right of substitution are attributive of right, and although this right comes from the donor it is transmitted through the person of the first beneficiary, obliquo modo.\nWe find a conclusive answer in the judgment of the Superior Court. Since Louis Masson\u2019s share returns to the general mass, since it returns to the seven other branches of the estate, and from the day of the death of Louis Masson, it follows that there is a transmission from Louis Masson, who had been seized, to the general mass, and this is precisely the effect of a substitution, so that we find that accretion as defined by the judgment is really a transmission by means of substitution. It seems more in accordance with the testator\u2019s intention to conclude that this substitution exists than to imagine a return to the general mass which would have the strange effect of placing properties, which were at the first degree in the person of Louis Masson, in the same degree in the case of Rodrigue Masson, and in the third and final degree in the person of the plaintiff.\nAnother condition of the right of accretion is that the legacy be made jointly to several legatees. There is no joint legacy here. According to the direction of the testator, the executors made a partition, on the 11th April, 1848, forming eight shares which they attributed to the eight children, and plaintiff alleges that this partition is final. The result is that there was, not a legacy of the whole estate to the children jointly, as held by the Superior Court, but a legacy to each child of a separate and specific portion of the estate which the testator ordered to be set aside and separated from the other shares immediately after his death. In other words, there was not, in favour of each legatee, a bequest of the whole estate, which would be essential to give rise to accretion, but a bequest of certain determinate property, which was to be set aside by the partition ordered by the will. Moreover the direction to divide the estate into equal shares is not made in order to carry out a joint legacy, but it bears on the title itself of the legatees, who receive nothing more than certain specific properties, and this also excludes any possibility of accretion. There is no joint legacy nor universal legatees in Mr. Masson\u2019s will. On the contrary, the legacy to each legatee is only of certain properties to be set aside by the partition, that is to say a legacy by particular title; or, at the most, a legacy of an aliquot share, or a legacy by general title, and in either case there can be no accretion from one legatee to another. See Dalloz, 1880, 1, 339, and especially the reporter\u2019s note. We may add that Mr. Masson expressly excludes any possibility of accretion by pre-decease, for he bequeaths his estate only to such of his children as survive him.\nThe distinction between a universal legacy and a legacy by general title is shewn in a note to Sirey, 1882, 1, 176. It seems clear to us that Mr. Masson intended to definitely limit each legatee (and his descendants) to the property assigned to him by the partition.\nThere are several conclusive answers to the contention based on the words of art. 868 C.C., \u201cdirections given to divide the thing jointly disposed of into equal aliquot shares, do not prevent accretion from taking place.\u201d In the first place the estate is not jointly disposed of. The will was made and the testator died before the Civil Code came into force and the question as to the existence or non-existence of accretion will have to be determined according to the law then in force, for it is held that articles 1044 and 1045 of the Code Napol\u00e9on and, consequently, our own art. 868, changed the old law. See Baudry-Lacantinerie, \u201cDonations et Testatments,\u201d vol. 2, Nos. 2, 904 et seq.; Demolombe, vol. 22, No. 366.\nAccording to the old law, it is clear that no question of accretion can arise even if the contrary could be contended under art. 868 C.C. See Pothier, ed. Bugnet, vol. 8, \u201cDonations Testamentaires,\u201d No. 349; Bourjon, cited by the codifiers under art. 868 C.C. (see DeLorimier, \u201cBiblioth\u00e8que du Code Civil,\u201d vol. 7, p. 61); Domat (ed. R\u00e9my), vol. 2, p. 609.\nIt follows, whatever construction may be given to article 868 C.C., that according to the law in force at the time of the will, no question of accretion can arise.\nAs to the contention by Henri Masson et al., the executors of the Masson estate, that Mr. Masson left to his children and descendants nothing but the revenues of his estate, and that he bequeathed the property to his executors and trustees who alone are seized thereof, it is to be remarked that the words \u201cje donne et l\u00e9gue\u201d are used only in the clause concerning the executors. This construction of the will cannot be sustained. The testator, it is true, bequeathed his property to his executors, but only \u201c\u00e0 titre de fid\u00e9icommis.\u201d In other words, he named them as trustees of his estate, adding that he did so \u201cpour faciliter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de mes dispositions testamentaires et pour d\u2019autant mieux garantir la r\u00e9version des revenus de nies biens \u00e0 mes dits enfants et descendants.\u201d The executors have undoubtedly \u201cla saisine de fait\u201d but they have not \u201cla saisine de droit.\u201d Moreover, if on the one hand the children only receive a legacy of revenues, and if on the other hand the executors are not left the property itself as owners subject to the payment of the revenues, then the property or the title of ownership is left to no one. It is clear that the executors are not owners, they are seized merely as administrators, and in the event of the legacy lapsing as to the children, they could not claim the benefit thereof (art. 964 C.C.). This being the case, the only possible conclusion is that the ownership vested in the children subject to the substitution in favour of their children and grandchildren, for the ownership or the title can never remain in suspense.\nIt is immaterial that the children get only half of the revenues of their shares, for the testator could have left the naked ownership to them and the whole enjoyment or usufruct to another, and, in that case, there could be no doubt that they were vested with the ownership. What is important is that, unless it is admitted that the children received the ownership, subject to the substitution, then no other owner can be discovered. Consequently the construction which the executors put on the will would lead to an obvious absurdity, leaving, as it does, the ownership in suspense. It is immaterial that the executors have fiduciary powers, since it is certain, as found by all the courts, that the trust is merely an ancillary trust created by the testator to carry out the substitution of his property.\nAs to some decisions on which the appellants rely: In Joseph v. Gastonguay[19], the head-note says: \u201cAccroissement takes place in a donation of the usufruct even by acte entre vifs, if such deed, by its disposition and by its clear expression, create a substitution r\u00e9ciproque.\u201d But all that was really decided was that there was in the case a reciprocal substitution. The decision was reversed in appeal[20], and in the reversing judgment there is no mention of accretion.\nIn McDonald v. Dodd[21], the Court of Appeal declared that no accretion was possible where the testator had assigned to each legatee a share in the thing bequeathed.\nIn Denis v. Cloutier[22], the testator directed that, in the event of the death of one of his children without issue, the share of usufruct of the deceased should go to the survivors. The court gave effect to this clause, expressing the opinion that the testator could order accretion in other cases than those mentioned by the law.\nPr\u00e9vost v. Lamarche[23], was reversed by the Privy Council[24]. The question of accretion was discussed by Mr. Justice Girouard, but the opinions of the other judges are not given. In the Privy Council this question was duly considered and it was held that there was nothing in the will which would justify the court in deciding that the testator intended that there should be accretion on the death of one of his children without issue. The Pr\u00e9vost will differs in essential points from the Masson will. In the former there was a real joint legacy; the grandchildren were expressly named universal legatees, and the immovables were to be transmitted to them en nature. In the Masson will the legacy is neither joint nor universal and the property does not go en nature to the final substitutes. In each case, however, the partition between the children was final. This point is very important and was so considered by the Privy Council in the Pr\u00e9vost Case[25]. The partition directed by the testator in order to separate forever the shares of his children was final. This partition produced with regard to Louis Masson and his brothers and sisters all the effect given by art. 746 C.C. The partition being final, property which fell into Louis Masson\u2019s lot, and which, by the presumption of article 746, must be held to have never belonged to his brothers and sisters, cannot pass to the latter otherwise than by transmission of the nature of a substitution.\nOn the death of Louis Masson without issue, the property which formed his share was transmitted by substitution to the other descendants of the testator, this transmission counting as a degree in the substitution as to the property so transmitted. Mr. Masson did not in express terms mention the case of one of his children dying without issue, but he says \u201cJe veux et entends que tors de chaque succession ou transmission de mes biens, il en soit fait partage, autant que possible, entre chacun de mes descendants.\u201d This clause follows the provision wherein the testator substitutes the share of his estate which he leaves to each of his children, from descendants to descendants, and this indefinitely or as far as the law allows. The clear intention of the testator, in case one of his children died without issue, was that the share of the child so dying should be transmitted to his other descendants, as he undoubtedly intended if the deceased left children that the latter should be substituted to him in the share so bequeathed. He desired that his estate should be transmitted to his remotest posterity and, because he did not mention the case, easily to be foreseen, of the death of one of his legatees without issue, can it be contended that he was willing that the share of this legatee should escape from the indefinite and perpetual substitution which he desired to establish? And there is no other alternative, accretion being juridically impossible. Since all parties admit that the testator desired to transmit his property to his remotest posterity, they must also admit that he intended that the share of a child dying without children should be transmitted to his other children. The only way in which it can be transmitted is by means of a substitution in favour of his other children. Such a substitution does not rest on suppositions or on conjectures, but it is clearly based on the intention of the testator. (Art. 928 C.C.). Therefore, the share of Louis Masson was transmitted to the descendants of the testator above named, and by virtue of this substitution, which transmission counts as a degree in the substitution. Pothier, vol. 8, \u201cSubstitution,\u201d No. 224.\nAt the time of Hon. Mr. Masson\u2019s death (1847) the jurisprudence of the Parliament of Paris was binding in Lower Canada, and it is important to remark that, in confirming this jurisprudence, the \u201cOrdonnance des Substitutions,\u201d art. 34, title 1 (which was not registered here), merely expressed the law as it existed under the Custom of Paris.\nSee also Ricard, \u201cDonations,\u201d vol. 2, pp. 420, 421 and 422, Nos. 826 and following, and the foot-note at page 422. Thevenot d\u2019Essaule, \u201cSubstitutions\u201d (ed. Mathieu) note on art. 34, tit. 1, of the Ordonnance, p. 441. This doctrine was followed in Jones v. Cuthbert(1).\nJones v. Cuthbert[26], was decisive as to the effect of art. 124 of the Ordonnance of 1629(Code Michaud).\nThe Ordonnance of 1629 never was followed and has been held to have fallen into disuse. Jones v. Cuthbert26; Stewart v. Molsons Bank[27], per Blanchet, J. We also cite: Page v. McLennan[28]; DeHertel v. Roe (DeHertel v. Godard)[29]. We may refer summarily to two judgments of the Superior Court construing the Masson will. Taschereau v. Masson[30], holds that the share of Louis Masson went to the general mass by accretion and also that the partition was not final. Perrautt v. Masson[31] decides that the share of Joseph Henri Masson, who died without children, was taken by his sister Madame Harwood by transmission and not by accretion, this transmission counting as a degree of the substitution. These judgments were rendered on actions brought by certain interested parties. It is not claimed that they constitute res judicata and we submit that the second judgment is well founded.\nIn substitutions made by collective terms, to which the family or the descendants are called, it is presumed that the testator intended to call the one after the other, the nearest coming first, the proximity of degree being understood of those who are nearest to the institute who has last possessed. Thus, Louis Masson dying without issue, the testator\u2019s descendants who are nearest to Louis Masson are called to the substitution, the order of legitimate succession being followed. See Thevenot D\u2019Essaule, \u201cSubstitutions,\u201d Nos. 364, 365, 366, 367, 941, 942, 943, 946, 952, 961, 964, 983, 985, 987, 988, 991, 994.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action is brought by the appellant, L\u00e9opold Masson, against the defendants as fiduciary legatees of the estate of his great-grandfather, the Honourable Joseph Masson. The plaintiff (appellant here) asks for the final partition of that share in the estate which had been assigned to his grand-uncle, Louis Masson, a son of the testator, under a clause in the will recited at length hereafter. I use the word \u201cassigned\u201d because of the very special language of that clause. The respondent, Mrs. Burroughs (Marguerite Masson), daughter of Rodrigue Masson and a granddaughter of the testator, raises another issue by asserting her right to an interest in the same share, on the ground that the will of her grandfather created a substitution in the collateral line of Louis Masson\u2019s share, to which substitution she claims to be a final substitute.\nThe question, therefore, is:\u2014On a true construction of the language used, can we hold with the majority in the court of appeal that the testator created a substitution in the direct or collateral line in favour of his children and grandchildren? Or,\u2014Did he vest his property in fiduciary legatees to be held by them in trust for his heirs as long as the law against perpetuities would permit? (Ordonnances des Substitutions, 1747). Which latter I understand to be the construction put upon the will by the trial judge. The facts are: The Honourable Joseph Masson died, in 1847, leaving eight children him surviving. At his death the legatees, as directed by his will, divided his estate into eight shares, and a ninth share was made up of assets of the estate which at the time it was considered difficult to apportion between the eight children. In 1893, this ninth share was, in part, distributed among the other shares; the balance, considerably increased, is still in a state of indivision.\nOf the eight shares, No. 2 was assigned to the said Louis Masson, who died, in 1897, without issue and intestate with respect to any interest he might have in his father\u2019s estate. The question to be decided is what becomes of that share No. 2 and his (Louis Masson\u2019s) interest in the undivided portion of share No. 9. The plaintiff (appellant here) is, as I have already said, the great-grandson of the testator and the grand-nephew of Louis Masson. The mise-en-cause, Mrs. Burroughs (respondent here), is the grand-daughter of the testator and the niece of Louis Masson.\nI agree in the conclusions reached by Archambeault J., now Chief Justice of the court of appeal, on the issue with Mrs. Burroughs, and would allow the appeal as to her, and dismiss her intervention. I would also allow the appeal on the issue with L\u00e9opold Masson; and maintain his action, the whole with costs against the estate.\nAs to the issue with the grand-daughter, Mrs. Burroughs, I accept the reasoning of the Chief Justice, as well as his conclusion that by his will the testator did not create a substitution in favour of his children and their children, and, in default of grandchildren, in favour of the brothers and sisters reciprocally. To succeed, it was necessary for Mrs. Burroughs to establish not only that by his will her grandfather created a substitution in favour of each of his children of a share in his estate, but also that in the case of a child dying without issue that child\u2019s share should accrue to his brothers and sisters, children of the testator, as first substitutes. For the reasons given by the Chief Justice of the court of appeal, and to which I can find little useful to add, I have come to the conclusion that the testator did not create a substitution of his estate either direct or collateral. There is no vesting of his property in his children or any of them. There is nowhere in the will to be found the double lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 which is of the essence of a substitution. Dalloz, 1902, 2, 281. Occasionally the word substitution is used by the testator, but merely to describe the disposition which he makes of his property. Further, there is nowhere a word which even suggests a substitution in the collateral line. I mean to say that nowhere in the will do I find words which manifest an intention on the part of the testator to give a share of his estate absolutely to one of his children, and, failing issue to that child, then to his or her brothers and sisters. Where in the will substitution is mentioned it is in the direct line, from descendants to descendants, and nowhere is reference made to collaterals. It is said that this was an omission on the part of the testator who has otherwise made his intention clear in that he frequently expresses a desire to keep his property intact in his family. But, as has been very lucidly explained by the Chief Justice in the court below, effect may be given to that manifest intention without putting a strained meaning upon the language of the will and inserting in it words which the testator did not use. On the main issue, between L\u00e9opold Masson and the respondents, fiduciary legatees, I will state my position briefly. L\u00e9opold Masson must succeed. In my opinion, Louis Masson, his grand-uncle, took no share, either as institute or otherwise, in his father\u2019s estate, except with respect to the revenues as I shall explain hereafter, and, therefore, the appellant takes nothing by or through him. That share in the estate, a portion of the revenues of which Louis Masson, the deceased, enjoyed during his lifetime, remains in the hands of the fiduciary legatees undisposed of, as is the case with share No. 9; and, as the appellant, L\u00e9opold Masson, is entitled to the share assigned to his grandfather, so is he, for the same reason, and by virtue of the same title, justified in his demand that the estate of his great-grandfather be disposed of, with respect to him, as if there were originally seven shares instead of eight.\nI quite agree that the intention of the testator, clearly expressed, is, to keep his estate in his family indefinitely, or as long as the law would permit, allowing it to increase by the accumulation of all the revenues during the first ten years after his death. At the expiration of that period half of the revenues was to be put to capital account during the lifetime of his children.\nIn many places in the will, it is also said that none of the testator\u2019s children are to have any share or voice in the control or management of his estate, except in so far as they may in time prove qualified for appointment as one of his fiduciary legatees.\nSuch being his admitted intention, what were the means which, in the then state of the law, the testator could adopt to give effect to it? He might have created a fiduciary substitution in favour of his children, or their children and of their grandchildren; beyond that limit he could not go. If this method was adopted, then, in the event of the death of a child or grandchild, without issue, the substitution would be at an end and the share of that child or grandchild might be disposed of to a third party and never reach any of the great grandchildren of the de cujus. (Thevenot d\u2019Essaule, (ed. Mathieu,) notes at pp. 164 and 161.) It was, of course, as is argued here, in the power of the testator to provide in that case for a collateral or reciprocal substitution in favour of the brothers and sisters of the child dying without issue, but then the property would not reach the greatgrandchildren because there could not be more than three degrees in a substitution and that event happens in the case of Mrs. Burroughs, if the judgment of the court below is affirmed. On the other hand, the Quebec law says that a testator may name legatees who shall be merely fiduciary, or simply trustees for charitable or other lawful purposes within the limit prescribed by law, and by taking advantage of that provision it was open to the testator to vest his estate in the appellants, (fiduciary legatees,) who are merely heirs for a special purpose, and to charge them, as mere trustees, to administer his property and to employ it, or deliver it, in accordance with his will. And that is what, in my opinion, the testator has done. He has by the very simple device of disposing of his estate in favour of his fiduciary legatees and by importing into his will the analogy of a substitution, left it in such a way that it must reach at least as far as his great-grandchildren (although in so doing he has provided apparently abundant material for litigation). That this result has been accomplished is to me clear. Louis Masson, the deceased, was merely a creditor of the fiduciary legatees for a share in the revenues of his father\u2019s estate and had no share in the property of the estate, either as institute or otherwise. The language of the will makes this abundantly clear. After making provision for his children and their descendants out of the revenues of his estate, the testator says:\u2014\nPour faciliter l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de mes dispositions testamentaires et pour d\u2019autant mieux garantir la r\u00e9version des revenus de mes tiens \u00e0 mes dits enfants et descendants suivant mes desirs ci-dessus exprim\u00e9s, je choisis et nomme pour mes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et fid\u00e9i-commissaires, Joseph Bourret, etc.\nThen, after having provided for the appointment of their successors, he proceeds to say in the following paragraph:\u2014\nAuxquels dits fid\u00e9commissaires, rempla\u00e7ants ou successeurs je donne et l\u00e8gue, \u00e0 titre fid\u00e9i-commis, tous mes dits biens meubles et immeubles, propres, etc., etc.,\nthat is to say, the universality of his estate. By those words, the whole estate of the deceased \u2014 the universality in capital and revenue \u2014 was vested in the fiduciary legatees, as such, to administer and hold indefinitely, or as long as the law will permit; so that, on the death of the testator, they were seized alone of the property, rights and actions of the deceased. Mr. Mignault\u2019s contention at the argument here was that, by reason of the division which the fiduciary legatees are directed by the testator to make, each child became entitled, as the institute to a substitution, to that share in the estate which was then assigned to him. In other words, according to this argument, the effect of that partition would be to create a substitution with respect to each share of the estate. I can find no words in the will to justify such a conclusion. To create a fiduciary substitution is to vest a title in the institute who holds the property as proprietor. Where is the provision in the will which enables the legatees to part with any share in the capital of the estate for any such purposes? When speaking of the partition of the estate, here are the words which the testator uses:\u2014\nEt quant aux biens meubles, etc. * * * je veux et entends qu\u2019il en soit fait autant de parts \u00e9gales que j\u2019aurai d\u2019enfants au temps de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s n\u00e9s de mon mariage avec ma dite \u00e9pouse, pour chacune de ces parts ou portions de mes biens repr\u00e9senter les biens mobiliers et immobilies dont chacun de mes dits enfants aura seulement la moiti\u00e9 des revenus, sa vie durant.\nHow can it be said that a partition of the estate, made for a purpose so clearly expressed in the underlined words, could be construed as divesting the legatees; or vesting the children? Moreover, it is to be observed that, after having disposed of his estate in favour of the legatees, the testator proceeds to say what is to be done with the revenues after this division. I quote his words:\u2014\nJe veux et entends qu\u2019apr\u00e8s dix ans du jour de mou d\u00e9c\u00e8s, il soit fait d\u00e9livrance tous les ans, \u00e0 mes dits enfants, alors majeurs, et \u00e0 ceux qui seront mineurs, \u00e0 compter de leur majorit\u00e9, et ce, leur vie durant, de moiti\u00e9 des revenus, rentes, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats (toutes d\u00e9penses pr\u00e9alablement d\u00e9duites) de tous les biens mobiliers et immobiliers qui, composeront le lot de chacun d\u2019eux, mes dits enfants, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le partage qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de mes biens en autant de parts \u00e9gales que j\u2019aurai d\u2019enfants lors de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ainsi que ci-dessus pourvus, et aussi de moiti\u00e9 des revenus, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats (aussi toutes d\u00e9penses pr\u00e9alablement d\u00e9duites) de tous les biens mobiliers et immobiliers qui, auront \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par mes dits fid\u00e9i-commissaires, rempla\u00e7ants ou successeurs, avec les revenus, rentes, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats annuels qui auront \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s et employ\u00e9s par eux pendant les dix ans du jour de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s et de ceux qui seront acquis du vivant de mes dits enfants par eux, les dits fid\u00e9i-commissaires, rempla\u00e7ants ou successeurs, avec l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 des revenus, rentes, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats annuels des biens de ma dite succession et qui doivent rester \u00e0 la disposition de ces derniers, pour en \u00eatre fait emploi ainsi que susdit, pourvu et \u00e0 condition toutefois que la moiti\u00e9 des dits revenus, rentes, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats dont d\u00e9livrance doive \u00eatre faites \u00e0 mes dits enfants comme susdit, ne donnent pas moins de cinq cents livres, cours actuels, \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux, mes dits enfants, par chaque ann\u00e9e.\nThis disposition clearly contemplates acquisition of property and additions to the estate, subsequent to the partition, and also creates an obligation on the trustees in favour of the children, each of whom is entitled to receive out of the revenues of the estate at least \u00a3500 currency. That is to say, each child at the expiration of the lean period of ten years is a creditor of the estate for at least \u00a3500, whatever may be the revenues, and although a partition may have been made in the meantime. They have no title in the estate, nor have they any claim to any partition of the revenues, but they are creditors to the extent of their annual allowance, which must be taken out of capital if the revenues are insufficient. This is wholly inconsistent with the idea of a final division of the estate. Read with all the other clauses of the will, I fail to see how it can be successfully argued that this partition is final, or intended for any other purpose of the will, I fail to see how it can be successfully argued that this partition is final or intended for any other purpose than to give the children a sentimental interest in the estate of their father, which was being administered for them and their children by strangers. Their claim to a share of the revenues was only for life and, as I have already said, they and their descendants had no share in the management, except as possible members of the board of legatees. The will is explicit as to this. After providing for the appointment of new legatees in cases of vacancy caused by death or resignation, the testator says pourvu et \u00e0 condition que ceux de mes enfants et descendants m\u00e2les qui seront jug\u00e9s \u00eatre capables, qualifi\u00e9s et comp\u00e9tents \u00e0 remplir cette charge y soient choisis et nomm\u00e9s de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 toutes autres personnes.\nThis is one of the many provisions which one does not expect to find in a will creating a substitution.\nIt is quite true that the word substitution is used in many places in the will, but the rule is that:\u2014\nIn general, the whole tenor of the act and the intention which it sufficiently expresses are considered, rather than the ordinary acceptation of particular words in order to determine whether there is substitution or not. Art. 928 C.C.\nIn his comment on art. 964 C.C., Sir Fran\u00e7ois Langelier gives very clearly the distinction between substitution and fiduciary legateeship. He says:\u2014\nPour qu\u2019il y ait une vraie substitution, il faut donc que les biens soient donn\u00e9s en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un pour lui-m\u00eame, avec charge de les restituer \u00e0 un autre, et il n\u2019y a pas de substitution lorsqu\u2019il est \u00e9vident que le testateur n\u2019a pas l\u00e9gu\u00e9 les biens \u00e0 son l\u00e9gataire pour celui-ci, mais ne s\u2019est servi de lui que comme d\u2019un instrument, ou d\u2019un interm\u00e9diaire, pour faire parvenir ces biens \u00e0 une autre personne.\nOn the whole, I am of the opinion that the share of Louis Masson is to be distributed among the children of the testator and their descendants in the same way and subject to the same conditions as if Louis Masson had pre-deceased the testator and the estate of the latter had been divided originally in seven instead of eight shares, the ninth share having been made for a special purpose. To make my meaning clear, I hold that the share of Louis Masson goes to increase share No. 9, so as to be dealt with by the fiduciary legatees in the same way, that is as if no disposition had been made of it by them or, to repeat myself, as if there never had been a share No. 2, and that all it contained formed part of share No. 9. By adopting practically the same construction of the will as the Chief Justice in the court below, I reach a different conclusion because he deals with the share in question as if it was really substituted, in which case the appellant\u2019s father and grandfather having pre-deceased the institute, Louis Masson, he, the appellant, would only be the second degree in the substitution; and the property might be substituted to the fourth or fifth generation. Whereas, on my construction, there never was a substitution and the share must be dealt with on the assumption that the testator intended his property to vest in his fiduciary legatees under an obligation on their part to hand it over to his descendants when they would be entitled to receive it, if by his will he had created a substitution. In this way, the property reaches the third generation, but does not go beyond, and the law against perpetuities is not defeated.\nDavies J.\u2014The questions to be determined upon this appeal depend entirely upon the proper construction of the will of the late Honourable Joseph Masson, made in 1847.\nI agree with Chief Justice Fitzpatrick that, by his will,\nthe testator did not create any substitution in favour of his children and their children, and failing the latter, in favour of the brothers and sisters reciprocally.\nThere is not a word in the will from beginning to end suggesting a substitution in the collateral line. Where in the will substitution is mentioned, it is in the direct line from descendants to descendants. Nowhere is reference made to collaterals.\nA great deal of argument was addressed to us as to the intention of the testator to keep his property in his family, but, while that intention is clearly expressed so far as direct descendants of each of his children exist, I have not been able to find a word shewing any intention on the part of the testator, in the event of there being a failure of descendants of any one of his children, to deal with the share of the child so dying in any way.\nMy construction, therefore, of the will is that whenever any child of the testator died without leaving issue, the share of that child lapsed, and as to it there was an intestacy.\nWhen, therefore, the late Louis Masson died without leaving any issue, his share of the estate remained vested in the trustees for the benefit of, and to be distributed amongst the heirs of the testator living at the time of Louis Masson\u2019s death.\nThe simple fact is, as I construe the will, that the testator made no provision whatever for the share allotted to any one of his children in the event of such child dying without issue. That there was no collateral substitution seems to be the opinion of the majority of this court, and I cannot escape from the conclusion that in such case, where special and elaborate provision is made by the will for the enjoyment by each of the children of the testator during his or her lifetime, and by such child\u2019s issue afterwards, \u201cindefinitely or as far as allowed by law,\u201d and no provision whatever is made for the contingency of a child dying without issue, if and when such a contingency happens, there arises an intestacy as regards such share.\nIn the case before us such a contingency has occurred; Louis Masson, one of the testator\u2019s children, has died without issue, and in my judgment there has been an intestacy as to his share.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal in part, refer the case back to the Superior Court to deal with this share of Louis Masson in the estate on the basis of there having been an intestacy with regard to it when he died.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nAnglin J.\u2014Upon the pleadings it is the common case of all the parties represented on this appeal that on a proper construction of the will of the late Honourable Joseph Masson he created a substitution of his entire estate or a substitution of each of the eight shares into which he directed that his estate should, for certain purposes, be divided. The learned judges in the Superior Court and in the court of appeal, probably because the case was so submitted by all parties, have proceeded on the assumption that the will provides for substitution. The same view appears to have been taken by Pagnuelo J. in Perrault v. Masson[32], but was not accepted, as I read their opinions, by Loranger J. in Taschereau v. Masson[33], or by Jett\u00e9 J. in Masson v. Masson (28th June, 1889).\nThe present contest concerns the aliquot share of the estate of which Louis Masson, a son of the testator who died without issue, had enjoyed one-half of the income, and the one-eighth interest in a ninth lot, held undivided for reasons of convenience, of which he also had received one-half of the income. The plaintiff, L\u00e9opold Masson, claims that as a great-grandchild of the testator he takes an interest in this property as a second substitute and, therefore, as absolute owner (art. 932 C.C.). The grandfather and father of L\u00e9opold Masson both predeceased Louis Masson. He, therefore, acquired whatever interest he may have (if any) in the property in question immediately on the death of Louis Masson without any intervening interest having vested in either his grandfather or his father. He was, nevertheless, held by the learned trial judge to be absolute and unconditional owner of the property which he here claims, probably as a second substitute, although the learned judge does not say so. In the Court of King\u2019s Bench he was held to be the first substitute in respect of such property and merely entitled for life to the revenues which it produces and bound to deliver over the corpus to his children. From this part of the judgment the plaintiff appeals to this court.\nOn the assumption that a substitution was created, which the testator directed should subsist \u201cindefinitely or as long as permitted by law,\u201d and that a collateral or subsidiary substitution may be implied, I should respectfully concur in the conclusion reached by the court of appeal in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s interest here in question.\nThe defendant Dame Marguerite Masson (Mrs. Burroughs), who is a grand-daughter of the testator and the daughter of Honourable L. F. R. Masson, who survived his brother Louis, also asserts that an interest in the property which had been set aside as the source of income for Louis Masson and his children is now vested in her as a second substitute, her father haying been, she alleges, the first substitute in respect of such property. She, therefore, claims it as absolute owner. On the other hand, the defendant-executors and the plaintiff insist that on the death of Louis Masson, who they say was seized as an institute, his surviving brothers and sisters acquired his interest in their father\u2019s estate by accretion; that the seizin of Honourable L. F. R. Masson of his share in that interest was not as a substitute, but as an institute; and that his daughter, therefore, holds not as second, but as first substitute. This latter view prevailed in the Superior Court. But Dame Marguerite Masson succeeded in convincing a majority of the learned judges in the court of appeal that her contention was well founded. Against the judgment declaring her to be entitled as absolute and unconditional owner of the interest which she claims, the executors and L\u00e9opold Masson have appealed. If the will of the Honourable Joseph Masson had created a substitution in favour of the descendants and also a collateral or subsidiary substitution under which a one-seventh interest in the share of which his brother Louis would in that case have been institute and grev\u00e9, passed to the Honourable L. F. R. Masson, and on his death to his children, I should incline to the view that the judgment in appeal must be maintained. Jones v. Cuthbert[34]; 8 Pothier, \u201cDes Substitutions,\u201d No. 224, p. 533.\nIf, however, the testator created a substitution, and if, in respect of the share of which he had the income, Louis Masson was an institute grev\u00e9 de substitution, the only substitution provided for is in favour of his descendants. There is no direction for subsidiary substitution in favour of collaterals, and I am respect- fully of the opinion that none may be implied. Th\u00e9venot D\u2019Essaule (Mathieu), No. 262, p. 98. The obligation to deliver the substituted property does not exist, where the condition upon which that obligation is to arise has not been fulfilled. The institute in that case is discharged from the obligation. He holds with an absolute title. On Louis Masson\u2019s death, therefore, if he held as institute under a substitution, his heirs, in default of testamentary disposition by him, took an absolute title to his share.\nBut with great diffidence, due to the fact that all the parties have treated the case as one of substitution and that the provincial courts have accepted that view of it, after a very careful study of the will of the late Honourable Joseph Masson, I have become convinced that he did not create either a single substitution or several substitutions of his property. He vests his entire estate (je donne et l\u00e8gue) in his testamentary executors \u00e0 titre de fid\u00e9i-commis. (I incline to agree with Mr. Mignault that had he said \u00e0 titre de fiducie his language would have been more exact. But see 11 Baudry-Lacantinerie, No. 3050. To his children and grandchildren he gives no interest whatever in any part of his property. The sole right of his children is to receive from his executors and trustees one-half of the income derived from the several lots into which he directed that his estate should for that purpose be divided. Even this limited right he postpones until ten years after his decease. That his children should have no interest in any part of the corpus of the estate, but merely a right to receive defined portions of its revenues as alimentary allowances he makes abundantly clear. The rights conferred on the grandchildren are precisely the same, except that they extend to the whole revenue. The intention of the testator that the entire title to and control of his property should be vested in his fid\u00e9i-commissaires, and that his children and grandchildren should have no rights except to demand and enforce payment to themselves by the fiduciary legatees of the revenues which the testator directed they should receive is too clearly expressed to admit of the slightest doubt and, in my opinion, makes the existence of any substitution impossible.\nIt is of the essence of a substitution that the institute should hold the property as proprietor. Art. 944 C.C.\nL\u2019h\u00e9ritier, ou autre grev\u00e9 de substitution est, avant l\u2019ouverture, seul propri\u00e9taire des (biens substitu\u00e9s.\nLe grev\u00e9 de substitution \u00e9tant, avant l\u2019ouverture de la substitution, le vrai et seul propri\u00e9taire des biens substitu\u00e9s, il suit de la que les actions actives et passives de la succession r\u00e9sident en sa seule personne: ipsi et in ipsum competunt.\nPothier gives this as the first principle of a substitution and its corollary, \u201cDes Substitutions,\u201d 153-4.\nNeither the children nor the grandchildren of the testator ever became in any sense proprietors of the property of which it is claimed there is substitution. They never were grev\u00e9s in respect of it. It is not the subject of the two or more lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s which must be found in every substitution fid\u00e9i-commissaire. 11 Baudry-Lacantinerie, No. 3065.\nIt is no doubt true that the testator speaks of the disposition which he had made as a substitution. He so refers to it many times in the course of his will \u2014 sometimes as a substitution of revenues and again as a substitution of property. Indeed, it seems clear that he was under the impression that it was properly designated as a substitution. But his mistaken idea that the disposition which he actually made might with propriety be called a substitution does not make it such.\nBien entendu qu\u2019il doit y avoir des termes dispositifs et non pas simplement \u00e9nonciatifs.\nCe ne serait pas assez, par exemple, qu\u2019un testator e\u00fbt parl\u00e9 dans son codicile, d\u2019une substitution par lui faite dans son testament, s\u2019il n\u2019y avait, ni dans le testament, ni dans le codicile, des termes emportant disposition pr\u00e9sente et actuelle. Th\u00e9venot D\u2019Essaule, para. 180, ed. annot\u00e9 par M. Mathieu, p. 62.\nPressed by the difficulties arising from the absence from the will of any words vesting the corpus of the estate in the testator\u2019s children or grandchildren and the presence of directions incompatible with either the children or the grandchildren having any title to, or any control of, any part of the testator\u2019s property, Mr. Mignault invoked the provisions directing partition as necessarily implying that, upon the executors making the division directed, title to the share allocated to him as a source of revenue would vest in each child as institute subject to the obligation of transmitting it to his descendants in due course. But the testator in directing this division has been careful to state that its purpose is to enable his children and their descendants to know the particular properties from which their revenues are derived and that the parts or portions are to represent the property of which each shall enjoy the income. I find nothing in such a division which would have the effect of divesting the fiduciary legatees and vesting the property in the testator\u2019s children and grandchildren, notwithstanding the express directions elsewhere given that they are merely to receive, and that it shall be the duty of the fiduciary legatees to pay, during their respective lives, to each of the former one-half and to each of the latter the whole of the revenue derived from the particular parts of the estate allocated for that purpose, but held, managed and administered by the fiduciary legatees. The original division and the subsequent sub-divisions are ordered solely for the purpose of ear-marking the sources of the revenue which is to be paid to each member of each branch of the family. Although when made they should be final and unchangeable (many considerations support the view that they should be so held), they have not, in my opinion, the effect for which the respondent contends. Notwithstanding the division and sub-divisions, the title to the entire succession as a single entity remained in the fiduciary legatees with the result that on the failure, through his death without issue, of the charge in favour of the chiildren of Louis Masson and their descendants the reason for maintaining the identity of the share allocated to that branch of the testator\u2019s family ceased and the part of the estate or hereditas in the hands of the fiduciary legatees from which Louis Masson had derived his income became available to satisfy the charges in favour of the other branches of the family imposed by the testator upon his succession. If the testator intended a bequest to Louis\u2019s more remote descendants of the property from which Louis had derived his revenue, or if such a bequest would be the legal result of his dispositions, that bequest simply lapsed. The direction to divide the estate into equal aliquot shares would not prevent the accretion (if that be the correct term to apply) of the aliquot part assigned as a source of revenue for Louis to the mass of the estate for the benefit of the ultimate legatees of the corpus (art. 868 C.C.). On the death of Louis Masson without issue, unless we are to assume that as to the share allocated to his branch of the family the testator was in that event intestate, which seems contrary to the spirit, if not to the letter, of art. 868 C.C., and to the scheme of his will as a whole and would defeat his apparent object, namely, to keep his property as long as possible in his family, that share remained in the mass from which it had not been separated except for the identification of the revenues derived from it. It augmented the corpus available for the other branches of the family and, as an incident, the revenues derived from that corpus were also increased. The share of each of the other branches of the testator\u2019s family was augmented by one-seventh of the share which it had become unnecessary to hold for the descendants of Louis. Such one-seventh as an accretion or accession was absorbed in the share which it thus augmented and became subject to the provisions of the will applicable to that share and must, I think, be dealt with and disposed of, both as to corpus and revenue, as an integral part of such share.\nIt being clear that neither a substitution nor a series of substitutions had been created, we have a devise of the testator\u2019s entire estate to fiduciary legatees, the only trust declared being that they shall manage the property, collect the revenues and pay them to the testator\u2019s children, grandchildren and their descendants, indefinitely or as long as the law will permit.\nIt has been suggested that the testator has himself indicated that this fiducie or trust is to be subject, as to its duration, to the rules which govern substitutions\u2014that this intention is to be gathered from his repeated references to substitution. I am, with respect, unable to concur in this view.\nI think there is no doubt that the testator was under the impression that his bequests were, or partook of the nature of, substitutions. He very probably thought that they would, therefore, be subject to the restrictions imposed by law on that form of disposition, and he may have had in mind the limitation now enunciated in art. 932 C.C., but not then so certain or well defined, when he directed that the revenues of each share of his estate should pass from his children to their descendants ind\u00e9finiment, ou autant que permis par la loi, and provided for succession in the trusteeship, for tutorships and for payment of such revenues to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren (see clause No. 3 providing for receipts to be given by married women) \u201cas long as the substitution hereby created shall last.\u201d But his expressed intention is that his fiduciary legatees shall hold the property and shall pay its revenues to his descendants perpetually (ind\u00e9finiment) unless the law prevents that being done. I do not read the references to substitution in the will as indicating that the testator intended that, although his dispositions should not in fact be substitutions, or be so much in the nature of substitutions as to be subject to the provisions of the law now embodied in art. 932 C.C., but should constitute a fiducie or trust in favour of his children and their descendants, the rules and restrictions which govern substitutions should, nevertheless, apply to the administration and duration of the fiducie or trust thus created. On the contrary, the words et ce ind\u00e9finiment, ou autant que permis par la loi seem to me to make it clear that he intended that the duration of the fid\u00e9i-commis, as he styles it, which he created should be subject only to such legal restrictions (if any) as such a disposition of property could not escape.\nWe have, therefore, to deal with a disposition in the nature of a trust of property intended by the testator to be perpetual if the law will permit, and, if not, to endure as long as the law will allow, with a provision for a succession of trustees for the expressed purpose of ensuring the enjoyment of the revenues of his succession by the testator\u2019s descendants to the most remote degree possible and with the manifest intention that, if and when the law requires that such a trust shall come to an end, the testator\u2019s descendants shall receive the corpus of his property in the shares which he has indicated. That the ultimate beneficial ownership of the property is in that case devised to persons not in esse, does not invalidate the disposition, because, by virtue of art. 838 C.C., the capacity to receive is, in the case of suspended legacies, to be considered relatively to the time when the right comes into effect. That the fiduciary legatees can never become entitled to any part of the testator\u2019s property except the compensation which he has fixed for their services is unquestionable (art. 964 C.C.). The purpose of the testator was that, as long as the law would permit, his fiduciary legatees should hold the corpus of his estate and should pay the revenues to his children and their descendants. Only when the legal limit had been reached did he wish the corpus to pass from his trustees, and then, clearly, not as on an intestacy, but under his will to those whom he intends to benefit as his legatees \u2014 the most remote of his descendants for whom the law will allow him to require that his property shall be held, if it may not, under the law, be held by his trustees indefinitely for the purpose of providing a perpetual revenue for his descendants.\nSuch being the testator\u2019s intention, and that intention being supreme within legal limits, it becomes necessary to inquire what restriction, if any, the law imposes upon the duration of such a trust.\nThe policy of the law upon which the rule in regard to substitutions enunciated in art. 932 C.C. is based, would seem to require that a similar restriction should be placed upon such a fiducie or trust as that with which we are now dealing. By the application of such a rule the beneficiary who, if the duration of the trust were unlimited, would actually come into the enjoyment of a portion of the revenue after two other beneficiaries had successively received revenue derived from the same fund or property, would become the absolute owner of that part of such fund or property from which the portion of revenue, which he would otherwise enjoy, would be derived. Although to apply such a rule to fiducies or trusts without express statutory authority may savour of judicial legislation, it seems necessary to do so unless we are prepared to hold that the purpose of the limitation advisedly placed upon the duration of substitutions may be frustrated by the very obvious device of creating a fiducie or trust of property which is either perpetual or postpones beneficial ownership of the corpus for a period longer than is permitted under the law of substitutions.\nApplying the rule which I have indicated, the plaintiff, L\u00e9opold Masson, on the death of his father, Joseph Edouard Masson, who survived his father Isidore Candide Masson, a son of the testator, became entitled, as absolute owner of an interest in it, to a partition of the share allocated to the family of his grandfather. The defendant, Dame Marguerite Masson, on the other hand, as a daughter of the Honourable L. F. R. Masson, also a son of the testator, is only the second person to enjoy the revenue from the property, forming the part of the share allocated to her father\u2019s family, of which she receives the income. She is not entitled to that property as absolute owner.\nThe shares allocated to the respective families of Isidore Candide Masson and of Honourable L. F. R. Masson have each been augmented by one-seventh of the property which would have gone to the family of Louis had he left descendants. The property by which the original shares of the other branches of the family were augmented on the death of Louis without issue was simply absorbed in such shares. Had the grandfather and the father of Leopold Masson survived Louis, their respective incomes would have been accordingly increased. Assuming that L\u00e9opold Masson has already obtained, in full beneficial ownership, his interest in the property which originally constituted the share of his grandfather, Isidore Candide Masson, he is, in my opinion, entitled to the partition of the property in question in this action because his right to the interest which he claims in it is precisely the same as that by which he enjoys the ownership of a portion of the share originally allotted to the family of his grandfather. The accidental circumstance that this right accrued in respect of the property now in question after he had become entitled to his interest in the share of his grandfather\u2019s family as originally constituted, and without the revenue of such property having been received by his grandfather and his father, does not in my opinion affect it. It is as an integral part of the share of his branch of the family, which must be regarded as a single lot, that he is entitled to share in the property by which that lot has been augmented. On the other hand the claim of Dame Marguerite Masson must fail because she is not entitled to the absolute ownership of the portion of the share allocated to her father\u2019s family of the revenue of which she has been in receipt since his death. The ownership of the property by which that share or lot has been augmented will belong to those who may become entitled to the ownership of the lot or share itself.\nI do not express any opinion upon the various rights, under the partition to which the plaintiff is held entitled, of the several parties as set forth in the declaration in this action. Those rights should be worked out in the provincial courts following the lines indicated in the judgment of this court, so far as it may be found proper at present to determine them.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the conclusions of the learned trial judge should be restored. In view of the very serious difficulties created by the peculiar and unusual dispositions of his property made by the testator the costs of all parties should come out of the estate.\nBrodeur, J. (dissident).\u2014La premi\u00e8re question qui se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause est de savoir si par son testament fait en 1847, peu de temps avant sa mort, l\u2019honorable Joseph Masson a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une substitution. La clause principale du testament est la clause 4, qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\nEt quant aux biens meubles et immeubles, propres, acqu\u00eats et conqu\u00eats, argent monnay\u00e9 et non monnay\u00e9, dettes actives, droits et actions mobiliers et immobiliers et tout ce que je d\u00e9laisserai lors de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, quelles qu\u2019en soient la nature, consistance, qualit\u00e9, valeur et situation, sans aucune exception ni r\u00e9serve, je veux et entends qu\u2019il en soit fait autant de parts \u00e9gales que j\u2019aurai d\u2019enfants au temps de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, n\u00e9s de mon mariage avec ma dite \u00e9pouse, pour chacune de ces parts ou portions de mes biens, repr\u00e9senter les biens mobiliers et immobiliers, dont chacun de mes dits enfants auront seulement la moiti\u00e9 des revenus, sa vie durante, ainsi que ci-apr\u00e8s pourvu, et pour les revenus de chacune de ces parts ou portions de mes biens \u00eatre r\u00e9versibles, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de chacun de mes dits enfants, aux enfants n\u00e9s en l\u00e9tigimes mariages d\u2019eux, mes dits entants, respectivement et \u00eatre substitu\u00e9s de descendants en descendants, et ce ind\u00e9finiment, ou autant que permis par la loi, en observant que je veux et entends que lors de chaque succession ou transmission de mes biens, il en soit fait partage, autant que possible, entre chacun de mes descendants, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir conna\u00eetre et distinguer la part ou portion des biens dont chacun d\u2019eux aura les revenus, sa vie durant, le tout sous les clauses et conditions ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9es.\nPar la clause 5, il nomme certaines personnes ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et fid\u00e9i-commissaires \u201cpour faciliter,\u201d dit-il,\nl\u2019ex\u00e9cution de mes dispositions testamentaires et pour d\u2019autant mieux garantir la r\u00e9version des revenus de mes biens \u00e0 mes dits enfants et descendants suivant mes d\u00e9sirs ci-apr\u00e8s exprim\u00e9s,\net il pourvoit \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient remplac\u00e9s \u201ctant et aussi long temps,\u201d dit-il, \u201cque la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par mon pr\u00e9sent testament subsistera,\u201d et il ajoute:\u2014\nAuxquels dits fid\u00e9i-commissaires, rempla\u00e7ants ou successeurs je donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 titre de fid\u00e9i-commis tous mes dits biens meubles et immeubles, propres, acqu\u00eats et conqu\u00eats, argent monnay\u00e9 et non monnay\u00e9, dettes actives, droits et actions mobiliers et immobiliers et tout ce que je d\u00e9laisserai lors de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, sans aucune r\u00e9serve ni exception, pour le tout \u00eatre g\u00e9r\u00e9 et administr\u00e9, les revenus, rentes, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats de mes dits biens mobiliers et immobiliers retir\u00e9s et per\u00e7us, mes dettes actives r\u00e9alis\u00e9es et mes biens meubles et effets convertis en deniers par mes dits fid\u00e9i-commissaires, rempla\u00e7ants, ou successeurs, et pour les deniers qui seront r\u00e9alis\u00e9s de ma succession, apr\u00e8s les affaires d\u2019icelle liquid\u00e9es et mes dettes pay\u00e9es, \u00eatre employ\u00e9s avec les revenus de mes autres biens mobiliers et immobiliers en achats de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s fonci\u00e8res, en parts ou actions de banques, en fonds provinciaux ou publics, \u201cd\u00e9bentures,\u201d ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re qui pourra \u00eatre jug\u00e9e avantageuse ou profitable, et pour les revenus, rentes, loyers et int\u00e9r\u00eats de toute ces biens ou emplois mobiliers et immobiliers \u00eatre de temps \u00e0 autre et autant que possible au fur et \u00e0 la m\u00e9sure qu\u2019ils seront retir\u00e9s et per\u00e7us convertis et employ\u00e9s de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re pendant et aussi longtemps qu\u2019il sera n\u00e9cessaire pour la plus grand avantage de mes dits enfants et descendants, et selon mes. dispositions ci-dessus et celles ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9es.\nIl proc\u00e8de ensuite \u00e0 exprimer dans six autres paragraphes ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s. Au paragraphe deuxi\u00e8me il d\u00e9clare que les revenus des enfants seront incessibles et insaisissables et qu\u2019ils ne pourront \u00eatre vendus\ntant et aussi longtemps que la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par mon pr\u00e9sent testament subsistera.\nAu paragraphe troisi\u00e8me, il dit l\u00e0 encore\ntant que la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par icelui (mon pr\u00e9sent testament) subsistera.\nL\u2019avant dernier paragraphe de son testament se lit comme suit:\nJe veux et entends que dans le cas o\u00f9 il serait n\u00e9cessaire, pour mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution mes pr\u00e9sentes dispositions, de faire nommer en justice un tuteur ou des tuteurs \u00e0 la substitution et aux substitutions cr\u00e9\u00e9es par mon pr\u00e9sent testament, les personnes par moi nomm\u00e9es cidessus pour mes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et fid\u00e9i-commissaires, leurs rempla\u00e7ants ou successeurs, soient, en autant que faire se peut, nomm\u00e9s ainsi tuteurs \u00e0 la dite substitution ou aux dites substitutions et en nombre \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui que j\u2019ai ci-dessus fix\u00e9 pour mes dits ex\u00e9cuteurs et fid\u00e9i-commissaires.\nLes uns pr\u00e9tendent que le testateur a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une fiducie avec obligation de payer la moiti\u00e9 des revenus aux enfants et la totalit\u00e9 des revenus aux petits-enfant et de remettre le capital \u00e0 ceux qui viondront en troisi\u00e8me lieu. D\u2019autres disent, au contraire, que le testament cr\u00e9e une substitution tout en donnant en m\u00eame temps aux ex\u00e9cuteurs ou fidei-commissaires l\u2019administration des biens et d\u2019autres pouvoirs tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus.\nDans les testaments nous devons toujours rechercher l\u2019intention du testateur; et, m\u00eame si parfois les textes semblaient \u00e9noncer un certain ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, nous devons cependant examiner l\u2019ensemble du document pour rechercher d\u2019une mani\u00e8re exacte ce que le testateur a eu le d\u00e9sir et la volont\u00e9 de faire avec ses biens.\nIl me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que dans le cas actuel M. Masson, tout en cr\u00e9ant une substitution, n\u2019a pas voulu confier aux grev\u00e9s, ses enfants et ses petits-enfants, l\u2019administration et la jouissance compl\u00e8te de ses biens; mais son d\u00e9sir est assez formellement exprim\u00e9 dans les extraits que je viens de faire de son testament pour d\u00e9montrer que sa volont\u00e9 \u00e9tait qu\u2019il y aurait substitution de ses biens. Il n\u2019a jamais voulu consid\u00e9rer ses executeurs testamentaires comme b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires; mais il a voulu que ses descendants jouissent de sa fortune.\nSachant que la loi permet de nommer des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires avec des pouvoirs de vendre, de disposer et d\u2019ali\u00e9ner, il a voulu se choisir des administrateurs qui conserveraient aussi loin que possible parmi les membres de sa famille les biens qu\u2019il avait amass\u00e9s.\nLa substitution n\u2019est pas subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 la fiducie. Ce n\u2019est pas celle-ci qui doit dominer. C\u2019est au contraire la substitution qui pr\u00e9vaut et les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires ne sont l\u00e0 que pour sauvegarder les int\u00e9r\u00eats des grev\u00e9s qui sont les seuls vrais int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nLa question de savoir si ce testament cr\u00e9ait une substitution a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge Loranger dans la cause de Taschereau v. Masson[35], et par l\u2019honorable juge Pagnuelo dans la cause de Perrault v. Masson, en 1898[36].\nDans ces deux causes, ainsi que dans la cause actuelle, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires \u00e9taient partie au proc\u00e8s et ont reconnu qu\u2019il y avait substitution. D\u00e9cider le contraire serait bouleverser toute l\u2019administration de cette succession et amener des complications des plus s\u00e9rieuses. Il vaut mieux respecter l\u2019intention \u00e9vidente du testateur et maintenir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que les ex\u00e9cuteurs, dans les soixante derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, ont faite de ce testament. Il est bon de remarquer que parmi ces administrateurs se trouvaient des amis intimes du d\u00e9funt et quelques-uns de ses enfants, qui devaient conna\u00eetre les id\u00e9es du de cujus.\nDans une cause jug\u00e9e par l\u2019honorable juge Jett\u00e9, en 1889, qui n\u2019est pas rapport\u00e9e, une action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par l\u2019un des neveux de Louis Masson pour faire d\u00e9clarer que la part de ce dernier appartenait \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gitimes, vu que la substitution s\u2019\u00e9tait ouverte par sa mort sans enfants.\nLe savant magistrat a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le testament constituait une fiducie limit\u00e9e par le testateur aux degr\u00e9s permis dans le substitution et que les biens confi\u00e9s par le testateur \u00e0 ses l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires ne pourraient \u00eatre remis qu\u2019aux arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants. Il ajoutait cependant le consid\u00e9rant suivant qui d\u00e9montre l\u2019incertitude dans laquelle il se trouvait:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant en outre que m\u00eame en appr\u00e9ciant le testament du dit Joseph Masson comme ne cr\u00e9ant qu\u2019une simple substitution, il en r\u00e9sulte encore que l\u2019intention du testateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 de faire parvenir \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement les biens composant sa succession \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s et ceux \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir avec la moiti\u00e9 des revenus accumul\u00e9s \u00e0 ses arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants et de ne laisser \u00e0 ses enfants et petits-enfants qu\u2019une moiti\u00e9 des revenus.\nIl est bien \u00e9vident par cette citation que le jugement ne va pas aussi loin qu\u2019on le dit. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, d\u2019ailleurs, dans cette cause, de d\u00e9cider ce point. Il suffisait de d\u00e9montrer que la part de Louis Masson, qu\u2019il y a\u00eet substitution ou non, doit, suivant les dispositions du testament, passer aux enfants du testateur et non pas aux h\u00e9ritiers de Louis Masson.\nOn peut donc conclure qu\u2019il y a eu unanimit\u00e9 presque compl\u00eate chez les magistrats, chez les administrateurs, et chez les h\u00e9ritiers pour reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il y a substitution.\nJe croirais que ce serait une profonde erreur de modifier l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et qui constitue, sinon chose jug\u00e9e, du moins un contrat judiciaire que nous devrions reconna\u00eetre.\nPothier, dans son \u201cTrait\u00e9 des Substitutions,\u201d No. 45, dit:\u2014\nComme c\u2019est la volont\u00e9 qui forme la substitution fid\u00e9i-commissaire, quoiqu\u2019elle ne soit pas exprim\u00e9e, il suffit qu\u2019on puisse tirer des cons\u00e9quences de ce qui est contenu au testament, que le testateur a eu effectivement volont\u00e9 de la faire, pour que la substitution soit aussi valable que si elle \u00e9tait exprim\u00e9e.\nLa substitution de la part de Louis Masson, est-elle devenue ouverte par son d\u00e9c\u00e8s?\nJ\u2019aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 enclin \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u201coui\u201d \u00e0 cette question.\nSa part aurait pass\u00e9 \u00e0 ses heritiers l\u00e9gaux et serait devenue leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit. Lors de l\u2019argument, j\u2019ai sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 cette hypoth\u00e8se aux parties. Mais ni les appelants ni les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont voulu prendre cette position. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait eu apparemment int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 soutenir cette pr\u00e9tention. Mais elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 s\u2019en tenir aux termes de son plaidoyes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, que les revenus de la part de Louis Masson sont r\u00e9versibles aux descendants du testateur.\nLes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la substitution ont int\u00e9r\u00eat, eux \u00e0 ce que la plus grande somme de biens leur \u00e9choit, maintenant si les h\u00e9ritiers, comme Mde. Burroughs, qui auraient pu jouir de la part de Louis Masson comme h\u00e9ritiers, ne d\u00e9sirent pas prendre cette qualit\u00e9 mais pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent, au contraire, consid\u00e9rer cette part comme substitu\u00e9e et n\u2019\u00eatre eux-m\u00eames que des grev\u00e9s ou des appel\u00e9s de cette part, cela constitue de la part des interess\u00e9s une admission qui a toute la force d\u2019un contrat judiciaire et que les tibunaux doivent accepter.\nLa part de Louis Masson reste donc soumise aux dispositions du testament et nous devons la traiter comme \u00e9tant substitu\u00e9e.\nQui devait recueillir la part de Louis \u00e0 sa mort du moment que le substitution n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ouverte? Ce sont les descendants du testateur. Le testateur d\u00e9clare en effet que son d\u00e9sir est de voir ses biens rester dans sa famille, et il ajoute que lors de chaque succession ou transmission de ses biens il veut qu\u2019il en soit fait partage autant que possible entre chacun de ses descendants.\nQue signifie l\u00e0 le mot descendants? Veut-il dire tous les enfants, petits-enfants, arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants du testateur? Non. Pothier, dans son \u201cTrait\u00e9 des Substitutions,\u201d No. 77 (ed. Bugnet, vol. 8, p. 480), discute l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e au mot \u201cfamille\u201d quand il se rencontre ainsi dans un testament et il termine en disant: Lors de l\u2019ouverture de la substitution \u00e0 laquelle une famille est appel\u00e9e, ce ne sont pas indistinctement tous ceux de la famille qui doivent la recueillir. Si l\u2019auteur de la substitution a prescrit lui-m\u00eame l\u2019ordre dans lequel elle serait recueillie, et nomm\u00e9 ceux qu\u2019il entendait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autres, on doit suivre ce qu\u2019il a ordonn\u00e9, sinon ce sont ceux de la famille qui sont en plus proche degr\u00e9, qui doivent la recueillir.\nAyant dispos\u00e9 du point qui avait soulev\u00e9 dans mon esprit, au moins, un doute tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux, sinon une conviction, j\u2019ai maintenant \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si \u00e0 la mort de Louis Masson sa part est accrue \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et neveux; ou bien si la transmission a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un degr\u00e9 dans la jouissance de sa part. S\u2019il y a eu accroissement, alors les fr\u00e8res et neveux de Louis Masson jouissent de sa part comme grev\u00e9s au premier degr\u00e9. Si, au contraire, il y a eu transmission de Louis \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et neveux, alors ces derniers jouiront des biens comme grev\u00e9s au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9 et leurs h\u00e9ritiers seront alors les appel\u00e9s d\u00e9finitifs de cette part; l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Madame Marguerite Masson, qui est l\u2019une des enfants de l\u2019honorable Rodrigue Masson, aura alors, avec ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, la jouissance absolue de la partie des biens de Louis Masson qui est \u00e9chue \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re.\nDroit d\u2019Accroissement.\nL\u2019accroissement est le privil\u00e8ge qu\u2019une personne poss\u00e8de de jouir de toute la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans le cas o\u00f9 son col\u00e9gataire ne recueille.\nAinsi A. donne une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 B. et C.; C. d\u00e9c\u00e8de ou bien refuse de se porter acqu\u00e9reur; alors B. a le droit de prendre toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMais si C. accepte le legs, entre en possession ou jouisse de la moiti\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et qu\u2019il meure ensuite sans disposer de ses droits, alors ses repr\u00e9sentants recueilleront la moiti\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; et si ce repr\u00e9sentant \u00e9tait son co-l\u00e9gataire alors ce dernier deviendra l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 non pas comme l\u00e9gataire de A. mais comme l\u00e9gataire de A. pour la moiti\u00e9 et comme h\u00e9ritier de C. pour l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9. Si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9e alors B. serait grev\u00e9 au premier degr\u00e9 de la moiti\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, de celle qu\u2019il aurait eu directement du testateur et grev\u00e9 au second degr\u00e9 de la moiti\u00e9 qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise par C.\nC\u2019est, je crois, la position qui se pr\u00e9sente dans le cas du testament de M. Joseph Masson quant \u00e0 la part de Louis Masson. Si ce dernier \u00e9tait mort avant son p\u00e8re, \u00e9videmment ses sept fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs auraient pris la partie que M. Masson, p\u00e8re, lui destinait. Il y aurait eu accroissement. Il en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00eame si Louis Masson avait refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter le legs.\nMais il a accept\u00e9 le legs; alors il n\u2019y a pas, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions de la loi, accroissement. Mais, dit-on, le testateur avait le droit de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il y aurait accroissement en faveur de ses descendants si l\u2019un de ses enfants venait \u00e0 mourir.\nIncontestablement il avait le droit de d\u00e9clarer, dans son testament, qu\u2019advenant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019un de ses enfants, sa part retournerait \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs. Mais alors cette transmission constitue un degr\u00e9 dans la jouissance des biens substitu\u00e9s.\nLe testateur dans une substitution n\u2019a pas le droit de substituer plus loin que deux degr\u00e9s. La loi ne veut pas permettre que des biens soient infiniment soumis \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 d\u2019un testateur. Pas de substitution perp\u00e9tuelle. Elles existaient autrefois; mais depuis l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, en 1560, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e plus tard par l\u2019ordonnance de Moulins, en 1566, elles sont abolies et on n\u2019a permis au testateur d\u2019exercer une ma\u00eetrise sur ses biens que pour deux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations; ou, ce qui est plus exact, pour deux degr\u00e9s de transmission. Le premier qui re\u00e7oit les biens peut avoir re\u00e7u ordre du testateur de transmettre ses biens \u00e0 un autre et ce dernier peut avoir re\u00e7u aussi les m\u00eames instructions; mais quant au troisi\u00e8me qui recueillera les biens il est libre d\u2019en disposer comme il l\u2019entendra, que le testateur l\u2019ait voulu ou non. Cette disposition est d\u2019ordre public et le testateur ne saurait y contrevenir. Toute disposition contraire dans un testament serait nulle.\nAsini un testateur pourrait bien pourvoir \u00e0 ce que ses co-h\u00e9ritiers h\u00e9ritent les uns des autres; mais en \u00e9tablissant cet ordre successif il n\u2019aurait pas le droit d\u2019emp\u00eacher le troisi\u00e8me qui recueillera les biens d\u2019en devenir le propri\u00e9taire absolu. M. Masson, en cr\u00e9ant une substitution, pouvait cr\u00e9er Louis Masson premier grev\u00e9 et lui ordonner de transmettre sa part \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs; mais ces derniers, en recueillant cette part, n\u2019en jouiront pas comme premiers grev\u00e9s mais comme grev\u00e9s au second degr\u00e9 et leurs enfants alors en deviendront les propri\u00e9taires absolus.\nPothier, au \u201cTrait\u00e9 des Substitutions,\u201d vol. 8, page 470, (ed., Bugnet,) No. 50, nous donne un exemple qui, tir\u00e9 de la jurisprudence romaine, a beaucoup d\u2019analogie avec le cas qui nous occupe. Voici ce qu\u2019il dit:\u2014\nUn h\u00e9ritage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 deux l\u00e9gataires, et le survivant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de le restituer \u00e0 un tiers * * * Paul d\u00e9cide qu\u2019on doit supposer un premier degr\u00e9 de substitution tacite par lequel le pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 a\u00eet \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de restituer, lorsqu\u2019il mourrait, sa part dans la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e au survivant. Cela est conforme \u00e0 nos principes; le survivant \u00e9tant seul charg\u00e9 de restituer au tiers non-seulement la portion qu\u2019il avait dans l\u2019h\u00e9ritage, mais l\u2019h\u00e9ritage entier, il est n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il a\u00eet re\u00e7u du testateur l\u2019h\u00e9ritage entier, car autrement il ne pourrait \u00eatre charg\u00e9 de le restituer; cum nemo fid\u00e9commisso onerari possit, in plus quam accepit; or, il ne peut avoir re\u00e7u du testateur l\u2019h\u00e9ritage entier qu\u2019en supposant un premier degr\u00e9 de substitution, par lequel son col\u00e9gataire pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de lui restituer sa portion; il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de supposer ce premier degr\u00e9 de substitution quoiqu\u2019il n\u2019a\u00eet pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9.\nAppliquant les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans cet exemple \u00e0 notre cas, nous voyons d\u2019abord des col\u00e9gataires. Ils constituent le premier degr\u00e9 de la substitution pour leur part respective. L\u2019un d\u2019eux meurt. Sa part qui passe entre les mains des survivants qui en deviennent les grev\u00e9s au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9.\nL\u2019honorable Rodrigue Masson, par la mort du testateur, est devenu grev\u00e9 au premier degr\u00e9 de la part qu\u2019il a eue de son p\u00e8re. Mais pour la part qui autrefois \u00e9tait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re il en est devenu le grev\u00e9 au second degr\u00e9. Alors ses enfants, parmi lesquels se trouve l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Dame Marguerite Masson, deviennent les propri\u00e9taires d\u00e9finitifs de la part de Louis.\nJe suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le testament de M. Masson cr\u00e9e une substitution et, qu\u2019en supposant m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas de substitution directe, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 une fiducie limit\u00e9e par le testateur aux degr\u00e9s permis dans les substitutions. Dans les deux cas, les deux degr\u00e9s, pour la part de Louis, sont \u00e9teints et Madame Marguerite Masson, et ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs qui viennent en troisi\u00e8me lieu, ont droit de jouir de cette part en toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Pour la part qui vient directement de leur p\u00e8re et de leur grand-p\u00e8re ils sont cependant grev\u00e9s au deuxi\u00e8me degr\u00e9.\nJe suis donc d\u2019opinion de renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant, L\u00e9opold Masson:\nAugers, deLorimier & Godin.\nSolicitors for the appellants, Henri Masson et al:\nBastien, Bergeron, Gousineau & Jasmin.\nSolicitor for the respondents: P.

Bochester and others complained to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada that the railway company was about to construct a solid embankment, at Cameron Bay, B.C., across the entrance to Market Cove upon the shores of which they held leases of water-lots from the Government of British Columbia. The complainants asked that, on approval of the location plans, their rights should be protected. At the time of this complaint, 25th November, 1909, no route-map for this portion of the railway had been approved by the Minister, and the approval of the location plans and authority for the construction of the works had been withheld by the Board pending inquiries. Without obtaining such approval and authorization, the railway company actively proceeded with the construction of the railway along the route in question in the professed exercise of its powers as a railway company and, in doing so, blocked the entrance of the cove so that navigation of its waters was obstructed by a stone embankment which the railway company placed across its entrance. After hearing the parties interested the Board found, in effect, that the complainants had leases of lands abutting on the waters of the cove for the purpose of securing access thereto by water for their warehouses, etc., and that they were the owners of the riparian rights appurtenant to the possession of these lands; that the railway company had cut off all access by water from the harbour to all points around the cove; that at the time of the construction of the embankment the company had no title to the land across the entrance of the cove; that the company had no right to make the construction without approval of the route-map and of the location plans and works; that the lands and business of the complainants had been injuriously affected by the wrongful and illegal act of the railway company; and that there was no necessity for a stone embankment across the entrance to the cove and no reason why an opening should not be left there sufficient to enable vessels to pass in and out during high tide.\nUpon these findings it was, on the 2nd of January, 1912, ordered by the Board that the railway company, on or before the 1st of May, 1912, should remove sufficient of the rock-fill to leave an opening at the deepest point of the entrance at least thirty feet in width, and that, before the 15th of February, 1912, the company should file with the Board and furnish the complainants with plans shewing the location of the opening, etc.\nThe opinion judgments of Chief Commissioner Mabee and Commissioner McLean, delivered upon the making of the order in question, appear at pages 294 to 299 of the Seventh Report (1912) of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada (Sessional Paper No. 20c), presented to Parliament in 1913.\nOn the hearing before Mr. Justice Duff, in Chambers, 1st March, 1912,\nD\u2019Arcy Tate K.C. appeared in support of the application.\nN. G. Guthrie contra.\nThe application was refused for the following reasons by\nDuff J.\u2014On the 4th of March, last, I dismissed an application made to me on the first day of the same month for leave to appeal from an order made by the Board of Railway Commissioners, on the 2nd of January, 1912, directing the railway company to remove part of their rock-fill at Cameron Bay, B.C. I gave no reasons in writing for my decision, at the time, but it is now stated that an appeal from the order of the Railway Commission is pending before His Royal Highness the Governor in Council, and that it may be necessary to refer to the grounds upon which the company\u2019s application for leave to appeal was dismissed, and I have been requested, through the registrar, to state the grounds upon which I acted. I think it is reasonable, in the circumstances, to comply with the request.\nAn appeal lies to the Supreme Court from the Board of Railway Commissioners in two cases only, which are provided for by sub-sections 2 and 3 of section 56 of the \u201cRailway Act.\u201d The application in question was made under sub-section 2, and the point to be determined was whether there was any arguable question of jurisdiction which the railway company ought to be permitted to bring before the Supreme Court.\nCameron Bay is a tidal water in which the public have rights of navigation. The Board of Railway Commissioners, in effect, found that the fill in question had been constructed by the railway company in professed exercise of their powers as a railway company, and that the requirements of section 233 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d had not been complied with. These facts being found by the Board, the question of jurisdiction of the Board to make the order appeared to be obviously concluded by a reference to section 230 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d coupled with sub-sections (h) and (i) of section 30 of the same Act, and I dismissed the application accordingly.\nApplication refused with costs.\n"}
